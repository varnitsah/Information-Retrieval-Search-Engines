23949387	philosopher jack by rm ballantyne    chapter one  treats of our hero and others  if the entire circuit of a friends conversation were comprised in the words dont and doit might perhaps be taken for granted that his advice was not of much value nevertheless it is a fact that philosopher jacks most intimate and valuableif not valuedfriend never said anything to him beyond these two words  nor did he ever condescend to reason  he listened however with unwearied patience to reasoning but when jack had finished reasoning and had stated his proposed course of action he merely said to him dont or do  for what end was i created said the philosopher gloomily  wise and momentous question when seriously put but foolish remark if not worse when flung out in bitterness of soul  jack whose other name was edwin and his age nineteen was a student being of an argumentative turn of mind his college companions had dubbed him philosopher  tall strong active kindly hilarious earnest reckless and impulsive he was a strange compound with a handsome face a brown fluff on either cheek and a moustache like a ladys eyebrow  moreover he was a general favourite yet this favoured youth sitting at his table in his own room sternly repeated the questionin varied form and with increased bitternesswhy was i born at all  deep wrinkles of perplexity sat on his youthful brow  evidently he could not answer his own question though in early life his father had carefully taught him the shorter catechism with proofs while his good old mother had enforced and exemplified the same  his taciturn friend was equally unable or unwilling to give a reply  after prolonged meditation jack relieved his breast of a deep sigh and reread a letter which lay open on his desk  having read it a third time with knitted brows he rose went to the window and gazed pathetically on the cats parade as he styled his prospect of slates and chimney cans  so said he at last my dreams are over prospects gone hopes collapsedall vanished like the baseless fabric of a vision  he turned from the cats parade on which the shades of evening were descending to the less romantic contemplation of his empty firegrate  now said he reseating himself at his table and stretching his long legs under it the question is what am i to do shall i kick at fate throw care like physic to the dogs cut the whole concern and go to sea  dont said his taciturn friend speaking distinctly for the first time  or continued jack shall i meekly bow to circumstances and struggle with my difficulties as best i may  do replied his friend whose name by the way was conscience  for a long time the student sat gazing at the open letter in silence it was from his father and ran thus    dear teddieits a long time now that ive been thinkin to write   you and couldnt abear to give you such a heavy disappointment but   cant putt it off no longer and as your mother poor soul says   its the lords will and cant be helpedwhich of course it   shouldnt be helped if thats truebutwell howsomever its of no   use beatin about the bush no longer  the seasons have been bad for   some years past and its all ive been able to do to make the two   ends meet with your mother slavin like a nigger patchin up the   childns old rags till theyre like josephs coat after the wild   beast had done its worst on itthough we are given to understand   that the only wild beasts as had to do with that coat was josephs own   brothers  almost since ever i left the north of englanda small   boyand began to herd cattle on the border hills ive had a strange   wish to be a learned man and ever since i took to small farmin and   perceived that such was not to be my lot in life ive had a powerful   desire to see my eldest sonthats you dear boytrained in   scientific pursoots all the more that you seemed to have a natural   thirst that way yourself  your mother good soul in her own broad   tonguewhich ive picked up somethin of myself through livin twenty   year with herwas used to say she wad raither see her laddie trained   in ways o wisdom than o booklearnin which im agreed to myself   though it seems to me the two are more or less mixed up  howsomever   its all up now my boy youll have to fight your own battle and pay   your own way for ive not got one shillin to rub on another except   whatll pay the rent and what with the grey mare breakin her leg   an the turnips failin the lookout ahead is darkish at the best  the letter finished with some good advice and a blessing  to be left thus without resources just when the golden gates of knowledge were opening and a few dazzling gleams of the glory had pierced his soul was a crushing blow to the poor student  if he had been a true philosopher he would have sought counsel on his knees but his philosophy was limited he only took counsel with himself and the immediate results were disastrous  yes said he with an impulsive gush ill go to sea  dont said his quiet friend  but regardless of this advice edwin jack smote the table with his clenched fist so violently that his pen leapt out of its inkbottle and wrote its own signature on one of his books  he rose in haste and rang the bell  mrs niven he said to his landlady let me know how much i owe you im about to leave townandand wont return  ech  maister jack what for exclaimed the astonished landlady  because im a beggar replied the youth with a bitter smile and i mean to go to sea  hoots  maister jack yere jokin  indeed i am very far from joking mrs niven i have no money and no source of income  as i dont suppose you would give me board and lodging for nothing i mean to leave  toots yere haverin persisted mrs niven who was wont to treat her young men with motherly familiarity  tak time to think ot an yell be in anither mind the morns mornin  nae doot yere  now my good woman interrupted jack firmly but kindly dont bother me with objections or advice but do what i bid youtheres a good soul be off  mrs niven saw that she had no chance of impressing her lodger in his present mood she therefore retired while jack put on a rough pilotcloth coat and round straw hat in which he was wont at times to go boating  thus clad he went off to the docks of the city in which he dwelt the name of which city it is not important that the reader should know  in a humble abode near the said docks a bulky seacaptain lay stretched in his hammock growling  the prevailing odours of the neighbourhood were tar oil fish and marinestores  the seacaptains room partook largely of the same odours and was crowded with more than an average share of the stores  it was a particularly small room with charts telescopes speakingtrumpets loglines sextants portraits of ships souwesters oilcloth coats and leggings on the walls model ships suspended from the beams overhead seaboots coils of rope kegs and handspikes on the floor and great shells earthenware ornaments pagodas and chinese idols on the mantelpiece  in one corner stood a childs crib  the hammock swung across the room like a heavy cloud about to descend and overwhelm the whole  this simile was further borne out by the dense volumes of tobacco smoke in which the captain enveloped himself and through which his red visage loomed over the edge of the hammock like a lurid setting sun  for a few minutes the clouds continued to multiply and thicken  no sound broke the calm that prevailed save a stertorous breathing with an occasional hitch in it  suddenly there was a convulsion in the clouds and one of the hitches developed into a tremendous cough  there was something almost aweinspiring in the cough  the captain was a huge and rugged man  his cough was a terrible compound of a choke a gasp a rend and a roar  only lungs of soleleather could have weathered it each paroxysm suggested the idea that the mans vitals were being torn asunder but not content with that the exasperated mariner made matters worse by keeping up a continual growl of indignant remonstrance in a thunderous undertone  hah that was a splitter  a few more hugsh ha like that will burst the biler entirety  pollyhallo  the lurid sun appeared to listen for a moment then opening its mouth it shouted pollyahoy as if it were hailing the maintop of a seventyfour  immediately there was a slight movement in one corner of the room and straightway from out a mass of marinestores there emerged a fairy  at least the little girl of twelve or thereabouts who suddenly appeared with rich brown tumbling hair pretty blue eyes faultless figure and ineffable sweetness in every lineament of her little face might easily have passed for a fairy or an angel  what caught you napping growled the captain in the midst of a paroxysm  only a minute father i couldnt help it replied polly with a little laugh as she ran to the fireplace and took up a saucepan that simmered there  here look alive shove along hand it up  im chokin  the child held the saucepan as high as she could towards the hammock the captain reaching down one of his great arms caught it and took a steaming draught  it seemed to relieve him greatly  youre a trump for gruel polly he growled returning the saucepan now then up with the pyramid and give us a norwester  the child returned the saucepan to the fireplace and then actively placed a chair nearly underneath the hammock  upon the chair she set a stool and on the top she perched herself  thus she was enabled to grasp the lurid sun by two enormous whiskers and putting her lips out gave it a charming norwester which was returned with hyperborean violence  immediately after polly ducked her head and thus escaped being blown away like a hindoo mutineer from a cannons mouth as the captain went off in another fit  oh father said polly quite solemnly as she descended and looked up from a comparatively safe distance isnt it awful  yes poll its about the wust un ive had since i came from barbadoes but the last panful has mollified it i think and your norwester has pollyfied it so turn into your bunk old girl an take a nap  youve much need of it poor thing  no father if i get into my crib ill sleep so heavy that you wont be able to wake me  ill just lie down where i was before  well wellamong the rubbish if ye prefer it no matter slong as you have a snooze growled the captain as he turned over while the fairy disappeared into the dark recess from which she had risen  just then a tap was heard at the door  come in roared the captain a tall broadshouldered nauticallooking man entered took off his hat and stood before the hammock whence the captain gave him a stern searching glance and opened fire on him with his pipe  forgive me if i intrude captain samson said the stranger i know you although you dont know me  you start tomorrow or next day i understand for melbourne  wind and weather permittin growled the captain  well what then  have you completed your crew asked the stranger  nearly  what then replied the captain with a touch of ferocity for he felt sensations of an approaching paroxysm  will you engage me asked philosopher jack for it was he  in what capacity demanded the captain somewhat sarcastically  as an ordinary seamanor a boy if you will replied edwin with a smile  no growled samson decisively i wont engage you men with kid gloves and white hands dont suit me  from the mere force of habit the young student had pulled on his gloves on leaving his lodging and had only removed that of the right hand on entering the captains dwelling  he now inserted a finger at the wrist of the lefthand glove ripped it off and flung it with its fellow under the grate  thereafter he gathered some ashes and soot from the fireplace with which he put his hands on a footing with those of a coalheaver  will you take me now captain he said returning to the hammock and spreading out his hands  the captain gave vent to a short laugh which brought on a tremendous fit at the conclusion of which he gasped yes my lad praps i will but first i must know something about you  certainly said the philosopher and at once gave the captain a brief outline of his circumstances  well you know your own affairs best said captain samson when he had finished im no judge of such a case but as youre willin to ship im willin to ship you  come here before ten tomorrow  good night there its acominhashk  in the midst of another furious paroxysm edwin jack retired  not long after the captain raised himself on one elbow listened intently for a few seconds and having satisfied himself that polly was asleep slipped from his hammockas only seamen know howand proceeded to dress with the utmost caution  he was evidently afraid of the little sleeper among the rubbish  it was quite interesting to observe the quiet speed with which he thrust his great limbs into his ample garments gazing anxiously all the time at pollys corner  issuing from his own door with the step of an elephantine mouse the captain went rapidly through several streets to the house of an intimate friend whom he found at supper with his wife and family  evenin bailie trench how are ee mrs t hows everybody said the captain in a hearty rasping voice as he shook hands right and left while one of his huge legs was taken possession of and embraced by the bailies only daughter a pretty little girl of six  why samson exclaimed the bailie after quiet had been restored and his friend had been thrust into a chair with little susan on his knee i thought you were laid up with influenzaeh  so i was bailie an so i am replied the captain leastwise im still on the sicklist and was in my hammock till about half an hour ago but im gettin round fast  the night air seems to do me a world o goodcontrariwise to doctors expectations  have some supper said mrs trench who was a weakish lady with watery eyes  no supper mrs t thank ee the fact is ive come on business  i should be on my beamends by rights  im absent without leave an have only a few minutes to spare  the passenger i spoke of has changed his mind and his berth is free so im glad to be able to take your son ben after all  but hell have to get ready quick for the lively poll sails the day after tomorrow or next dayall bein well  the eyes of young benjamin trench sparkled  he was a tall thin rather quiet lad of eighteen  i can be ready tonight if you wish it captain samson he said with a flush on his usually pale face  beside mrs trench there sat a sturdy little boy  he was the bosom friend of bena bright ruddy fellow of fourteen overflowing with animal spirits and with energy enough for three lads of his size  this youths countenance fell so visibly when ben spoke of going away that mrs trench could not help noticing it  why whats the matter wilkins she asked  oh nothing returned the boy only i dont like to hear ben speak of leaving us all and going to australia  and i would give all the world to go with him  wont you take me as a cabin boy captain samson  sorry i cant lad said the captain with a grin got a cabin boy already  besides your father would not let you said mrs trench and it would never do to go without his leave  only misfortune could come of that  humph its very hard pouted the boy  i wanted him to get me into the navy and he wouldnt and now i want him to get me into the merchant service and he wont  but ill go in spite of him  no you wont watty said ben laying his hand on his friends shoulder  yes ben i will returned little wilkins with such an air of determination that every one except ben laughed  now bailie said the captain rising im off  the truth is i wouldnt have come if it had not been important to let you know at once to get your boy ready but i had no one to send except polly and i wouldnt send her out at night by herself for all the wealth of indy moreover she wouldnt have let me out tonight for any consideration whatever  shes very strict with me is my little keeper  i wouldnt for the world she should wake and find me gone  so goodnight all  ten minutes more and the guilty man entered his dwelling on tiptoe  in order to get into his hammock with extreme caution he forsook his ancient method of a spring and mounted on an empty cask  the cask was not equal to the emergency  he went through the head of it with a hideous crash  spurning it from him he had just time to plunge into his place of repose and haul the clothes over him when polly emerged from her lair with wondering eyes  what ever was that father  nothin my dear nothin in partickleronly a cask i kicked over now then poll since youre keepin me awake in this fashion its your dooty to soothe me with an extra panful and another norwester so up wi the pyramid and after youve done it you must turn into your crib  ill not want you again tonight the coughs much better therethank ee  pollyfy me nowthats right  goodnight  oh base mariner little did you merit such a pleasant termination to your evenings work but you are not the only wicked man in this world who receives more than he deserves  two days after the incidents just related a noble ship spread her canvas to a favouring breeze and bowing farewell to her port of departure commenced the long long voyage to the antipodes  she was not a passenger ship but a trader nevertheless there were a few passengers on her quarterdeck and among these towered the colossal figure of captain samson  beside him holding his hand stood a fairylike little creature with brown curls and pretty blue eyes  not far from her leaning over the bulwarks benjamin trench frantically waved a handkerchief and wiped his eyes  the signal was responded to with equal feeling by the bailie his wife and little susan  a good number of people young and old assembled at the pierhead among whom many waved handkerchiefs and hands and scarfs and hats to the crew  among the sailors who gazed wistfully towards the pier was one who made no farewell signal and received no parting wave  philosopher jack had concealed his intention of going to sea from all his college chums and a bitter feeling of loneliness oppressed his heart as he thought of his old father and mother and the lowly cottage on the border hills  he had not indeed acted in direct opposition to the wishes of his parents but he had disobeyed the wellknown scripture command to do them honour for he had resolved on his course of action without consulting them or asking their advice  he felt that he had very selfishly forsaken them in their old age in the hour of their sore distress and at a time when they stood woefully in need of his strong muscles buoyant spirit and energetic brain  in short edwin jack began to feel that he required all his philosophy and something more to enable him to face the future with the unflinching courage of a man  so the ship moved slowly on revealing on her stern the lively poll in letters of burnished goldpast the pierhead down the broad river out upon the widening firth beyond lighthouse buoy and beacon until at last the fresh atlantic breezes filled her snowy sails  and ever as she rose and sank upon the rolling waves their swish and thud fell strangely on the ear of one who lay deep down in the recesses of the hull whereamong barrels of pork and casks of tar and cans of oil and coils of rope and other unsavoury storeshe consorted with rats and mice and an uneasy conscience in thick darkness  this was a stowaway  he was a sturdy bright ruddy little fellow of fourteen down in that unwholesome place with a few shipbiscuits and a bottle of water to keep him alive he would have looked like a doubledup overgrown hedgehog if there had been light enough to reveal him  thus with its little world of hopes and fears its cares and pleasures and its brave trembling trusting sorrowing joyful anxious reckless hearts the good ship passed from the shores of britain until her sails quivered like a petrels wings on the horizon and then vanished into the boundless bosom of the mighty sea    chapter two  tells of a ghost and an overwhelming disaster  it may seem strange nevertheless it is true that ignorance is a misfortune which now and then results in good  of course we do not make this remark in commendation of ignorance but if baldwin burr had not been ignorant and densely stupid philosopher jack would not have had the pleasure of instructing him and the seaman himself would not have enjoyed that close intimacy which frequently subsists between teacher and pupil  even polly samson derived benefit from baldwins want of knowledge for being remarkably intelligent for her years and having been well taught she took great pleasure in enlightening his darkness  how is it she asked one day while sitting on the cabin skylight and looking up in the mans rugged countenance how is it that you are so stupid  burr who was steering gave the wheel a turn looked up at the masthead then round the horizon then down at his questioner with a bland smile and said  well now miss polly dee know thats wot i cant exactly tell praps its cause of a natral want of brains or maybe cause the brains is too much imbedded in fatfor im a fleshy man as you see or praps its cause i never went to school my parients bein poor uncommon poor though remarkably honest  ive sometimes thought wen meditatin on the subject that my havin bin born of a friday may have had somethin to do with it  oh baldwin said polly with a little laugh surely you cant believe that  father says its all nonsense about friday being an unlucky day  praps it is an praps it aint returned the cautious seaman  i regard your father my dear as a deeply learned man and would give in if i could to wotever he says but facts is facts and opinions is opinions you cant change that nohow you fix it  wots the capns opinions now as to ghosts  he dont believe in em at all was pollys prompt answer  no more do i for father knows everything and hes always right  hes a lucky man to have you polly and theres a lucky boy knockin about the world somewheres lookin out for you  a good daughter its said inwariably makes a good wife which you dont understand just now but youll come to in course of time  howsever as i wos observin ive been of the same opinion as your father till two nights ago when i heard a ghost right under the deck it seemed to me blow my hammock where theres nothin but ships stores and rats  heard a ghost exclaimed polly with opening eyes  ay an seed im too said burr  night before yesterday i heerd im as plain as i hear myself  he wos groanin an its quite impossible that a tarbarrel or a cask or a rat could groan  the only thing that puzzled me wos that he seemed to snore more than that he sneezed once or twice  now i never heard it said that a ghost could sleep or catch cold  did you polly  polly laughed and said that she never did and asked eagerly what the ghost was like  it was wery much like an ornary man of small size said the seaman but it were too dark to make out its face  i know the figure of every soul in the ship by this time an i could swear before a maginstrate or a bench of bishops that the ghost is neither one of the crew nor a passenger  why didnt you speak to it asked polly  so i did speak to it but it wouldnt answer then i made a grab at it but it was as active as a kitten dodged round the mainmast flew fored on inwisible wings and went slap down the forescuttle head first with a crash that would have broke the neck of anything but a ghost  at this interesting point the conversation was interrupted by edwin jack whose turn it was to relieve the man at the wheel  he nodded to polly as he came up took his post and received the ships course from burr who thrust his hands into his pockets and left the quarterdeck  edwin was by this time a considerably changed man although but a few days at sea  the rough blue trousers guernsey and peajacket took as naturally to his strong limbs as if he had been born and bred a sailor and already some huge blisters a few scars and not a little tar had rendered his hands creditable  steering at the time was a mere matter of form as a dead calm prevailed  our philosopher therefore amused himself and polly with commentaries on the ghostsubject which burr had raised  late that night when the stars were shining in a cloudless sky and winking at their reflections in the glassy ocean the ghost appeared to edwin jack  it was on this wise  jack being one of the watch on deck went to the port bulwarks near the foremast shrouds leant over and gazing down into the reflected sky thought sadly of past present and future  tiring at last of his meditations he went towards a man who appeared to be skulking under the shadow of the longboat and remarked that it was a fine night but the man made no reply  a most enjoyable night shipmate he said going closer  im glad you think so said the ghost its anything but enjoyable to me  the state of the weather hasnt much effect either one way or another on a fellow who is halfdead with hunger halfchoked with a cold caught among the rats and stores and halfkilled by a tumble down the forescuttle or whatever may be the name of that vile ladder that leads to the regions below  surely exclaimed jack in surprise seizing the ghost by the shoulders and looking close into its face i have heard your voice before now and ehno i dont know you  yes philosopher jack you do know me returned the ghost ive had the honour of playing cricket with you on the green though youve forgotten me and no wonder for ive suffered much from bad air and seasickness of late  my name is walter more familiarly watty wilkins  little wilkins exclaimed jack in surprise well you are changed you dont mean to say that youve run away from home  thats just what ive done said the poor lad in a tone of despondency but youve no occasion to shake your head at me so solemnly for to all appearance you have run away too  no wilkins you are wrong i have walked away being my own master and i have done it openly though i admit somewhat hastily  jack was interrupted at that moment by ben trench laying a hand on his shoulder  it strikes me he said in some surprise that i recognise the voice of a townsmanmister jack if i mistake not  no sir replied the philosopher not mister only edwin jack seaman aboard the lively poll  you are right however in styling me townsman  allow me to introduce you to another townsman mr watty wilkins stowaway on board of the same vessel  trench had not in the darkness recognised his friend  he now seized him by both shoulders and peering into his face said  o watty watty have you really done it  i had thought better of you  i said i would do it and ive done it returned the little youth somewhat testily and now i want to know what is to be done next  report yourself and take the consequences said jack promptly  this advice being seconded by ben trench watty wilkins went aft to the captain who had just come on deck touched his cap and confessed himself  for some moments the captain spoke not a word but looked at the young culprit with a portentous frown  then uttering something like a deep bass growl he ordered the lad to follow him into his private cabin when there captain samson seated himself on a locker and with a hand on each knee glared at his prisoner so long and so fiercely from under his shaggy brows that watty in spite of his recklessness began to feel uneasy  so youngster youve run away he said at length in deep solemnity  yes sir replied wilkins  and you think yourself a fine clever fellow no doubt  no sir i dont said watty with much humility  i knew your father boy continued the captain assuming a softer and more serious tone and i think he is a good man  he is sir returned the boy promptly  ay and he is a kind man he has been kind to you i think  watty hung his head  he has fed you clothed you educated you since you was a babby nursed you maybe in sickness and prayed for you no doubt that god would make you a good obedient and loving son  the boys head drooped still lower  and for all this continued the captain you have repaid him by running away  now my lad as you have made your bed you shall lie on it  ill clap your nose to the grindstone and keep it there steward  a smart little man answered to the call  take this boy fored and teach him to clean up  dont spare him  in obedience to this order the steward took little wilkins forward and introduced him to the cook who introduced him to the coppers and scrubbing brushes  from that day forward master watty became deeply versed in the dirty work and hard work of the ship so that all the romance of a sea life was driven out of him and its stern realities were implanted  in less than three weeks there was not a cup saucer or plate in the ship that watty had not washed not a brass that he had not polished and repolished not a copper that he had not scraped not an inch of the deck that he had not swabbed  but it must not be supposed that he groaned under this labour  although reckless hasty and inconsiderate he was not meanspirited  making up his mind to do his best in the circumstances he went cheerfully to his dirty work and did it well  you see said he to philosopher jack as they chanced one dark night to have a few minutes talk together near the weather gangway where watty paused on his way to the caboose with a souptureen as the captain says ive made the bed myself so i must lie on it and im resolved to lie straight and not kick  right watty right said jack with a sigh we have both been fools so must grin and bear it  watty greeted this remark to jacks surprise with a sudden and unexpected yell as he received a cut from a ropesend over the back  what idling eh cried the steward flourishing the ropesend again  in a burst of rage the poor boy raised the souptureen and would infallibly have shattered it on the mans head if jack had not caught his arm  come wilkins mind what youre about he said pushing him towards the forepart of the ship to prevent a scuffle  a moments reflection sufficed to convince wilkins of the folly as well as uselessness of rebellion  pocketing his pride and burning with indignation he walked forward while the tyrannical steward went grumbling to his own private den  it chanced that night that the captain ignorant of what had occurred sent for the unfortunate stowaway for the mitigation of whose sorrows his friend ben trench had more than once pleaded earnestly but in vain  the captain invariably replied that watty had acted ungratefully and rebelliously to a kind father and it was his duty to let him bear the full punishment of his conduct  watty was still smarting from the ropesend when he entered the cabin  youngster said the captain sternly i sent for you to tell you of a fact that came to my knowledge just before we left port  your father told me that being unwilling to disappoint you in your desires he had managed to get a situation of some sort for you on board a wellknown line of ocean steamers and he only waited to get the thing fairly settled before letting you know about it  there you may go fored and think what you have lost by running away  without a word of reply watty left the cabin  his days work had just been completed  he turned into his hammock and laying his head on his pillow quietly wept himself to sleep  aint you rather hard on the poor boy father said polly who had witnessed the interview  not so hard as you think little woman answered the captain stroking the childs head with his great hand that little rascal has committed a great sin  he has set out on the tracks of the prodigal son youve often read about an hes not sufficiently impressed with his guilt when i get him into a proper frame o mind ill not be so hard on him now polly go putt your doll to bed and dont criticise your father  polly seized the huge whiskers of her sire and giving him an unsolicited norwester which was duly returned went off to her little cot  we do not mean to trouble the reader with all the incidents of a prolonged voyage to southern latitudes during which philosopher jack formed a strong friendship with ben trench and watty wilkins continued his instruction of the amiable and unfathomable baldwin burr and became a general favourite with the crew of the lively poll  suffice it to say that all went well and the good ship sailed along under favouring breezes without mishap of any kind until she reached that great ocean whose unknown waters circle round the southern pole  here however good fortune forsook them and contrarygales baffling the lively poll drove her out of her course while tumbling billows buffeted her severely  one night a dead calm prevailed  the air became hot clouds rose rapidly over the sky and the barometerthat faithful friend of the marinerfell unusually low  how dreadfully dark it is getting said polly in a low halffrightened tone to baldwin burr who was at the wheel  were going to have a night of it my dear replied the seaman  if he had said that the winds and waves were going to have a night of it baldwin burr would have been more strictly correct  he had scarcely uttered the words when the captain gave orders to closereef the topsails  our philosopher springing aloft with his comrades was out on the topsail yard in a few seconds  scarcely had the sails been reefed when the gale burst upon the ship and almost laid her flat upon the foaming sea  at first the very violence of the wind kept the waves down but they gradually rose until the ship was tossed on their crests and engulfed in their hollows like a cork  as the force of the gale increased sail was further reduced until nothing but a mere rag was left and even this at last was split and blown to ribbons  inky clouds soon obscured the sky and as night descended on the wild scene the darkness became so intense that nothing could be seen except the pale gleam of foaming billows as they flashed past over the bulwarks  in the midst of the turmoil there came a blinding flash of lightning followed instantly by a terrible crash of thunder  this was succeeded by a sound of rending which was not the result of elemental strife  foremast gone sir cried one of the men staggering aft  seizing an axe the captain sprang forward  edwin jack followed  they found the shipscarpenter already at work cutting the shrouds and other ropes that held the wreck of the mast  as flashes of lightning followed in quick succession they revealed a scene of ruin on the forepart of the vessel with the tall figure of edwin as he stood on the bulwarks wielding an axe  at last the wreck was cleared but the seas were now bursting over the decks and sweeping away everything not made fast among other things the longboat was carried away and ere long all the other boats were torn from their fastenings or destroyed  it was a fearful night  even the most reckless among the sailors were overawed by such a display of the terrors of god  at such times scoffers are wont to become tremblers and those who trust in god find him a very present help in trouble  the gale was as shortlived as it was fierce  by the dawn of the following day it had abated considerably and it was found that less damage had been done to the ship than might have been expected  were all right polly thank god said the captain earnestly when he ventured to open the companion hatch and go below  you prayed for us dear didnt you  yes father i did i prayed that our lives might be spared if he pleased  well polly our prayers have been answered said the captain our lives are spared and the ship is safe though weve lost the foremast and the boats  however that can be putt to rights well rig up a jurymast and get on famously so keep up your heart old girl and give us a nor  there youd better stay below yet awhile its dirty on deck  the weather was not long of improving  a profound calm followed the storm  bright sunshine banished the thunderclouds  the contrast between the dangers just past and the peaceful condition that prevailed had the effect of raising the spirits of all on board the lively poll to an unusual height so that snatches of song whistling and cheery remarks were heard on all sides among the busy crew as they rigged up a new mast bent on new sails and repaired the various damages  when night put a stop to their labours and every one sought repose except the watch and the captain and the man at the wheel the same peaceful calm continued  only the long undulating swell of ocean remained to tell of the recent storm while the glassy surface reflected a universe of stars  it was at this time of profound repose and fancied security that the deathknell of the lively poll was sounded  in the southern seas there is a little creature named the coral insect of which we shall have more to say hereafter which is ever at work building walls and ramparts on the bottom of the sea  these rise by degrees to the surfacerise above itand finally become some of the fairest isles of the pacific  charts tell of the isles but no charts can tell the locality of coral reefs which have just or barely reached the surface the lively poll was forging slowly ahead under a puff of air that only bulged her topsails as she rose and sank on the majestic swell presently she rose high and was then let down on a coral reef with such violence that the jurymast with the maintopmast and all the connected rigging went over the side  another swell lifted her off and flung her on the oceans breast a total wreck  the scene that followed may be imagined  whatever could be done by an able and active seaman in such an emergency was done by captain samson water was rushing in through the shattered hull  to pass a sail under the ships bottom and check this was the first act  then the pumps were rigged and worked by all on board  besides ben trench there were three gentlemen passengers  these took their turn with the rest but all was of no avail  the ship was sinking  the utmost efforts of those whose lives seemed dependent on her only delayed the final catastrophe  there is no hope said the captain in a low tone to his chief mate to whom he gave some rapid orders and went below  it was daybreak and the first gleam of light that leaped over the glassy sea tinged the golden curls of polly samson as she lay sleeping on one of the cabin sofas  she awoke and started up  lie still darling and rest as long as you may said the captain in a low tender voice and pray polly pray for us again  god is able to save to the uttermost my pet  he said this without pausing as he went to his berth and brought out a sextant with which he returned on deck  standing near the foot of the companionladder watty wilkins had heard the words there is no hope and the few sentences addressed to the child  his impressionable spirit leapt to the conclusion that the fate of all on board was sealed  he knew that the boats had all been swept away and a feeling of profound despair seized him  this was quickly followed by contrition for his past conduct and pity for his father under the impulse of which he sat down in a corner of the stewards pantry and groaned aloud  then he wrote a few lines in pencil on a piece of paper bidding farewell to his father  often had he read of such messages from the sea being wafted ashore in bottles but little did he expect ever to have occasion to write one  he had just put the paper in a bottle corked it up and dropped it out of one of the cabin windows when he was summoned on deck and found that a raft was being hastily prepared alongside  already some casks of biscuits and water had been lowered on it while the carpenter and several men were busily at work increasing its size and binding it together with iron clamps hawsers and chains  there was urgent need for haste as the ship was fast settling down  now then my lads look alive cried the captain as he lifted his little daughter over the side  the ship cant float much longer here jack catch hold  edwin sprang to the side of the raft and standing up received polly in his arms  take care of her  hold her tight cried the anxious father  trust me said philosopher jack  the child was placed on the highest part of the raft with the passengers and partially covered with a shawl  the crew were then ordered to leave the ship  having seen every one out of it captain samson descended and gave the order to shove off  this was quickly done and the distance was slowly increased by means of two large oars the huge mass of spars and planks moved gradually away from the doomed vessel whose deck was by that time little above the level of the sea they had not got more than a few hundred yards off when baldwin burr who pulled one of the oars uttered an exclamation  edwin jack and ben trench who knelt close to him fastening a rope looked up and saw the captain standing on the high part of the raft near polly and little wilkins waving his right hand  he was bidding farewell to the old ship which suddenly went down with a heavy roll  another moment and only a few ripples remained to mark the spot where the lively poll had found an ocean tomb    chapter three  adrift on the great ocean  sunshine gladdens the heart of man and causes him more or less to forget his sorrows  the day on which the lively poll went down was bright and warm as well as calm so that some of those who were cast away on the raftafter the first shock had passed and while busily employed in binding the spars and making other needful arrangementsbegan to feel sensations approaching almost to hilarity  polly samson in particular being of a romantic turn of mind soon dried her eyes and when called on to assist in the construction of a little place of shelter for herself on the centre of the raft by means of boxes and sails she began to think that the life of a castaway might not be so disagreeable after all  when this shelter or hut was completed and she sat in it with her father taking luncheon she told him in confidence that she thought rafting was very nice  glad you find it so polly replied the captain with a sad smile  of course you know she continued with great seriousness of look and tone i dont think its nice that our ship is lost  im very very sorryoh you cant think how sorryfor that but this is such a funny little cabin you know and so snug and the weather is so fine do you think it will last long father  i hope it may god grant that it may darling but we cant be sure if it does last i daresay we shall manage to reach one of the islands of which there are plenty in the southern seas but  a roar of laughter from the men arrested and surprised the captain  he raised the flap of sail which served as a door to the hutpollys bower as the men styled itand saw one of the passengers dragged from a hole or space between the spars of the raft into which he had slipped up to the waist  mr luke the passenger referred to was considered a weak man mind and bodya sort of human nonentity a harmless creature with long legs and narrow shoulders  he took his cold bath with philosophic coolness and acknowledged the laughter of the men with a bland smile  regardless of his drenched condition he sat down on a small keg and joined the crew at the meal of cold provisions which served that day for dinner  lucky for us said one of the sailors making play with his claspknife on a junk of salt pork that weve got such a fine day to begin with  thats true bob said another a raft aint much of a seagoin craft  if it had blowed hard when we shoved off from the ship we might ha bin tore to bits before we was well fixed together but weve had time to make all taut now and can stand a stiffish breeze  shove along the breadbasket mate  youve had your allowance bob mind were on short commons now said baldwin burr who superintended the distribution of provisions and served out a measured quantity to every man  theres your grog for you  bob corkey growled a little as he wiped his knife on his leg and accepted the allowance of grog which however was only pure water  are you sure the raft can stand a storm inquired watty wilkins of philosopher jack who sat eating his poor meal beside him  sure responded jack we can be sure of nothing in this life  except trouble growled corkey  oh yes you can be sure of more than that said baldwin burr you can always be sure of folly coming out of a fools mouth  come come baldwin be civil said philosopher jack its cowardly you know to insult a man when you cant fight him  cant fight him repeated burr with a grin who said i couldnt fight him eh  why im ready to fight him now right off  nevertheless you cant persisted the philosopher how could two men fight on a raft where theres not room for a fair standup scrimmage between two rats  come now dont argue burr but answer little wilkinss question if you can  stowaways dont desarve to have their questions answered said corkey in fact they dont desarve to live  if i had my way id kill little wilkins and salt him down to be ready for us when the pork and biscuit fail  well now as to the safety of this here raft in a gale small wilkins said baldwin regardless of corkeys interruption that depends summat on the natur o the gale  if it was only a halfgale wed weather it all right i make no doubt but if it should come to blow hard dee see we have no occasion to kill and eat you as wed all be killed together and eaten by the sharks  sharks exclaimed mr luke whose damp garments were steaming under the powerful sun like a boiler on washingday are there sharks here  ay said corkey pointing to the sea astern where the glassy surface was broken and rippled by a sharp angular object thats a shark afollerin of us now leastwise the back fin of one  if you dont believe it jump overboard and youll soon be convinced  this reference to the shark was overheard by polly who came out of her bower to see it  the monster of the deep came close up at that moment as if to gratify the child and turning on its back according to shark habit when about to seize any object thrust its nose out of the water for one moment its double row of teeth were exposed to view then they closed on a lump of pork that had been accidentally knocked overboard by corkey  is that the way you take care of our provisions said the captain sternly to baldwin  weve got a big hook sir said edwin jack touching his cap shall we try to recover the pork  you may try returned the captain  little wilkins uttered something like a warwhoop as he leaped up and assisted jack to get out the sharkhook  it was soon baited with another piece of pork  ben trench who had a strong leaning to natural history became very eager and the men generally being ever ready for sport looked on with interest and prepared to lend a hand  the shark however was cautious  it did indeed rush at the bait and seemed about to swallow it but suddenly changed its mind swam round it once or twice then fell slowly astern and finally disappeared  although the fish was not caught this little incident served to raise the spirits of every one and as the calm sunny weather lasted the whole day even the most thoughtful of the party found it difficult to realise their forlorn condition but when evening drew near the aspect of things quickly changed  the splendid oceanmirror which had reflected the golden crags and slopes the towers and battlements of cloudland was shivered by a sudden breeze and became an opaque grey the fair blue sky deepened to indigo black and gathering clouds rose out of the horizon and cold white crests gleamed on the darkening waves  the men gathered in anxious groups and polly sat in the entrance of her bower gazing on the gloomy scene until her young heart sank slowly but steadily  then remembering her fathers advice she betook herself to god in prayer  young though she was polly was no sentimentalist in religion  she believed with all her heart in jesus christ as a living loving saviour her faith was very simple and founded on experience  she had prayed and had been answered  she had sought jesus in sorrow and had been comforted  the theologian can give the why and how and wherefore of this happy condition but in practice he can arrive at it only by the same short road  one result of her prayer was that she went to sleep that night in perfect peace while most of her companions in misfortune sat anxiously watching what appeared to be a gathering storm  before going to rest however polly had an earnest little talk with her father  polly said captain samson sitting down under the shelter of the tarpaulin and drawing the childs fair head on his breast i never spoke to you before on a subject that praps you wont understand but i am forced to do it now  its about money  about money exclaimed polly in surprise oh father surely you forget  the very last night we spent on shore you spoke to me about money you gave me a halfsovereign and said you meant to give a blowout to old mrs brown before leaving and told me to buystay let me seethere was half a pound of tea and four pounds of sugar and three pennorth of snuff and  yes yes polly interrupted the captain with a smile but i meant about money in a business way you know because if you chanced dee see ever to be in england without me you knowit  but ill never be there without you father will i asked the child with an earnest look  of course notthats to say i hope notbut you know polly that god arranges all the affairs of this world and sometimes in his love and wisdom he sees fit to separate peoplefor a time you know only for a timeso that they dont always keep together  now my darling if it should please him to send me cruising totoanywhere in a different direction from you and you chanced ever to be in england alonein scotland that isat your own home you must go to bailie trenchyou know himour old friend and helper when we were in shoal water my dear and say to him that i handed all my savings over to mr wilkinsthats wattys father pollto be invested in the way he thought best  when you tell that to bailie trench hell know what to do he understands all about it  i might send you to mr wilkins direct but hes a very great man dee see and doesnt know you and might refuse to give you the money  to give me the money father  but what should i do with the money when i got it  keep it my darling  oh  i see keep it safe for you till you came back said polly  just so poll youre a clever girl keep it for me till i come back or rather take it to bailie trench and hell tell you how to keep it its a good pot o money poll and has cost me the best part of a lifetime workin hard and spendin little to lay it by  once i used to think continued the captain in a sad soliloquising tone that id live to cast anchor near the old spot and spend it with your mother polly and you but the lord willed it otherwise and he does all things well blessed be his name  now you understand what youre to do about the money dont you if you should ever find yourself without me in scotland eh  polly did not quite clearly understand but after a little further explanation she professed herself to be quite prepared for the transaction of that important piece of financial business  poor captain samson sought thus to secure to the best of his ability that the small savings of his life should go to polly in the event of her being saved and himself lost  moreover he revealed the state of his finances to philosopher jack ben trench and watty wilkins whom he found grouped apart at a corner of the raft in earnest conversation and begged of them if they or any of them should survive to see his daughters interest attended to  you see my lads although i would not for the world terrify the dear child uselessly by telling her that we are in danger it must be clear to you that if a gale springs up and our raft should be broken up its not likely that all of us would be saved  yet polly might escape and some of you also  we are all in the lords hands however and have nothing to fear if we are his followers  ah that if went home  the captain did not lay stress on it nevertheless stress was laid on it somehow for the three youths found it recurring again and again to memory that night though they did not speak of it to each other  as the night advanced the threatening gale passed away the stars came out in all their splendour and the morning sun found the glassy sea again ready to reflect his image  thus they floated for several days in comparative peace and comfort  but it came at last  one evening a squall came rushing down on them turning up the sea and converting it to ink and foam as it approached  the rag of sail with which they had previously courted the breeze in vain was hastily taken in the fastenings of everything were looked to  polly was placed in her canvas bower and the whole structure of the raft was strengthened with a network of hawsers and cordage  when the squall struck them the raft appeared to tremble  the seas broke clean over them several articles not properly secured were swept off and weak points in the main fastenings were made plain as the spars beams and planks writhed and struggled to get free  but captain samson and his men were equal to the occasion an iron clamp here and an extra turn of a chain or hawser there made all fast so that before the squall had time to raise the sea the raft held well together and yielded without breaking to the motions of the waves  of course every one was drenched including poor little polly for although the tarpaulin turned off the waves and spray above it could not prevent the water spirting up between the spars from below  but polly was according to baldwin a true chip of the old block she bore her discomforts with heroism and quite put to shame poor mr luke whose nervous temperament caused him great suffering  thus was spent a night of anxiety  the next day was little better and the night following was worse  in addition to the violence of the wind and constant breaking over them of heavy seas the darkness became so intense that it was difficult to see where damage to the fastenings occurred and repairs became almost impossible  about midnight there was a terrible rending of wood in that part of the raft lying farthest from pollys bower and a great cry of fear was heard  the more courageous among the men sprang by a natural impulse to assist those in distress  it was found that a large portion of the raft had broken adrift and was only held to it by a single rope  on this portion were two passengers and one of the crew  the former were apparently panicstricken the latter made frantic but futile attempts to haul in on the rope  bear a hand boys cried edwin jack as he laid hold of the inner end of the rope  strong and willing hands were ready but before they could lay hold the rope parted and jack was dragged violently into the sea  he rose like a cork  little wilkins lay down and stretched out a helping hand jack caught it and would infallibly have dragged the little fellow into the water if ben trench had not thrown himself on his legs and held on baldwin burr seized hold of ben and the captain coming up at the moment lent his powerful aid  jack was saved but the broken part of the raft with its hapless occupants was swept away and lost sight of  this sad event had naturally a very depressing effect on every one true the portion of the raft which had broken away was large enough to sustain the unfortunates who were on it  moreover some of the provisions had also gone with them so that there was hope of their holding out for a time and being picked up by a passing ship but the hope was slight and in the event of rougher weather their fate would be certain  for six days and nights the raft was tossed about on the open sea  it could scarcely be said that it sailed although as large a mast and piece of canvas as they could set up urged it slowly though the water when the wind was strong  as to steering that was next to impossible and in truth it did not matter much how they steered  constant exposure by night and by day now began to tell on the less robust of the crew  little polly however was not one of these  she possessed a naturally good constitution and was besides specially cared for by her father who devoted all the powers of an inventive mind to the strengthening and improving of the bower  in this he was ably assisted by philosopher jack whose love for the child deepened daily as he watched the sweet contented manner with which she received every drenchingand she got manyand the anxious way in which she inquired for and sought to help those of the party whose health began to fail  among these latter was ben trench  ah  polly said ben one sultry forenoon when she brought him a glass of sweetened limejuice and water youre a kind little nurse  i really dont know how i should get on without you  upon my word said little wilkins pouting youre a grateful fellow here have i been nursing you all the morning yet you seem to think nothing of that in comparison with pollys glass of limejuice  come watty dont be jealous said ben its not the glass of limejuice but pollys sympathetic face beaming behind it that does me so much good  besides you know pollys a girl and a girl is always a better nurse than a man you must admit that  watty was not at all prepared to admit that but his being spoken of as a man did much to mollify his hurt feelings  but i do hope you feel better today said polly observing with some anxiety the short halfbreathless manner in which the invalid spoke  oh yes  i feel betterthat is to say i think i do  sometimes i do and sometimes i dont  you know polly i came on this voyage chiefly on account of my health and of course i must expect to be a little damaged by so much exposure though your good father has indeed done his best to shelter me  why do you know i sometimes think the berth he has made for me between the logs here is a greater triumph of his inventive genius than your bower  i often think they spoiled a splendid engineer when they made your father a sailor  polly laughed at this and watty wilkins tried to laugh just by way of keeping up his friends spirits and being what baldwin called good company but poor watty could not laugh  he had loved and played with ben trench since ever he could remember and when he looked at his pale face and listened to his weak voice a dread foreboding came over him and brought such a rush of feeling to his heart that he was fain to leap up and spring to the farthest end of the raft where he fell to hauling and tightening one of the ropefastenings with all the energy of his little body and soul  land ho shouted one of the men at that moment from the top of a cask which formed the outlook where every day and all day a man was stationed to watch for a sail or a sign of land  an electric shock could not have produced greater excitement than these two words  where away exclaimed the captain leaping up beside the lookout  on the portbow sirthere pointing eagerly  i dont see itohyesno  its only a cloud  who ever heard of the portbow of a raft  bah your eyes have been squintin  not a bit of it i see itlow lyin why i see the palmsand i see the nutsah and the monkeys no doubt aeatin of emhip hip hurrah  such were some of the exclamations ending in a long deeptoned british cheer with which the discovery of land was greeted  in a short time all uncertainty was removed and the land was clearly made out to be a small coral island with its narrow outlying reef and a few cocoanut palms waving thereon  the joy of the shipwrecked crew was excessivesomewhat in proportion to their previous depression  they shook bands laughed cheered and in some cases wept while a few clasped their hands looked up and audibly thanked god  youll soon get ashore said polly laying her hand on ben trenchs arm  ay and the cocoanut milk will set you up and make you fat in no time added watty wilkins  so it will returned ben who had not risen like the others well have jolly times of it wont we  like robinson crusoe  oh how i wish that sister susan was here  she would enjoy it so much  its an island isnt it  yes said edwin jack coming forward at the moment a coral island with plenty of vegetation on it  so cheer up ben we shall soon be ashore  not so soon however as they expected for the wind was light although favourable the raft was heavy and the two oars had but little influence on it  the sun sank and rose again before they drew near to the reef  inside the reef between it and the islandshore there was a lake or lagoon of calm water but outside on the reef itself a heavy swell broke with continuous roar  to get involved in those giant breakers would have been destruction to the raft and probably death to most of those on board  one narrow opening marked by a few shrubs and palms on either side formed the only portal to the calm lagoon  the captain himself took the steering oar and summoned our philosopher to his assistance  give way now lads with a will  as many men as could grasp the two oars laid hold of them and bent their backs till the strong wood cracked again  gradually the raft neared the opening  as it did so the groundswell began to act on it by degrees the towering billowswhich seemed to rise out of a calm sea and rush to their destruction like walls of liquid glasscaught it dragged it on a little and then let it slip  at last one great wave began to curl in hissing foam underneath caught the raft fairly carried it forward on its boiling crest and launched it with lightning speed into the opening  the space was too narrow  one of the projecting spars touched the reef  instantly the fastenings were rent like packthread and the raft was hurled forward in disconnected fragments  one of these turned completely over with several men on it another portion passed through the opening and swung round inside  the steering oar was wrenched from jacks hands and struck the captain into the water  as if by instinct jack sprang to the bower caught polly in his arms and leaped into the sea  at the same moment wilkins ran to the rescue of his friend ben  these two were on the part that had swung round to the calm side of the reef and watty waded to it with ben on his back  the captain and all the rest were washed in a cataract of foam and wreckage through the opening into the lagoon and pitched by curling eddies on the shore  in a few minutes they all stood in safety panting but uninjured on the white sands of the coral reef    chapter four  the coral islandproceedings therein  the island on which the raft with its occupants had been cast was of small size not more than six miles in extent and lay low in the water nevertheless it was covered with luxuriant vegetation among which were several groves of cocoanut palms the long feathery branches of which waved gracefully in a gentle breeze as if beckoning an invitation to the castaways on the reef to cross the lagoon and find shelter there but crossing the lagoon was not an easy matter  shure its a mile wide if its a futt said one of the men as they stood in a group on the reef dripping and gazing at the isle  no simon orook said bob corkey in that flat contradictions way to which some men are prone no its only half a mile if its an inch  youre wrong both of you said baldwin burr it aint more than quarter of a mile  quite an easy swim for any of us  except my polly observed the captain quietly  ay and those who are too weak to swim said watty wilkins with a glance at his friend ben who had lain down on the sand and listened with a calm untroubled look to the conversation  you dont seem at all anxious whispered polly to ben  no polly im not  i have lately been taught how to trust in god by your example  by mine exclaimed the child in extreme surprise  before ben could reply the captain turned and called to polly  come here my duckey edwin jack offers to swim over the lagoon to the island with you on his back  will you trust yourself to him  yes father answered the child promptly  but maybe there are sharks suggested orook  there was a momentary silence  in the excitement of the occasion every one had forgotten sharks  what was to be done  the raft was utterly destroyed  only a few of the logs which had formed it lay on the reef the rest were floating on the lagoon at various distances none nearer than fifty yards  theres nothing for it then but to reconstruct our raft said the captain throwing off his coat and shoes so these logs must be secured  he had only taken two steps towards the water when philosopher jack grasped his arm  stop sir it is your duty to look after polly  now lads those who can swim come along  another instant and he was in the sea regardless of sharks and striking out for the floating wreckage closely followed by orook corkey burr and watty wilkins  strange to say eight other men of the crew could not swim although they had managed somehow to scramble on the reef  whether it was that the sharks were not there at the time or that the number and energy of the swimmers frightened them we cannot tell but each man reached a log or plank in safety and began pushing it towards the reef  it was when they drew near to this that the trial of their courage was most severe  the excitement and gush of daring with which they had plunged in was by that time expended and the slow motion of the logs gave them time for reflection  orooks lively fancy troubled him much  if the baists would only attack a man in front he muttered its little id mind em but to come up behind sneakin likehooroo  at that moment a branch of coral which projected rather far from the bottom touched orooks toe and drew from him an uncontrollable yell of alarm  baldwin burr who swam close behind was humorously inclined as well as cool  he pushed the plank he was guiding close to his comrades back dipped the end of it and thrust it down on orooks legs  the effect was even more powerful than he had hoped for  a sharka shaaark howled orook and dived under the broken mainyard which he was piloting ashore  coming up on the other side he tried to clamber on it but it rolled round and dropped him  he went down with a gurgling cry  again he rose grasped the spar with his left arm glared wildly round and clenched his right hand as if ready to hit on the nose any creaturefish flesh or fowlthat should assail him  take it easy messmate said burr in a quiet tone sorry i touched you  hope it didnt hurt much  och it was you was it  sure i thought it was a shark well well its plaised i am to be let off so aisy  with this philosophic reflection orook landed with his piece of timber enough of material was soon collected to form a raft sufficiently large to ferry half of the party across the lagoon and in two trips the whole were landed in safety on the island  you dont mean to tell me jack said baldwin burr that this island was made by coral insects  yes i do said jack  from the top to the bottom asked burr  from the bottom to the top said edwin  baldwin asked this question of the philosopher during a pause in their labours  they were at the time engaged in constructing a new bower for polly among the flowering shrubs under the cocoanut palms  polly herself was aiding them and the rest of the party were scattered among the bushes variously employed in breaking down branches tearing up long grass and otherwise clearing ground for an encampment  how could insects make an island asked polly sitting down on a bank to rest  dont you know poll said edwin why i thought your father taught you about almost everything  oh no replied polly with an innocent smile not everything yet you know but i daresay he will in the course of time  tell me about the insects  well let me see how shall i begin said jack leaning against the bank and crossing his arms on his breast  the coral insects polly are very small some of them not larger than a pins head  they are great builders  there is lime in seawater  the insects which are called corallines have the power of attracting this lime to them drawing it away from the water so to speak and fixing it round their own bodies which is called secreting the lime  thus they form shells or houses to themselves which they fix at the bottom of the sea having laid the basements of their houses close together they proceed to add upper storeys and thus they add storey to storey until they reach the surface of the sea  they work in such innumerable millions that in course of time they form reefs and islands as you see  but i dont see said polly looking round at least i dont see corallines working  ah good said baldwin with a nod of approval to the child as if to say you have him there  true returned the philosopher because the corallines can only work under water  the moment they reach the surface they die but those that remain continue their labours on the sides of the reef or island and thus widen it  then the waves break off masses of coral and cast them with drifting seaweed and other things up on the reef which makes it higher then seabirds come to rest on it  the winds carry seeds of various plants to it which take root grow up die and thus thicken the soil by slow degrees till at last after a long long time the island becomes a pretty large and fertile one like this  wonderful exclaimed polly what a clever insect  clever indeed returned edwin especially when we consider that it has got no brains  no brains echoed baldwin  no it has little more than a stomach  oh come now remonstrated baldwin we cant believe that can we miss polly  even a housebuilder must think much more an islandbuilder and no fellow can think with his stomach you know  nevertheless it is as i tell you continued jack and these little creatures manage to create hundreds of islands in the southern seas by their perseverance energy and united action  quite an example to maneh baldwin  ha just soa long pull and a strong pull and a pull all together i think wed better act on the principles of these corrylines else miss pollys bower wont be ready afore dark  so saying the seaman and our philosopher resumed their work with such united energyaided by polly herselfthat a very comfortable habitation of boughs and large leaves was finished before the day closed  it resembled a large beehive was overshadowed by dense foliage of a tropical kind and carpeted with a species of fern  polly was profuse in her thanks and when it was finished called to her father to come and admire it  the stout mariner at once obeyed the summons  he quitted the pile of firewood on which he had been labouring and with a violently red face and perspiring brow appeared on the scene bearing a mighty axe on his shoulder  splendid he exclaimed with beaming admiration  its fit for the queen of the coral isles  for whom it is intended said philosopher jack quickly  polly laughed for she understood the compliment but suddenly became grave as she remembered ben trench and said no no it must be used as a shelter for ben  thats kind of you polly said watty coming up with a huge bundle of grass and foliage for bedding at the moment but ben has got friends to remember him as well as you  bob corkey and i have made him a hut on the other side of the bushesthere you may see the top of it through the leaves  does any one know where mr luke is asked the captain  none of those assembled at the bower had seen him for some hours and captain samson was on the point of organising a party to go in search of him when one of the crew came in from the bush and said he had gone off with simon orook to the highest point of the low islet to ascertain if possible its extent  hes all right if orook is with him said the captain to polly in confidence when they went into the bower together but hes not to be trusted away by himself  i never saw a man more unfit to look after himself  and yet he is a good kind man father said polly  true quite true poll replied the captain musingly  i wonder why it is that some men seem as if they had been meant for women maybe it is by way of balancing those women who seem to have been meant for men  polly listened to this with a look of grave consideration but not having formed an opinion on the subject wisely held her tongue  meanwhile orook led his companion towards the highest part of the islet which being clear of trees seemed likely to afford them a good outlook  the sailor was a man of inquiring disposition and being of a freeandeasy nature did not hesitate to speak out his mind on all occasions  after walking beside his tall companion and eyeing his thin figure and sad countenance in silence for some time he said  youre a cadaverous sort o man mr luke  think so said mr luke gently  of course i cant help thinkin so because i see it returned orook  was it a fall now wen you was a babby that did it or measles  neither that i am aware of replied mr luke with a goodnatured smile my father before me was cadaverous  ah said orook with a look of sympathy as he touched the region of his heart with his left thumb praps it was somethin o this sort eh  ive bin through that myself in the ould country where as purty awell well its all over now but ive a fellowfeelin for  no interrupted mr luke with a sigh it wasnt a disappointment it wasoh what a splendid view  they had reached the top of the ridge at the moment and the view of the verdant islet that burst upon them might well have called forth admiration from men of coarser mould than they  orook forgot for a few minutes the subject of his curiosity and compared the prospect to some of the beautiful scenery of ireland though there was no resemblance whatever between the two  he soon returned however to the previous subject of conversation but mr luke had ceased to be communicative  what is that lying on the beach there he said pointing in the direction referred to  its more than i can tell answered orook looks like a boat dont it  very said mr luke and there is something lying beside it like a man  come lets go see  the two explorers went rapidly down the gentle slope that led to the beach and soon found that the object in question was indeed a boat old rotten and blistered with the sun  beside it lay the skeleton of a man with a few rags of the garments that had once formed its clothing still clinging to it here and there  it was a pitiful sight  evidently the unfortunate man had been cast away in an open boat and had been thrown on that beach when too much exhausted to make a last struggle for life for there was no sign of his having wandered from the boat or cut down bushes or attempted to make a fire  his strength had apparently enabled him to get out of the boat that was all and there he had lain down to die  for some time the two wanderers stood contemplating the sight in silence and when at length they spoke it was in low sad tones  poor poor fellow said mr luke he must have been shipwrecked like ourselves and cast adrift in the boat  but i wonder that he is alone one would expect that some of his comrades must have got into the boat along with him  no doubt said orook they was all starved at sea and throwd overboard  come mr luke lets bury him its all we can do for him now  saying this orook threw off his jacket and with his companions assistance soon scraped a hole in the sand  into this they were about to lift the skeleton when they observed that its right hand covered a decayed remnant of rag under which was seen a glittering substance  it turned out to be the clasp of a notebook which however was so decayed and glued together that it could not be opened  orook therefore wrapped it in his handkerchief and put it in his pocket  then they buried the skeleton and rolled a large mass of coral rock upon the grave to mark the spot  a careful examination was next made of the old boat and the locality around it but nothing whatever was found to throw light on the fate of the vessel to which the man had belonged  returning to the encampment orook and his companion found their friends busy preparing supper which consisted of some provisions saved from the raft and cocoanuts  in a few seconds the whole party was assembled in front of pollys bower listening attentively while orook described the discovery of the skeleton to the captain and produced the old notebook  deep was the interest of every member of that little community as the captain attempted to open the book and intense was the expression of disappointment on each countenanceespecially on that of pollywhen after a prolonged trial he utterly failed  let philosopher jack try it exclaimed watty wilkins eagerly  the captain at once handed the book to jack with a smile  to be sure said he a philosopher ought to understand the management of books better than a skipper but when a book is glued hard and fast like that it may puzzle even a philosopher to master its contents  jack made the attempt however  he went to work with the calm deliberation of a thorough workman  by the aid of heat and gentle friction and a little moisture and the judicious use of a penknife he succeeded at last in opening the book in one or two places  while he was thus engaged the rest of the party supped and speculated on the probable contents of the book  here is a legible bit at last said jack but the writing is very faint  let me see  it refers to the state of the weather and the wind the poor man evidently kept a private journal  ah here in the middle of the book the damp has not had so much effect  as he turned and separated the leaves with great care jacks audience gazed at him intently and forgot supper  at last he began to read    saturday 4thhave been three weeks now on short allowance  we   are all getting perceptibly weaker  the captain who is not a strong   man is sinking  the boat is overcrowded  if a gale should spring up   we shall all perish  i dont like the looks of two of the men  they   are powerful fellows and the captain and i believe them to be quite   capable of murdering the most of us and throwing us overboard to save   their own lives  here there is a blank said jack and the next date is the 8th but there is no month or year given  the writing continues    i scarce know what has passed during the last few days  it is like   a horrible dream  the two men made the attempt and killed big   george whom they feared most because of his courage and known   fidelity to the captain but before they could do further mischief   the second mate shot them both  the boat floats lighter now and   through gods mercy the weather continues fine  our last ration was   served out this morningtwo ounces of biscuit each and a wineglass   of water  sunday 11thtwo days without food  the captain read   to us today some chapters out of the bible those describing the   crucifixion of jesus  williams and ranger were deeply impressed and   for the first time seemed to lament their sins and to speak of   themselves as crucifiers of jesus  the captains voice very weak but   he is cheerful and resigned  it is evident that his trust is in the   lord  he exhorts us frequently  we feel the want of water more than   food  wednesdaythe captain and williams died yesterday  ranger   drank sea water in desperation  he went mad soon after and jumped   overboard  we tried to save him but failed  only three of us are   left  if we dont meet with a ship or sight an island it will soon   be all over with us  thursdayi am alone now  an island is in   sight but i can scarcely raise myself to look at it  i will bind   this book to my hand  if any one finds me let him send it to my   beloved wife lucy  it will comfort her to know that my last thoughts   on earth were of her dear self and that my soul is resting on my   redeemer  i grow very cold and faint  may gods best blessing   rest  the voice of the reader stopped suddenly and for some moments there was a solemn silence broken only by a sob from polly samson  why dont you go on asked the captain  there is nothing more said jack sadly  his strength must have failed him suddenly  it is unfortunate for as he has neither signed his name nor given the address of his wife it will not be possible to fulfil his wishes  maybe suggested orook if you open some more o the pages youll find a name somewheres  jack searched as well as the condition of the book would admit of and found at last the name of david ban the latter part of the surname being illegible  he also discovered a lump in one place which on being cut into proved to be a lock of golden hair in perfect preservation  it was evidently that of a young person  thats lucys hair said orook promptly  blessins on her poor heart  give it me philosopher jack as well as the book  they both belong to me by rights cause i found em an if ever i set futt in old england again ill hunt her up and give em to her  as no one disputed orooks claim the book and lock of hair were handed to him  soon afterwards polly lay down to rest in her new bower and her father with his men made to themselves comfortable couches around her under the canopy of the luxuriant shrubs  a week passed  during that period captain samson with polly jack and wilkins walked over the island in all directions to ascertain its size and productions while the crew of the lively poll found full employment in erecting huts of boughs and broad leaves and in collecting cocoanuts and a few other wild fruits and roots  meanwhile the bottle thrown overboard by watty wilkins with its message from the sea began a long and slow but steady voyage  it may not perhaps be known to the reader that there are two mighty currents in the ocean which never cease to flow  the heated waters of the equator flow north and south to get cooled at the poles and then flow back again from the poles to get reheated at the equator  the form of continents the effect of winds the motion of the earth and other influences modify the flow of this great oceanic current and produce a variety of streams  one of these streams a warm one passing up the coast of africa is driven into the gulf of mexico from which it crosses the atlantic to the west coast of britain and is familiarly known as the gulf stream  if watty wilkinss bottle had been caught by this stream it would perhaps in the course of many months have been landed on the west of ireland  if it had been caught by any of the other streams it might have ended its career on the coasts of japan australia or any of the many ends of the earth  but the bottle came under a more active influence than that of the ocean streams  it was picked up one calm day by a british ship and carried straight to england where its contents were immediately put into the newspapers and circulated throughout the land  the effect of little wilkinss message from the sea on different minds was various  by some it was read with interest and pathos while others glanced it over with total indifference  but there were a few on whom the message fell like a thunderbolt as we shall now proceed to show    chapter five  tells of plottings and trials at home with doings and dangers abroad  in a dingy office in a back street in one of the darkest quarters of the city whose name we refrain from mentioning an elderly man sat down one foggy morning poked the fire blew his nose opened his newspaper and began to read  this man was a partowner of the lively poll  his name was black  black is a good wearing colour and not a bad name but it is not so suitable a term when applied to a mans character and surroundings  we cannot indeed say positively that mr blacks character was as black as his name but we are safe in asserting that it was very dirty grey in tone  mr black was essentially a dirty little man  his hands and face were dirty so dirty that his only clerk a dirty little boy held the firm belief that the famous soap which is said to wash black men white could not cleanse his master  his office was dirty so were his garments and so was his mean little spirit which occupied itself exclusively in scraping together a paltry little income by means of little ways known only to its owner  mr black had a soul he admitted that but he had no regard for it and paid no attention to it whatever  into whatever corner of his being it had been thrust he had so covered it over and buried it under heaps of rubbish that it was quite lost to sight and almost to memory  he had a conscience also but had managed to sear it to such an extent that although still alive it had almost ceased to feel  turning to the shipping news mr blacks eye was arrested by a message from the sea  he read it and as he did so his hands closed on the newspaper convulsively his eyes opened so did his mouth and his face grew deadly palethat is to say it became a light greenish grey  anything wrong sir asked the dirty clerk  the lively poll gasped mr black is at the bottom of the sea  shes in a lively position then thought the dirty clerk who cared no more for the lively poll than he did for her partowner but he only replied o dear with a solemn look of hypocritical sympathy  mr black seized his hat rushed out of his office and paid a sudden visit to his neighbour mr walter wilkins senior  that gentleman was in the act of running his eye over his newspaper  he was a wealthy merchant  turning on his visitor a bland kindly countenance he bade him goodmorning  i do hopeexcuse me my dear sir said mr black excitedly i do hope you will see your way to grant me the accommodation i ventured to ask for yesterday  my business is in such a state that this disaster to the lively poll  the lively poll exclaimed mr wilkins with a start  oh i beg pardon said mr black with a confused look for his seared conscience became slightly sensitive at that moment  i suppose you have not yet seen it he pointed to the paragraph but excuse me i cannot understand how you came to know that your son was on board pardon me  mr wilkins had laid his face in his hands and groaned aloud then looking up suddenly said i did not certainly know that my dear boy was on board but i had too good reason to suspect it for he had been talking much of the vessel and disappeared on the day she sailed and now this message from  he rose hastily and put on his greatcoat  excuse me my dear sir urged mr black at such a time it may seem selfish to press you on business affairs but this is a matter of life and death to me  it is a matter of death to me interrupted the other in a low tone but i grant your request  my clerk will arrange it with you  he left the office abruptly with a bowed head and mr black having arranged matters to his satisfaction with the clerk left it soon after with a sigh of relief  he cared no more for mr wilkinss grief than did the dirty clerk for his masters troubles  returning to his dirty office mr black then proceeded to do a stroke of very dingy business  that morning through some mysterious agency he had learned that there were rumours of an unfavourable kind in reference to a certain bank in the city which for convenience we shall name the blankow bank  now it so happened that mr black was intimately acquainted with one of the directors of that bank in whom as well as in the bank itself he had the most implicit confidence  mr black happened to have a female relative in the city named mrs niventhe same mrs niven who had been landlady to philosopher jack  it was one of the rootprinciples of mr blacks business character that he should make hay while the sun shone he knew that mrs niven owned stock in the blankow bank he knew that the bank paid its shareholders a very handsome dividend and he was aware that owing to the unfavourable rumours then current the value of the stock would fall very considerably  that therefore was the time for knowing men like mr black who believed in the soundness of the bank to buy  accordingly he wrote a letter to mrs niven advising her to sell her shares and offering to transact the business for her but he omitted to mention that he meant to buy them up himself  he added a postscript on the back telling of the loss of the lively poll  mrs niven was a kindhearted woman as the reader knows moreover she was a trusting soul  very kind o maister black she observed to peggy her maidofallwork on reading the letter  the blankow bank gies a high dividend nae doot but im well enough off and hae nae need to risk my siller for the sake o a pund or twa mair income i the year  fetch me the ink peggy  a letter was quickly written in which worthy mrs niven agreed to her relatives proposal and thanked him for the interest he took in her affairs  having despatched peggy with it to the post she reread mr blacks epistle and in doing so observed the postscript which being on the fourth page had escaped her on the first perusal  hoots said she thats stipid  i didna notice the ps  reading in a low tone and commenting parenthetically she continued by the way did not one of your lodgers a student sail in the lively poll atweel did he he telt me though he telt naebody else an gaed muckle again my wull as a common sailor  common indeed na na he was an uncommon sailor if he was onything if so youll be sorry to learn that the lively poll is lost and all her crew and passengers have per  instead of reading perished poor mrs niven finished the sentence with a shriek and fell flat on the floor where she was found soon after and with difficulty restored to consciousness by the horrified peggy  that same morning in his lowly cottage on the scottish border mr john jack opened a newspaper at the breakfasttable  besides mrs jack there sat at the table four olive branchestwo daughters and two sonsthe youngest of whom named dobbin was peculiarly noticeable as being up to the eyes in treacle dobbins chief earthly joy being treacle pieces  mr jacks eye soon fell on the message from the sea  of course he knew nothing of the writer but recognised the name of the vessel as being that in which his son had sailed for the southern seas for our hero had written to tell of his departure although he had not asked or waited for advice  mr jack was a man of strong nerve  rising quietly from the table he left the room but his wife noticed the expression of his face and followed him into their bedroom  whats wrang john  the poor man turned abruptly drew his wife to him and pressed her head on his breast  o maggie he said in a low husky voice the lord gave and the lord hath taken away can you finish the sentence  ay blessed be the name o the lord said mrs jack in a tremulous voice but what  listen said her husband and he read out the fatal message  it canna beoh it canna bethat my teddie is gone said the stricken mother clasping her hands i canna i winna believe it  are ye sure that was the ships name  yes too sure answered her husband  ive mislaid the dear boys letter but ill go and see mrs niven  he mentioned it i know to her  there was yet another house in scotland into which the message carried profound grief namely that of bailie trench  need we say that the supposed loss of an only son was a crushing blow rendered all the more terrible by the thought that death had been met so suddenly in a voyage which had been undertaken in search of health  but we will spare the reader further details and return once more to the coral island where we left the castaways making themselves as comfortable as the nature of the place would admit of  and truth to tell there are many people in civilised lands much less comfortably situated than were these same castaways  the weather as orook said was splendacious almost equal to that of ould ireland  cocoanuts and other fruits were abundant  the lagoon swarmed with fish including sharks which rendered fishing an excitingly dangerous as well as enjoyable pastime  polly samson found gardens of coral and seaweed in crystal pools which she could gaze at and admire for hours though she could not walk in them  but she could and did sympathise with the little fish of varied size and colour which darted about in these water gardens and philosopher jack found in them an inexhaustible theme for discourse to the teachable and inquisitive baldwin burr  the captain found enough of employment in directing and planning generally for the whole party  cutting firewood gathering nuts and wild fruit fell to the lot of bob corkey and simon orook slid naturally into the office of cook  the remainder of the men were employed at various jobs according to circumstances  watty wilkins was a passionate fisher  he divided his time between the lagoon and the couch of his sick friend bell trench who soon began to improve on rest sunshine and cocoanut milk  as for mr luke being fit for nothing he was allowed to do very much what he pleased except at meal times when orook made him wash the dishes many of which were merely flat stones  in short the place was according to polly a sort of paradise and would have been almost perfect but for a tendency in one or two of the men to quarrel and a powerful disposition in bob corkey and simon orook to argue  though the arguing never quite degenerated into quarrelling and the quarrelsome men never absolutely came to blows their tendencies made this coral paradise imperfect  two of the most troublesome men named respectively bounce and badger were cured by the captain in the following mannerthey had been quarrelling verbally for half an hour one morning calling each other names and threatening as usual to fight but not doing so  come lads follow me said the captain to them sternly and much to their surprise  he led the way to a neighbouring grove where he stopped  now said he this is a cool shady spot  i want to know which of you two is the best man  come go to work and fight it out  ill see fair play  bounce and badger showed much unwillingness whereupon the captain buttoned his coat turned up his wristbands doubled his enormous fists and declared that they would have to fight with him if they would not fight with each other  but we dont want to fight sir said bounce humbly seeing that the captain was thoroughly in earnest  very well then shake hands said the captain in a tone so peremptory that the men were fain to obey  now go back to camp together said the captain and let us have no more boastingdee understand  they went off at once  after that there was less disagreement and no threatening to fight among the men  one morningit was a sundaythe captain called the whole party together after breakfast and announced the fact that he was going to preach them a sermon  you see my lads said he since you have agreed that i shall continue to be your captain on shore as well as at seato be the governor in short of this little colonyit is right that we should come to a distinct understanding as to our new position and be guided by fixed laws  in time i will draw you up a code which i hope will be ratified by yourselves and will work well  today i mean to start by preaching a sermon  i prpose to do so every sunday and to have family prayers every morning  is that agreed to  agreed said nearly every one  bounce and badger laughed however supposing that the captain was jesting  but he was very far from jesting  taking no notice of the laughter he continued in an earnest impressive manner which enforced respect while he pointed towards the other side of the island  my lads the skeleton that lies over yonder furnishes me with a text one is taken and another left  that poor fellow was taken away from this life  you and i have been left behind  assuredly we have been left for a good purpose and the merciful god who has spared us means that we should henceforth live for his glory  my lads you all know what a blessed thing is a state of peace and you also know what a miserable thing it is to be for ever quarrelling  since we landed on this island weve had a little of both  i took in hand to stop the quarrelling the other day in my own way  praps it wasnt altogether my own way either for ive read in the bible of smiting a scorner that the simple might take warning  however be that as it may that system may serve a turn but its not the straight road to come to a state of peace  if we are to live happily here my lads to avoid quarrelling to honour our maker and to prove to each otheras well as to angels and devils who may be lookin on for all that i knowthat we stand on a higher level than the brutes we must square our conduct by the rules and laws laid down by the prince of peace whose desire is that on earth men should live together in peace and goodwill  ill now read you some of these laws  here the captain drew a small bible from his pocket and slowly read the fifth chapter of matthews gospel pausing at each verse and commenting thereon after his own peculiar fashion to the surprise of all who heard him for although all knew the captain to be an upright man they were not prepared by his usually stern look and brusque offhand manner for the tender spirit and depth of feeling which he now displayed  now my lads said he shutting the book thats all ive got to say to you today but before closing let me ask you to think like mennot like childrenabout what we have been reading  the service of god is not a mere matter of ceremonies  jesus christ came to save you and me not so much from punishment as from sin itself  it is a great salvation  those of you who may have been swimming with the current know and care nothing about the power of sin  if you think you do my lads turn up stream  try to resist sin and youll learn something new  only those who are made willing and strong by the spirit of god can do it successfully  no doubt that remark will set adrift a lot o thoughts and questions in your minds  to all of them i give you a short text as a good course to steer by ask and ye shall receive  ask light and ask wisdom  now cook continued the captain turning to orook go to work and get your dinner under weigh for talking makes one hungry  meanwhile i intend to go and have a short ramble on the seashore and i want to know if there is any small female on this island who wants to go with me  at this polly jumped up with a laugh put her little hand in that of her father and stood on tiptoe with upturned face  the captain stooped received a stiff norwester and the two went off together  the following night as the party were seated round the fire finishing supper watty wilkins surprised his friends by rising clearing his throat extending his right arm after the manner of an orator and delivering himself of the following speech  lady and gentlemeni rise on the present occasion with or without your leave order from ben trench to make a few pertinent remarks impertinent from philosopher jack regarding our present strange and felicitous circumstances  hear hear  our community is a republica glorious republic  having constituted captain samson our governor pastor and lawgiver it has occurred to me that we might with great advantage to ourselves institute a college of learning and without delay elect professors  as a stowaway i would not have presumed to make such a proposal but as a free and independent citizen of this republic i claim the right to be heard and i now move that we proceed to elect a professor of natural philosophy natural history and any other natural or unnatural science that any of us may happen to remember or invent  hear hear and laughter  as a student is naturally allied to a professor and somewhat resembles himthe only difference being that the one knows mostly everything and the other next to nothingi further propose that we appoint to this professorship philosopher jack with a salary of gratitude depending on merit and the duty of lecturing to us every night after supper for our entertainment  watty wilkins sat down amid great applause and ben trench seconded the motion which was of course carried unanimously  philosopher jack at once accepted the professorship and proceeded then and there to deliver his inaugural address in which he philosophised of things past present and to come both seriously and humorously in a way that filled his favourite pupil baldwin burr with inexpressible delight  when he had finished bob corkey rose and with an air of intense solemnity said  messmates my lady fathers and brethreni begs to offer a observation or two  it seems to me that a college with only one professor aint quite the thing for this great and enlightened republic seems to me therefore that we should appint a professor who could spin yarns for our amusement not to say edification  and for this end i moves that we appint simon orook great applause whose gifts in the way o storytellin or natral lyin so to speak is unequalled by any natral philosopher on the island  hear hear and cheers mingled with laughter  this motion was seconded by bounce and the appointment was gracefully accepted by orook who however declined taking office till the following night as it was getting late and he required time to compose his professional lies but he ventured as a free citizen of the noo republic to move that the house should adjourn to bed  the idea thus jestingly introduced was so far carried into effect in earnest that philosopher jack did on many evenings thereafter amuse and interest his comrades round the campfire by relating many a tale from history both ancient and modern with which his memory was well stored  he also proved to himself as well as to others the great value of even a small amount of scientific knowledge by being able to comment on the objects of surrounding nature in a way that invested them with an interest which to absolutely ignorant men they could not have possessed  orook also fulfilled his engagements to some extent being not only able but willing to spin longwinded yarns which when genuine material failed he could invent with facility  thus the time passed pleasantly enough for several weeks and the shipwrecked crew succeeded in keeping up their spirits despite the undercurrent of heavy anxiety with which they were oppressedas indeed they could scarcely fail to be when they reflected on the fact that the island on which they had been cast lay far out of the ordinary track of ships  this had been ascertained by the captain who it may be remembered had taken his sextant from the ship and who the day before the destruction of the raft on the coral reef had obtained a reliable observation and fixed their position  but this anxiety was deepened and a darker gloom was cast over the party by an incident which happened soon afterwards  it has been said that watty wilkins was passionately fond of fishing this business he prosecuted by means of a small raft made from the remnants of the old one which he pushed about with a long pole  but the raft was inconvenient moreover it had been more than once nearly upset by a shark  watty therefore resolved to make a small boat out of the remains of the old boat beside which the skeleton had been found in this he was so ably assisted by his friends jack and ben that the boatwhich was a very small onewas launched in the course of two weeks  a pair of light oars was also made and in this boat the fishing was prosecuted with redoubled vigour  sometimes the three friends went off in company more frequently little wilkins went out alone  one day he pushed off by himself and pulled to different parts of the lagoon casting his line now and then with varying success  the day happened to be unusually calm and bright  when he passed the opening in the reef the surf appeared less violent than usual so that he was tempted to pull though it  the breakers were passed in safety and he soon found himself with a sensation of great delight floating on the gentle swell of the open sea  he pulled out for a considerable distance and then cast his lines  so intent was he on these that he did not observe the approach of a squall till it was almost upon him seizing the oars he pulled towards the island but he had drifted off shore a considerable distance  the wind also was against him  his efforts were vain  in short he was blown out to sea  the desperate anxiety of the poor boy was changed to despair when the island gradually receded and finally disappeared  at first the little boat was nearly swamped but by clever management of the oars watty saved it  the squall was shortlived  before long it again fell calm and the sky cleared but nothing was now to be seen save the unbroken circle of the horizon  who can tell the feelings of the poor youth when night descended on the sea  for hours he sat in the sternsheets quite motionless as if stunned  note see frontispiece rowing he knew would be of no use as he might be pulling away from the island instead of towards it fastening his jacket to an oar he set it up as a signal and sat down helpless and inactive but his mind was busy as he gazed into the depths of the moonlit sky  he thought of home of the father whom he had so deeply injured of the prospects that he had unwittingly blighted of his comrade ben trench and his other friends on the coral island  as he continued to think conscience rose up and condemned him sternly wilkins bowed his head to the condemnation and admitted that it was just  oh he cried in a passion of sudden remorse o god spare me to return home and be a comfort to my fathermy dear dear father  he put his face in his hands and wept bitterly  sitting thus overcome with sorrow and fatigue he gradually sank lower and lower until he slid to the bottom of the boat and lay at last with his head on the thwart in profound slumber  he dreamed of home and forgiveness as he floated there the one solitary black spot on the dark breast of the solemn sea    chapter six  watty wilkins is tried comforted run down rescued and restored  when watty wilkins awoke from sleep the sun was high in the heavens and the sea smooth as a mirror  the poor boy raised himself on one elbow and looked about him at first with a confused feeling of uncertainty as to where he was  then the truth burst upon him with overwhelming force  not only was he alone in a little halfdecayed boat without sail rudder or compass on the great pacific ocean but with the exception of a few fish he was without food and worst of all he had not a drop of fresh water  what was to be done  an unspoken prayer ascended from his heart to god as he rose and seized the oars  a belief that it was needful to act vigorously and at once was strong upon him  for several minutes he relieved his feelings by rowing with all his might  then he stopped abruptly and his spirit sank almost in despair as he exclaimed aloud  whats the use  i dont know where the island is  i may only be pulling farther away from it  oh what shall i do  at that moment of extreme depression the value of having had a godfearing father who had taught him the bible was unexpectedly realised for there flashed into his mind as if in reply to his question the words call upon me in the time of trouble i will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me  he pulled in the oars at once fell on his knees and clasping his hands prayed fervently  watty had been taught a form of prayer in childhood and had often used it with little or no regard to its meaning  now in his distress he prayed in earnest  he meant what he said  it followed also that he said what he meant  the old form being quite unsuitable to the occasion was forgotten and very homely language indeed was used but it was sufficient for the purpose  the substance of it was a cry for pardon and deliverance  that which winged it to the throne of grace was the name of jesus christ  resuming the oars he rowed gently not for the sake of directing the boat but because a state of inaction was disagreeable and as he rowed he thought of the promise that had been sent to him  strange to say the latter part of it thou shalt glorify me seemed to take a stronger hold of his mind than the first  yes he thought the whole promise is true  he will deliver me and make me to glorify himself in some way or other  perhaps he will let me live to return home and be a comfort to my father  the thought of the sorrow he had caused his father weighed heavier than ever in the poor boys mind and the desire to express his repentance and if possible make his father glad again became very intense  it seemed to him that a millstone would be removed from his heart if he could be allowed even for one minute to hold his fathers hand and say oh i am so sorry sorry sorry that i ran away  the millstone was not removed at that time however but in answer to prayer it was unquestionably lightened  the exercise of rowing and the fresh morning air produced their natural effect ere long on the little castaway  he became ravenously hungry and turned his eyes inquiringly on the few fish which surged about in the pool of dirty water that had gathered in the bottom of the boat  it was not an inviting breakfast  watty turned his eyes away from it looked up into the fair blue sky and tried to think of other things but the calls of nature were not to be silenced  instead of thinking of other things he somehow thought of bread and butter  he even fell into a species of argument with himself as to whether it would not be uncommonly pleasant in various supposable circumstances to eat bread without butter  then he found himself meditating on the delights of butter and jam together which somehow suggested the scriptural figure of a land flowing with milk and honey  oh he sighed at this point if the sea was only milk and honeymilk even without honeywhat a glorious prospect  he looked at it as if he half thought it would be transformed under the power of his intense wish  then he looked again at the floating fish and shuddered  well might he shudder for they were contemptible little fish most of them with unnaturally large heads and great staring eyes as if they had failed even in death to get rid of their surprise at being caught  with their mouths opened to the uttermost they seemed to wish to shout but couldnt  i may as well take them out of the dirty water anyhow he muttered suiting the action to the word and spreading the fish on the thwart in front of him  liking their appearance still less in that position he put them on the thwart behind him and tried to forget them impossible  he might as well have tried to forget his own existence at last after holding out as long as possible the poor boy made up his mind to eat a little  then he thought if i could only cook them oh for only one small lump of live coal from the camp fire on  the thought was checked abruptly for he suddenly remembered that he had a burningglass in his trousers pocket  he might perhaps be able to roast them with thatin a somewhat underdone fashion no doubtstill any sort of cooking would be better than none  it need scarcely be said that the attempt failed  the only results were a burnt spot or two and a faint odour that served to intensify his hunger  at last he bit a mouthful out of the back of one of the fish chewed it viciously swallowed it in a hurry and felt very sick  the ice was broken however and he got on better than he had expected  but when hunger was appeased there came gradually upon him the far less endurable condition of thirst  he really felt as if he should choke and once or twice he dipped his balingdish over the side but restrained himself on remembering the journal of the skeleton wherein it was recorded that one of the men had gone mad after drinking salt water  towards the afternoon hope was revived in his breast by the appearance of clouds indicating rain  it came at last in a soft gentle shower far too gentle indeed for it could not be collected  what dropped upon the wooden balingdish seemed to sink into or evaporate off it the few drops that fell upon his patiently protruded tongue served only to tantalise him  but watty was not prone to give way to despair at least not to remain in that condition  he took off his jacket spread it out so as to form a basin and eagerly watched the result  alas the cloth was too soft  it acted like a sponge into which the raindrops disappeared  when it became evident that the coat was a failurerefusing even to part with a single drop when wrungwatty chanced to cast down his eyes and they naturally fell on his trousers  they were stiff canvas trousers and very greasy from much service among the dishes  instantly he had them off and spread out as the coat had been  joy inexpressiblethey held water  to convert the body of them into a lake and the legs into two watercourses was not difficult for one whose ingenuity was beyond the average  but oh the lake basin was slow to gather the precious drops  he caused the two legs to debouch into the balingdish and watched eagerly for half an hour at the end of which period about a wineglassful was collected  he sucked it in to the last drop and waited for more  it seemed as if the very sky sympathised with the boys distress for soon afterwards the rain increased then it poured and finally watty wilkins was more than satisfied he was drenched  fortunately the downpour was shortlived  it ceased suddenly the clouds broke up and the evening sun came out in full splendour enabling him to partially dry his garments  in the southern seas at that time the weather was particularly warm so that our castaway felt no inconvenience from his ducking and spent the second night in comparative comfort his dreamsif he had anybeing untroubled with visions of food or drink  once indeed he awoke and looking up recalled so vividly the fate of the man who had been cast alone and dying on the coral island that he became deeply depressed by the thought of meeting a similar fate but the text of the previous day again recurred to him  clinging to it he again fell asleep and did not wake till morning  looking over the side he saw what sent a gush of hope and joy to his heart  a ship under full sail not half a mile off  he rubbed his eyes and looked again  was he dreaming  could it be  he sprang up with a cry of delight and gave vent to a long loud cheer as much to relieve his feelings as to attract attention  it was almost too good to be true he thought  then a voice within whispered did you not ask for deliverance and the boy mentally responded yes thank god i did  while he was thinking his hands were busy refastening his jacket which he had taken down to sleep in by a sleeve to its former place at the end of an oar  but there was no occasion to signal  the vessel a barque was running straight towards him before a light breeze under full sailas baldwin burr would have said with stunsls slow and aloft  believing that he had been observed he ceased waving his flag of distress  but soon a new idea sent a thrill through his heart  no sign of recognition was made to him as the ship drew near  evidently the lookout was careless  leaping up watty seized the oar waved his flag frantically and yelled out his alarm  still the ship bore majestically down on him her huge bow bulking larger and higher as she drew near  again watty yelled loud and long and waved his flag furiously  the ship was close upon himseemed almost towering over him  he saw a sailor appear lazily at the bow with his hands in his pockets  he saw the eyes of that seaman suddenly display their whites and his hands with the ten fingers extended fly upwards  he heard a tremendous starboard haaard followed by a terrific starboard it is  then there was a crashing of rotten wood a fearful rushing of water in his ears a bursting desire to breathe and a dreadful thrusting downwards into a dark abyss  even in that moment of extremity the text of the morning flashed through his whirling brainthen all was still  when wattys mind resumed its office its owner found himself in a comfortable berth between warm blankets with a hot bottle at his feet and the taste of hot brandyandwater in his mouth  a man with a rough hairy visage was gazing earnestly into his face  wall youngster i guess said the man that youd pretty nigh slipped your cable  watty felt thankful that he had not quite slipped his cable and said so  you went over me i think he added  over you  yes i just think we did  you went down at the bowsi seed you myselfand came up at the starn  the capn he seed you come up an said you bounced out o the water like the cork of a sodawater bottle  but here he comes himself  he told me i wasnt to speak much to you  the captain who was an american with a sharpfeatured and firm but kindly countenance entered the berth at the moment  well my boy glad to see you revived  you had a narrow escape wouldnt have been so if it hadnt chanced that one of our worst men was the lookoutor rather wasnt the lookout  however youre all right now  your ship went down i expect not long since  about three or four months ago answered watty  come boy your mind hasnt got quite on the balance yet  it aint possible that you could be as fat as a young pig after bein three or four months at sea in an open boat  what was the name of your ship  the lively poll  what a scotch ship  yes part owned and commanded by captain samson  i know him met him once in glasgow  a big roughbearded hearty fellowsix foot two or thereabouts  didnt go down with his ship did he asked the captain with a look of anxiety  no replied watty with increasing interest in the american we escaped on a raft to an island off which i was blown while alone in my boat only two days ago  only two days ago boy echoed the captain starting up dyou happen to know the direction of that island  watty did not know of course having had no compass in his boat but he fortunately remembered what captain samson had said when he had ascertained the latitude and longitude of it  mr barnes shouted the captain to the first mate who stood on deck near the open skylight hows her head  sousouwest sir  put her about and lay your course west and by north  now said the captain turning again to watty with a look of satisfaction well soon rescue captain samson and his crew  im sorry i wont be able to take you all back to england because we are bound for san francisco but a trip to california is preferable to life on a coral island  now boy ive talked enough to you  the steward will bring you some dinner if you feel disposed you may get up after that  here are dry clothes for you  we ripped up your own to save time after hauling you out of the sea  it was not usual for the gentle polly samson to alarm the camp with a shriek that would have done credit to a mad cockatoo nevertheless she did commit this outrage on the feelings of her companions on the afternoon of the day on which watty was run down and rescued  her father and all the others were seated around the camp fire among the bushes at the time  polly had left them intending to pay a visit to one of her beautiful watergardens on the beach and had just emerged from the bushes and cast her eyes upon the sea when she beheld the sight that drew from her the shriek referred to  she gave it forth in an ascending scale  oh  oh  oh father come here quick quick oh  never since he was a boy had the captain jumped so sharply from a sitting posture to his legs  every man followed suit like a jackinthebox  there was a rush as if of a tempest through the bushes and next moment the whole party burst upon the scene to find pollynot as they had feared in some deadly peril butwith flashing eyes and glowing cheeks waving her arms like a windmill and shrieking with joy at a ship which was making straight for the island under full sail  the captain greeted the sight with a bass roar philosopher jack with a stentorian shout  ben trench did his best to follow jacks example simon orook uttered an irish howl threw his cap into the air and forthwith began an impromptu hornpipe in which he was joined by bob corkey  baldwin burr and his comrades vented their feelings in prolonged british cheers and mr luke uttering a squeak like a wounded rabbit went about wanting to embrace everybody but nobody would let him  in short every one went more or less mad with joy at this sudden realisation of hope long deferred  only then did they become fully aware of the depth of anxiety which had oppressed them at the thought of being left perhaps for years it might be to the end of their days on that unknown island  as the vessel approached it became apparent that there was some one on board whose temporary insanity was as demonstrative as their own so wild were his gesticulations  its too fur off said baldwin to make out the critturs phisog but if it warnt for his size id say he was a monkey  praps its an ourangoutang suggested corkey  or a gorilla said orook  oh exclaimed polly in a low eager voice of surprise i do believe it is watty wilkins  polly is right said philosopher jack id know wattys action among a thousand  as he spoke the vessel roundedto outside the reef backed her topsails and lowered a boat  at the same time the excited figure disappeared from her bow and reappeared wilder than ever in the stern of the boat  as it crossed the lagoon the voice of watty became audible and was responded to by a succession of hearty cheers in the midst of which the boat was run ashore  the excited lad sprang on the beach and was almost annihilated by the species of miscellaneous embracing that he immediately underwent  need we say that captain samson and his men were only too thankful to have such an opportunity of deliverance  they at once accepted the offer of the american captain embarked in his ship the following morning passed cape horn not long after sailed up the coast of south america and in course of time cast anchor in the renowned harbour of san francisco  at the time of which we write the excitement about the goldfields of california was at its highest pitch  men were flocking to that region from all parts of the earth  fortunes were being made by some in a few months and lost by others at the gamingtables in a few days or even hours  while a few gained a competence many gained only a bare subsistence thousands lost their health and not a few their lives  it was a strange play that men enacted there embracing all the confusion glitter rapid change of scene burlesque and comedy of a pantomime with many a dash of darkest tragedy intermingled  tents were pitched in all directions houses were hastily run up restaurants of all kinds were opened boats were turned keel up and converted into cottages while ships were stranded or lying idle at their anchors for want of crews who had made off to that mighty centre of attraction the diggings  arrived at san francisco captain samson and his crew were landed one fine morning at an early hour and went up to a modestlooking hotel without any definite idea as to what was best to be done in their peculiar circumstances  feeling a strange sensation of helplessness in the midst of so much turmoil and human energy after their quiet sojourn on the coral island they kept together like a flock of sheep and wandered about the town  then they returned to their hotel and had luncheon for which so large a sum was demanded that they resolved to return on board at once and ask the american captains advice  they found their deliverer pacing his quarterdeck with his hands in his pockets and a stern frown on his countenance  he was quite alone and the vessel wore an unusually quiet air  nothing wrong i hope said captain samson as he stepped over the gangway  everything wrong replied the american crew skedaddled  what bolted  ay every man to the diggins  what will you do asked captain samson in a sympathetic tone  sell off the ship and cargo for what theyll fetch and go to the diggins too replied the other  moreover id strongly recommend you to do the same  what say you to that advice philosopher jack asked captain samson turning to our hero with a peculiar smile  i say answered the philosopher returning the smile that the advice requires consideration  cautiously replied and what says my polly continued the captain  i say whatever you say father  ah  poll poll that sort of answer dont help one much  however well call a council of war and discuss the matter seriously but first of all lets see how the wind blows  how do you feel inclined ben trench  bein the invalid of our party so to speak youre entitled i think to speak first  i say go replied ben  and i say ditto burst from watty wilkins with powerful emphasis  you wasnt axed yet observed bob corkey  besides stowaways have no right to speak at all  what says mr luke continued the captain  dont go answered mr luke feebly  now lads said the captain after putting the question to the others well go in for the pros and cons  they went in for the pros and cons accordingly and after an animated debate resolved that the path of duty as well as that of interest and propriety lay in the direction of the diggings  having settled the matter and gathered together into a common fund the small amount of cash and property which each had saved from the wreck they went ashore purchased the articles necessary for their expedition and followed the great stream of californian golddiggers  we shall join them but let not the reader suppose that we intend to bore him or her with the statistics and details of californian golddigging  it is our purpose only to touch lightly on those salient points in the adventures of our wanderers which had a more or less direct bearing on the great issues of their lives    chapter seven  failure  there are times probably in the life of all when everything seems to go against onewhen plans and efforts turn out ill or go wrong and prospects look utterly black and hopeless  such a time fell upon philosopher jack and his friends some months after their arrival at the golddiggings  at first they were moderately successful and at that time what amazingly golden visions they did indulge  a carriage and pair soliloquised watty wilkins one evening at supper while his eyes rested complacently on the proceeds of the days laboura little heap of nuggets and golddust which lay on a sheet of paper beside him a carriage and pair a town house in london a country house near bath or tunbridge wells and a shootingbox in the scotch highlands  such is my reasonable ambition  not bad said philosopher jack if you throw in a salmon river near the shootingbox and the right to wear the bonnet plaid and kilt at pleasure  not to mention bare legs an rheumatiz remarked simon orook who was busy with the fryingpan  sure if the good queen herself was to order me to putt on such things id take off me bonnet an plaid in excuse that id be kilt entirely if she held me to it  all the same id obey her for im a loyal subject  youre a bad cook anyhow said baldwin burr to burn the bacon like that  burn it retorted orook with an air of annoyance man alive how can i help it  it hasnt fat enough to slide in much less to swim  its my belief that the pig as owned it was fed on mahoganysawdust and steel filins  there ait it an howld yer tongue  its good enough for a goolddigger anyhow  in regard to that little bit of ambition o yourn said bob corkey as the party continued their meal seems to me watty that you might go in for a carriage an four or six when youre at it  no corkey no returned the other that would be imitating the foibles of the great which i scorn  what is your particular ambition now mr luke  what will you buy when youve dug up your fortune  the cadaverous individual addressed who had become thinner and more cadaverous than ever looked up from his pewter plate and with a sickly smile replied that he would give all the gold in the mines to purchase peace of mind  this was received with a look of surprise which was followed by a burst of laughter  why you aint an escaped convict are you exclaimed baldwin burr  no im only an escaped man of business escaped from the toils and worries and confinements of city life returned mr luke with another sickly smile as he returned to his tough bacon  well mr luke if contrast brings any blessing with it said edwin jack you ought to revive here for you have splendid fresh country airby night as well as by daya fine laborious occupation with pick and shovel a healthy appetite wet feet continually mud up to the eyes and gold to your hearts content  what more can you desire  nothing replied the cadaverous man with a sigh  the state of prosperity to which jack referred did not last  their first claim though rich was soon worked out and they were obliged to seek another  this turned out to be a poor one yielding barely enough of the precious metal to enable them to pay their way every article of clothing tools and food being excessively dear at the mines  nevertheless they worked on in hope but what was termed their luck became worse and worse every day so that at last they were obliged to run into debt  this was not difficult to do for the principal storekeeper higgins by name saw that they were respectable trustworthy men and felt pretty safe in giving them supplies on credit  one bad result of the debt thus incurred was that the whole tone and spirit of the party was lowered  its too bad growled philosopher jack one evening as he strode into the tent and flung down his tools got barely enough to keep the pot boiling  better that than nothing remarked watty wilkins who was in the act of taking off his wet boots  i havent got as much dust as would gild the end of a bumbees nose  hope some of the others have been more successful  none of them have come in yet except orook who is as unlucky as myself  hes off to the store for something for supper  watty sat down before the fire which burned in front of the tent and sadly toasted his toes  ill tell you what said jack sitting down beside him i fear we were fools to come here  not so sure of that returned wilkins with a dubious shake of the head  every one you know cannot be lucky  some succeed and some dont  we are down just now thats all  the wheel of fortune is going round and something will be sure to turn up soon  nothing will turn up unless we turn it up for ourselves you may depend upon that said philosopher jack  the captain seemed to preach a different doctrine from that last sunday didnt he when he remarked that god sometimes sends prosperity and riches to those who neither ask work for nor deserve them  true watty but these he told us were exceptional cases the rule being that those who labour with body or mind acquire possessions while those who dont labour fall into poverty  the simple truth of that rule is partially veiled by the fact that thousands of laborious men labour unwisely on the one hand while on the other hand thousands of idle men live on the product of their forefathers labours besides didnt the captain also impress upon us that success is not success when it leads to evil and failure is not failure when it results in good  from all which retorted watty you bring forward strong proof that your present growling at bad luck is most unphilosophic you crossgrained philosopher  not at all returned jack  the captains principles may or may not be correct  the mere statement of them does not prove that my ill luck just now is going to result in good  but the worst of it is that during the time of our good fortune i had been hoarding up in order to be able to send money to my poor father and now it has all melted away  im sorry for you jack said watty but that is not the worst of it to my mind bad though it be  what grieves me most is that my dear friend and chum ben trench is surely losing his health under the strain of anxiety and hard work  you see he is not gifted with the guttapercha feelings and castiron frame of philosopher jack neither has he the happygolucky spirit and tough little corpus of watty wilkins so that it tells on him heavilyvery heavily  poor watty said this half jestingly yet with such a look of genuine feeling that jack forgot his own troubles for the moment  something must be done he said gazing with a concerned look at the fire  did you observe that man conway last night up at the store  yes what of him  he staked largely at the gamingtable last nightand won  little wilkins glanced quickly in his friends face  jack he said with a look and tone of earnestness quite unusual to him we must not think of that  whatever straits we are reduced to we must not gamblei repeat we must not  why not little man asked jack with an amused smile at what he considered an uncalledfor burst of seriousness  because it is dishonourable said wilkins promptly  i dont see it to be so returned jack  if i am willing to stake my money on a chance of black or red turning up and the banker is willing to take his chance why should we not do it the chances are equal both willing to win or to lose nothing dishonourable in that  or if i bet with you and you bet with me we both agree to accept the consequences having a right of course to do what we please with our own  now jack said wilkins im not going to set up for a little preacher or attempt to argue with a big philosopher but ill tell you what my father has impressed on me about this matter  one day when we were passing some ragged boys playing pitchandtoss on the street he said to me watty my boy no man should gamble because it is dishonourable  to want money that does not belong to you is greedy  to try to get it from your neighbour without working for it is mean  to risk your money in the hope of increasing it by trade or other fair means and so benefit yourself and others is right but to risk it for nothing with the certainty of impoverishing some one else if you win or injuring yourself if you lose is foolish and unfeeling  the fact that some one else is willing to bet with you only proves that you have met with one as foolish and unfeeling as yourself and the agreement of two unfeeling fools does not result in wisdom  you will hear it said my boy that a man has a right to do what he will with his own  that is not true  as far as the world at large is concerned it is indeed partially true but a man may only do what god allows with what he has lent him  he is strictly accountable to god for the spending of every penny  he is accountable also to his wife and his children in a certain degree ay and to his tradesmen if he owes them anything yes watty gambling for money is dishonourable believe me  now jack i did and i do believe him from the bottom of my heart  what jack would have replied we cannot tell for the conversation was interrupted at that moment by the abrupt appearance of captain samson he led polly by the hand  the child had an unwonted expression of sadness on her face  come into the tent  now then darling said the captain sit on my knee and tell me all about it  polly has seen something in her rambles that has made her cry he explained to jack wilkins and the rest of the party who chanced to come in while he was speaking  let us hear about it  oh it is so sad said polly whimpering  you know that good kind man jacob buckley who lives up in redmans gap with his sick brother daniel who is so fond of me well i went up to the gap this afternoon when i had done cleaning up to sit with the sick brother for a little i found him in great anxiety and very ill  he told me that jacob who had always been such a good nurse to him is much cast down by his bad luck and has taken to drink and that he has lost or spent all his money and cant get credit at the store  he went out quite drunk last night and has not returned since  of course poor daniel has had nothing to eat for he cant leave his bed without help and even if he could there isnt a morsel of food in the house  this story created much sympathy in the hearts of pollys hearers  well now messmates whats to be done in this case asked captain samson looking round  make a clection said orook  here you are said watty taking up his cap and dropping several small nuggets into it as he handed it to jack  the philosopher contributed a pretty large nugget which in his heart he had intended to stake at the gamingtable  well said he we are reduced to low enough circumstances just now but we are rich compared with poor buckley  the entire party at that time numbered only nine including polly bounce and badger the other members of the crew of the lively poll having separated soon after leaving san francisco  but as all of them were men of generous spirit wattys cap soon contained a very creditable clection which was made up forthwith into a bag and carried with some cooked provisions by polly to redmans gap under the safe escort of her father and baldwin burr  the following evening after supper philosopher jack quietly put his last bag of gold into his pocket and went off with it to higgins store on the way up he entered into a debate with himself as to the rectitude of gambling  he seemed to himself to be composed of two persons one of whom condemned while the other defended gambling  but jack had a strong will of his own  he was not to be lightly turned from a purpose either by the disputants within him or by the arguments of his friend wilkins  being a good reasoner our philosopher found that the condemner of gambling within him was rapidly getting the best of the argument he therefore brought the matter to a point by suddenly exclaiming aloud now the question is shall i do it  dont said his old brusque but faithful friend conscience with a promptitude that made him quite uncomfortable  or continued jack slowly shall i go back and wait to see whether things will turn and mend  do answered his friend at once  if jack had put more questions he would have received clear and emphatic replies but he merely said pooh and when a man says pooh to conscience he is in a very bad way indeed  at higgins store goldminers assembled to buy and sell to talk and drink and gamble  as the necessaries of life were procured there miners of all sorts from the steady to the disreputable were to be found assembled at times but it was chiefly the latter who hung about the place  no notice was taken of jack as he mingled with the crowd except by one or two acquaintances who gave him a passing nod of recognition  at the bar there was assembled a boisterous group who were laughing heartily at something  jack joined it and found a tall halftipsy man offering to bet with another  when men are smitten with the gambling spirit anything that affords a chance will serve their turn  see here now said the tall man looking round i repeat that ill bet any man ten dollarsall i have in the worldthat theres not any four of the men in this store can prevent my lifting this tumbler of water to my lips  he held out a tumbler in his right hand as he spoke and straightened his long sinewy arm  some of those present laughed but one a short thickset powerful fellow said done at once and stepped forward  well stranger said the tall man with a smile lay hold  you ought to be strong enough to prevent me by yourself but come on some more of you  three strong fellows rose and laughingly grasped the mans arm while several of the lookerson began to bet on the event  now hold fast said the tall man giving his arm a slight but vigorous shake which had the effect of causing those who held it to tighten their grip powerfully  oh youre not strong enough he added come another of you hereupon a fifth man rose and laid hold of the arm amid much laughter  at that moment a big rough miner pushed his way through the crowd and demanded to know what was up  on being told he drew a bag from his pocket and exclaimed ill bet you this bag of dust if you can match it that these five men will prevent you easily  they are strong enough to hold goliath himself if he were here  sorry that i cant match your bag stranger replied the tall man im only game for ten dollars and thats already staked  but i can match it exclaimed philosopher jack suddenly producing his bag which was much the same size as that of the big miner  now then hold fast but dont break the bone if you can help it said the tall man giving his arm another shake  the laugh with which this was received was changed into a roar of delight when the tall man passed his left arm over the heads of those who held him and with his left hand conveyed the tumbler to his lips  there was a good deal of disputation immediately as to the justice of paying up bets on what was obviously a sell but it was ruled that in this case they had been fairly lost and won so that the big miner turned his back on his bag of gold and with a deep curse left the store  never before had edwin jack felt so thoroughly ashamed of himself as when he went forward and took up the two bags of gold  he did it how ever and hurriedly quitting the store returned to his tent  there was a small portion of the tent curtained off at the farther extremity as a chamber for polly samson  jack was relieved on arriving to find that she had retired to it for the night  he was also glad to observe that all his tired companions were asleep with the exception of orook  that worthy was busy clearing up his pots and pans for the night  its late you are tonight remarked orook with a yawn  yes ive been to the store said jack hand me that candle thanks  turning his back on his comrade he opened the bag which he had won and looked in  the first thing that met his astonished gaze was the identical nugget which he had contributed the evening before to the sick miner at redmans gap  there was a name inside the bag  holding it near the candle he readbuckley  they must have been robbed he muttered to himself then rising said to orook ive taken a fancy to go up to the gap to see the buckleys dont mistake me for a thief when i return  no mistake at all if i did returned orook for youre stealin a march on us all just now an isnt it robbin yourself of your nights rest you are ah then a wilful man must have his way good luck go with ye  before the sentence and the yawn that followed it were finished jack was on his way to the gap  he found the elder buckley seated on a log by his brothers couch with his face buried in his hands  a glance showed him that the sick man was dying  jacob looked up quickly  his face was haggard from the combined effects of dissipation grief and watching  he seemed rather annoyed than pleased by jacks visit  im grieved to see daniel so ill said jack in a low voice which however roused the attention of the invalid  dying said jacob sternly though in a voice that was scarcely audible  what have you got there he added almost fiercely as he observed and at once recognised the bag in his visitors hand  your property answered jack  have you not missed it  i conclude of course that it has been stolen from you because it was gambled away by a big rough fellow at higgins store this evening  a peculiar smile flitted for a moment across the rugged face of jacob buckley as he said no he didnt steal it  not being able to leave my brother myself i sent him with it to the store to try his luck  it was my last throw contained all i had includin the dust and nuggets you and your comrades sent me last night  he said this in a hard reckless defiant manner then looked suddenly in jacks eyes and inquired with an expression of curiosity how he came by the bag  i won it god forgive me said jack a deep flush of shame overspreading his face and i now come to return what i had no right to win  a sound from the dying man attracted their attention at that moment  he wants to speak to you said jacob who had stooped down to listen  jack bent over the sick man who said in a low whisper with occasional pauses for breath for his strength was almost gone  god bless you  youve saved his life  he said if he lost that gold that hed blow out his brainsand hed have done ithe would i know jacobhed have done it  read to methe wordthe only true gold  jack looked round  jacob had sat down and again covered his face with his hands  i have not my bible with me said jack but i can repeat passages from memory  he began with the words they that trust in him shall never be put to confusion when the dying man roused himself and with a strong effort whispered o sir i do trust in him  will you try to save my brother from gambling and drink  speakpromise  i will whispered jack in his ear  the mans energy left him at once and he fell back on the pillow from which he had partially risen with a deep prolonged sigh  jacob heard it  springing up he fell on his knees by the bedside and seized his brothers hand  o dan dear dan he exclaimed passionately dont give way like that  youll get well soon an well cut this infernal place altogether well go home and work with the old folk  dan dear dan speak to me  he stopped abruptly and rose with a stony stare of hopelessness for dans spirit had returned to god who gave it  without a word jacob set to work to lay out the body and jack quietly assisted him  having finished the former put the recovered bag of gold in his pocket stuck a revolver in his belt and took up the door key of the hut  come jacob said jack purposely taking no notice of these actions youll go home and spend the night with me  dear dan wants no tending now  we will return together and see to his remains tomorrow  come  buckley looked undecided  you havent your flask have you he asked eagerly  jack felt in his pockets and with something like joy found that his flask was not there  no said he i havent got it  but come jacob you want rest  ill give you something better than spirits to drink when we reach the tent  come  the man submitted  they went out and locking the door walked quickly and silently away  many and anxious were the thoughts that chased each other through the busy brain of our hero during that dreary midnight walk  before it was ended he had almost resolved upon a plan of action which was further matured while he prepared a can of strong hot coffee for poor jacob buckley  this is how the matter stands he said to captain samson next morning during a private conversation while buckley and the others were at breakfast in the tent  i who am not a teetotaller and who last night became a gambler have pledged myself to do what i can to save jacob buckley from drink and gaming  to attempt that here would be useless well we are at our lowest ebb just now  to continue working here is equally useless  i will therefore leave you for a time take buckley and wilkins with me and go on a prospecting tour into the mountains there it will be impossible to drink or gamble time may cure buckley and perhaps we may find gold  of course he added with a sad smile if we do well return and let you know  the captain approved of this plan  jacob buckley and watty wilkins at once agreed to go and immediately after daniels burial the prospecters set out  the entire party including polly convoyed them as far as redmans gap where wishing them goodspeed they parted company  then the three adventurers passed through the gap and were soon lost in the wild recesses of the mountain range    chapter eight  success  for more than a month did the prospecting party wander among the californian mountains in quest of gold but found noneat least not in paying quantities  at first the trip was to each of them full of romance interest and hope  even buckley began to cheer up after a few days had passed  the craving for drink began to wear off and grief for his lost brother whom he had truly lovedbegan to abate  the wild scenery through which they passed was in itself sufficient to rouse to a high pitch the enthusiasm of such youths as philosopher jack and watty wilkins while their comrade though not so impressionable in regard to the sublime and beautiful was roused to sympathy by their irresistible ardour  the necessity of hunting too in order to obtain food added excitement of a more stirring kind and an occasional encounter with a grizzly bear introduced a spice of danger to which none of them objected  their various washings of the soil and examination of river beds afforded a sufficient quantity of gold to foster hope though not to pay expenses thus they progressed through many a scene of loveliness where the hand of god had sown broadcast all the forms and hues of grace and beauty which render this world attractive they also passed through many a savage defile and mountain gorgedark gloomy almost repulsivewhich served to enhance their enjoyment of the beautiful by contrast  but as the time passed by they became accustomed to the life and therefore less appreciative  they failed also to find gold in larger quantities and as the finding of gold was their highest aim they were proportionally disappointed and downcast  watty indeed kept up his spirits pretty well  he experienced the benefit of the change that had taken place in his soul that time when he was alone with god in the little boat upon the sea  he prayed in secret for light and tried to believe that all things work together for good to them that love god but his faith was weak and the old heart of unbelief was still very strong  as for philosopher jack his spirit was still engaged in rebellious warfare  he growled a good deal at his luck and was heartily seconded by buckley  in addition to this jacks spirit was much troubled by his promise to daniel buckley on his deathbed  he shrank with a strength of feeling that surprised himself from speaking to jacob about his infirmity yet he felt the duty lying strong upon him for he knew well that if nothing was said the man would certainly go back to his old habits on returning to the neighbourhood of the store where drink could be obtained  shall i break the ice at once thought jack  perhaps it would be well to wait till we know each other better  dont said the voice of his old laconic friend  but jack did wait and the longer he waited the more disinclined to speak did he become  he held strongly however that a right promise once given should never be broken and under a feeling of desperation said to himself one day would it not be much better to end this matter by speaking without further delay  do said conscience approvingly  and jack did then and there the result being that jacob buckley did not take it well but told him flatly to mind his own business  jack flushed crimson and clenched his fist then the absurdity of attempting to knock sobriety into a man struck him and he laughed as he said  well buckley that is just what i am doing for it is my business to remonstrate with a comrade when i see him give way to a habit which will result in his destruction if not abandoned  after this buckley allowed him to talk a little on the subject but jack felt the work to be very distasteful  eventually he gave it up consoling himself with the reflection that at all events he had brought the man away on an expedition where nothing stronger than cold water and hot tea was to be had for love or money  at last the tide turned  on the same day a piece of great good and bad fortune befell our explorers  it happened thus  watty wilkins roused himself from a golden dream one morning threw off his blanket looked up at the bush which served him and his comrades as a canopy and yawned  it was grey dawn  there was that clear sweet light in the sky which gives sure promise of a fine day  seeing that his companions still slept he drew from his breast a small testament read a few verses and prayed  this had been his custom ever since his deliverance by the american ship  soon after jack moved his bulky frame rolled round threw out his arms and yawned  the yawn awakened buckley who immediately followed suitsuch is the force of example  ill tell you what it is mates said the latter sitting up that twist i gave my leg yesterday troubles me a little  i shall remain in camp today and smoke  very good said jack rising and putting the kettle on the fire with a view to breakfast  watty and i will go up that valley and prospect we will expect that youll eat no more than your share of the provisions during our absence and that youll have supper ready for us when we return  the simple breakfast being disposed of and washed down with cans of hot tea the two friends shouldered their guns and set off up the gorge or narrow mountain valley near the mouth of which they had bivouacked there was a belt of wood close to their camp beyond that a small plain after crossing which they entered a dense thicket and began a toilsome march up the bed of a little mountain stream  the channel was nearly dry at the time but the boulders which were strewn about everywhere showed that it was sometimes a formidable torrent  a likely place for gold said watty with a hopeful look and tune  weve tried many such likely places replied jack with a look and tone not quite so hopeful  for several miles they advanced washing out a panful of dirt here and there and finding a little golddust as usual  midday arrived and they sat down to a cold dinner consisting of a few scraps of meat left from breakfast  little conversation was indulged in  they were too hungry for thatperhaps too much depressed by hope deferred  ill try the banks higher up said jack rising  and ill try the bed of the stream lower down just by way of opposition said watty  they separated and the latter soon found himself among the boulders where he continued to searchactively at first but more lazily as time passed by  presently he came to a wild spot where the stream was overhung by bushes  he turned over a small stone  beneath it was a hole or pocket  he stooped quickly and pulled out a nugget of gold about the size of a thimble  he stooped again and inserting his hand pulled at something that would not come  his heart gave a jump and appeared to get into his throat where it apparently remained while the blood rushed to his forehead  another pull and out came a mass of solid gold about the size of his own fist  a cheer rose to his lips but he checked it  praps theres more he said  yes the greedy little wretch said that  but there was no more in that pocket  quickly turning over several more stones he found more pockets with nuggets of various sizes in each  in a short time his specimen pouch was pretty well lined with the precious metal  meanwhile his friend jack was equally successful the chief difference between them being that the latter washed out the earth on the banks above and found his gold in little grains and specks but in such quantities that he felt as if his fortune were already made  towards evening watty hallooed and was replied to  as they walked rapidly towards the prearranged rendezvous each hit on the same ideathat of deception  well what luck asked watty with a careless air that ill concealed the elation of his heart  only a little dustnothing to speak ofat least not as compared with what some fellows get said jack whose laughing eye gave the lie direct to his melancholy tones  see here watty this is all ive got  as he spoke the hypocrite poured the glittering contents of his pouch into his tin washpan  well what a lucky fellow you are said watty with mouth expanded just look here this is all that i have got  he opened his bag and displayed the nuggets with the big one in the midst  need we say that these youths found it difficult to express their joy and astonishment  the fact was evident that they had at last discovered unusually rich ground and they travelled back to the camp to tell their lazy comrade the good news  it was near sunset when they reached the little plain or open space at the mouth of the gorge  here jack turned aside to cut a stick of peculiar form which had caught his eye on the way up and which he meant to keep as a souvenir of their discovery and the spot  watty sauntered slowly across the plain  he had just reached the wood on the other side and turned to wait for his comrade when he heard two shots in quick succession  there was nothing unusual in this but when he heard the philosopher utter a loud cry he started cocked his gun and ran a few steps back to meet him next moment jack burst from the thicket and ran across the plain at a speed that told of imminent danger  from the same thicket there also rushed a large grizzly bear whose speed was greater than that of jack though it did not appear to be so  all the blood in watty wilkinss body seemed to fly back to his heart and immediately after it rushed to his brain and toes  prompt action no time to think  life death  watty never afterwards could tell clearly what he felt or did on that tremendous occasion but jack could tell what he did for he saw him do it  going down on one knee and resting his left arm on the other in what is known to volunteers as the hythe position the little youth calmly levelled his doublebarrelled gun  it was charged only with small shot and he knew that that was useless at long range therefore he restrained himself and waited  jack and the bear ran straight towards him  up watty up a tree gasped jack its no useshot wont hurt him quick  as he spoke he darted to the nearest tree seized a large limb and swung himself up among the branches  the bear passed under him and observing the kneeling figure in front charged at once  when it was within three feet of him the youth let fly the contents of both barrels into the grizzlys mouth  so true was his aim that about six inches of the barrel followed the shot as the bear rushed upon it  this saved watty who was violently hurled aside by the stock of his own gun while the bear went headoverheels vomiting blood and rage amid smoke and dust and scattered nuggets of gold  o watty cried jack leaping down to the rescue with his drawn huntingknife  but before jack reached him or the bear had time to recover himself watty was on his active legs and sprang up a tree like a monkey  jack caught a branch of the same tree and by sheer strength swung himself up but on this occasion with so little time to spare that the bear standing on its hind legs touched his heel lovingly with its protruded lips as he drew himself out of reach  we need scarcely say it was with beating and thankful hearts that the two friends looked down from their perch of safety on the formidable and bloody foe who kept pawing at the foot of the tree and looking hungrily up at them  what a mercy that the grizzly cant climb panted watty who had not yet recovered breath  but he can watch and keep us here all night said jack and we have no means of killing him  i fell and lost my gun in escaping and yours is doubled up  were in for a night of it my boy  why didnt you do what i bade you get up into the tree with your gun when you saw us coming and then we could have shot him at our leisure  why didnt you lend me your own cool head and clear brain retorted the other and then we might have done something of the sort  but surely the shot i gave him must tell in the longrun  pooh said jack its not much more to him than an overdose of mustard would be to a cat  however weve nothing for it but to wait perhaps buckley may have heard our shots  in this conjecture jack was right  the goldminer was enjoying an unsocial cup of tea at the time and fortunately heard the distant shots and shouting  buckley was a prompt man  loading his double barrel with ball as he ran he suddenly made his appearance on the field saw at a glance how matters stood and being a good shot put two balls in the bears carcass with deadly effect  grizzly bears are however remarkably tenacious of life  this one at once turned on his new foe who getting behind a tree reloaded as quickly as possible  as the animal passed he put two more balls in its heart and killed it  splendidly done cried jack leaping to the ground and shaking buckley by the hand as he thanked him for his timely aid  almost in the same breath he told of their unexpected good fortune  now then he added well cut off the claws of this fellow as a trophy and then to camp and supper  stop a bit not so fast said wilkins who had descended the tree and was sitting on the ground with a most lugubrious countenance we must gather up my nuggets before going  besides it strikes me theres something wrong with my ankle  this was found to be too true  in scrambling into the tree watty had sprained his ankle badly and in jumping down had made it so much worse that he could not bear to put even his toe to the ground  he was compelled therefore to accept the services of jacob buckley who carried him into camp on his back  despite his sufferings poor wilkins rejoiced that night with his comrades at their good fortune and it was long before he or they could cease to talk over future plans and take needful rest  at length buckley rolled himself in his blanket and lay down  poor fellow said jack seeing watty wince a little does it hurt much  yes rather but ill be all right tomorrow  now jack im going to sleep  do me a favour before turning in  just make a pile of my nuggets close to my pillow here with the big one on the top  there thanks  what a covetous little wretch you are becoming said jack with a laugh as he lay down  have a care watty that you dont become a miser  watty made no reply but in the night when he thought his comrades were asleep he was overheard muttering in a low tone yes my dear old dad you shall have them every one big un as well at least ill send you every rap that they will fetch  not that you need it  youre rich enough as it is but this will show you perhaps that my first thoughts after my first luck were of you  a long sigh followed the remark  looking up soon afterwards jack saw that watty was sound asleep with the point of his nose reposing on the big nugget  the poor lads idea of a sprain was not quite correct  instead of being all right next day he found himself to be hopelessly lame and was unable to move from the camp for a couple of weeks  during that period jack and buckley went forth to the new diggings every morning and returned at night laden with gold so that in a short time they had gathered as much as they could conveniently carry  then they resolved to go for their comrades and return with them to continue their labours at what they named grizzly bear gulch  as watty was still unable to walk without great pain they made a sort of litter of a blanket between two poles  in this contrivance they carried him with their gold and their other belongings back to the old diggings  but here on arrival they found a wonderfully altered state of affairs  immediately after you left said captain samson over a cup of tea while polly who presided listened with sympathetic delight we bought a new claim or two without much hope however of bettering our circumstances  one of these claims we bought for you jack with part of the money you left in our charge one for buckley and another for wilkins  well these claims all turned out splendidly and weve been makin our fortunes ever since  as you were off prospecting as much for our benefit as your own we agreed that it was the least we could do to work a little for you so we gave your claims a rummage day about and thus weve made your fortunes too or part of em anyhow  weve bin sendin home bills of exchange too and knowin your wish to help your father jack i took upon me to send a small sum to him with your love i did right didnt i  right exclaimed jack seizing the captains hand and squeezing it need you ask  im only sorry i didnt dig the gold out with my own hand and enclose the bill in my own letter  how much did you send  only 1000 pounds replied the captain  come dont joke  im anxious to know because he was very hard up when i left  more shame to you for leaving him my young philosopher returned the captain but i tell you the truth i sent him 1000 pounds sterling and i believe theres as much lyin here in golddust and nuggets that belongs to you  weve all done equally well im thankful to say and better than that good fortune seems to have brought us good health even ben trench there is able to dig like the rest of us  not exactly said ben with a pleasant smile at his old friend wilkins but im very well thank god and able to do a little  i wouldnt have been what i am now but for the care of this dear little nurse  polly was quite pleased with the compliment and made a liberal offer to supply more tea to any of the company who might want it  all this and a great deal more was corroborated by every one present moreover it was told them that there were many other claims which had suddenly turned out well and that the whole aspect of these diggings had changed for the better  and what of mr luke asked jack glancing round the circle  gone said the captain nobody knows where  he became gloomier and stranger than ever after you went away and one morning announced his intention to leave us and return to san francisco  he left and has not been heard of since  bob corkey too is off  he got restless and disappointed at our bad luck said hed go away prospectin on his own hook and went  good luck go with him  he was altogether too fond of argifying said simon orook  hes not the only one remarked baldwin burr with a grin  after much consideration and consultation it was agreed that in the meantime the party should remain where they were and when their claims began to fail go off to grizzly bear gulch  this being decided jacob buckley rose saying that he was going to visit his friends at higgins store  jack followed him  when they were alone he said  now jacob dont go theres a good fellow  you saved my life i may say and that gives me a claim on you  buckley frowned but said nothing  if you get among your old mates continued jack and begin to taste youre a gone man  god has been very good to us  he has made us rich  we may live to be useful jacob  think of it  a half sarcastic smile flitted over buckleys face as he said you didnt use to be a preacher jack what makes you now so keen to save me as you call it  im not sure what it is that makes me anxious now replied jack but i know what made me anxious at first  it was your poor brother daniel that night he died when he whispered in my ear it was to make me promise to save you from drink and gambling if i could  did he exclaimed the miner vehemently as he clenched his hands  o dan dear dan did you say that at such an hour  look you jack he added turning sharply round ill not go near the store and if i am saved it is dan who has done it mind thatnot you  and buckley held to his word  for months after that he worked with the samson partyas it was styledand never once tasted a drop of anything stronger than tea  during all that time success continued but philosopher jack felt in his heart that no success in digging up gold was at all comparable to that of working with the lord in helping a brothersinner to turn from the error of his ways  as their wealth accumulated the different members of the party converted it into cash sent some of it home to the assistance of friends or relatives and the rest for safe and remunerative investment for the latter purpose they committed it to the care of mr wilkins senior who being a trusty and wellknown man of business was left to his own discretion in the selection of investments  simon orook however did not follow the example of his friends  he preferred to keep his gold in his own hands and as its bulk increased stowed it away in a small chest which for further security he buried in a hole in the tent directly under his own sleeping corner  in addition to his remittances to mr wilkins for investment edwin jack sent large sums regularly to his father for the purpose not only of getting him out of his difficulties but of enabling him to extend his farming operations  the wheel of fortune however had turned upwards with jack senior and he did not require these sums as we shall see  while things were going on thus prosperously at the other side of the world a wonderful changeintimately connected with goldtook place in the old country which materially altered the circumstances of some of those personages whose names have figured in our tale    chapter nine  treats of a catastrophe and ruin  we return once again to the cottage on the scottish border  it is not quite so lowly as it was when first introduced to our readers  although not extensively changed there is a certain air of comfort and prosperity about it which gives it much the appearance of a dirty boy who has had his face washed and a suit of new clothes put on  it has been whitewashed and partially reroofed  a trelliswork porch with creepers has been added  the garden bears marks of improvement and in one part there are four little plots of flowerbeds so conspicuously different in culture and general treatment as to suggest the idea of four different gardens  inside of mr jacks abode there are also many changes for the better  the rooms are better furnished than they used to be  several cheap oleograph copies of beautiful pictures adorn the walls and the best parlour which used to be kept in a condition of deadly propriety for state occasions only is evidently used in the course of daily life  a brandnew piano with a pretty little girl seated before it suggests advancing refinement and the expression of the childs face while she attempts the impossible task of stretching an octave indicates despair  there is another little girl seated at a table darning with all the energy of a marthalike character  she is engaged upon a pair of juvenile socks which have apparently been worn last by a carthorse  books and drawing materials and mathematical instruments on the table betoken progressive education and in short everything without and within the cottage tells as we have said of prosperity  it must not be supposed however that all this is due to philosopher jacks good fortune and liberality  when the first letter came from california telling of the safety of our hero and his friends mr jack was indeed in great material distress but there was no money in that letter  it was despatched from san francisco at the time of the arrival of the party along with letters from the other members informing their various relations of their deliverance  but if the letter had contained tons of the finest gold it could not have added a feathers weight to the joy of the old couple who like the widow of nain or the sisters of bethany had received their dear lost one direct from the lord and as it were back from the dead  then after an interval came captain samsons letter enclosing the bill for 1000 pounds and explaining why philosopher jack himself did not write with it  mr jack senior thankfully used two hundred of the amount which was quite sufficient to extricate him from all his difficulties  the balance he put into the nearest bank to be kept for the dear boy on his return  from that date god sent prosperity to the cottage on the border  flocks increased seasons were no longer bad grey mares no longer broke their legs turnips throve and in short everything went well so that instead of using the large sums of money which his son frequently sent him mr jack placed them all to dear teddies credit in the bank  in one of these letters his son mentioned that he had sent still larger sums to the care of mr wilkins senior to be invested for himself  mr jack having consulted with his faithful spouse drew his sons gifts from the local bank went to the city of blankow called on mr wilkins and desired him to invest the money in the same concern with the rest mr wilkins purchased shares with it in the blankow bank telling mr jack that he considered it one of the best and safest investments in scotland that he had invested in it all the funds sent home by his own son and his comrades and that he himself was a large shareholder  thus did mr jack senior act with all the gifts that jack junior sent him saying to mr wilkins on each occasion that though the dear boy meant him to use the money he had no occasion to do so as the lord had prospered him of late and given him enough and to spare  we reintroduce the jack family to the reader at breakfasttime not because that was the only noteworthy period of their day but because it was the time when the parents of the family were wont to talk over the daily plans  mr jack went to the door and shouted breakfast in a sonorous tone instantly the octave was abandoned and the socks were dropped  next moment there was a sound like the charge of a squadron of cavalry  it was the boys coming from the farmyard  the extreme noise of the familys entry was rendered fully apparent by the appalling calm which ensued when mr jack opened the family bible and cleared his throat to begin worship  at breakfast the noise began again but it was more subdued appetite being too strong for it  in five minutes dobbin was up to the eyes in a treaclepiece  this was a good opportunity for conversation  maggie said mr jack looking up from his plate the last bill sent us from the diggins by the dear boy makes the sum in my hands up to two thousand pounds  ill go to town today and give it to mr wilkins to invest as usual  very weel john replied mrs jack but its been runnin in my mind that its no that safe to pit a yer eggs in the same basket  maybe ye might invest it in somethin else  thats true maggie we shall see said mr jack who was at all times a man of few words  as dobbin became at the moment clamorous for more food nothing further was said on the subject  arrived in the city john jack made his way to the office of mr wilkins  he found that gentleman with an expression of unwonted resignation on his countenance  ive brought you more money to invest mr wilkins said john jack sitting down after wiping his forehead and producing a fat pocketbook i thought of doin it in the old way but my wife and i have been thinkin that perhaps it might be wise to put some of the eggs in another basket  a very sad and peculiar smile flitted for a moment across mr wilkinss face  it is plain that you have not heard of the disastrous failure he said  only last week the blankow bank suspended payment and if the reports as to its liabilities be true the result will be widespread ruin throughout the country  do you mean to say that the bank has failed asked mr jack anxiously  yes and it is feared that most of the shareholders will be ruined  i am one you know  will you be ruined mr wilkins  i fear that the first call will be more than i can meet  i trust that you are not personally involved  no thank god im not said mr jack with an increasingly anxious look  but tell me mr wilkinsfor i dont understand banking matters very wellis my sons money all gone  all returned mr wilkins sadly and all that my own son has invested as well as that of his friends  how was it sir asked mr jack in a reproachful tone that you were so confident in recommending the investment  because i thoroughly believed in the soundness of the bank and in the character of its directors  investing my own funds so largely in its stock proves how i trusted it  but i was mistaken  it is a mystery which i cannot solve  perhaps when the examination of its affairs is completed light may be thrown on the subject  i hope that no more of your relations or friends have stock in it  none that i know of except indeed my poor friend mrs niven who was my sons landlady when he was at college  ill go and inquire about her  mr jack thrust the fat pocketbook into a breast pocket and buttoned up his coat with the determined air of a man who means to keep hold of what he has got  bidding mr wilkins goodbye he walked rapidly to mrs nivens house and pulled the bell rather violently  the summons was promptly answered by peggy who ushered him into a little parlour where he was quickly joined by mrs niven  im very sorry to hear the bad news said mr jack pressing the good womans hand in sympathy  what bad news asked mrs niven in alarm  the bank you know said mr jack  its very hard and to think that youre in the same boat with my dear boy whose fortune is wrecked  a little scream stopped him for the word wrecked struck a chill to the poor womans heart  what wrecked again she cried on a bank in a boat  oh dont tell me dont tell me that hes drownded  no no cried mr jack hastening to relieve her mind while he supported her to a chair no no my dear boys all right  its the blankow bank i mean thats gone to wreck you know and all his money with it and yours too i suppose for you told me you had shares in that bank  oh as to that said mrs niven greatly relieved you may mak yer mind easy  ive got nae shares intilt noo  i selt them through mr black lang syne  hes a douce clever honest fellya relation o mine and a firstrate business man but for him id hae lost my siller nae doot  he warned me that the bank was nae a right ane and advised me to sell  mr jack thought that such a clever disinterested manofbusiness and a relation of mrs niven might be just the person to give him sound advice at this crisis he therefore obtained his address and after a long chat with the good woman who would have listened for hours to the adventures of her bonny lodger took his departure and in due time stood at the door of the dirty little office  the dirty clerk ushered the visitor into the presence of mr black whose presence was more repulsive than it used to be  he received mr jack rather gruffly and asked his business  oho an eccentric character gruff but honest thought mr jack who began by saying that he had just come from visiting his friend mrs niven  mr blacks face grew almost green at the name and his brows scowled fiercely  strange look for an honest kindly man thought mr jack but we must never judge from the outward appearance then he said aloud i went to see her about that bank failure  ha growled mr black interrupting but for that woman and that he checked himself and said but you came here on some matter of business i suppose  will you state it  a very eccentric man indeed remarkably so for a kindly honest man thought mr jack but he only said i came here to consult you about the investment of two thousand pounds  oh indeed said mr black in quite an altered tone as he rose and politely offered his visitor a chair  but continued mr jack rebuttoning his greatcoat which he had partly opened but sir i have changed my mind and bid you goodday  so saying he went out leaving mr black standing at the door in stupid amazement and his dirty clerk agonising with suppressed laughter behind his desk  mr black had been groaning and growling all the day at the thoughts of the ruin which had overtaken himthoughts which were embittered by the knowledge that he had drawn it on himself through the instrumentality of mrs niven  the climax of mr jacks visit did not tend to restore him  recovering from his amazement and observing the condition of the clerk he suddenly hurled the cashbook at him cleverly dodging it the dirty little creature bolted from the office and banged the door behind him  meanwhile mr jack cashed his last bill of exchange returned home and presented his wife with a bag of gold which she deposited in the darkest recesses of the great family chest  that bank gives no interest said john jack with a quiet chuckle as he superintended the deposit but we shall always have the interest of knowing that it is there  long afterwards mr wilkins sought to combat mr jacks objection to invest in another scotch bank  this disaster he said ought not to be called a bank failure it is a bank robbery committed by its own directors as has been clearly proved and no more touches the credit of scotch banks in general than the failure of a commercial house through the dishonesty of its principals affects the other commercial houses of the kingdom  it may be as you say sir replied john jack gravely an if it was my own money i might act on your advice  but i intend to take care of whats left of the dear boys money myself  so saying the stout farmer threw his shepherds plaid over his shoulder and went off to his cottage on the border  but we must pass from this subject  space forbids our going deeper into it or touching on the terrible consequences of dishonesty coupled with unlimited liability  fortunes were wrecked the rich and the poor the innocent and guilty the confiding and the ignorant as well as the knowing and wise fell in the general crash  many homes were desolated and many hearts were broken  may we not believe also that many hearts were purified in passing through the furnace of affliction  all is not evil that brings sorrow may be quite as true as the proverb all is not gold that glitters  some have been glad to say with the psalmist it was good for me that i was afflicted  this truth however while it might strengthen some hearts to bear did not lighten the load to be borne  the great bank failure produced heartrending and widespread distress  it also called forth deep and general sympathy  out among the mountain gorges of california the goldhunters knew nothing of all this for many a day and our adventurers continued to dig and wash and pile up the superstructure of their fortunes all ignorant of the event which had crumbled away the entire foundations  at last there came a day when these fortunate goldminers cried hold enough an unwonted crynot often uttered by human beings  standing beside the camp fire one evening while some of the party were cooking and others were arranging things inside the tent captain samson looked around him with an unusually heavy sigh  its a grand country and ill be sorry to leave it he said  troth and so will meself responded orook  it was indeed a grand country  they had lately changed the position of their tent to an elevated plateau near a huge mass of rock where a little mountain stream fell conveniently into a small basin  from this spot they could see the valley where it widened into a plain and again narrowed as it entered the gloomy defile of the mountains whose tops mingled magnificently with the clouds  you see my lads continued the captain its of no use goin on wastin our lives here diggin away like navvies when weve got more gold than we know what to do with  besides im not sure that we aint gettin into a covetous frame of mind and if we go on devotin our lives to the gettin of gold that we dont need its not unlikely that it may be taken away from us  moreover many a man has dug his grave in california and bin buried so to speak in golddust which is a fate that no sensible man ought to courta fate let me add that seems to await ben trench if he continues at this sort o thing much longer and lastly its not fair that my polly should spend her prime in acting the part of cook and mender of old clothes to a set of rough miners  for all of which reasons i vote that we now break up our partnership pack up the golddust that weve got and return home  to this speech polly samson replied promptly that nothing pleased her more than to be a cook and mender of old clothes to rough miners and that she was willing to continue in that capacity as long as her father chose  philosopher jack also declared himself willing to remain but added that he was equally willing to leave if the rest of the firm should decide to do so as he was quite content with the fortune that had been sent him  simon orook however did not at first agree to the proposal  its rich enough that i am already no doubt he said but sure theres no harm in bein richer  i may be able to kape me carriage an pair at present but why shudnt i kape me town house an country house an me carriage an four if i can  because we wont stay to keep you company answered watty wilkins and surely you wouldnt have the heart to remain here digging holes by yourself  besides my friend ben is bound to go home  the work is evidently too hard for him and hes so fond of gold that he wont give up digging  ah  watty returned ben with a sad smile you know it is not my fondness for gold that makes me dig  but i cant bear to be a burden on you and you know well enough that what i do accomplish does little more than enable me to pay my expenses  besides a little digging does me good  it occupies my mind and exercises my muscles an prevents moping  doesnt it polly  in this estimate of his case ben trench was wrong  the labour which he undertook and the exposure to damp despite the remonstrances of his companions were too much for a constitution already weakened by disease  it was plain to every oneeven to himselfthat a change was necessary  he therefore gladly agreed to the captains proposal  baldwin burr however dissented  he did not indeed object to the dissolution of the partnership of samson and company but he refused to quit the goldfields saying that he had no one in the old country whom he cared for and that he meant to settle in california  it was finally agreed that the captain philosopher jack watty wilkins ben trench simon orook and polly should return home while baldwin burr and jacob buckley should enter into a new partnership and remain at the fields  although as we have said most of our adventurers had sent their gold home in the form of bills of exchange for investment they all had goodly sums on hand in dust and nuggetsthe result of their more recent laboursfor which strong boxes were made at higginss store  simon orook in particularwho as we have said did not send home any of his goldhad made such a huge pile that several strong boxes were required to hold all his wealth  the packing of these treasurechests occupied but a short time  each man cut his name on the lid of his box inside and printed it outside and nailed and roped it tight and took every means to make it secure  then mounting their mules and travelling in company with a trader and a considerable party of miners they returned to san francisco having previously secured berths in a ship which was about to sail for england via cape horn  baldwin burr and buckley convoyed them a days journey on the way  im sorry youre goin miss polly said baldwin riding up alongside of our little heroine who ambled along on a glossy black mule  i am not sorry that were going replied polly but im sorryvery sorrythat we are leaving you behind us baldwin  youre such a dear old goose and im so fond of teaching you  i dont know how i shall be able to get on without you  yes thats it miss polly returned the bluff seaman with a look of perplexity  youre so cram full of knowledge an im sitch an empty cask that its bin quite a pleasure to let you run over into me so to speak  come baldwin dont joke said polly with a quick glance  im far from jokin miss polly returned the seaman im in downright earnest  an then to lose philosopher jack on the selfsame day  it comes hard on an old salt  the way that young man has strove to drive jogriffy an rithmetic an navigation into my head is wonderful an all in vain too  its amost broke his heartto say nothin of my own  its quite clear that ill never make a good seaman howsever its a comfort to know that ive got edication enough for a landsmanaint it miss polly  polly laughed and admitted that that was indeed a consoling reflection  while these two were conversing thus jack and jacob buckley were riding together in the rear of the party  they had been talking as if under some sort of restraint  at last jack turned to his companion with a kind straightforward look  its of no use buckley my beating about the bush longer  this is likely to be the last time that you and i shall meet on earth and i cant part without saying how anxious i am that you should persevere in the course of temperance which you have begun  thank you jack thank you said the miner heartily for the interest you take in me  i do intend to persevere  i know that jacob i know it but i want you to believe that you have no chance of success unless you first become a follower of jesus christ he is the only saviour from sin  your resolutions without him cannot succeed  i have found that out and i want you to believe it jacob  i do believe it said the miner earnestly  dear dan used to tell me thatoftenoften  dear dan  now added jack we shall have to part soon  there is another thing i want to mention  there is a bag of gold with my name on it worth some few hundred pounds more or less  i want you to accept it for i know that you have not been so successful as we have during our short  but i wont take it jack interrupted buckley  yes you will jacob from an old friend and comrade  it may tide you over a difficulty who knows  luck does not always last as the saying goes  still buckley shook his head  well then continued jack you cant help yourself for ive left the bag under your own pillow in the tent  buckleys reply was checked by a shout from captain samson  they had reached the parting pointa clump of trees on an eminence that overlooked a long stretch of undulating parklike region  here they dismounted to shake hands and say farewell  little was said at the time but moistened eyes and the long grasp of hard muscular hands told something of feelings to which the lips could give no utterance  the party could see that knoll for miles after leaving it and whenever polly reined up and looked back she saw the sturdy forms of baldwin burr and jacob buckley waving a kerchief or a hat standing side by side and gazing after them  at last they appeared like mere specks on the landscape and the knoll itself finally faded from their view  at san francisco they found their vessel the rainbow a large fullrigged ship ready for sea  embarking with their boxes of golddust they bade farewell to the golden shore where so many young and vigorous men have landed in hopeful enthusiasm to meet too often with disappointment if not with death  our friends being among the fortunate few left it with joy  the rainbow shook out her sails to a favouring breeze and sweeping out upon the great pacific was soon bowling along the western coast of south america in the direction of cape horn    chapter ten  change of scene and fortune  the fair wind that swept the good ship rainbow away from californias golden shores carried her quickly into a fresh and purer atmosphere moral as well as physical  it seemed to most if not all of the goldfinders as if their brains had been cleared of golden cobwebs they felt like convalescents from whom a low fever had suddenly departed leaving them subdued restful calm and happy  its more like a dream than a reality observed ben trench one day as he and polly sat on the after part of the vessel gazing out upon the tranquil sea  what seems like a dream asked philosopher jack coming aft at the moment with watty wilkins and sitting down beside them  our recent life in california replied ben  there was such constant bustle and toil and restless feverish activity both of mind and body and now everything is so calm and peaceful and we are so delightfully idle  i can hardly persuade myself that it is not all a dream  perhaps it is said philosopher jack  there are men you know who hold that everything is a dream that matter is a mere fancy or conception and that there is nothing real or actually in existence but mind  bah exclaimed watty with contempt what would these philosophers say if matter in the shape of a fist were to hit them on their ridiculous noses  theyd say that they only imagined a fist and fancied a blow i suppose returned jack  and would they say that the pain and the blood were imagination also  i suppose they would  but what if i were to come on them slily behind and hit them on their pates before they had a chance to see or to exert their terribly real and powerful minds demanded watty  you must ask one of themselves watty for i dont know much about their views indeed im not sure that i have represented them correctly though its very likely i have for there is no species of nonsense under the sun that men have not been found to hold and defend with more or less vigour  would you not call that a proof of the creators intention that man should exercise the investigative powers of his mind asked ben  i would call it a proof of mans depravity said wilkins  what does polly think asked jack with an amused look at the child whose fair brow wore an anxious little frown as she tried to understand  i think its a proof of both replied polly with a blush and a laugh we have got the power to think and speak and reason and we are sometimes very naughty  well said polly we must call you the philosopher in future cried watty  but jack he added with a perplexed air it seems to me that we live in such a world of confusion both as to the limited amount of our knowledge and the extent of our differences of opinion while presumptuous incapacity attempts to teach us on the one hand and designing iniquity or pure prejudice seeks to mislead us on the other and misconception of ones meaning and motives all round makes such a muddle of the whole thatthatit seems to me the search after truth is almost hopeless at least to ordinary minds  i admit it to be a great difficulty replied jack but it is by no means hopeless  we must not forget that the world is well supplied with extraordinary minds to keep the ordinary minds right  true but when the extraordinary minds differ what are the poor ordinary ones to do asked watty  use their brains watty use their brains said captain samson who had come aft and been listening to the conversation  your brains whether good or bad were given to be used not to be sold  the power to reason is a gift that is not bestowed only on extraordinary minds the unlearned are sometimes better reasoners than the learned though of course they havent got so many tools to work with  still they are sufficiently furnished with all thats needful to run the race that is set before them  god has given to every mancivilised and savagea brain to think with a heart to feel with a frame to work with a conscience to guide him and a world with all its wonderful stores in which to do what he will  consciencewhich i think is well named the voice of god in mantells him to do right and forbids him to do wrong his heart glows with a certain degree of pleasure when he does well and sinks more or less when he does ill his reason tells him more or less correctly what is right and what is wrong  the word of god is the great chart given to enlighten our understandings and guide us heavenward  as my reason tells me to go to my charts for safe direction at sea so every mans reason will tell him to go to gods revealed word when he believes he has got it  there he will find that jesus christ is the centre of the word the sum and substance of it that he cannot believe in or accept the saviour except by the power of the holy spirit  he will also find the blessed truth that god has promised the spirit to those who simply ask for him  there is no difficulty in all this  the great and numberless difficulties by which we are undoubtedly surrounded are difficulties of detail which we may be more or less successful in solving according to our powers of mind coupled with our submission to the revealed will of god  to some extent we fail and get into trouble because we lazily or carelessly let other men think for us instead of making use of other mens thoughts to help us to think for ourselves  depend upon it watty we wont be able to justify ourselves at the judgment day by saying that things were too deep for us that things seemed to be in such a muddle that it was of no use trying to clear em up  why what would you say of the mainspring of a watch if it were suddenly to exclaim ill give up trying  here am iso powerful and energetic and so well able to spin round checked and hindered and harassed by wheels and pinions and levers some going this way and some going that way all at sixes and sevens and all for no good end that i can see buried as i am in this dark hole and scarcely allowed to move at all  would it be right or reasonable to charge the watchmaker with having made the watch in vain or made it wrong  of this i at least am convinced that god is perfect and that all things are working towards a good end gods sovereignty our mysterious freewill and personal responsibility being among these all things  while captain samson was discoursing on these important subjects the lookout on the forecastle reported a sail on the weatherbow  shes a whaler i do believe and her boats are after a sperm whale said simon orook who stood by the mizzen shrouds looking intently at her through his double glass  simon being now a rich man had not only taken a cabin passage but had bought for himself one of the best binocular telescopes to be had in san francisco  it was soon seen that orook was right for the whale rose to blow and swam towards the rainbow while the boats of the whaler immediately followed in pursuit  great was the excitement on board the rainbow as the men clustered on the forecastle or ran up the rigging to watch the chase while the officers and passengers got out their telescopes  come here polly cried jack look through my glass  its a rare chance youve got of seeing what men have to go through in order to send oil to market  polly at once accepted the invitation  jack assisted her to mount on the top of the capstan and arranged the glass  there she blows shouted one of the men who had been an old whaler there she breaches  as he spoke the whale rose about three miles to windward of them not far from the boat that led the chase  the men in the boat were seen to bend to their oars as captain samson said with a will  another moment and the harpooneer stood up in the bow  the spectators were too far off to see the weapon used but they could perceive the mans action and there was no possibility of mistake as to the result when the tail of the enormous creature was suddenly flourished in the air and came down on the sea like a clap of distant thunder  oh oh shrieked the horrified polly the boat is gone  but the boat was not gone  it had been quickly backed out of danger when the harpoon was thrown and reappeared when the cataract of spray sent up had dispersed  hes pouring water on the rope now said jack in a low excited voice to prevent its catching fire as it runs out  theyre fast to the fish  yes i see exclaimed polly squeezing her right eye against the glass and shutting the other with her hand  but in a few minutes there was no need for telescopes as the whale came straight towards the rainbow dragging the boat after it while the other boats followed as fast as the men could pull  the whaleship steered in the same direction but there was scarcely wind enough to fill her topsails  suddenly the leviathan came to the surface for breath not far off and sent up a grand spout of water on the rainbows starboard bows  the boat pulled quickly up and another harpoon was sent deep into the whales side  it dived immediately and turning at an angle darted off in an other direction  this time the excited onlookers could hear the cheer given by the whalers as the second iron was fixed and replied to it with enthusiasm  soon the boat was carried far away and the telescopes became again necessary but ere long the fish turned and once more made for the ship  it could not have been more than five hundred yards distant when it came to the surface for the third time and the harpooneer was distinctly seen to drive a lance deep into its side from which fountains of blood flowed  he had struck its life as whalemen express it and the whale soon went into its dying struggles in the course of which it hit the boat stove in its side and overturned it  there was a cry of consternation on board the rainbow at this instantly the order was given to lower the boats  philosopher jack and orook sprang to obey by an irresistible impulse as if they had been part of the ships crew  in a few seconds two boats were rowing at full speed to the rescue while the boats belonging to the whaleshipstill far distantmade for the scene of disaster  ere long the rescue party had the great satisfaction of picking up the wrecked whalers and found that not a man among them had received greater injury than a bruise or two and a ducking  their boat however was completely destroyed  they were therefore taken on board the rainbow while the whalers boats came up and secured their prize  that night while the stars twinkled at their own reflections in the sleeping sea the crew of the whaleship had a gam on board the rainbow  a gam good reader may be described as a small teaparty on the sea  but it differs in many respects from such gatherings on shore inasmuch as the revellers are not a few friends male and female but are usually absolute strangers to each other and of the male sex only but the circumstances of their meetingon the lone ocean far from home and friendshave a marvellous effect in opening up the fountains of the human heart  the men and officers fraternised at once  the whalers were chiefly american the rainbowers principally english with a slight mixture of irish and scotch  they all spoke the same language that was enough  soon after the arrival of their guests powerful friendships were formed  while tea or rather supper was being discussed these were cemented and when pipes were lit confidences of the most touching nature were interchanged  anecdotes and stories naturally followed the confidences broke up the separate parties and drew the company more together  the union was finally and effectually concentrated by one of the whalers crew making a demand for a song  come orook cried one of the rainbow men lets have the poor little pig wi the purple nose  orook began at once and sang with such fervour and pathos that his auditors became quite uproarious in their admiration  but when the irishman called on the whalers for a ditty a finelooking youth sang a song of the homeward bound in a voice so sweet and true that the spirit of the men was changed and many a moistened eye told that deep chords of sympathy had been touched  can you play the fiddle asked one of the men of orook when the song was finished  sure its myself can do that same he replied with a modest air which drew forth a peal of laughter  when the fiddle was produced and orook struck up reels and strathspeys and hornpipes with a precision of touch and time and perfection of tune that was far above the average of amateurs the joy of the party could no longer find vent through eye and mouth  they were forced to open the safetyvalves of heel and toe for this purpose the quarterdeck was cleared and flags were festooned round it the officers joined and polly samson was placed on the capstan like the presiding angel of the scene  ah reader if you have not been for many months on the ocean or in the lone wilderness without seeing a new face or hearing a sweet sound or feeling the power of female influence you cannot fully appreciate what we describe  there was no drink save coffee and tea at that feast  the rainbow was a temperance ship  but the men required no spirits  each one had more than sufficient within himself  the presence of polly too had a powerful effect  every man there saw his own particular polly or susan or nancy in her pretty laughing face and sparkling eyes  your men are powerful fellows said the captain of the rainbow to the captain of the whaler ive no doubt theyll be quite game for work tomorrow though they should keep it up all night  they certainly would replied the latter if called on to do duty but they wont be required to work tomorrow for we keep the sabbath on board of our ship as a duty we owe to god and we find that we are great gainers in health and strength while we are no losers of fish by doing so  ha the great captain scoresby tried that before you and said that he found keeping the sabbath to be good both for body and soul said the captain of the rainbow  i know he did replied the other and i am trying to follow in scoresbys wake  it was pretty late in the evening before the whalers could tear themselves away and when at last they did so they expressed a unanimous opinion that it had been the most successful gam they had ever had in their lives  not long after parting company from the whaleship the rainbow sailed into the cold and variable regions south of cape horn  here they experienced what the men styled very dirty weather  the skies were seldom blue and the decks were never dry while it became necessary to keep the stove burning constantly in the cabin and the berthports almost always shut  the effect of all this on poor ben trench was to injure his health severely  his cough increased and it soon became evident that his complaint which at first had only threatened to grow worse had now become chronic and serious  watty he said one day while his friend sat beside his cot reading to him its of no use shutting ones eyes to facts  i fear that i am now hopelessly ill and that i shall never see father or mother or susan again in this world  o ben dont speak like that said watty laying down the book and gently taking his friends thin hand in both of his  you mustnt do it  it will only make you worse  when we get out of this horrible region into the trade winds and the sunshine near the line youll be a new man  come now cheer up ben and dont let your good little nurse see you with such a sad face  pollys step was heard at the moment  she entered with a bowl of soup  here ben this will do you good she said handing him the bowl the cook says its the stuff to stick to your ribs  there now i cant stop to give it you for father wants me but youre all right when wattys by  are you better  well not much replied ben with a smile but im always the better of seeing your little face  dont be long of returning poll  when she had left ben drank the soup and then lay down with a sigh  it may be that the warm latitudes will do me good watty he said but i dont feel as if they would  still im resigned to gods will though it seems sad to die so young and just when ive come to know my dear redeemer and might perhaps have done some little work for him it seems so strange to be saved and not allowed time to do anything  you have done something returned his friend with an earnest look if i have really turned to jesus at all it has been through your influence ben and im sure that jack would say the same of himself and if he and i are spared to do any good work for our lord it will be all owing to you  not to me watty not to me rejoined ben with a glad look but if gods holy spirit has used me as an instrument in this i shall have cause to praise him for it throughout eternity  oh is it not strange that in a region where there is so little godliness and while we were in the eager pursuit of gold our eyes should have been opened to see and appreciate the true gold  but now watty he added in a lower tone i want to ask you to do me a favour  i want you to go yourself to our house without delay and break it to mother  he paused  watty laid his face in the bedclothes and wept silently  they are very fond of you continued ben and i should not like them to hear of it from any one but you  be very tender to susan watty poor susan she will need comfort and you know how to direct her  for some time ben trench continued talking and then fell into a quiet slumber in which his friend left him while polly watched by his side  the warm latitudes did no good to the invalid  on the contrary he suffered much from the heat and became visibly weaker  at last the shores of old england drew nigh  a few days more and they should sight land  they sought to cheer him with this but there was no answering sparkle in bens eyes  yes he said faintly i shall see them all again but not here  ben was dying when the rainbow approached the british channel  the whole of the previous day a stiff gale had blown and this had not much abated when night drew on  liverpool was their port and the captain carried on full sailmore than the good ship could well bear  it is not known whether he felt so sure of his course that he did not think it necessary to shorten sail on nearing the lands end or that he was anxious at all hazards to reach port before ben trench should die but he held on recklessly and in the dead of night ran the rainbow straight against the high cliffs not far from the cornish town of saint just  the wreck of the ship was complete in a few seconds  all her masts went over the side and the waves overwhelmed her  she would have gone down in deep water if she had not been dashed between two rocks and held there  time was thus given for one of the boats to be got out but utter confusion reigned for the captain had disappeared  no wonder that several of the men leaped into her crying every man for himself and endeavoured to cast off  have you got polly cried jack as he dimly saw a figure staggering through the turmoil of wind and whirling spray  all safe gasped captain samson  jack instantly jumped into the boat and found orook struggling to prevent one of the men from cutting the hawser  jack knocked the man down and hauling the boat close alongside shouted jump captain jump  the captain did so at the right moment and alighted safely though with great violence  just then watty wilkins was seen striving to lift ben trench over the bulwark of the ship  it was impossible to render him assistance though jack tried to do so for at the moment a towering billow fell on the deck and tore the invalid from his grasp with a shriek of despair watty fell back into the sea but was caught by one of the men and hauled into the boat which was then cut adrift  it was not a moment too soon for the next wave dashed their ship to pieces  as it was impossible to effect a landing among perpendicular cliffs which were lashed by roaring breakers they were obliged to push out to sea where they rowed till daylight and succeeded in reaching penzance harbour  leaving the others to report the news jack and wilkins started off along the coast to the scene of the wreck  they found the spot but not a vestige was to be seen of what had so long been their home save a few broken spars here and there far down in the clefts of inaccessible rocks  a fisherman however told them that several bodies had been thrown into a little bay and were then lying in a shed near the spot hastening thither they found five lying side by side  among them were those of poor ben trench and the captain of the shipthe one strong stalwart and still ruddy in the face the other attenuated and ghastly as might have been expected of one who had as it were died a double death  we will not dwell on the terrible scene  while jack and captain samson remained to attend to the dead wilkins set off without delay to be first if possible in breaking the sad news to his friends family according to promise  in regard to the wreck it is sufficient to say that she with all her precious freight was scattered on the rugged coasts of cornwall and our adventurers stood once more on their native shores without even the means of paying their travelling expenses home  they did not like to speak of their invested wealth fearing that their statements might be disbelieved  they therefore stood literally in the position of beggars  in this extremity they found the hospitable men of cornwall to be friends indeed and full of sympathy    chapter eleven  return of the wanderer  great was the anxiety of edwin jack as he walked with light foot and fluttering heart over the border hills and drew near to the old home he had not heard from his father for nearly a year  were they all well had they struggled out of their difficulties with the funds he had sent them  was there no empty chair  such and similar thoughts hurried through his mind as he went along until he was forced to run for relief  there was a rocky ridge of land in front of him  from the top of this he knew the cottage could be seen  panting with exertion when he gained the top he sat down on a mass of rock and gazed at the old place till tears disturbed his vision  there it stood as of yoreno change in the general aspect of things though there did seem one or two improvements about the cottage  but he did not gaze long  starting up again he hurried on  at last he stood in the midst of the old homecircleall well and thank god not one absent  philosopher though he was he could not reason down the tears of joy that blinded and the lump in his throat that wellnigh choked him after the first wild miscellaneous embrace all round was over jack or teddie as the homecircle called him found relief by catching up dobbin and burying his face in his neck and curls regardless of the treacle with which that gentleman was plentifully besmeared  ive got bad news for you teddie my boy said his father after they had moderated a little  nobody ill ordead asked jack with a look of anxiety  no nobody  then im prepared for any other kind of bad news said our philosopher with a quiet smile  the blankow bank said his father laying a hand impressively on his shoulder has failed and every penny of your gold is gone  the family had become very grave  jack looked from one to the other with a bewildered air  you are jesting father  no my boy i would that it were not true  the distress that is abroad in the land because of this calamity is very great  not only is all your fortune gone ted but anything that you may have brought home with you will be taken to pay the creditors of the bank and they require so much money that it would ruin you though you had thousands upon thousands of pounds  a strange smile flitted across the youths face as he replied  what i brought home with me wont benefit them much for it lies with the wreck of the rainbow at the bottom of the sea  this was indeed a surprise to the old couple who now learned for the first time that the wrecked ship about which a rumour had just reached them was that in which their son had come home  but father continued jack with a look of deepening anxiety if this be as you say then my comrades must also be ruined for their gold was all invested by mr wilkins in the same bank  all ruined replied the old man in a sad tone  mr wilkins himself is bankruptthe first call brought him and many others down  and yourself father i hope you had no shares in it  none my boy thank god  prosperity has attended me ever since i got the first money you sent home  that saved me teddie  a gleam of joy overspread philosopher jacks countenance as he started to his feet  then am i well and undeservedly rewarded daddy he exclaimed but all this news is pretty tough  i must go out to tackle it  ill be back in a few minutes  he sprang through the cottage door and sped away over the moor like a greyhound  reaching the top of a rising groundfrom which he could see a boundless stretch of borderland with the sea in the far distance and the sun setting in a flood of golden lighthe drew himself up and pushing back the hair from his temples with both hands stood gazing wistfully into the radiant glory  so like a dreamso like a dream he murmured  it was god who gave surely it is he who has taken away  can there be anything but good in all this  his hands dropped to his side as he spoke and he sauntered slowly down the slope on which he stood  entering a small plantation of firtrees at the foot of it he disappeared  when he returned to the cottage all trace of strong feeling was gone we wont talk of the bank tonight he said lets be jolly and jolly he was accordingly  not only so but he made dobbin jolly too by supplying him with such a number of treaclepieces that the child could hardly gasp his refusal of the last slice offered and was made sticky from the ends of his filthy fingers to the crown of his curly head  it is not necessary nor would it be pleasant to describe minutely the effect of the bad news on the other members of our golddigging party captain samson and watty wilkins took it well but polly and simon orook could not easily reconcile themselves to their fate  the former it is true sorrowed not for herself but for her father  orook however was more selfish and came down very heavily on what he called his luck  sure its a misfortunate pig ive been iver since i left owld ireland he remarked to his pipe one day after dinner being alone with that implement at the time an no sooner does the first stroke of good luck befall me an me fortunes made intirely than whoop down goes the whole consarn to the bottom of the say  its well howsever that ye didnt go down yerself along with it simon  yeve raison to be thankful for that anyhow  if orooks pipe did not offer him a comforting reply it appeared to console him with its fumes for after a pause during which the smoke played voluminously about his nose he wrinkled his visage into a smile of good humour  now simon he said rising and putting the black little implement in his pocket youre in a fit state to go an comfort the widdy  saying which he went out of the cheap refreshment room in which he had dined and betook himself to the principal street of the city whose name we have already declined to mention  to explain his remark we may state here that after the most diligent inquiry without success the irishman had by the merest chance discovered the widow of david banin this very city to which he had accompanied philosopher jack and captain samson after clearly ascertaining that every vestige of the wreck of the rainbow had disappeared and that all his gold was irrevocably gone  walking along the principal street one day he had been attracted by a temperance eatinghouse named the holly tree  entering it for the purpose of as he said revictualling the ship he was rooted to the spot by hearing a customer call out another cup of coffee please mrs bancroft while at the same moment an assistant at the counter addressed the comely woman who replied yes sir by the name of lucy  could proof be more conclusive  upon inquiry lucy turned out in very truth to be the widow of david bancroft and the lock of hair corresponded of course orook revealed to her the sad circumstances connected with her husbands end  to say that mrs bancroft was overwhelmed with grief would not be true  she had long mourned him as dead and although the information corroborated as it afterwards was by edwin jack and captain samson did reopen the old wound to some extent she nevertheless bore it heroically and took simon orooks comforting observations in good part  but we must not anticipate  let us return to watty wilkins  having broken the news of ben trenchs death to the bailie and his familyand a terrible duty he found it to bewatty went straight to his fathers house  we drop the curtain on the meeting  the joy of the elder wilkins can only be fully understood by those who can say of an only son he was lost and is found  now watty dear boy said mr wilkins when they came to talk of ordinary matters god has mingled mercy with my sorrows  my business has indeed been ruined and i have passed through the bankruptcy court but i am by no means so unfortunate as hundreds of people who have been reduced to absolute poverty by this crash  you remember my brother jamesuncle jimmy well he has got a flourishing business in the west indies  for some years past he had been meditating the establishment of an agency in connection with it in this city  the moment he heard of my failure he offered to make me his agent here with a good salary  of course i was only too glad and thankful to accept the offer and after my affairs were wound up entered upon the office  so now you see here i am through gods goodness still inhabiting the old house which i now rent from the person who purchased it  of course i can no longer keep a carriage and it will cost me some calculation and economy to make the two ends meet but these are small matters  oh father im so glad and thankful said watty with sparkling eyes  but continued mr wilkins with a look of profound gravity at present i happen to be troubled with a great difficulty  whats that asked his little son with a ready sympathy that was natural to him and which his recent experiences had rendered much more powerful  i find the nature of my duties too much for me replied mr wilkins with a peculiar smile and it is almost impossible that i can get along without a clever honest intelligent clerk or shall we say secretarya character that is not easily found in these degenerate days  can you recommend one watty  o yes cried the youth springing up and seizing his fathers hand in both of his you mean me  dont you now  you cant get on without me  watty felt inclined to dance a hornpipe but he sat down instead and covering his face with his hands burst into tears of joy  being a tenderhearted man mr wilkins could not help joining him but in a moderate degree  we will leave them thus engaged merely remarking that if the act was a weakness it nevertheless seemed to do them a world of good  after a considerable time had elapsed philosopher jack left the border cottage one day went up to town and presented himself at his old lodgings to mrs niven  that ladys feelings under the influence of surprise had a tendency as we have shown to lay her flat on the floor  but the faithful peggy had come to understand her tendencies and was usually too much for her  when her old lodger made his appearance in her parlour mrs niven exhibited symptoms which caused peggy to glide swiftly forward and receive her in her arms whence she was transferred to an easychair  recovering she gave jack what in the circumstances was a hearty welcome  losh me laddie yell be the death o me  i hope not mrs niven said jack laughing as he shook her hand heartily and sat down for my own sake as well as yours because i have come to take my old room if it is vacant  yer auld room maister jack exclaimed the bewildered woman  yes if it is not already occupied  the yin wi the reeky lum and the view o chimbleypots frae the wundy  the same  i hope i can have it for im going to college again and ive an affection for the old place despite the smoky chimney and the cans on the cats parade  yer jokin maister jack  indeed i am not mrs niven  they telt me ye was in callyforny an had made eer fortin there by howkin gold  well they told the truth my good woman but i happened to invest all in blankow bank shares and  wow wow exclaimed mrs niven whimpering for she understood full well the meaning of that an eeve been ruined  oh dear  weel weel ay ay an its come to that  jist like my kind freen maister black  losh me man she added in a sudden burst of indignation what for disna the government order a penny subscription ower the hail kingdom to git the puir guiltless shareholders oot o their diffeeculties  philosopher jack declined to enter upon so subtle a question but after finding that his old room was vacant retook it and then went out to the region of the docks to pay a visit to captain samson  he found that old salt in possession of his old lodging but it was wonderfully changed and perhaps not for the better  polly was there however and her presence would have made any place charming  sit down  there is an empty keg to offer a friend said the captain looking round the almost empty room  you see theyve cleared me out had to sell everything amost  this was true  the marine stores coils of rope kegs charts telescopes loglines sextants foreign shells model ships chinese idolsall were gone excepting a table a chair a childs crib in a corner and the hammock which latter looked more like an overwhelmingly heavy cloud than ever as it hung over the clean but desolate scene  but were going to have such a nice tea said polly and you shall stay and have some  she bustled about the fire but it had so little heart that even her coaxing nearly failed to make it burn  jack offered to assist  take care said polly with some anxiety if you cough or sneeze youll put it out  but i promise neither to cough nor sneeze said jack  under their united efforts the fire blazed and tea with buttered toast ere long smoked on the board  pollys going to london said the captain suddenlyalmost fiercely  yes said polly hastening to explain you see my aunt maria has been so good as to offer to take me to live with her and put me to school  ha said the captain almost blowing the buttered toast out of his mouth with contempt and aunt maria says shell make a lady of polly think o that jack make a lady out of an angel  the captain was so tickled with the idea that he went off into a roar of sarcastic laughter  ill tell ee what it is jack he continued on recovering i shouldnt wonder it in the course of a few months residence with her polly was to make a lady out of aunt mariasupposin that to be possible  oh father remonstrated polly  come cried the captain savagely give us a norwesterthats it anotherthank ee  the fact is im goin in for norwesters durin the next fortnightgoin to have it blow a regular hurricane of em  philosopher jack hoped if at all allowable that he might be permitted to come under the influence of the gale and then asked why polly was leaving her father  shes not leavin me bless you said the captain its me thats leavin her  the fact is ive got a ship  whats left of me is not over young but its uncommon tough so i mean to use it up as long as it lasts for polly  im off to the east indies in two or three weeks if it hadnt been for this aunt maria i shouldnt have known what to do for polly so ive no call to abuse the stupid old thing  a lady indeedha  you might have been quite sure that my fathers house would have been open to polly said jack quite warmly or mr wilkinss for the matter of that  i know it lad i know it returned the captain slapping his friend on the shoulder but after all this aunt mariathis ladylike individualis the most natural protector  but now tell me what of orook  i know nothing of him  havent seen him for several days  when i last met him he seemed to be much depressed poor fellow  i dont wonder considering the fortune he has lost  however wilkinss father is sure to do the best he can for him  he feels so deeply having led him and the rest of us into thisthough it was no fault of his and he went in and suffered along with us  i couldnt understand however what orook meant by some wild remarks he made the other day about taking to the temperance line and going in for coffee and mutton chops up a hollytree  i hope it hasnt unseated his reason poor fellow  while the trio were thus discussing orook over a cup of tea that bold irishman was busily engaged comforting the widdy over a cup of coffee in mrs bancrofts private parlour  it is only just to orook to say that he originally sought the widow from a simple desire to tell her of her husbands sad end which as we have seen had made a deep impression on his sympathetic heart  when however he found that the widow was young cheery and goodlooking his sympathy was naturally increased and the feeling was not unnaturally intensified when he found her engaged in the management of so excellent an institution as the holly tree public house without drink  at first orook confined his visits to pure sympathy then when he had allowed a raisonable time to elapse he made somewhat warmer approaches and finally laid siege to the widows heart  but the widow was obdurate  why wont ye have me now asked the poor man one evening with a perplexed look sure its not badlookin i am though ive no occasion to boast of gud looks neither  no its not your looks said mrs bancroft with a laugh as she raised her eyes from her knitting and looked at her sister flo who sat opposite also knitting and who took a smiling but comparatively indifferent view of the matter  then it must be because im not owld enough  sure if ye wait a year or two ill be as owld as yourself every bit said orook  no its not that either said the widow  ah then it cant be because im poor persisted orook for with this good business you dont want money an im great at cookin besides havin the willin hands that can turn to amost anything  if yed seen me diggin for goold bad luck to it yed belaive what i tell ye  ah he added with a sigh its a rich man id have been this day if that ship had only kep afloat a few hours longer  well well i neednt grumble when me own comrades that thought it so safe in the blankow bank are about as badly off as me  when was it they began to suspec the bank was shaky  oh long ago said mrs bancroft soon after the disappearance of mr luke the cashier  mr who demanded orook with a start  mr luke  did you know him  ive heard of such a man replied orook with assumed carelessness what about him  well it was supposed that he was goin deranged poor fellow and at last he suddenly disappeared no one could tell why but its clear enough now for he was made to put the accounts all wrong and i suppose the struggle in his mind drove him to suicide for he was a long thin weakly sort of man without much brains except for figures  hereupon orook told the widow all he knew about the strange passenger of that name with whom he had sailed to the southern seas and worked at the gold fields  the conclusion which they came to was that the golddigging passenger was the absconded cashier  having settled this orook renewed the siege on the widows heart but without success though she did not cast him off altogether  the poor man however lost patience and finally giving it up in despair went off to sea  ive been too hard on him remarked the widow sadly to her sister flo after he was gone  you have was flos comforting reply as she rose to serve a clamorous customer of the holly tree  philosopher jack from that time forth devoted himself heartily to study and gradually ceased to think of the golden dreams which had for so long a time beset him by night and by day  he had now found the gold which cannot perish and while he studied medicine and surgery to enable him to cure the bodies of men he devoted much of his time to the study of the book which would enable him to cure their souls  the captain came and went across the seas in the course of his rough calling and he never came without a heart full of love and hands full of foreign nicknacks which he conveyed to polly in london and never went away without a rousing norwester  watty and his father worked on together in vigorous contentment and many a visit did the former pay to bailie trench attracted by the strong resemblance in susan to the bosom friend who had reached the better land before him  thus time rolled quietly on until an event occurred which modified the career of more than one of those whose fortunes we have followed so long    chapter twelve  conclusion of the whole matter  if it be true that there is many a slip twixt the cup and the lip which we have no reason to doubtit is not less true that many a cup of good fortune is unexpectedly and unsought raised to the lips of thankless man  captain samson was seated one fine summer evening in his shoregoing cabin that used to be the abode of fishy smells marinestores polly and bliss but which now presented an unfurnished and desolate aspect he had just returned from a voyage  little kickshaws for polly lay on the table before him and a small fire burned in the grate with a huge kettle thereon  a stormy sigh escaped the captain as he glanced round the old room  come come samson he exclaimed apostrophising himself this will never do  you mustnt give way to the blues  its true you havent got as much to leave to polly when you slip your cable as you once had but you have scraped together a little these few years past and theres lots of work in you yet old boy  besides its his way of ordering events and that way must be right whatever it appears to me  why samson for all your preaching to others your own faith isnt as big as a grain of mustard seed  ah  polly youre a woman now amostand a beauty ill be bound  i wish youd come though  youre not up to time young ooman  its as well youve got one or two faults just to keep you in sympathy with other mortals  ah here you come  he hastened to answer a double knock at the door and checked himself not a moment too soon from giving a warm embrace to the postman  under a strong impulse to knock the man down he took a letter from him flung it on the table and shut the door  after pacing the room for some time impatiently he sat down opened the letter and read it aloud  it ran thus    sirhaving been for some years past engaged in diving operations at   the wreck of the rainbowlost off the coast of cornwall in 18   hundred and something i write to say that i have recovered a large   chest of gold with your name on the inside of it and that of a man   named simon orook  most of the gold recovered from the rainbow has   been scattered about but in all cases when ownership could be proved   i have handed over the property  if you can give such an account of   the contents of the chest referred to as shall satisfy me that it is   yours the part of its contents which belongs to you shall be   restored    i would feel obliged if you could give me any clew to the whereabouts   of orooki am etcetera  the whereabouts of orook cried the captain starting up and gazing at the letter why hes my own first mate an close alongside at this good hour  true for ye cried a man outside the window as he flattened his nose against the glass an is it polite to kape yer own first mate rappin the skin off his knuckles at the door  the captain at once let in his follower and showed him the letter  his surprise may be better imagined than described  but dee think its true capn  i havent a doubt of it but we can settle that tomorrow by a visit to the writer of the letter  thats true said orook which o the boxes now that belonged to us dee think it is  it can only be one replied the captain that box of mine in which you asked me to stuff the remnant of the golddust that you hadnt room for in your own boxes  it was the strongest box o the lot which accounts for its not breakin up like the others  it must be that  i rowled it up in an owld leather coat bought from an injin the day before we left the diggins  its but a small remainder o me fortunea thousand pounds more or lessbut sure its found money an comes handy this good day which reminds me ive got some noose for ee  what dee think capn continued orook with a very conscious look  how can i think if ye dont give me somethin to think about  the widdys tuk me after all said orook  what widow bancroft  orook nodded impressively  moreover he said shes tuk me as a poor beggar with nothin but his pay for better and for worse an sure now its better ill be than she tuk me for  the captain was interrupted in his congratulations of the mate by another knock at the door  he opened it and next moment was seized round the neck by a tall graceful beautiful exquisiteoh reader you know who we mean  why didnt you come up to time old girl demanded the captain while orook looked on in admiration  oh father gasped polly dont crush me so and ill tell you  when she had explained that delay in the train had caused her want of punctuality she shook hands with orook with whom she had renewed acquaintance at the time of his being appointed first mate to her fathers ship  then she was bid stand up in a corner to be overhauled  the captain retired to an opposite corner and gazed at his daughter critically as though she had been a fine portrait  yes polly youll do he said while an approving smile wrinkled his vast countenance  fit for a queen any day  a ladyha ha  have you done your duty to aunt maria polly eh  have you made a lady of her eh  have you infused into her something allied to the angelic eh come now a rousing norwester  with a laugh worthy of her girlhood polly ran out of her corner and obeyed orders  now my pet said the captain seating her on his knee here are some kickshaws from foreign parts for you but before letting you look at em i must explain why i asked you to meet me here instead of going to see you as usual in london  the fact is i had bin longing to take you with me my next voyage and it would have been handier to have you by me here when were getting ready for sea butbut the fact is things have taken a sudden turn andandin short circumstances have come about that i cant speak of just now only im not quite so sure about going to sea as i was an hour ago  but you dont seem to jump at the notion polly  surely youd have liked to gowouldnt you  liked father of course  i should have been overjoyed to have gone with you butbutthe truth is she said with a little laugh and a glance at orook circumstances have come about that i cant speak of just now  well my pet rejoined the captain with a puzzled anxious look well not talk about em  now you must know that ive got up a small party to meet you here tonight and expect you to do me credit the pastrycook next door has undertaken to send in cakes and tea and hot sausages and buns at a moments notice  i expect his man here every minute to lay out the spread  now who dee think are coming youll never guess  theres mr and mrs john jack the father and mother of edwin jackyou remember him polly  philosopher jack we used to call him  yes replied polly in a low tone  well they happen to be in town just now with their family and theyre all coming  then theres my first mate simon orook he would be coming only hes come already a full hour before his time  then theres a mr burr and a mr buckley both returned from california with fortunes  arowlin in gold muttered orook in a low tone  you dont really mean father that  yes i do polly  i mean that baldwin burr and jacob buckley are coming  i met em only two days ago in the streets going about in chimneypot hats and broadcloth like gentlemenwhich they are every inch of em if worth and welldoing and wisdom make the gentleman  so knowing you were to be here i made em promise to come  well then theres your old friend watty wilkins who by the way is engaged to be married to susan trench  i tried to get susan to come too but shes shy and wont  besides these theres a doctor of medicine whom i think you have met before a very rising young manquite celebrated i may say  got an enormous practice and  the captain was interrupted by the rattle of wheels outside and the pulling up of a carriage at the door  polly rose quickly with a halffrightened look  dont be alarmed poll its only the doctor he said going out to the passage  pardon my coming so much before the appointed time said a familiar voice but i have something to communicate before she comessomething very important and  philosopher jack stopped short for he had entered the room and saw that polly had already come  with one spring he was at her side seized her in his arms and imprinted on her lips what her father afterwards called the stiffest norwester hed ever seen  at the time however the captain strode up to our philosopher with a frown  come come doctor he said sternly there is a limit to familiarity even among  pardon me said our hero drawing pollys unresisting hand through his arm i had no intention of doing it until i had your consent but somehowi cant tell howit came upon me suddenly while i was paying my respects to her in london not long ago and before i knew where i was it all came out and she accepted me on the understanding that i should consider it no engagement until i had obtained your consent  so now i have to ask your forgiveness and your blessingfather  captain samson stood there bereft of speech and orook stood there the picture of benignity in a corner  what the former would have said it is impossible to tell for at that moment there came an impatient rapping at the door  hurrah captain i could not help looking in before the time cried watty wilkins to tell you that susans coming after all  the dear girl  he stopped suddenly and stared at polly as if he had applied the term of endearment to her  the ghost of polly samson he exclaimed after a breathless pause  nothing of the sort my boy said the captain grasping his little friends hand but an enlarged and improved edition of polly samson not yet fullbound but goin to be very soon by philosopher jack  at that auspicious moment the pastrycook made his appearance and compelled the party to quit the premises  they therefore went for a stroll while he put things in order  when they returned it was found that his wonderful powers had made a change little short of miraculous the floor was swept  chairs had been introduced on the scene  the table groaned being weak in the legs under a surfeit of viands  the hammock had been removed  the fire leaped high as if desirous of going up the chimney altogether and the huge kettle sat thereon leaning back with its spout in the air pouring its very heart out in a joyous domestic song  need we say that the united party made the most of their opportunity they spoke of the golden land of their toils and joys their successes and losses and of their heavenly fathers guiding hand  the exgolddiggers baldwin burr and jacob buckley fought their battles over again and sang the campfire songs  philosopher jack sat beside his mother who was a little deaf to explain the miners slang and point the jokes  watty wilkins became involved in susan and was comparatively useless but he laughed at the jokes whether he saw them or not and joined with telling effect in the choruses  polly sang in a voice that corresponded with her sweet face two or three of the hymns with which they had been wont to make vocal the palm grove on the coral island in the southern seas and philosopher jack related the story of the slaying of the bear at grizzly bear gulch  all this was a rare treat to the family from the lonely cottage on the border the younger members of which had by that time ascended through christian example and improved education to a high level in the social scale  dobbin in particular had become a strapping youth of gentlemanly mien and would as soon have thought of shoeblacking as of treacle to his bread  he retained a sneaking fondness for it however especially when presented in the form of golden syrup  but we must not prolong the scene  it is sufficient to say that they had a glorious night of it on strictly temperance principles which culminated and drew to a close when captain samson opening his bible and reading therefrom many precious promises drew his friends minds from things seen and temporal to things unseen and eternal  thereafter he prayed that neither he nor they should be permitted to forget that a loving father holds the helm and guides the souls of his people whether in joy or in sorrow success or failure through time into eternity  and now it is incumbent on us to draw our story to a close  on the day following the feast captain samson called with his chief mate on the writer of the important letter and found that his principal chest of gold had indeed been fished up from the deep  he and orook were able to give so correct an account of its contents that their claim was at once admitted and thus the captain became possessor of gold to the value of about four thousand pounds sterling while orook recovered upwards of one thousand  this was only a fraction of their original fortune but the interest of it was sufficient to supply their moderate wants  going straight off to the holly tree of which a healthy shoot had been planted in the suburbs orook proceeded according to use and wont to comfort the widdy  its a rich man i am darlin after all he said on sitting down beside her  how so simon  simon explained  an would you consider yourself a poor man if you had only me asked the widow with a hurt air  ah then its the women can twist their tongues anyhow cried orook  sure its about dirty goold im spakin isnt it  i made no reference to the love of purty womandid i now  in regard of that i wouldnt change places with the shah of pershy  well now simon if its the women that can twist their tongues its the irishmen that can twist their consciences so you an i will be well matched  thats well said anyhow rejoined orook  an now darlin will ye name the day  no simon i wont but ill think about it  there now  go home its gettin late and if ye happen to be passing this way tomorrow you may give us a call  thus simon orook prosecuted his courtship  in process of time he married the widow and was finally installed as master of the juvenile holly tree in the suburbs while his wife conducted the parent stem in town  vegetables and other country produce had to be conveyed to the town tree regularly  for this purpose a ponycart was set up which travelled daily between it and the country branch  thus it came to pass that orooks californian dreams were realised for sure he was wont to say havent i got a house in the country an a mansion in the town an if i dont drive my carriage and four i can always drive me cart an wan anyhow with a swate little widdy into the bargain  it is we suppose almost superfluous to say that doctor jack and polly samson were united in due course but it is necessary to record that by special arrangement walter wilkins esquire and susan trench were married on the same day  more than that the doctor and watty so contrived matters that they rented a double villa in the suburbs of the nameless city onehalf of which was occupied by dr jacks family the other by that of wilkins  still further it was so contrived by philosopher jack that a small cottage was built on an eminence in his garden in which there was a room precisely similar in all respects to that in which he had first met his fatherinlaw  there was a hammock in this room slung as the original hammock had been and although the old telescopes and souwesters and marine stores and charts had been sold and lost past redemption a good many new things bearing a strong resemblance to such articles were purchased and placed on the walls and in the corners so that almost the only difference between it and the old room was the absence of fishy smells  there was an improvement also in the view for whereas in the old room the window commanded a prospect of about ten yards in extent comprising a brick wall a lamppost and a broken pump the windows of the new room overlooked miles and miles of landscape embracing villages hamlets fields and forests away to the horizon  in this cottage captain samson took up his abode rent free and the money which he was thus enabled to save or which jack insisted on his saving was spent in helping the poor all round his dwelling  here the captain spent many happy hours in converse with polly and her husband to this room as time rolled on he brought a small child to which although not its nurse he devoted much of his spare time and called it polly  and oh it was a wonderful sight to see polly the second with her heart in her mouth and her hair flying in the air riding the captains foot in a storm  here too as time continued to roll on he fabricated innumerable boats and ships for little boys whose names were teddie watty ben baldwin and such like  in this room also every sunday morning early the captain was to be found with a large eager attentive class of little boys and girls to whom he expounded the word of god with many an illustrative anecdote while he sought to lead them to that dear lord who had saved his soul and whose holy spirit had enabled him to face the battles of life in prosperity and adversity and had made him more than conqueror  here also in the evenings of the same holy day he was wont to gather a meeting of old people to whom he discanted on the same old old story  in all which works he was aided and abetted by the families of the double house close by  besides his constant visitors among the young the aged and the poor the captain had a few occasional visitors at his residence which by the way was named harmony hall  among these were bailie trench and his wife who were naturally attracted to that region by the presence there of a slender loving sprightly boy whose name was benjamin walter wilkins and who boreat least they thought he borea striking resemblance to their loved and lost son ben  the family from the cottage on the border also paid annual visits to number 1 of the double house which was the doctors and the various members of that family being very fond of a chat with the old sailor often found themselves of an evening in the old storeroom as the boys styled it of harmony hall  these visits were regularly returned chiefly in the summertime by the captain and the families of the double house on which occasions the cottage on the border was taxed to such an extent that philosopher jack was obliged to purchase a neighbouring barn which he had fitted up as a dormitory that could accommodate almost a battalion of infantry  during these visits the trouting streams of the neighbourhood were so severely whipped that the fish knew the difference between a real and an artificial fly as well as their tormentors but they were captured for all that  baldwin burr and jacob buckley were also among the occasional visitors at the hall but their visits were few and far between because of their having taken up their permanent abode in california  only when they came home on business once in the two years had they an opportunity of seeing their old comrade but they never failed to take advantage of such opportunities  these men were not prone to speak about themselves but from various remarks they made and from their general appearance it was easy to see that they were substantial and influential members of society in foreign parts  from baldwin the captain heard that bob corkey had during his wanderings fallen in with bounce and badger and that these three had formed a partnership in which they tried their luck at golddigging farming furtrading and many other sources of livelihood but up to the last news of them without success  there was hope of them yet however so thought baldwin burr because of the latest remarks made by them in the hearing of credible witnesses  bob corkey having attained to the lowest depths of destitution and despair had it was said made to his comrades the following observation mates it strikes me that we are three great fools whereupon bounce had replied were more than that bob were three great sinners to which badger had added with considerable emphasis thats a fact and when men come to this there is hope for them  the only personage of our tale who now remains to be mentioned is mrs niven  that steadygoing female continued her vocation of ministering to the wants of young students some of whom treated her well while othersto their shame be it saidtook advantage of her amiability  in regard to this latter fact however it may be recorded that peggy proved a sharpwitted tighthanded and zealous defender of her mistress  among mrs nivens other boarders there was one who was neither young nor a student  he came to reside with her in the following manner  one evening peggy was heard in altercation with a man in the passage who seemed bent on forcing his way into the house  the students who chanced to be in their rooms at the time cocked their ears like warsteeds snuffing the battle from afar and hoped for a row  mrs niven after opening the parlour door softly and listening called out let the gentleman come up peggy  gentleman indeed cried the irate peggy who had the intruder by the throat hes only a dirty auld blagyird  niver ye mind peggy returned mrs niven peremptorily i ken him let him up  immediately after there walked into the parlour a bowed meanlooking dirty little old man who as he sat down on a chair paid some doubtful compliments to peggy  oh maister black is it you said mrs niven sitting down beside him  besides being all that we have said mr black was ragged dishevelled haggard and in every way disreputable  yes its me mrs niven he replied harshly and you see im in a sorry plight  i see i see said the good woman taking his hand and shedding tears i kent ye had lost a by that fearfu bank failure but i didna ken ye had come doon sae low  and oh to think that it was a through me an your kindness in offerin to tak the shares aff my hands  oh  maister black my heart is wae when i look at ye  is there onything i can dae for ye  now it was quite a new light to mr black that his relative had not found him out  he had called in a fit of desperation for the purpose of extorting money from her by any means  he now changed his tactics and resolved to board and lodge with her gratuitously  the proposition rather startled the poor woman for she found it difficult to make the two ends meet even when her house was full of lodgers  she had not the heart to refuse him however and thus mr black was fairly installed in the old room whose window opened on the cats parade  in her difficulty mrs niven went as she was in the habit of doing to philosopher jack to whom she represented mr black as such a suffering and selfsacrificing man that his heart was quite melted  ill tell you what ill do mrs niven he said  there is a sum of money in my fathers possession the interest of which enabled me to pay my way when i came back from the goldfields  my father wont use that money himself and i wont accept it from him  we have therefore resolved to devote it to charitable purposes  now we will give mr black a small annuity out of it for your sake mrs niven  philosopher jack was not however so easily deceived as mrs niven  he afterwards found out mr black and told him so in very stern language  nevertheless he did not stop his allowance  neither did he enlighten mrs niven as to the mans true character though he kept a sharp eye on him  thus did mr black become a pensioner and a free boarder  there is no sinner on this side of the grave who is beyond redemption  that which prosperity and adversity had equally failed to accomplish was finally brought about by unmerited kindnessmr blacks spirit was quietly and gradually but surely broken  the generous forbearance of edwin jack and the loving christian sympathy of his intended victim proved too much for him  he confessed his sin to jack and offered to resign his pension but jack would not hear of it as the pensioner was by that time too old and feeble to work  he also confessed to mrs niven but that unsuspecting woman refused to believe that he ever did or could harbour so vile a design towards her and she continued in that mind to her dying day  peggy however was made of sterner stuff  she not only believed his confession but she refused to believe in his repentance and continued to treat him with marked disrespect until her mistress died  after that however she relented and retired with him to a poorer residence in the capacity of his servant  peggy was eccentric in her behaviour while she nursed him with the assiduous care and kindness of a rough but honest nature she continued to call him a dirty auld blagyird to the last  the expression of this sentiment did not however prevent her from holding more polite intercourse  when his eyes grew dim she read to him not only from the bible but from the pilgrims progress and robinson crusoe which were their favourites among the books of the little library furnished to them by christian friends  and many sage and original remarks did peggy make on those celebrated books  the topics of conversation which she broached with mr black from time to time were numerous as a matter of course for peggy was loquacious but that to which she most frequently recurred was the wonderful career of philosopher jack for peggy liked to sing his praises and never tired of treating the old man to longwinded accounts of that heros ever memorable voyage to the southern seas  the end
