restricted to a few dwarf scotch firs and was so perpendicularly cast that leonidas boone seeking shelter from the heat was obliged to draw himself up under one of them as if it were an umbrella occasionally with a boys perversity he permitted one bared foot to protrude beyond the sharply marked shadow until the burning sun forced him to draw it in again with a thrill of satisfaction there was no earthly reason why he had not sought the larger shadows of the pinetrees which reared themselves against the ridge on the slope below him except that he was a boy and perhaps even more superstitious and opinionated than most boys having got under this tree with infinite care he had made up his mind that he would not move from it until its line of shade reached and touched a certain stone on the trail near him why he did this he did not know but he clung to his sublime purpose with the courage and tenacity of a youthful casabianca he was cramped tickled by dust and fir sprays he was supremely uncomfortablebut he stayed a woodpecker was monotonously tapping in an adjacent pine with measured intervals of silence which he always firmly believed was a certain telegraphy of the birds own making a greenandgold lizard flashed by his foot to stiffen itself suddenly with a rigidity equal to his own still he stirred not the shadow gradually crept nearer the mystic stoneand touched it he sprang up shook himself and prepared to go about his business this was simply an errand to the postoffice at the crossroads scarcely a mile from his fathers house he was already halfway there he had taken only the better part of one hour for this desultory journey  however he now proceeded on his way diverging only to follow a fresh rabbittrack a few hundred yards to note that the animal had doubled twice against the wind and then naturally he was obliged to look closely for other tracks to determine its pursuers he paused also but only for a moment to rap thrice on the trunk of the pine where the woodpecker was at work which he knew would make it cease work for a timeas it did having thus renewed his relations with nature he discovered that one of the letters he was taking to the postoffice had slipped in some mysterious way from the bosom of his shirt where he carried them past his waistband into his trouserleg and was about to make a casual delivery of itself on the trail this caused him to take out his letters and count them when he found one missing he had been given four letters to posthe had only three there was a big one in his fathers handwriting two indistinctive ones of his mothers and a smaller one of his sistersthat was gone not at all disconcerted he calmly retraced his steps following his own tracks minutely with a grim face and a distinct delight in the process while lookingperfunctorilyfor the letter in the midst of this slow progress a bright idea struck him he walked back to the firtree where he had rested and found the lost missive it had slipped out of his shirt when he shook himself he was not particularly pleased he knew that nobody would give him credit for his trouble in going back for it or his astuteness in guessing where it was he heaved the sigh of misunderstood genius and again started for the postoffice this time he carried the letters openly and ostentatiously in his hand  presently he heard a voice say hey it was a gentle musical voicea strangers voice for it evidently did not know how to call him and did not say oh leonidas or youlook here he was abreast of a little clearing guarded by a low stockade of bark palings and beyond it was a small white dwellinghouse leonidas knew the place perfectly well it belonged to the superintendent of a mining tunnel who had lately rented it to some strangers from san francisco thus much he had heard from his family he had a mountain boys contempt for city folks and was not himself interested in them yet as he heard the call he was conscious of a slightly guilty feeling he might have been trespassing in following the rabbits track he might have been seen by some one when he lost the letter and had to go back for itall grownup people had a way of offering themselves as witnesses against him he scowled a little as he glanced around him then his eye fell on the caller on the other side of the stockade  to his surprise it was a woman a pretty gentle fragile creature all soft muslin and laces with her fingers interlocked and leaning both elbows on the top of the stockade as she stood under the checkered shadow of a buckeye  come herepleasewont you she said pleasantly  it would have been impossible to resist her voice if leonidas had wanted to which he didnt he walked confidently up to the fence she really was very pretty with eyes like his setters and as caressing and there were little puckers and satiny creases around her delicate nostrils and mouth when she spoke which leonidas knew were expression  iishe began with charming hesitation then suddenly whats your name  leonidas  leonidas thats a pretty name he thought it did sound pretty well leonidas i want you to be a good boy and do a great favor for mea very great favor  leonidass face fell this kind of prelude and formula was familiar to him it was usually followed by promise me that you will never swear again or that you will go straight home and wash your face or some other irrelevant personality but nobody with that sort of eyes had ever said it so he said a little shyly but sincerely yes maam  you are going to the postoffice  this seemed a very foolish womanish question seeing that he was holding letters in his hand but he said yes  i want you to put a letter of mine among yours and post them all together she said putting one little hand to her bosom and drawing out a letter he noticed that she purposely held the addressed side so that he could not see it but he also noticed that her hand was small thin and white even to a faint tint of blue in it unlike his sisters the babys or any other hand he had ever seen can you read she said suddenly withdrawing the letter  the boy flushed slightly at the question of course i can he said proudly  of course certainly she repeated quickly but she added with a mischievous smile you mustnt now promise me promise me that you wont read this address but just post the letter like one of your own in the letterbox with the others  leonidas promised readily it seemed to him a great fuss about nothing perhaps it was some kind of game or a bet he opened his sunburnt hand holding his own letters and she slipped hers face downward between them her soft fingers touched his in the operation and seemed to leave a pleasant warmth behind them  promise me another thing she added promise me you wont say a word of this to any one  of course said leonidas  thats a good boy and i know you will keep your word she hesitated a moment smilingly and tentatively and then held out a bright halfdollar leonidas backed from the fence id rather not he said shyly  but as a present from me  leonidas coloredhe was really proud and he was also bright enough to understand that the possession of such unbounded wealth would provoke dangerous inquiry at home but he didnt like to say it and only replied i cant  she looked at him curiously thenthank you she said offering her white hand which felt like a bird in his now run on and dont let me keep you any longer she drew back from the fence as she spoke and waved him a pretty farewell leonidas half sorry half relieved darted away  he ran to the postoffice which he never had done before loyally he never looked at her letter nor indeed at his own again swinging the hand that held them far from his side he entered the postoffice directly going at once to the letterbox and depositing the precious missive with the others the postoffice was also the country store and leonidas was in the habit of still further protracting his errands there by lingering in that stimulating atmosphere of sugar cheese and coffee but today his stay was brief so transitory that the postmaster himself inferred audibly that old man boone must have been tanning lee with a hickory switch but the simple reason was that leonidas wished to go back to the stockade fence and the fair stranger if haply she was still there his heart sank as breathless with unwonted haste he reached the clearing and the empty buckeye shade he walked slowly and with sad diffidence by the deserted stockade fence but presently his quick eye discerned a glint of white among the laurels near the house it was she walking with apparent indifference away from him towards the corner of the clearing and the road but this he knew would bring her to the end of the stockade fence where he must passand it did she turned to him with a bright smile of affected surprise why youre as swiftfooted as mercury  leonidas understood her perfectly mercury was the other name for quicksilverand that was lively you bet he had often spilt some on the floor to see it move she must be awfully cute to have noticed it toocuter than his sisters he was quite breathless with pleasure  i put your letter in the box all right he burst out at last  without any one seeing it she asked  sure pop nary one the postmaster stuck out his hand to grab it but i just let on that i didnt see him and shoved it in myself  youre as sharp as youre good she said smilingly now theres just one thing more i want you to do forget all about thiswont you  her voice was very caressing perhaps that was why he said boldly yes maam all except you  dear me what a compliment how old are you  goin on fifteen said leonidas confidently  and going very fast said the lady mischievously well then you neednt forget me on the contrary she added after looking at him curiously i would rather youd remember me goodbyor rather goodafternoonif im to be remembered leon  goodafternoon maam  she moved away and presently disappeared among the laurels but her last words were ringing in his ears leoneverybody else called him lee for brevity leonit was pretty as she said it  he turned away but it so chanced that their parting was not to pass unnoticed for looking up the hill leonidas perceived his elder sister and little brother coming down the road and knew that they must have seen him from the hilltop it was like their snoopin  they ran to him eagerly  you were talking to the stranger said his sister breathlessly  she spoke to me first said leonidas on the defensive  what did she say  wanted to know the eleckshun news said leonidas with cool mendacity and i told her  this improbable fiction nevertheless satisfied them what was she like oh do tell us lee continued his sister  nothing would have delighted him more than to expatiate upon her loveliness the soft white beauty of her hands the cunning little puckers around her lips her bright tender eyes the angelic texture of her robes and the musical tinkle of her voice but leonidas had no confidant and what healthy boy ever trusted his sister in such matter you saw what she was like he said with evasive bluntness  but lee  but lee was adamant go and ask her he said  like as not you were sassy to her and she shut you up said his sister artfully but even this cruel suggestion which he could have so easily flouted did not draw him and his ingenious relations flounced disgustedly away  but leonidas was not spared any further allusion to the fair stranger for the fact of her having spoken to him was duly reported at home and at dinner his reticence was again sorely attacked just like her in spite of all her airs and graces to hang out along the fence like any ordinary hired girl jabberin with anybody that went along the road said his mother incisively he knew that she didnt like her new neighbors so this did not surprise nor greatly pain him neither did the prosaic facts that were now first made plain to him his divinity was a mrs burroughs whose husband was conducting a series of mining operations and prospecting with a gang of men on the casket ridge as his duty required his continual presence there mrs burroughs was forced to forego the civilized pleasures of san francisco for a frontier life for which she was ill fitted and in which she had no interest all this was a vague irrelevance to leonidas who knew her only as a goddess in white who had been familiar to him and kind and to whom he was tied by the delicious joy of having a secret in common and having done her a special favor healthy youth clings to its own impressions let reason experience and even facts argue ever to the contrary  so he kept her secret and his intact and was rewarded a few days afterwards by a distant view of her walking in the garden with a man whom he recognized as her husband it is needless to say that without any extraneous thought the man suffered in leonidass estimation by his propinquity to the goddess and that he deemed him vastly inferior  it was a still greater reward to his fidelity that she seized an opportunity when her husbands head was turned to wave her hand to him leonidas did not approach the fence partly through shyness and partly through a more subtle instinct that this man was not in the secret he was right for only the next day as he passed to the postoffice she called him to the fence  did you see me wave my hand to you yesterday she asked pleasantly  yes maam buthe hesitatedi didnt come up for i didnt think you wanted me when any one else was there  she laughed merrily and lifting his straw hat from his head ran the fingers of the other hand through his damp curls youre the brightest dearest boy i ever knew leon she said dropping her pretty face to the level of his own and i ought to have remembered it but i dont mind telling you i was dreadfully frightened lest you might misunderstand me and come and ask for another letterbefore him as she emphasized the personal pronoun her whole face seemed to change the light of her blue eyes became mere glittering points her nostrils grew white and contracted and her pretty little mouth seemed to narrow into a straight cruel line like a cats not a word ever to him of all men do you hear she said almost brusquely then seeing the concern in the boys face she laughed and added explanatorily hes a bad bad man leon remember that  the fact that she was speaking of her husband did not shock the boys moral sense in the least the sacredness of those relations and even of blood kinship is i fear not always so clear to the youthful mind as we fondly imagine that mr burroughs was a bad man to have excited this change in this lovely woman was leonidass only conclusion he remembered how his sisters soft pretty little kitten purring on her lap used to get its back up and spit at the postmasters yellow hound  i never wished to come unless you called me first he said frankly  what she said in her half playful half reproachful but wholly caressing way you mean to say you would never come to see me unless i sent for you oh leon and youd abandon me in that way  but leonidas was set in his own boyish superstition id just delight in being sent for by you any time mrs burroughs and you kin always find me he said shyly but doggedly buthe stopped  what an opinionated young gentleman well i see i must do all the courting so consider that i sent for you this morning ive got another letter for you to mail she put her hand to her breast and out of the pretty frillings of her frock produced as before with the same faint perfume of violets a letter like the first but it was unsealed now listen leon we are going to be great friendsyou and i leonidas felt his cheeks glowing you are going to do me another great favor and we are going to have a little fun and a great secret all by our own selves now first have you any correspondentyou knowany one who writes to youany boy or girlfrom san francisco  leonidass cheeks grew redderalas from a less happy consciousness he never received any letters nobody ever wrote to him he was obliged to make this shameful admission  mrs burroughs looked thoughtful but you have some friend in san franciscosome one who might write to you she suggested pleasantly  i knew a boy once who went to san francisco said leonidas doubtfully at least he allowed he was goin there  that will do said mrs burroughs i suppose your parents know him or of him  why said leonidas he used to live here  better still for you see it wouldnt be strange if he did write what was the gentlemans name  jim belcher returned leonidas hesitatingly by no means sure that the absent belcher knew how to write mrs burroughs took a tiny pencil from her belt opened the letter she was holding in her hand and apparently wrote the name in it then she folded it and sealed it smiling charmingly at leonidass puzzled face  now leon listen for here is the favor i am asking mr jim belchershe pronounced the name with great gravitywill write to you in a few days but inside of your letter will be a little note to me which you will bring me you can show your letter to your family if they want to know who it is from but no one must see mine can you manage that  yes said leonidas then as the whole idea flashed upon his quick intelligence he smiled until he showed his dimples mrs burroughs leaned forward over the fence lifted his torn straw hat and dropped a fluttering little kiss on his forehead it seemed to the boy flushed and rosy as a maid as if she had left a shining star there for every one to see  dont smile like that leon youre positively irresistible it will be a nice little game wont it nobody in it but you and meand belcher well outwit them yet and you see youll be obliged to come to me after all without my asking  they both laughed indeed quite a dimpled brighteyed rosy innocent pair though i think leonidas was the more maidenly  and added leonidas with breathless eagerness i can sometimes write totojim and inclose your letter  angel of wisdom certainly well now lets seehave you got any letters for the post today he colored again for in anticipation of meeting her he had hurried up the family post that morning he held out his letters she thrust her own among them now she said laying her cool soft hand against his hot cheek run along dear you must not be seen loitering here  leonidas ran off buoyed up on ambient air it seemed just like a fairybook here he was the confidant of the most beautiful creature he had seen and there was a mysterious letter coming to himleonidasand no one to know why and now he had a call to see her often she would not forget himhe neednt loiter by the fencepost to see if she wanted himand his boyish pride and shyness were appeased there was no question of moral ethics raised in leonidass mind he knew that it would not be the real jim belcher who would write to him but that made the prospect the more attractive nor did another circumstance trouble his conscience when he reached the postoffice he was surprised to see the man whom he knew to be mr burroughs talking with the postmaster leonidas brushed by him and deposited his letters in the box in discreet triumph the postmaster was evidently officially resenting some imputation on his carelessness and concluding his defense no sir he said you kin bet your boots that ef any letter hez gone astray for you or your wifeye said your wife didnt ye  yes said burroughs hastily with a glance around the shop  well for you or anybody at your houseit aint here thats the fault you hear me i know every letter that comes in and goes outer this office i reckon and handle em allleonidas pricked up his earsand if anybody oughter know its me ye kin paste that in your hat mr burroughs burroughs apparently disconcerted by the intrusion of a third partyleonidasupon what was evidently a private inquiry murmured something surlily and passed out  leonidas was puzzled that big man seemed to be snoopin around for something he knew that he dared not touch the letterbagleonidas had heard somewhere that it was a deadly crime to touch any letters after the government had got hold of them once and he had no fears for the safety of hers but ought he not go back at once and tell her about her husbands visit and the alarming fact that the postmaster was personally acquainted with all the letters he instantly saw too the wisdom of her inclosing her letter hereafter in another address yet he finally resolved not to tell her todayit would look like hanging round again andanother secret reasonhe was afraid that any allusion to her husbands interference would bring back that change in her beautiful face which he did not like the better to resist temptation he went back another way  it must not be supposed that while leonidas indulged in this secret passion for the beautiful stranger it was to the exclusion of his boyish habits it merely took the place of his intellectual visions and his romantic reading he no longer carried books in his pocket on his lazy rambles what were mediaeval legends of highborn ladies and their pages to this real romance of himself and mrs burroughs what were the exploits of boy captains and juvenile trappers and the indian maidens and spanish senoritas to what was now possible to himself and his divinity hereupon casket ridge the very ground around her was now consecrated to romance and adventure consequently he visited a few traps on his way back which he had set for jackassrabbits and wildcatsthe latter a vindictive reprisal for aggression upon an orphan brood of mountain quail which he had taken under his protection for while he nourished a keen love of sport it was controlled by a boys larger understanding of nature a pantheistic sympathy with man and beast and plant which made him keenly alive to the strange cruelties of creation revealed to him some queer animal feuds and made him a chivalrous partisan of the weaker he had even gone out of his way to defend by ingenious contrivances of his own the hoard of a golden squirrel and the treasures of some wild bees from a predatory bear although it did not prevent him later from capturing the squirrel by an equally ingenious contrivance and from eventually eating some of the honey  he was late home that evening but this was vacationthe district school was closed and but for the household chores which occupied his early mornings each long summer day was a holiday so two or three passed and then one morning on his going to the postoffice the postmaster threw down upon the counter a real and rather bulky letter duly stamped and addressed to mr leonidas boone leonidas was too discreet to open it before witnesses but in the solitude of the trail home broke the seal it contained another letter with no addressclearly the one she expectedand more marvelous still a sheaf of trouthooks with delicate gutsnells such as leonidas had only dared to dream of the letter to himself was written in a clear distinct hand and ran as follows   dear leehow are you getting on on old casket ridge it seems a coons age since you and me was together and times i get to think i must just run up and see you were having bully times in frisco you bet though there aint anything wild worth shucks to go to seecept the sea lions at the cliff house theyre just stunningbig as a grizzly and biggerclimbing over a big rock or swimming in the sea like an otter or muskrat im sending you some snells and hooks such as you cant get at casket use the fine ones for potholes and the bigger ones for running water or falls let me know when youve got em write to lock box no 1290 thats where dads letters come so no more at present  from yours truly  jim belcher   not only did leonidas know that this was not from the real jim but he felt the vague contact of a new charming and original personality that fascinated him of course it was only natural that one of her friendsas he must beshould be equally delightful there was no jealousy in leonidass devotion he knew only a joy in this fellowship of admiration for her which he was satisfied that the other boy must feel and only the right kind of boy could know the importance of his ravishing gift and this jim was evidently no slouch yet in leonidass new joy he did not forget her he ran back to the stockade fence and lounged upon the road in view of the house but she did not appear  leonidas lingered on the top of the hill ostentatiously examining a young hickory for a green switch but to no effect then it suddenly occurred to him that she might be staying in purposely and perhaps a little piqued by her indifference he ran off there was a mountain stream hard by now dwindled in the summer drouth to a mere trickling thread among the boulders and there was a certain pothole that he had long known it was the lurkingplace of a phenomenal troutan almost historic fish in the district which had long resisted the attempt of such rude sportsmen as miners or even experts like himself few had seen it except as a vague shadowy bulk in the four feet of depth and gloom in which it hid only once had leonidass quick eye feasted on its fair proportions on that memorable occasion leonidas having exhausted every kind of lure of painted fly and living bait was rising from his knees behind the bank when a pink fivecent stamp dislodged from his pocket fluttered in the air and descended slowly upon the still pool horrified at his loss leonidas leaned over to recover it when there was a flash like lightning in the black depths a dozen changes of light and shadow on the surface a little whirling wave splashing against the side of the rock and the postage stamp was gone more than thatfor one instant the trout remained visible stationary and expectant whether it was the instinct of sport or whether the fish had detected a new subtle and original flavor in the gum and paper leonidas never knew alas he had not another stamp he was obliged to leave the fish but carried a brilliant idea away with him ever since then he had cherished itand another extra stamp in his pocket and now with this strong but gossamerlike snell this new hook and this freshly cut hickory rod he would make the trial  but fate was against him he had scarcely descended the narrow trail to the pinefringed margin of the stream before his quick ear detected an unusual rustling through the adjacent underbrush and then a voice that startled him it was hers in an instant all thought of sport had fled with a beating heart half opened lips and uplifted lashes leonidas awaited the coming of his divinity like a timorous virgin at her first tryst  but mrs burroughs was clearly not in an equally responsive mood with her fair face reddened by the sun the damp tendrils of her unwound hair clinging to her forehead and her smart little slippers red with dust there was also a querulous light in her eyes and a still more querulous pinch in her nostrils as she stood panting before him  you tiresome boy she gasped holding one little hand to her side as she gripped her brambled skirt around her ankles with the other why didnt you wait why did you make me run all this distance after you  leonidas timidly and poignantly protested he had waited before the house and on the hill he thought she didnt want him  couldnt you see that that man kept me in she went on peevishly havent you sense enough to know that he suspects something and follows me everywhere dogging my footsteps every time the post comes in and even going to the postoffice himself to make sure that he sees all my letters well she added impatiently have you anything for me why dont you speak  crushed and remorseful leonidas produced her letter she almost snatched it from his hand opened it read a few lines and her face changed a smile strayed from her eyes to her lips and back again leonidass heart was lifted she was so forgiving and so beautiful  is he a boy mrs burroughs asked leonidas shyly  wellnot exactly she said her charming face all radiant again hes older than you what has he written to you  leonidas put his letter in her hand for reply  i wish i could see him you know he said shyly that letters bullyits just rats i like him powful  mrs burroughs had skimmed through the letter but not interestedly  you mustnt like him more than you like me she said laughingly caressing him with her voice and eyes and even her straying hand  i couldnt do that i never could like anybody as i like you said leonidas gravely there was such appalling truthfulness in the boys voice and frankly opened eyes that the woman could not evade it and was slightly disconcerted but she presently started up with a vexatious cry theres that wretch following me again i do believe she said staring at the hilltop yes look leon hes turning to come down this trail whats to be done he mustnt see me here  leonidas looked it was indeed mr burroughs but he was evidently only taking a short cut towards the ridge where his men were working leonidas had seen him take it before but it was the principal trail on the steep hillside and they must eventually meet a man might evade it by scrambling through the brush to a lower and rougher trail but a woman never but an idea had seized leonidas i can stop him he said confidently to her you just lie low here behind that rock till i come back he hasnt seen you yet  she had barely time to draw back before leonidas darted down the trail towards her husband yet in her intense curiosity she leaned out the next moment to watch him he paused at last not far from the approaching figure and seemed to kneel down on the trail what was he doing her husband was still slowly advancing suddenly he stopped at the same moment she heard their two voices in excited parley and then to her amazement she saw her husband scramble hurriedly down the trail to the lower level and with an occasional backward glance hasten away until he had passed beyond her view  she could scarcely realize her narrow escape when leonidas stood by her side how did you do it she said eagerly  with a rattler said the boy gravely  with a what  a rattlesnakepizen snake you know  a rattlesnake she said staring at leonidas with a quick snatching away of her skirts  the boy who seemed to have forgotten her in his other abstraction of adventure now turned quickly with devoted eyes and a reassuring smile  yes but i wouldnt let him hurt you he said gently  but what did you do  he looked at her curiously you wont be frightened if i show you he said doubtfully theres nothin to be afeerd of slong as youre with me he added proudly  yesthat isshe stammered and then her curiosity getting the better of her fear she added in a whisper show me quick  he led the way up the narrow trail until he stopped where he had knelt before it was a narrow sunny ledge of rock scarcely wide enough for a single person to pass he silently pointed to a cleft in the rock and kneeling down again began to whistle in a soft fluttering way there was a moment of suspense and then she was conscious of an awful gliding somethinga movement so measured yet so exquisitely graceful that she stood enthralled a narrow flattened expressionless head was followed by a footlong strip of yellowbarred scales then there was a pause and the head turned in a beautifully symmetrical halfcircle towards the whistler the whistling ceased the snake with half its body out of the cleft remained poised in air as if stiffened to stone  there said leonidas quietly thats what mr burroughs saw and thats why he scooted off the trail i just called out william henryi call him william henry and he knows his nameand then i sang out to mr burroughs what was up and it was lucky i did for the next moment hed have been on top of him and have been struck for rattlers dont give way to any one  oh why didnt you letshe stopped herself quickly but could not stop the fierce glint in her eye nor the sharp curve in her nostril luckily leonidas did not see this being preoccupied with his other graceful charmer william henry  but how did you know it was here said mrs burroughs recovering herself  fetched him here said leonidas briefly  what in your hands she said drawing back  no made him follow i have handled him but it was after id first made him strike his pizen out upon a stick ye know after he strikes four times he aint got any pizen left then ye kin do anythin with him and he knows it he knows me you bet ive bin three months trainin him look dont be frightened he said as mrs burroughs drew hurriedly back see him mind me now scoot home william henry  he accompanied the command with a slow dominant movement of the hickory rod he was carrying the snake dropped its head and slid noiselessly out of the cleft across the trail and down the hill  thinks my rod is witchhazel which rattlers cant abide continued leonidas dropping into a boys breathless abbreviated speech lives down your wayjust back of your farm show ye some day suns himself on a flat stone every dayalways coldnever can get warm eh  she had not spoken but was gazing into space with a breathless rigidity of attitude and a fixed look in her eye not unlike the motionless orbs of the reptile that had glided away  does anybody else know you keep him she asked  nary one i never showed him to anybody but you replied the boy  dont you must show me where he hides tomorrow she said in her old laughing way and now leon i must go back to the house  may i write to himto jim belcher mrs burroughs said the boy timidly  certainly and come to me tomorrow with your letteri will have mine ready goodby she stopped and glanced at the trail and you say that if that man had kept on the snake would have bitten him  sure popif hed trod on himas he was sure to the snake wouldnt have known he didnt mean it its only natural continued leonidas with glowing partisanship for the gentle and absent william henry you wouldnt like to be trodden upon mrs burroughs  no id strike out she said quickly she made a rapid motion forward with her low forehead and level head leaving it rigid the next moment so that it reminded him of the snake and he laughed at which she laughed too and tripped away  leonidas went back and caught his trout but even this triumph did not remove a vague sense of disappointment which had come over him he had often pictured to himself a heavensent meeting with her in the woods a walk with her alone where he could pick her the rarest flowers and herbs and show her his woodland friends and it had only ended in this and an exhibition of william henry he ought to have saved her from something and not her husband yet he had no illfeeling for burroughs only a desire to circumvent him on behalf of the unprotected as he would have baffled a hawk or a wildcat he went home in dismal spirits but later that evening constructed a boyish letter of thanks to the apocryphal belcher and told him all aboutthe trout  he brought her his letter the next day and received hers to inclose she was pleasant her own charming self again but she seemed more interested in other things than himself as for instance the docile william henry whose hidingplace he showed and whose few tricks she made him exhibit to her and which the gratified leonidas accepted as a delicate form of flattery to himself but his yearning innocent spirit detected a something lacking which he was too proud to admit even to himself it was his own fault he ought to have waited for her and not gone for the trout  so a fortnight passed with an interchange of the vicarious letters and brief hopeful and disappointing meetings to leonidas to add to his unhappiness he was obliged to listen to sneering disparagement of his goddess from his family and criticisms which happily his innocence did not comprehend it was his own mother who accused her of shamefully making up to the goodlooking expressman at church last sunday and declared that burroughs ought to look after that wife of histwo statements which the simple leonidas could not reconcile he had seen the incident and only thought her more lovely than ever why should not the expressman think so too and yet the boy was not happy something intruded upon his sports upon his books making them dull and vapid and yet that something was she he grew pale and preoccupied if he had only some one in whom to confidesome one who could explain his hopes and fears that one was nearer than he thought  it was quite three weeks since the rattlesnake incident and he was wandering moodily over casket ridge he was near the casket that abrupt upheaval of quartz and gneiss shaped like a coffer from which the mountain took its name it was a favorite haunt of leonidas one of whose boyish superstitions was that it contained a treasure of gold and one of whose brightest dreams had been that he should yet discover it this he did not do today but looking up from the rocks that he was listlessly examining he made the almost as thrilling discovery that near him on the trail was a distinguishedlooking stranger  he was bestriding a shapely mustang which well became his handsome face and slight elegant figure and he was looking at leonidas with an amused curiosity and a certain easy assurance that were difficult to withstand it was with the same fascinating selfconfidence of smile voice and manner that he rode up to the boy and leaning lightly over his saddle said with exaggerated politeness i believe i have the pleasure of addressing mr leonidas boone  the rising color in leonidass face was apparently a sufficient answer to the stranger for he continued smilingly then permit me to introduce myself as mr james belcher as you perceive i have grown considerably since you last saw me in fact ive done nothing else its surprising what a fellow can do when he sets his mind on one thing and then you know theyre always telling you that san francisco is a growing place that accounts for it  leonidas dazed dazzled but delighted showed all his white teeth in a shy laugh at which the enchanting stranger leaped from his horse like a very boy drew his arm through the rein and going up to leonidas lifted the boys straw hat from his head and ran his fingers through his curls there was nothing original in thateverybody did that to him as a preliminary to conversation but when this ingenuous fine gentleman put his own panama hat on leonidass head and clapped leonidass torn straw on his own and passing his arm through the boys began to walk on with him leonidass simple heart went out to him at once  and now leon said the delightful stranger lets you and me have a talk theres a nice cool spot under these laurels ill stake out pepita and well just lie off there and gab and not care if school keeps or not  but you know you aint really jim belcher said the boy shyly  im as good a man as he is any day whoever i am said the stranger with humorous defiance and can lick him out of his boots whoever he is that ought to satisfy you but if you want my certificate heres your own letter old man he said producing leonidass last scrawl from his pocket  and hers said the boy cautiously  the strangers face changed a little and hers he repeated gravely showing a little pink note which leonidas recognized as one of mrs burroughss inclosures the boy was silent until they reached the laurels where the stranger tethered his horse and then threw himself in an easy attitude beneath the tree with the back of his head upon his clasped hands leonidas could see his curved brown mustaches and silky lashes that were almost as long and thought him the handsomest man he had ever beheld  well leon said the stranger stretching himself out comfortably and pulling the boy down beside him how are things going on the casket all serene eh  the inquiry so dismally recalled leonidass late feelings that his face clouded and he involuntarily sighed the stranger instantly shifted his head and gazed curiously at him then he took the boys sunburnt hand in his own and held it a moment well go on he said  well mrmri cant go oni wont said leonidas with a sudden fit of obstinacy i dont know what to call you  call me jackjack hamlin when youre not in a hurry ever heard of me before he added suddenly turning his head towards leonidas  the boy shook his head no  mr jack hamlin lifted his lashes in affected expostulation to the skies and this is fame he murmured audibly  but this leonidas did not comprehend nor could he understand why the stranger who clearly must have come to see her should not ask about her should not rush to seek her but should lie back there all the while so contentedly on the grass he wouldnt he half resented it and then it occurred to him that this fine gentleman was like himselfshy who could help being so before such an angel he would help him on  and so shyly at first but bit by bit emboldened by a word or two from jack he began to talk of herof her beautyof her kindnessof his own unworthinessof what she had said and doneuntil finding in this gracious stranger the vent his pentup feelings so long had sought he sang then and there the little idyl of his boyish life he told of his decline in her affections after his unpardonable sin in keeping her waiting while he went for the trout and added the miserable mistake of the rattlesnake episode for it was a mistake mr hamlin i oughtnt to have let a lady like that know anything about snakesjust because i happen to know them  it was an awful slump lee said hamlin gravely get a woman and a snake togetherand where are you think of adam and eve and the serpent you know  but it wasnt that way said the boy earnestly and i want to tell you something else thats just makin me sick mr hamlin you know i told you william henry lives down at the bottom of burroughss garden and how i showed mrs burroughs his tricks well only two days ago i was down there looking for him and couldnt find him anywhere theres a sort of narrow trail from the garden to the hill a short cut up to the ridge instead o going by their gate its just the trail any one would take in a hurry or if they didnt want to be seen from the road well i was looking this way and that for william henry and whistlin for him when i slipped on to the trail there in the middle of it was an old bucket turned upside downjust the thing a man would kick away or a woman lift up well mr hamlin i kicked it away andthe boy stopped with rounded eyes and bated breath and addedi just had time to give one jump and save myself for under that pail cramped down so he couldnt get out and just bilin over with rage and chockful of pizen was william henry if it had been anybody else less spry theyd have got bittenand thats just what the sneak who put it there knew  mr hamlin uttered an exclamation under his breath and rose to his feet  what did you say asked the boy quickly  nothing said mr hamlin  but it had sounded to leonidas like an oath  mr hamlin walked a few steps as if stretching his limbs and then said and you think burroughs would have been bitten  why no said leonidas in astonished indignation of course notnot burroughs it would have been poor mrs burroughs for of course he set that trap for herdont you see who else would do it  of course of course certainly said mr hamlin coolly of course as you say he set the trapyesyou just hang on to that idea  but something in mr hamlins manner and a peculiar look in his eye did not satisfy leonidas are you going to see her now he said eagerly i can show you the house and then run in and tell her youre outside in the laurels  not just yet said mr hamlin laying his hand on the boys head after having restored his own hat you see i thought of giving her a surprise a big surprise he added slowly after a pause he went on did you tell her what you had seen  of course i did said leonidas reproachfully did you think i was going to let her get bit it might have killed her  and it might not have been an unmixed pleasure for william henry i mean said mr hamlin gravely correcting himself you would never have forgiven him but what did she say  the boys face clouded she thanked me and said it was very thoughtfuland kindthough it might have been only an accidenthe stammeredand then she said perhaps i was hanging round and coming there a little too much lately and that as burroughs was very watchful id better quit for two or three days the tears were rising to his eyes but by putting his two clenched fists into his pockets he managed to hold them down perhaps mr hamlins soft hand on his head assisted him mr hamlin took from his pocket a notebook and tearing out a leaf sat down again and began to write on his knee after a pause leonidas said  was you ever in love mr hamlin  never said mr hamlin quietly continuing to write but now you speak of it its a longfelt want in my nature that i intend to supply some day but not until ive made my pile and dont you either he continued writing for it was this gentlemans peculiarity to talk without apparently the slightest concern whether anybody else spoke whether he was listened to or whether his remarks were at all relevant to the case yet he was always listened to for that reason when he had finished writing he folded up the paper put it in an envelope and addressed it  shall i take it to her said leonidas eagerly  its not for her its for himmr burroughs said mr hamlin quietly  the boy drew back to get him out of the way added hamlin explanatorily when he gets it lightning wouldnt keep him here now how to send it he said thoughtfully  you might leave it at the postoffice said leonidas timidly he always goes there to watch his wifes letters  for the first time in their interview mr hamlin distinctly laughed  your head is level leo and ill do it now the best thing you can do is to follow mrs burroughss advice quit going to the house for a day or two he walked towards his horse the boys face sank but he kept up bravely and will i see you again he said wistfully  mr hamlin lowered his face so near the boys that leonidas could see himself in the brown depths of mr hamlins eyes i hope you will he said gravely he mounted shook the boys hand and rode away in the lengthening shadows then leonidas walked sadly home  there was no need for him to keep his promise for the next morning the family were stirred by the announcement that mr and mrs burroughs had left casket ridge that night by the down stage for sacramento and that the house was closed there were various rumors concerning the reason of this sudden departure but only one was persistent and borne out by the postmaster it was that mr burroughs had received that afternoon an anonymous note that his wife was about to elope with the notorious san francisco gambler jack hamlin  but leonidas boone albeit half understanding kept his miserable secret with a still hopeful and trustful heart it grieved him a little that william henry was found a few days later dead with his head crushed yet it was not until years later when he had made a successful prospect on casket ridge that he met mr hamlin in san francisco and knew how he had played the part of mercury upon that heavenkissing hill     colonel starbottle for the plaintiff   it had been a day of triumph for colonel starbottle first for his personality as it would have been difficult to separate the colonels achievements from his individuality second for his oratorical abilities as a sympathetic pleader and third for his functions as the leading legal counsel for the eureka ditch company versus the state of california on his strictly legal performances in this issue i prefer not to speak there were those who denied them although the jury had accepted them in the face of the ruling of the half amused half cynical judge himself for an hour they had laughed with the colonel wept with him been stirred to personal indignation or patriotic exaltation by his passionate and lofty periodswhat else could they do than give him their verdict if it was alleged by some that the american eagle thomas jefferson and the resolutions of 98 had nothing whatever to do with the contest of a ditch company over a doubtfully worded legislative document that wholesale abuse of the state attorney and his political motives had not the slightest connection with the legal question raisedit was nevertheless generally accepted that the losing party would have been only too glad to have the colonel on their side and colonel starbottle knew this as perspiring florid and panting he rebuttoned the lower buttons of his blue frockcoat which had become loosed in an oratorical spasm and readjusted his oldfashioned spotless shirt frill above it as he strutted from the courtroom amidst the handshakings and acclamations of his friends  and here an unprecedented thing occurred the colonel absolutely declined spirituous refreshment at the neighboring palmetto saloon and declared his intention of proceeding directly to his office in the adjoining square nevertheless the colonel quitted the building alone and apparently unarmed except for his faithful goldheaded stick which hung as usual from his forearm the crowd gazed after him with undisguised admiration of this new evidence of his pluck it was remembered also that a mysterious note had been handed to him at the conclusion of his speechevidently a challenge from the state attorney it was quite plain that the colonela practiced duelistwas hastening home to answer it  but herein they were wrong the note was in a female hand and simply requested the colonel to accord an interview with the writer at the colonels office as soon as he left the court but it was an engagement that the colonelas devoted to the fair sex as he was to the codewas no less prompt in accepting he flicked away the dust from his spotless white trousers and varnished boots with his handkerchief and settled his black cravat under his byron collar as he neared his office he was surprised however on opening the door of his private office to find his visitor already there he was still more startled to find her somewhat past middle age and plainly attired but the colonel was brought up in a school of southern politeness already antique in the republic and his bow of courtesy belonged to the epoch of his shirt frill and strapped trousers no one could have detected his disappointment in his manner albeit his sentences were short and incomplete but the colonels colloquial speech was apt to be fragmentary incoherencies of his larger oratorical utterances  a thousand pardonsforerhaving kept a lady waitinger butercongratulations of friendsandercourtesy due to themerinterfered withthough perhaps only heightenedby procrastinationthe pleasure ofha and the colonel completed his sentence with a gallant wave of his fat but white and wellkept hand  yes i came to see you along o that speech of yours i was in court when i heard you gettin it off on that jury i says to myself thats the kind o lawyer i want a man thats flowery and convincin just the man to take up our case  ah its a matter of business i see said the colonel inwardly relieved but externally careless andermay i ask the nature of the case  well its a breachopromise suit said the visitor calmly  if the colonel had been surprised before he was now really startled and with an added horror that required all his politeness to conceal breachofpromise cases were his peculiar aversion he had always held them to be a kind of litigation which could have been obviated by the prompt killing of the masculine offenderin which case he would have gladly defended the killer but a suit for damagesdamageswith the reading of loveletters before a hilarious jury and court was against all his instincts his chivalry was outraged his sense of humor was small and in the course of his career he had lost one or two important cases through an unexpected development of this quality in a jury  the woman had evidently noticed his hesitation but mistook its cause it aint mebut my darter  the colonel recovered his politeness ah i am relieved my dear madam i could hardly conceive a man ignorant enough toererthrow away such evident good fortuneor base enough to deceive the trustfulness of womanhoodmatured and experienced only in the chivalry of our sex ha  the woman smiled grimly yesits my darter zaidee hookerso ye might spare some of them pretty speeches for herbefore the jury  the colonel winced slightly before this doubtful prospect but smiled ha yescertainlythe jury butermy dear lady need we go as far as that can not this affair be settlederout of court could not thiserindividualbe admonishedtold that he must give satisfactionpersonal satisfactionfor his dastardly conducttoernear relativeor even valued personal friend theerarrangements necessary for that purpose i myself would undertake  he was quite sincere indeed his small black eyes shone with that fire which a pretty woman or an affair of honor could alone kindle the visitor stared vacantly at him and said slowly and what good is that goin to do us  compel him toerperform his promise said the colonel leaning back in his chair  ketch him doin it she exclaimed scornfully nothat aint wot were after we must make him pay damagesand nothin short o that  the colonel bit his lip i suppose he said gloomily you have documentary evidencewritten promises and protestationserer loveletters in fact  nonary a letter ye see thats jest itand thats where you come in youve got to convince that jury yourself youve got to show what it istell the whole story your own way lord to a man like you thats nothin  startling as this admission might have been to any other lawyer starbottle was absolutely relieved by it the absence of any mirthprovoking correspondence and the appeal solely to his own powers of persuasion actually struck his fancy he lightly put aside the compliment with a wave of his white hand  of course he said confidently there is strongly presumptive and corroborative evidence perhaps you can give meera brief outline of the affair  zaidee kin do that straight enough i reckon said the woman what i want to know first is kin you take the case  the colonel did not hesitate his curiosity was piqued i certainly can i have no doubt your daughter will put me in possession of sufficient facts and detailsto constitute what we callera brief  she kin be brief enoughor long enoughfor the matter of that said the woman rising the colonel accepted this implied witticism with a smile  and when may i have the pleasure of seeing her he asked politely  well i reckon as soon as i can trot out and call her shes just outside meanderin in the roadkinder shy ye know at first  she walked to the door the astounded colonel nevertheless gallantly accompanied her as she stepped out into the street and called shrilly you zaidee  a young girl here apparently detached herself from a tree and the ostentatious perusal of an old election poster and sauntered down towards the office door like her mother she was plainly dressed unlike her she had a pale rather refined face with a demure mouth and downcast eyes this was all the colonel saw as he bowed profoundly and led the way into his office for she accepted his salutations without lifting her head he helped her gallantly to a chair on which she seated herself sideways somewhat ceremoniously with her eyes following the point of her parasol as she traced a pattern on the carpet a second chair offered to the mother that lady however declined i reckon to leave you and zaidee together to talk it out she said turning to her daughter she added jest you tell him all zaidee and before the colonel could rise again disappeared from the room in spite of his professional experience starbottle was for a moment embarrassed the young girl however broke the silence without looking up  adoniram k hotchkiss she began in a monotonous voice as if it were a recitation addressed to the public first began to take notice of me a year ago arter thatoff and on  one moment interrupted the astounded colonel do you mean hotchkiss the president of the ditch company he had recognized the name of a prominent citizena rigid ascetic taciturn middleaged mana deaconand more than that the head of the company he had just defended it seemed inconceivable  thats him she continued with eyes still fixed on the parasol and without changing her monotonous toneoff and on ever since most of the time at the freewill baptist churchat morning service prayermeetings and such and at homeoutsideerin the road  is it this gentlemanmr adoniram k hotchkisswhoerpromised marriage stammered the colonel  yes  the colonel shifted uneasily in his chair most extraordinary foryou seemy dear young ladythis becomesaermost delicate affair  thats what maw said returned the young woman simply yet with the faintest smile playing around her demure lips and downcast cheek  i mean said the colonel with a pained yet courteous smile that thisergentlemanis in facterone of my clients  thats what maw said too and of course your knowing him will make it all the easier for you  a slight flush crossed the colonels cheek as he returned quickly and a little stiffly on the contraryerit may make it impossible for me toeract in this matter  the girl lifted her eyes the colonel held his breath as the long lashes were raised to his level even to an ordinary observer that sudden revelation of her eyes seemed to transform her face with subtle witchery they were large brown and soft yet filled with an extraordinary penetration and prescience they were the eyes of an experienced woman of thirty fixed in the face of a child what else the colonel saw there heaven only knows he felt his inmost secrets plucked from himhis whole soul laid barehis vanity belligerency gallantryeven his mediaeval chivalry penetrated and yet illuminated in that single glance and when the eyelids fell again he felt that a greater part of himself had been swallowed up in them  i beg your pardon he said hurriedly i meanthis matter may be arrangederamicably my interest withand as you wisely saymyerknowledge of my clientermr hotchkissmay effecta compromise  and damages said the young girl readdressing her parasol as if she had never looked up  the colonel winced anderundoubtedly compensationif you do not press a fulfillment of the promise unless he said with an attempted return to his former easy gallantry which however the recollection of her eyes made difficult it is a question oferthe affections  which asked his fair client softly  if you still love him explained the colonel actually blushing  zaidee again looked up again taking the colonels breath away with eyes that expressed not only the fullest perception of what he had said but of what he thought and had not said and with an added subtle suggestion of what he might have thought thats tellin she said dropping her long lashes again  the colonel laughed vacantly then feeling himself growing imbecile he forced an equally weak gravity pardon mei understand there are no letters may i know the way in which he formulated his declaration and promises  hymnbooks  i beg your pardon said the mystified lawyer  hymnbooksmarked words in them with penciland passed em on to me repeated zaidee like love dear precious sweet and blessed she added accenting each word with a push of her parasol on the carpet sometimes a whole line outer tate and bradyand solomons song you know and sich  i believe said the colonel loftily that theerphrases of sacred psalmody lend themselves to the language of the affections but in regard to the distinct promise of marriagewas thereerno other expression  marriage service in the prayerbooklines and words outer thatall marked zaidee replied  the colonel nodded naturally and approvingly very good were others cognizant of this were there any witnesses  of course not said the girl only me and him it was generally at churchtimeor prayermeeting once in passing the plate he slipped one o them peppermint lozenges with the letters stamped on it i love you for me to take  the colonel coughed slightly and you have the lozenge  i ate it  ah said the colonel after a pause he added delicately but were these attentionserconfined toersacred precincts did he meet you elsewhere  useter pass our house on the road returned the girl dropping into her monotonous recital and useter signal  ah signal repeated the colonel approvingly  yes hed say keerow and id say keeree suthing like a bird you know  indeed as she lifted her voice in imitation of the call the colonel thought it certainly very sweet and birdlike at least as she gave it with his remembrance of the grim deacon he had doubts as to the melodiousness of his utterance he gravely made her repeat it  and after that signal he added suggestively  hed pass on  the colonel again coughed slightly and tapped his desk with his penholder  were there any endearmentsercaressesersuch as taking your handerclasping your waist he suggested with a gallant yet respectful sweep of his white hand and bowing of his head erslight pressure of your fingers in the changes of a dancei mean he corrected himself with an apologetic coughin the passing of the plate  no he was not what youd call fond returned the girl  ah adoniram k hotchkiss was not fond in the ordinary acceptance of the word noted the colonel with professional gravity  she lifted her disturbing eyes and again absorbed his in her own she also said yes although her eyes in their mysterious prescience of all he was thinking disclaimed the necessity of any answer at all he smiled vacantly there was a long pause on which she slowly disengaged her parasol from the carpet pattern and stood up  i reckon thats about all she said  eryesbut one moment began the colonel vaguely he would have liked to keep her longer but with her strange premonition of him he felt powerless to detain her or explain his reason for doing so he instinctively knew she had told him all his professional judgment told him that a more hopeless case had never come to his knowledge yet he was not daunted only embarrassed no matter he said of course i shall have to consult with you again  her eyes again answered that she expected he would and she added simply when  in the course of a day or two he replied quickly i will send you word  she turned to go in his eagerness to open the door for her he upset his chair and with some confusion that was actually youthful he almost impeded her movements in the hall and knocked his broadbrimmed panama hat from his bowing hand in a final gallant sweep yet as her small trim youthful figure with its simple leghorn straw hat confined by a blue bow under her round chin passed away before him she looked more like a child than ever  the colonel spent that afternoon in making diplomatic inquiries he found his youthful client was the daughter of a widow who had a small ranch on the crossroads near the new freewill baptist churchthe evident theatre of this pastoral they led a secluded life the girl being little known in the town and her beauty and fascination apparently not yet being a recognized fact the colonel felt a pleasurable relief at this and a general satisfaction he could not account for his few inquiries concerning mr hotchkiss only confirmed his own impressions of the alleged lovera seriousminded practically abstracted man abstentive of youthful society and the last man apparently capable of levity of the affections or serious flirtation the colonel was mystified but determined of purpose whatever that purpose might have been  the next day he was at his office at the same hour he was aloneas usualthe colonels office being really his private lodgings disposed in connecting rooms a single apartment reserved for consultation he had no clerk his papers and briefs being taken by his faithful bodyservant and exslave jim to another firm who did his office work since the death of major stryker the colonels only law partner who fell in a duel some years previous with a fine constancy the colonel still retained his partners name on his doorplate and it was alleged by the superstitious kept a certain invincibility also through the manes of that lamented and somewhat feared man  the colonel consulted his watch whose heavy gold case still showed the marks of a providential interference with a bullet destined for its owner and replaced it with some difficulty and shortness of breath in his fob at the same moment he heard a step in the passage and the door opened to adoniram k hotchkiss the colonel was impressed he had a duelists respect for punctuality  the man entered with a nod and the expectant inquiring look of a busy man as his feet crossed that sacred threshold the colonel became all courtesy he placed a chair for his visitor and took his hat from his half reluctant hand he then opened a cupboard and brought out a bottle of whiskey and two glasses  aerslight refreshment mr hotchkiss he suggested politely  i never drink replied hotchkiss with the severe attitude of a total abstainer  ahernot the finest bourbon whiskey selected by a kentucky friend no pardon me a cigar thenthe mildest havana  i do not use tobacco nor alcohol in any form repeated hotchkiss ascetically i have no foolish weaknesses  the colonels moist beady eyes swept silently over his clients sallow face he leaned back comfortably in his chair and half closing his eyes as in dreamy reminiscence said slowly your reply mr hotchkiss reminds me ofersinglar circumstance thateroccurred in point of factat the st charles hotel new orleans pinkey hornblowerpersonal friendinvited senator doolittle to join him in social glass received singlarly enough reply similar to yours dont drink nor smoke said pinkey gad sir you must be mighty sweet on the ladies ha the colonel paused long enough to allow the faint flush to pass from hotchkisss cheek and went on half closing his eyes i allow no man sir to discuss my personal habits declared doolittle over his shirt collar then i reckon shootin must be one of those habits said pinkey coolly both men drove out on the shell road back of cemetery next morning pinkey put bullet at twelve paces through doolittles temple poor doo never spoke again left three wives and seven children they saytwo of em black  i got a note from you this morning said hotchkiss with badly concealed impatience i suppose in reference to our case you have taken judgment i believe  the colonel without replying slowly filled a glass of whiskey and water for a moment he held it dreamily before him as if still engaged in gentle reminiscences called up by the act then tossing it off he wiped his lips with a large white handkerchief and leaning back comfortably in his chair said with a wave of his hand the interview i requested mr hotchkiss concerns a subjectwhich i may say isererat present not of a public or business naturealthough later it might becomeererboth it is an affair of someerdelicacy  the colonel paused and mr hotchkiss regarded him with increased impatience the colonel however continued with unchanged deliberation it concernserera young ladya beautiful highsouled creature sir who apart from her personal lovelinessereri may say is of one of the first families of missouri andernot remotely connected by marriage with one oferermy boyhoods dearest friends the latter i grieve to say was a pure invention of the colonelsan oratorical addition to the scanty information he had obtained the previous day the young lady he continued blandly enjoys the further distinction of being the object of such attention from you as would make this interviewreallya confidential mattererer among friends andererrelations in present and future i need not say that the lady i refer to is miss zaidee juno hooker only daughter of almira ann hooker relict of jefferson brown hooker formerly of boone county kentucky and latterly oferpike county missouri  the sallow ascetic hue of mr hotchkisss face had passed through a livid and then a greenish shade and finally settled into a sullen red whats all this about he demanded roughly  the least touch of belligerent fire came into starbottles eye but his bland courtesy did not change i believe he said politely i have made myself clear as betweenergentlemen though perhaps not as clear as i should toererjury  mr hotchkiss was apparently struck with some significance in the lawyers reply i dont know he said in a lower and more cautious voice what you mean by what you call my attentions toany oneor how it concerns you i have not exchanged half a dozen words withthe person you namehave never written her a linenor even called at her house  he rose with an assumption of ease pulled down his waistcoat buttoned his coat and took up his hat the colonel did not move  i believe i have already indicated my meaning in what i have called your attentions said the colonel blandly and given you my concern for speaking aserermutual friend as to your statement of your relations with miss hooker i may state that it is fully corroborated by the statement of the young lady herself in this very office yesterday  then what does this impertinent nonsense mean why am i summoned here demanded hotchkiss furiously  because said the colonel deliberately that statement is infamouslyyes damnably to your discredit sir  mr hotchkiss was here seized by one of those impotent and inconsistent rages which occasionally betray the habitually cautious and timid man he caught up the colonels stick which was lying on the table at the same moment the colonel without any apparent effort grasped it by the handle to mr hotchkisss astonishment the stick separated in two pieces leaving the handle and about two feet of narrow glittering steel in the colonels hand the man recoiled dropping the useless fragment the colonel picked it up fitted the shining blade in it clicked the spring and then rising with a face of courtesy yet of unmistakably genuine pain and with even a slight tremor in his voice said gravely  mr hotchkiss i owe you a thousand apologies sir thatera weapon should be drawn by meeven through your own inadvertenceunder the sacred protection of my roof and upon an unarmed man i beg your pardon sir and i even withdraw the expressions which provoked that inadvertence nor does this apology prevent you from holding me responsiblepersonally responsibleelsewhere for an indiscretion committed in behalf of a ladymyerclient  your client do you mean you have taken her case you the counsel for the ditch company asked mr hotchkiss in trembling indignation  having won your case sir replied the colonel coolly theerusages of advocacy do not prevent me from espousing the cause of the weak and unprotected  we shall see sir said hotchkiss grasping the handle of the door and backing into the passage there are other lawyers who  permit me to see you out interrupted the colonel rising politely  will be ready to resist the attacks of blackmail continued hotchkiss retreating along the passage  and then you will be able to repeat your remarks to me in the street continued the colonel bowing as he persisted in following his visitor to the door  but here mr hotchkiss quickly slammed it behind him and hurried away the colonel returned to his office and sitting down took a sheet of letterpaper bearing the inscription starbottle and stryker attorneys and counselors and wrote the following lines   hooker versus hotchkiss  dear madamhaving had a visit from the defendant in above we should be pleased to have an interview with you at two p m tomorrow  your obedient servants  starbottle and stryker   this he sealed and dispatched by his trusted servant jim and then devoted a few moments to reflection it was the custom of the colonel to act first and justify the action by reason afterwards  he knew that hotchkiss would at once lay the matter before rival counsel he knew that they would advise him that miss hooker had no casethat she would be nonsuited on her own evidence and he ought not to compromise but be ready to stand trial he believed however that hotchkiss feared such exposure and although his own instincts had been at first against this remedy he was now instinctively in favor of it he remembered his own power with a jury his vanity and his chivalry alike approved of this heroic method he was bound by no prosaic factshe had his own theory of the case which no mere evidence could gainsay in fact mrs hookers admission that he was to tell the story in his own way actually appeared to him an inspiration and a prophecy  perhaps there was something else due possibly to the ladys wonderful eyes of which he had thought much yet it was not her simplicity that affected him solely on the contrary it was her apparent intelligent reading of the character of her recreant loverand of his own of all the colonels previous light or serious loves none had ever before flattered him in that way and it was this combined with the respect which he had held for their professional relations that precluded his having a more familiar knowledge of his client through serious questioning or playful gallantry i am not sure it was not part of the charm to have a rustic femme incomprise as a client  nothing could exceed the respect with which he greeted her as she entered his office the next day he even affected not to notice that she had put on her best clothes and he made no doubt appeared as when she had first attracted the mature yet faithless attentions of deacon hotchkiss at church a white virginal muslin was belted around her slim figure by a blue ribbon and her leghorn hat was drawn around her oval cheek by a bow of the same color she had a southern girls narrow feet encased in white stockings and kid slippers which were crossed primly before her as she sat in a chair supporting her arm by her faithful parasol planted firmly on the floor a faint odor of southernwood exhaled from her and oddly enough stirred the colonel with a faroff recollection of a pineshaded sundayschool on a georgia hillside and of his first love aged ten in a short starched frock possibly it was the same recollection that revived something of the awkwardness he had felt then  he however smiled vaguely and sitting down coughed slightly and placed his fingertips together i have had anerinterview with mr hotchkiss butierregret to say there seems to be no prospect ofercompromise  he paused and to his surprise her listless company face lit up with an adorable smile of courseketch him she said was he mad when you told him she put her knees comfortably together and leaned forward for a reply  for all that wild horses could not have torn from the colonel a word about hotchkisss anger he expressed his intention of employing counseland defending a suit returned the colonel affably basking in her smile  she dragged her chair nearer his desk then youll fight him tooth and nail she asked eagerly youll show him up youll tell the whole story your own way youll give him fitsand youll make him pay sure she went on breathlessly  ierwill said the colonel almost as breathlessly  she caught his fat white hand which was lying on the table between her own and lifted it to her lips he felt her soft young fingers even through the lislethread gloves that encased them and the warm moisture of her lips upon his skin he felt himself flushingbut was unable to break the silence or change his position the next moment she had scuttled back with her chair to her old position  iercertainly shall do my best stammered the colonel in an attempt to recover his dignity and composure  thats enough youll do it said she enthusiastically lordy just you talk for me as ye did for his old ditch company and youll fetch itevery time why when you made that jury sit up the other daywhen you got that off about the merrikan flag waving equally over the rights of honest citizens banded together in peaceful commercial pursuits as well as over the fortress of official proflig  oligarchy murmured the colonel courteously  oligarchy repeated the girl quickly my breath was just took away i said to maw aint he too sweet for anything i did honest injin and when you rolled it all off at the endnever missing a word you didnt need to mark em in a lessonbook but had em all ready on your tongueand walked outwell i didnt know you nor the ditch company from adam but i could have just run over and kissed you there before the whole court  she laughed with her face glowing although her strange eyes were cast down alack the colonels face was equally flushed and his own beady eyes were on his desk to any other woman he would have voiced the banal gallantry that he should now himself look forward to that reward but the words never reached his lips he laughed coughed slightly and when he looked up again she had fallen into the same attitude as on her first visit with her parasol point on the floor  i must ask you toerdirect your memory toeranother point the breaking off of theerererengagement did heergive any reason for it or show any cause  no he never said anything returned the girl  not in his usual wayerno reproaches out of the hymnbookor the sacred writings  no he just quit  erceased his attentions said the colonel gravely and naturally youerwere not conscious of any cause for his doing so  the girl raised her wonderful eyes so suddenly and so penetratingly without replying in any other way that the colonel could only hurriedly say i see none of course  at which she rose the colonel rising also weshall begin proceedings at once i must however caution you to answer no questions nor say anything about this case to any one until you are in court  she answered his request with another intelligent look and a nod he accompanied her to the door as he took her proffered hand he raised the lislethread fingers to his lips with oldfashioned gallantry as if that act had condoned for his first omissions and awkwardness he became his oldfashioned self again buttoned his coat pulled out his shirt frill and strutted back to his desk  a day or two later it was known throughout the town that zaidee hooker had sued adoniram hotchkiss for breach of promise and that the damages were laid at five thousand dollars as in those bucolic days the western press was under the secure censorship of a revolver a cautious tone of criticism prevailed and any gossip was confined to personal expression and even then at the risk of the gossiper nevertheless the situation provoked the intensest curiosity the colonel was approacheduntil his statement that he should consider any attempt to overcome his professional secrecy a personal reflection withheld further advances the community were left to the more ostentatious information of the defendants counsel messrs kitcham and bilser that the case was ridiculous and rotten that the plaintiff would be nonsuited and the fireeating starbottle would be taught a lesson that he could not bully the law and there were some dark hints of a conspiracy it was even hinted that the case was the revengeful and preposterous outcome of the refusal of hotchkiss to pay starbottle an extravagant fee for his late services to the ditch company it is unnecessary to say that these words were not reported to the colonel it was however an unfortunate circumstance for the calmer ethical consideration of the subject that the church sided with hotchkiss as this provoked an equal adherence to the plaintiff and starbottle on the part of the larger body of nonchurchgoers who were delighted at a possible exposure of the weakness of religious rectitude ive allus had my suspicions o them early candlelight meetings down at that gospel shop said one critic and i reckon deacon hotchkiss didnt rope in the gals to attend jest for psalmsinging then for him to get up and leave the board afore the games finished and try to sneak out of it said an otheri suppose thats what they call religious  it was therefore not remarkable that the courthouse three weeks later was crowded with an excited multitude of the curious and sympathizing the fair plaintiff with her mother was early in attendance and under the colonels advice appeared in the same modest garb in which she had first visited his office this and her downcast modest demeanor were perhaps at first disappointing to the crowd who had evidently expected a paragon of loveliness in this circe of that grim ascetic defendant who sat beside his counsel but presently all eyes were fixed on the colonel who certainly made up in his appearance any deficiency of his fair client his portly figure was clothed in a blue dress coat with brass buttons a buff waistcoat which permitted his frilled shirtfront to become erectile above it a black satin stock which confined a boyish turneddown collar around his full neck and immaculate drill trousers strapped over varnished boots a murmur ran round the court old personally responsible has got his warpaint on the old warhorse is smelling powder were whispered comments yet for all that the most irreverent among them recognized vaguely in this bizarre figure something of an honored past in their countrys history and possibly felt the spell of old deeds and old names that had once thrilled their boyish pulses the new district judge returned colonel starbottles profoundly punctilious bow the colonel was followed by his negro servant carrying a parcel of hymnbooks and bibles who with a courtesy evidently imitated from his master placed one before the opposite counsel this after a first curious glance the lawyer somewhat superciliously tossed aside but when jim proceeding to the jurybox placed with equal politeness the remaining copies before the jury the opposite counsel sprang to his feet  i want to direct the attention of the court to this unprecedented tampering with the jury by this gratuitous exhibition of matter impertinent and irrelevant to the issue  the judge cast an inquiring look at colonel starbottle  may it please the court returned colonel starbottle with dignity ignoring the counsel the defendants counsel will observe that he is already furnished with the matterwhich i regret to say he has treatedin the presence of the courtand of his client a deacon of the churchwithergreat superciliousness when i state to your honor that the books in question are hymnbooks and copies of the holy scriptures and that they are for the instruction of the jury to whom i shall have to refer them in the course of my opening i believe i am within my rights  the act is certainly unprecedented said the judge dryly but unless the counsel for the plaintiff expects the jury to sing from these hymnbooks their introduction is not improper and i cannot admit the objection as defendants counsel are furnished with copies also they cannot plead surprise as in the introduction of new matter and as plaintiffs counsel relies evidently upon the jurys attention to his opening he would not be the first person to distract it after a pause he added addressing the colonel who remained standing the court is with you sir proceed  but the colonel remained motionless and statuesque with folded arms  i have overruled the objection repeated the judge you may go on  i am waiting your honor for theerwithdrawal by the defendants counsel of the word tampering as refers to myself and of impertinent as refers to the sacred volumes  the request is a proper one and i have no doubt will be acceded to returned the judge quietly the defendants counsel rose and mumbled a few words of apology and the incident closed there was however a general feeling that the colonel had in some way scored and if his object had been to excite the greatest curiosity about the books he had made his point  but impassive of his victory he inflated his chest with his right hand in the breast of his buttoned coat and began his usual high color had paled slightly but the small pupils of his prominent eyes glittered like steel the young girl leaned forward in her chair with an attention so breathless a sympathy so quick and an admiration so artless and unconscious that in an instant she divided with the speaker the attention of the whole assemblage it was very hot the court was crowded to suffocation even the open windows revealed a crowd of faces outside the building eagerly following the colonels words  he would remind the jury that only a few weeks ago he stood there as the advocate of a powerful company then represented by the present defendant he spoke then as the champion of strict justice against legal oppression no less should he today champion the cause of the unprotected and the comparatively defenselesssave for that paramount power which surrounds beauty and innocenceeven though the plaintiff of yesterday was the defendant of today as he approached the court a moment ago he had raised his eyes and beheld the starry flag flying from its dome and he knew that glorious banner was a symbol of the perfect equality under the constitution of the rich and the poor the strong and the weakan equality which made the simple citizen taken from the plough in the field the pick in the gulch or from behind the counter in the mining town who served on that jury the equal arbiters of justice with that highest legal luminary whom they were proud to welcome on the bench today the colonel paused with a stately bow to the impassive judge it was this he continued which lifted his heart as he approached the building and yethe had entered it with an uncertainhe might almost saya timid step and why he knew gentlemen he was about to confront a profoundaye a sacred responsibility those hymnbooks and holy writings handed to the jury were not as his honor had surmised for the purpose of enabling the jury to indulge inerpreliminary choral exercise he might indeed say alas not they were the damning incontrovertible proofs of the perfidy of the defendant and they would prove as terrible a warning to him as the fatal characters upon belshazzars wall there was a strong sensation hotchkiss turned a sallow green his lawyers assumed a careless smile  it was his duty to tell them that this was not one of those ordinary breachofpromise cases which were too often the occasion of ruthless mirth and indecent levity in the courtroom the jury would find nothing of that here there were no loveletters with the epithets of endearment nor those mystic crosses and ciphers which he had been credibly informed chastely hid the exchange of those mutual caresses known as kisses there was no cruel tearing of the veil from those sacred privacies of the human affection there was no forensic shouting out of those fond confidences meant only for one but there was he was shocked to say a new sacrilegious intrusion the weak pipings of cupid were mingled with the chorus of the saintsthe sanctity of the temple known as the meetinghouse was desecrated by proceedings more in keeping with the shrine of venus and the inspired writings themselves were used as the medium of amatory and wanton flirtation by the defendant in his sacred capacity as deacon  the colonel artistically paused after this thunderous denunciation the jury turned eagerly to the leaves of the hymnbooks but the larger gaze of the audience remained fixed upon the speaker and the girl who sat in rapt admiration of his periods after the hush the colonel continued in a lower and sadder voice there are perhaps few of us here gentlemenwith the exception of the defendantwho can arrogate to themselves the title of regular churchgoers or to whom these humbler functions of the prayermeeting the sundayschool and the bibleclass are habitually familiar yetmore solemnlydown in our hearts is the deep conviction of our shortcomings and failings and a laudable desire that others at least should profit by the teachings we neglect perhaps he continued closing his eyes dreamily there is not a man here who does not recall the happy days of his boyhood the rustic village spire the lessons shared with some artless village maiden with whom he later sauntered hand in hand through the woods as the simple rhyme rose upon their lips       always make it a point to have it a rule      never to be late at the sabbathschool  he would recall the strawberry feasts the welcome annual picnic redolent with hunks of gingerbread and sarsaparilla how would they feel to know that these sacred recollections were now forever profaned in their memory by the knowledge that the defendant was capable of using such occasions to make love to the larger girls and teachers whilst his artless companions were innocentlythe court will pardon me for introducing what i am credibly informed is the local expressiondoing gooseberry the tremulous flicker of a smile passed over the faces of the listening crowd and the colonel slightly winced but he recovered himself instantly and continued  my client the only daughter of a widowed motherwho has for years stemmed the varying tides of adversity in the western precincts of this townstands before you today invested only in her own innocence she wears noerrich gifts of her faithless admireris panoplied in no jewels rings nor mementos of affection such as lovers delight to hang upon the shrine of their affections hers is not the glory with which solomon decorated the queen of sheba though the defendant as i shall show later clothed her in the less expensive flowers of the kings poetry no gentlemen the defendant exhibited in this affair a certain frugality oferpecuniary investment which i am willing to admit may be commendable in his class his only gift was characteristic alike of his methods and his economy there is i understand a certain not unimportant feature of religious exercise known as taking a collection the defendant on this occasion by the mute presentation of a tin plate covered with baize solicited the pecuniary contributions of the faithful on approaching the plaintiff however he himself slipped a lovetoken upon the plate and pushed it towards her that lovetoken was a lozengea small disk i have reason to believe concocted of peppermint and sugar bearing upon its reverse surface the simple words i love you i have since ascertained that these disks may be bought for five cents a dozenor at considerably less than one half cent for the single lozenge yes gentlemen the words i love youthe oldest legend of all the refrain when the morning stars sang togetherwere presented to the plaintiff by a medium so insignificant that there is happily no coin in the republic low enough to represent its value  i shall prove to you gentlemen of the jury said the colonel solemnly drawing a bible from his coattail pocket that the defendant for the last twelve months conducted an amatory correspondence with the plaintiff by means of underlined words of sacred writ and church psalmody such as beloved precious and dearest occasionally appropriating whole passages which seemed apposite to his tender passion i shall call your attention to one of them the defendant while professing to be a total abstainera man who in my own knowledge has refused spirituous refreshment as an inordinate weakness of the fleshwith shameless hypocrisy underscores with his pencil the following passage and presents it to the plaintiff the gentlemen of the jury will find it in the song of solomon page 548 chapter ii verse 5 after a pause in which the rapid rustling of leaves was heard in the jurybox colonel starbottle declaimed in a pleading stentorian voice stay me witherflagons comfort me witherapplesfor i amersick of love yes gentlemenyes you may well turn from those accusing pages and look at the doublefaced defendant he desirestoerbestayed with flagons i am not aware at present what kind of liquor is habitually dispensed at these meetings and for which the defendant so urgently clamored but it will be my duty before this trial is over to discover it if i have to summon every barkeeper in this district for the moment i will simply call your attention to the quantity it is not a single drink that the defendant asks fornot a glass of light and generous wine to be shared with his inamorata but a number of flagons or vessels each possibly holding a pint measurefor himself  the smile of the audience had become a laugh the judge looked up warningly when his eye caught the fact that the colonel had again winced at this mirth he regarded him seriously mr hotchkisss counsel had joined in the laugh affectedly but hotchkiss himself sat ashy pale there was also a commotion in the jurybox a hurried turning over of leaves and an excited discussion  the gentlemen of the jury said the judge with official gravity will please keep order and attend only to the speeches of counsel any discussion here is irregular and premature and must be reserved for the juryroom after they have retired  the foreman of the jury struggled to his feet he was a powerful man with a goodhumored face and in spite of his unfelicitous nickname of the bonebreaker had a kindly simple but somewhat emotional nature nevertheless it appeared as if he were laboring under some powerful indignation  can we ask a question judge he said respectfully although his voice had the unmistakable western american ring in it as of one who was unconscious that he could be addressing any but his peers  yes said the judge goodhumoredly  were finding in this yere piece out o which the kernel hes just bin aquotin some language that me and my pardners allow hadnt orter be read out afore a young lady in court and we want to know of youez a farminded and impartial manef this is the reglar kind o book given to gals and babies down at the meetinhouse  the jury will please follow the counsels speech without comment said the judge briefly fully aware that the defendants counsel would spring to his feet as he did promptly  the court will allow us to explain to the gentlemen that the language they seem to object to has been accepted by the best theologians for the last thousand years as being purely mystic as i will explain later those are merely symbols of the church  of wot interrupted the foreman in deep scorn  of the church  we aint askin any questions o you and we aint takin any answers said the foreman sitting down abruptly  i must insist said the judge sternly that the plaintiffs counsel be allowed to continue his opening without interruption you to defendants counsel will have your opportunity to reply later  the counsel sank down in his seat with the bitter conviction that the jury was manifestly against him and the case as good as lost but his face was scarcely as disturbed as his clients who in great agitation had begun to argue with him wildly and was apparently pressing some point against the lawyers vehement opposal the colonels murky eyes brightened as he still stood erect with his hand thrust in his breast  it will be put to you gentlemen when the counsel on the other side refrains from mere interruption and confines himself to reply that my unfortunate client has no actionno remedy at lawbecause there were no spoken words of endearment but gentlemen it will depend upon you to say what are and what are not articulate expressions of love we all know that among the lower animals with whom you may possibly be called upon to classify the defendant there are certain signals more or less harmonious as the case may be the ass brays the horse neighs the sheep bleatsthe feathered denizens of the grove call to their mates in more musical roundelays these are recognized facts gentlemen which you yourselves as dwellers among nature in this beautiful land are all cognizant of they are facts that no one would denyand we should have a poor opinion of the ass who atersuch a supreme moment would attempt to suggest that his call was unthinking and without significance but gentlemen i shall prove to you that such was the foolish selfconvicting custom of the defendant with the greatest reluctance and theergreatest pain i succeeded in wresting from the maidenly modesty of my fair client the innocent confession that the defendant had induced her to correspond with him in these methods picture to yourself gentlemen the lonely moonlight road beside the widows humble cottage it is a beautiful night sanctified to the affections and the innocent girl is leaning from her casement presently there appears upon the road a slinking stealthy figure the defendant on his way to church true to the instruction she has received from him her lips part in the musical utterance the colonel lowered his voice in a faint falsetto presumably in fond imitation of his fair client keeree instantly the night becomes resonant with the impassioned reply the colonel here lifted his voice in stentorian tones keerow again as he passes rises the soft keeree again as his form is lost in the distance comes back the deep keerow  a burst of laughter long loud and irrepressible struck the whole courtroom and before the judge could lift his halfcomposed face and take his handkerchief from his mouth a faint keeree from some unrecognized obscurity of the courtroom was followed by a loud keerow from some opposite locality the sheriff will clear the court said the judge sternly but alas as the embarrassed and choking officials rushed hither and thither a soft keeree from the spectators at the window outside the courthouse was answered by a loud chorus of keerows from the opposite windows filled with onlookers again the laughter arose everywhereeven the fair plaintiff herself sat convulsed behind her handkerchief  the figure of colonel starbottle alone remained erectwhite and rigid and then the judge looking up sawwhat no one else in the court had seenthat the colonel was sincere and in earnest that what he had conceived to be the pleaders most perfect acting and most elaborate irony were the deep serious mirthless convictions of a man without the least sense of humor there was the respect of this conviction in the judges voice as he said to him gently you may proceed colonel starbottle  i thank your honor said the colonel slowly for recognizing and doing all in your power to prevent an interruption that during my thirty years experience at the bar i have never been subjected to without the privilege of holding the instigators thereof responsiblepersonally responsible it is possibly my fault that i have failed oratorically to convey to the gentlemen of the jury the full force and significance of the defendants signals i am aware that my voice is singularly deficient in producing either the dulcet tones of my fair client or the impassioned vehemence of the defendants response i will continued the colonel with a fatigued but blind fatuity that ignored the hurriedly knit brows and warning eyes of the judge try again the note uttered by my client lowering his voice to the faintest of falsettos was keeree the response was keerowow and the colonels voice fairly shook the dome above him  another uproar of laughter followed this apparently audacious repetition but was interrupted by an unlookedfor incident the defendant rose abruptly and tearing himself away from the withholding hand and pleading protestations of his counsel absolutely fled from the courtroom his appearance outside being recognized by a prolonged keerow from the bystanders which again and again followed him in the distance  in the momentary silence which followed the colonels voice was heard saying we rest here your honor and he sat down no less white but more agitated was the face of the defendants counsel who instantly rose  for some unexplained reason your honor my client desires to suspend further proceedings with a view to effect a peaceable compromise with the plaintiff as he is a man of wealth and position he is able and willing to pay liberally for that privilege while i as his counsel am still convinced of his legal irresponsibility as he has chosen publicly to abandon his rights here i can only ask your honors permission to suspend further proceedings until i can confer with colonel starbottle  as far as i can follow the pleadings said the judge gravely the case seems to be hardly one for litigation and i approve of the defendants course while i strongly urge the plaintiff to accept it  colonel starbottle bent over his fair client presently he rose unchanged in look or demeanor i yield your honor to the wishes of my client anderlady we accept  before the court adjourned that day it was known throughout the town that adoniram k hotchkiss had compromised the suit for four thousand dollars and costs  colonel starbottle had so far recovered his equanimity as to strut jauntily towards his office where he was to meet his fair client he was surprised however to find her already there and in company with a somewhat sheepishlooking young mana stranger if the colonel had any disappointment in meeting a third party to the interview his oldfashioned courtesy did not permit him to show it he bowed graciously and politely motioned them each to a seat  i reckoned id bring hiram round with me said the young lady lifting her searching eyes after a pause to the colonels though he was awful shy and allowed that you didnt know him from adam or even suspect his existence but i said thats just where you slip up hiram a powful man like the colonel knows everythingand ive seen it in his eye lordy she continued with a laugh leaning forward over her parasol as her eyes again sought the colonels dont you remember when you asked me if i loved that old hotchkiss and i told you thats tellin and you looked at melordy i knew then you suspected there was a hiram somewhere as good as if id told you now you jest get up hiram and give the colonel a good handshake for if it wasnt for him and his searchin ways and his awful power of language i wouldnt hev got that four thousand dollars out o that flirty fool hotchkissenough to buy a farm so as you and me could get married thats what you owe to him dont stand there like a stuck fool starin at him he wont eat youthough hes killed many a better man come have i got to do all the kissin  it is of record that the colonel bowed so courteously and so profoundly that he managed not merely to evade the proffered hand of the shy hiram but to only lightly touch the franker and more impulsive fingertips of the gentle zaidee ieroffer my sincerest congratulationsthough i think youeroverestimatemyerpowers of penetration unfortunately a pressing engagement which may oblige me also to leave town tonight forbids my saying more i haveerleft theerbusiness settlement of thisercase in the hands of the lawyers who do my office work and who will show you every attention and now let me wish you a very good afternoon  nevertheless the colonel returned to his private room and it was nearly twilight when the faithful jim entered to find him sitting meditatively before his desk fo god kernel i hope dey aint nuffin de matter but yous lookin mighty solemn i aint seen you look dat way kernel since de day pooh massa stryker was fetched home shot froo de head  hand me down the whiskey jim said the colonel rising slowly  the negro flew to the closet joyfully and brought out the bottle the colonel poured out a glass of the spirit and drank it with his old deliberation  youre quite right jim he said putting down his glass but imergetting oldandsomehow i am missing poor stryker damnably     the landlord of the big flume hotel   the big flume stagecoach had just drawn up at the big flume hotel simultaneously with the ringing of a large dinner bell in the two hands of a negro waiter who by certain gyrations of the bell was trying to impart to his performance that picturesque elegance and harmony which the instrument and its purpose lacked for the refreshment thus proclaimed was only the ordinary station dinner protracted at big flume for three quarters of an hour to allow for the arrival of the connecting mail from sacramento although the repast was of a nature that seldom prevailed upon the traveler to linger the full period over its details the ordinary cravings of hunger were generally satisfied in half an hour and the remaining minutes were employed by the passengers in drowning the memory of their meal in drinks at the bar in smoking and even in a hurried game of old sledge or dominoes yet today the deserted table was still occupied by a belated traveler and a ladyseparated by a wilderness of empty disheswho had arrived after the stagecoach observing which the landlord perhaps touched by this unwonted appreciation of his fare moved forward to give them his personal attention  he was a man however who seemed to be singularly deficient in those supreme qualities which in the west have exalted the ability to keep a hotel into a proverbial synonym for superexcellence he had little or no innovating genius no trade devices no assumption no faculty for advertisement no progressiveness and no racket he had the tolerant goodhumor of the southwestern pioneer to whom cyclones famine drought floods pestilence and savages were things to be accepted and whom disaster if it did not stimulate certainly did not appall he received the insults complaints and criticisms of hurried and hungry passengers the comments and threats of the stage company as he had submitted to the aggressions of a stupid unjust but overruling naturewith unshaken calm perhaps herein lay his strength people were obliged to submit to him and his hotel as part of the unfinished civilization and they even saw something humorous in his impassiveness those who preferred to remonstrate with him emerged from the discussion with the general feeling of having been played with by a largehearted and paternally disposed bear tall and longlimbed with much strength in his lazy muscles there was also a prevailing impression that this feeling might be intensified if the discussion were ever carried to physical contention of his personal history it was known only that he had emigrated from wisconsin in 1852 that he had calmly unyoked his ox teams at big flume then a trackless wilderness and on the opening of a wagon road to the new mines had built a wayside station which eventually developed into the present hotel he had been divorced in a western state by his wife rosalie locally known as the prairie flower of elkham creek for incompatibility of temper her temper was not stated  such was abner langworthy the proprietor as he moved leisurely down towards the lady guest who was nearest and who was sitting with her back to the passage between the tables stopping occasionally to professionally adjust the tablecloths and glasses he at last reached her side  ef theres anythin more ye want that ye aint seein maam he beganand stopped suddenly for the lady had looked up at the sound of his voice it was his divorced wife whom he had not seen since their separation the recognition was instantaneous mutual and characterized by perfect equanimity on both sides  well i wanter know said the lady although the exclamation point was purely conventional abner langworthy though perhaps ive no call to say abner  same to you rosaliethough i say it too returned the landlord but hol on just a minit he moved forward to the other guest put the same perfunctory question regarding his needs received a negative answer and then returned to the lady and dropped into a chair opposite to her  youre looking peart andfleshy he said resignedly as if he were tolerating his own conventional politeness with his other difficulties unless he added cautiously youre takin on some new disease  no im fairly comfble responded the lady calmly and youre gettin on in the vale ez is naturalthough you still kind o run to bone as you used  there was not a trace of malevolence in either of their comments only a resigned recognition of certain unpleasant truths which seemed to have been habitual to both of them mr langworthy paused to flick away some flies from the butter with his professional napkin and resumed  it must be a matter o five years sens i last saw ye isnt itin court arter you got the decreeyou remember  yesthe 28th o july 51 i paid lawyer hoskinss bill that very daythats how i remember returned the lady youve got a big business here she continued glancing round the room i reckon youre makin it pay dont seem to be in your line though but then thar wasnt many things that was  nothats so responded mr langworthy nodding his head as assenting to an undeniable proposition and youi suppose youre gettin on too i reckon youreermarriedehwith a slight suggestion of putting the question delicately  the lady nodded ignoring the hesitation yes let me see its just three years and three days constantine byersi dont reckon you know himfrom milwaukee timber merchant standin timbers his specialty  and i reckon hessatisfactory  yes mr byers is a good providerand handy and you i should say youd want a wife in this business  mr langworthys serious halfperfunctory manner here took on an appearance of interest yesive bin thinkin that way thars a young woman helpin in the kitchen ez might do though im not certain and i aint lettin on anything as yet you might take a look at her rosaliei orter say mrs byers ez isand kinder size her up and gimme the result its still wantin seven minutes o schedule time afore the stage goes andif you aint wantin more fooddelicately as became a landlordand aint got anythin else to do it might pass the time  strange as it may seem mrs byers here displayed an equal animation in her fresh face as she rose promptly to her feet and began to rearrange her dust cloak around her buxom figure i dont mind abner she said and i dont think that mr byers would mind either then seeing langworthy hesitating at the latter unexpected suggestion she added confidently and i wouldnt mind even if he did for im sure if i dont know the kind o woman youd be likely to need i dont know who would only last week i was sayin like that to mr byers  to mr byers said abner with some surprise  yesto him i said weve been married three years constantine and ef i dont know by this time what kind o woman you need nowand might need in futurewhy thar aint much use in matrimony  you was always wise rosalie said abner with reminiscent appreciation  i was always there abner returned mrs byers with a complacent show of dimples which she however chastened into that resignation which seemed characteristic of the pair lets see your intendedas might be  thus supported mr langworthy led mrs byers into the hall through a crowd of loungers into a smaller hall and there opened the door of the kitchen it was a large room whose windows were half darkened by the encompassing pines which still pressed around the house on the scantily cleared site a number of men and women among them a chinaman and a negro were engaged in washing dishes and other culinary duties and beside the window stood a young blonde girl who was wiping a tin pan which she was also using to hide a burst of laughter evidently caused by the abrupt entrance of her employer a quantity of fluffy hair and part of a white bared arm were nevertheless visible outside the disk and mrs byers gathered from the direction of mr langworthys eyes assisted by a slight nudge from his elbow that this was the selected fair one his feeble explanatory introduction addressed to the occupants generally just showing the house to mrserdusenberry convinced her that the circumstances of his having been divorced he had not yet confided to the young woman as he turned almost immediately away mrs byers in following him managed to get a better look at the girl as she was exchanging some facetious remark to a neighbor mr langworthy did not speak until they had reached the deserted diningroom again  well he said briefly glancing at the clock what did ye think o mary ellen  to any ordinary observer the girl in question would have seemed the least fitted in age sobriety of deportment and administrative capacity to fill the situation thus proposed for her but mrs byers was not an ordinary observer and her auditor was not an ordinary listener  shes older than she gives herself out to be said mrs byers tentatively and them kitten ways dont amount to much  mr langworthy nodded had mrs byers discovered a homicidal tendency in mary ellen he would have been equally unmoved  she dont handsome much continued mrs byers musingly but  i never was keen on good looks in a woman rosalie you know that mrs byers received the equivocal remark unemotionally and returned to the subject  well she said contemplatively i should think you could make her suit  mr langworthy nodded with resigned toleration of all that might have influenced her judgment and his own i was wantin a farminded opinion rosalie and you happened along jest in time kin i put up anythin in the way of food for ye he added as a stir outside and the words all aboard proclaimed the departing of the stagecoachan orange or a hunk o gingerbread freshly baked  thank ye kindly abner but i shant be usin anythin afore supper responded mrs byers as they passed out into the veranda beside the waiting coach  mr langworthy helped her to her seat ef youre passin this way aginhe hesitated delicately  ill drop in or i reckon mr byers might he havin business along the road returned mrs byers with a cheerful nod as the coach rolled away and the landlord of the big flume hotel reentered his house  for the next three weeks however it did not appear that mr langworthy was in any hurry to act upon the advice of his former wife his relations to mary ellen budd were characterized by his usual tolerance to his employees failingswhich in mary ellens case included many breakagesbut were not marked by the invasion of any warmer feeling or a desire for confidences the only perceptible divergence from his regular habits was a disposition to be on the veranda at the arrival of the stagecoach and when his duties permitted this a cautious survey of his female guests at the beginning of dinner this probably led to his more or less ignoring any peculiarities in his masculine patrons or their claims to his personal attention particularly so in the case of a redbearded man in a long linen duster both heavily freighted with the red dust of the stage road which seemed to have invaded his very eyes as he watched the landlord closely towards the close of the dinner when abner accompanied by a negro waiter after his usual custom passed down each side of the long table collecting payment for the meal the stranger looked up you air the landlord of this hotel i reckon  i am said abner tolerantly  id like a word or two with ye  but abner had been obliged to have a formula for such occasions yell pay for yer dinner first he said submissively but firmly and make yer remarks agin the food arter  the stranger flushed quickly and his eye took an additional shade of red but meeting abners serious gray ones he contented himself with ostentatiously taking out a handful of gold and silver and paying his bill abner passed on but after dinner was over he found the stranger in the hall  ye pulled me up rather short in thar said the man gloomily but its just as well as the talk i was wantin with ye was kinder betwixt and between ourselves and not hotel business my names byers and my wife let on she met ye down here  for the first time it struck abner as incongruous that another man should call rosalie his wife although the fact of her remarriage had been made sufficiently plain to him he accepted it as he would an earthquake or any other dislocation with his usual tolerant smile and held out his hand  mr byers took it seemingly mollified and yet inwardly disturbedmore even than was customary in abners guests after dinner  have a drink with me he suggested although it had struck him that mr byers had been drinking before dinner  im agreeable responded byers promptly but with a glance at the crowded barroom couldnt we go somewhere jest you and me and have a quiet confab  i reckon but ye must wait till we get her off  mr byers started slightly but it appeared that the impedimental sex in this case was the coach which after a slight feminine hesitation was at last started whereupon mr langworthy followed by a negro with a tray bearing a decanter and glasses grasped mr byerss arm and walked along a small side veranda the depth of the house stepped off and apparently plunged with his guest into the primeval wilderness  it has already been indicated that the site of the big flume hotel had been scantily cleared but mr byers backwoodsman though he was was quite unprepared for so abrupt a change the hotel with its noisy crowd and garish newness although scarcely a dozen yards away seemed lost completely to sight and sound a slight fringe of old tin cans broken china shavings and even of the longdried chips of the felled trees once crossed the two men were alone from the tray deposited at the foot of an enormous pine they took the decanter filled their glasses and then disposed of themselves comfortably against a spreading root the curling tail of a squirrel disappeared behind them the faroff tap of a woodpecker accented the loneliness and then almost magically as it seemed the thin veneering of civilization on the two men seemed to be cast off like the bark of the trees around them and they lounged before each other in aboriginal freedom mr byers removed his restraining duster and undercoat mr langworthy resigned his dirty white jacket his collar and unloosed a suspender with which he played  would it be a fair question between two farminded men ez hez lived alone said mr byers with a gravity so supernatural that it could be referred only to liquor to ask ye in what sort o way did mrs byers show her temper  show her temper echoed abner vacantly  yesin course i mean when you and mrs byers waswasone you know the divorce was for incompatibility of temper  but she got the divorce from me so i reckon i had the temper said langworthy with great simplicity  whaat said mr byers putting down his glass and gazing with drunken gravity at the sadeyed yet goodhumoredly tolerant man before him youyou had the temper  i reckon thats what the court allowed said abner simply  mr byers stared then after a moments pause he nodded with a significant yet relieved face yes i see in course times when youd histed too much o this corn juice lifting up his glass inside yeye sorter bust out ravin  but abner shook his head i wuz a total abstainer in them days he said quietly  mr byers got unsteadily on his legs and looked around him wot might hev bin the general gait o your temper pardner he said in a hoarse whisper  dont know i reckon thats jest whar the incompatibility kem in  and when she hove plates at your head wot did you do  she didnt hove no plates said abner gravely did she say she did  no no returned byers hastily in crimson confusion i kinder got it mixed with suthin else he waved his hand in a lordly way as if dismissing the subject howsumever you and her is off anyway he added with badly concealed anxiety  i reckon theres the decree returned abner with his usual resigned acceptance of the fact  mrs byers wuz allowin ye wuz thinkin of a second hows that comin on  jest whar it was returned abner i aint doin anything yet ye see ive got to tell the gal naterally that im divorced and as that isnt known hereabouts i dont keer to do so till im pretty certain and then in course ive got to  why hev ye got to asked byers abruptly  because it wouldnt be on the square with the girl said abner how would you like it if mrs byers had never told you shed been married to me and spose youd happen to hev bin a divorced man and hadnt told her eh well he continued sinking back resignedly against the tree i aint sayin anythin but shed hev got another divorce and from you on the spotyou bet  well all i kin say is said mr byers lifting his voice excitedly thatbut he stopped short and was about to fill his glass again from the decanter when the hand of abner stopped him  yeve got ez much ez ye kin carry now byers he said slowly and thats about ez much ez i allow a man to take in at the big flume hotel treatin is treatin hospitality is hospitality ef you and me was squattin out on the prairie id let you fill your skin with that pizen and wrap ye up in yer blankets afterwards but here at big flume the stage kempenny and the wimen and children passengers hez their rights he paused a moment and added and so i reckon hez mrs byers and i aint goin to send you home to her outer my house blind drunk its mighty rough on you and me i know but theres a lot o roughness in this world ez hez to be got over and life ez far ez i kin see aint all a clearin  perhaps it was his goodhumored yet firm determination perhaps it was his resigned philosophy but something in the speakers manner affected mr byerss alcoholic susceptibility and hastened his descent from the passionate heights of intoxication to the maudlin stage whither he was drifting the fire of his red eyes became filmed and dim an equal moisture gathered in his throat as he pressed abners hand with drunken fervor thash so your thinking o me an mish byersh is like troo fren he said thickly i wosh only goin to shay that wotever mish byersh wosheven if she wosh wife o yoursshe woshnoble woman such a woman continued mr byers dreamily regarding space cant have too many husbands  you jest sit back here a minit and have a quiet smoke till i come back said abner handing him his tobacco plug ive got to give the butcher his orderbut i wont be a minit he secured the decanter as he spoke and evading an apparent disposition of his companion to fall upon his neck made his way with long strides to the hotel as mr byers sinking back against the trees began certain futile efforts to light his unfilled pipe  whether abners attendance on the butcher was merely an excuse to withdraw with the decanter i cannot say he however dispatched his business quickly and returned to the tree but to his surprise mr byers was no longer there he explored the adjacent woodland with nonsuccess and no reply to his shouting annoyed but not alarmed as it seemed probable that the missing man had fallen in a drunken sleep in some hidden shadows he returned to the house when it occurred to him that byers might have sought the barroom for some liquor but he was still more surprised when the barkeeper volunteered the information that he had seen mr byers hurriedly pass down the side veranda into the highroad an hour later this was corroborated by an arriving teamster who had passed a man answering to the description of byers mor n half full staggeringly but hurriedly walking along the road two miles back there seemed to be no doubt that the missing man had taken himself off in a fit of indignation or of extreme thirst either hypothesis was disagreeable to abner in his queer sense of responsibility to mrs byers but he accepted it with his usual goodhumored resignation  yet it was difficult to conceive what connection this episode had in his mind with his suspended attention to mary ellen or why it should determine his purpose but he had a logic of his own and it seemed to have demonstrated to him that he must propose to the girl at once this was no easy matter however he had never shown her any previous attention and her particular functions in the hotelthe charge of the few bedrooms for transient guestsseldom brought him in contact with her his interview would have to appear to be a business onewhich however he wished to avoid from a delicate consciousness of its truth while making up his mind for a few days he contented himself with gravely regarding her in his usual resigned tolerant way whenever he passed her unfortunately the first effect of this was an audible giggle from mary ellen later some confusion and anxiety in her manner and finally a demeanor of resentment and defiance  this was so different from what he had expected that he was obliged to precipitate matters the next day was sundaya day on which his employees in turns were allowed the recreation of being driven to big flume city eight miles distant to church or for the days holiday in the morning mary ellen was astonished by abner informing her that he designed giving her a separate holiday with himself it must be admitted that the girl who was already prinked up for the enthrallment of the youth of big flume city did not appear as delighted with the change of plan as a more exacting lover would have liked howbeit as soon as the wagon had left with its occupants abner in the unwonted disguise of a full suit of black clothes turned to the girl and offering her his arm gravely proceeded along the side veranda across the mound of debris already described to the adjacent wilderness and the very trees under which he and byers had sat  its about ez good a place for a little talk miss budd he said pointing to a tree root ez ef we went a spell further and its handy to the house and ef youll jest say what youd like outer the cupboard or the barno matter whichill fetch it to you  but mary ellen budd seated herself sideways on the root with her furled white parasol in her lap her skirts fastidiously tucked about her feet and glancing at the fatuous abner from under her stack of fluffy hair and light eyelashes simply shook her head and said that she reckoned she wasnt hankering much for anything that morning  ive been calkilatin to myself miss budd said abner resignedly that when two folkslike ez you and memeet together to kinder discuss things that might go so far ez to keep them together if they hez had anything of that sort in their lives afore they ought to speak of it confidentially like together  ef any one o them sneakin soulless critters in the kitchen hez bin slingin lies to ye about meor carryin tales broke in mary ellen budd setting every one of her thirtytwo strong white teeth together with a snap wellye might hev told me so to oncet without spilin my sunday but ez fer yer keepin me a minit longer yeve only got to pay me my salary today andbut here she stopped for the astonishment in abners face was too plain to be misunderstood  nobodys been slinging any lies about ye miss budd he said slowly recovering himself resignedly from this last backhanded stroke of fate i warnt talkin o you but myself i was only allowin to say that i was a divorced man  as a sudden flush came over mary ellens brownishwhite face while she stared at him abner hastened to delicately explain it wasnt no onfaithfulness miss buddno philanderin o mine but only incompatibility o temper  temperyour temper gasped mary ellen  yes said abner  and here a sudden change came over mary ellens face and she burst into a shriek of laughter she laughed with her hands slapping the sides of her skirt she laughed with her hands clasping her narrow hollow waist laughed with her head down on her knees and her fluffy hair tumbling over it abner was relieved and yet it seemed strange to him that this revelation of his temper should provoke such manifest incredulity in both byers and mary ellen but perhaps these things would be made plain to him hereafter at present they must be accepted in the days work and tolerated  your temper gurgled mary ellen saints alive what kind o temper  well i reckon returned abner submissively and selecting a word to give his meaning more comprehensioni reckon it was kinderaggeravokin  mary ellen sniffed the air for a moment in speechless incredulity and then locking her hands around her knees and bending forward said look here ef that old woman o yours ever knew what temper was in a man ef shes ever bin tied to a brute that treated her like a nigger till she darent say her soul was her own who struck her with his eyes and tongue when he hadnt anythin else handy who made her life miserable when he was sober and a terror when he was drunk who at last drove her away and then divorced her for desertionthenthen she might talk but incompatibility o temper with you oh go awayit makes me sick  how far abner was impressed with the truth of this how far it prompted his next question nobody but abner knew for he said deliberately i was only goin to ask ye if knowin i was a divorced man ye would mind marryin me  mary ellens face changed the evasive instincts of her sex rose up didnt i hear ye sayin suthin about refreshments she said archly mebbe you wouldnt mind gettin me a bottle o lemming sody outer the bar  abner got up at once perhaps not dismayed by this diversion and departed for the refreshment as he passed along the side veranda the recollection of mr byers and his mysterious flight occurred to him for a wild moment he thought of imitating him but it was too late nowhe had spoken besides he had no wife to fly to and the thirsty or indignant byers hadhis wife fate was indeed hard he returned with the bottle of lemon soda on a tray and a resigned spirit equal to her decrees mary ellen remarking that he had brought nothing for himself archly insisted upon his sharing with her the bottle of soda and even coquettishly touched his lips with her glass abner smiled patiently  but here as if playfully exhilarated by the naughty foaming soda she regarded him with her headand a good deal of her blonde hairvery much on one side as she said do you know that all along o you bein so free with me in tellin your affairs i kinder feel like just telling you mine  dont said abner promptly  dont echoed miss budd  dont repeated abner its nothing to me what i said about myself is different for it might make some difference to you but nothing you could say of yourself would make any change in me i stick to what i said just now  but said miss buddin half real half simulated threateningwhat if it had suthin to do with my answer to what you said just now  it couldnt so if its all the same to you miss budd id rather ye wouldnt  that said the lady still more archly lifting a playful finger is your temper  mebbe it is said abner suddenly with a wondering sense of relief  it was however settled that miss budd should go to sacramento to visit her friends that abner would join her later when their engagement would be announced and that she should not return to the hotel until they were married the compact was sealed by the interchange of a friendly kiss from miss budd with a patient tolerating one from abner and then it suddenly occurred to them both that they might as well return to their duties in the hotel which they did miss budds entire outing that sunday lasted only half an hour  a week elapsed miss budd was in sacramento and the landlord of the big flume hotel was standing at his usual post in the doorway during dinner when a waiter handed him a note it contained a single line scrawled in pencil   come out and see me behind the house as before i dussent come in on account of her c byers   on account of her abner cast a hurried glance around the tables certainly mrs byers was not there he walked in the hall and the verandashe was not there he hastened to the rendezvous evidently meant by the writer the wilderness behind the house sure enough byers drunk and maudlin supporting himself by the tree root staggered forward clasped him in his arms and murmured hoarsely  shes gone  gone echoed abner with a whitening face mrs byers where  run away never come back no more gone  a vague idea that had been in abners mind since byerss last visit now took awful shape before the unfortunate byers could collect his senses he felt himself seized in a giants grasp and forced against the tree  you coward said all that was left of the tolerant abnerhis even voiceyou hound did you dare to abuse her to lay your vile hands on herto strike her answer me  the shockthe graspperhaps abners words momentarily silenced byers did i strike her he said dazedly did i abuse her oh yes with deep irony certainly in course look yer pardnerhe suddenly dragged up his sleeve from his red hairy arm exposing a blue cicatrix in its centrethats a jab from her scissors about three months ago look yerhe bent his head and showed a scar along the scalpthats her playfulness with a fire shovel look yerhe quickly opened his collar where his neck and cheek were striped and crossed with adhesive plasterthats all that was left o a glass jar o preservesthe preserves got away but some of the glass got stuck thats when she heard i was a divorced man and hadnt told her  were you a divorced man gasped abner  you know that in course i was said byers scornfully dye meanter say she didnt tell ye  she echoed abner vaguely your wifeyou said just now she didnt know it before  my wife ez oncet was i mean mary ellenyour wife ez is to be said byers with deep irony oh come now pretend ye dont know hi there hands off dont strike a man when hes down like i am  but abners clutch of byerss shoulder relaxed and he sank down to a sitting posture on the root in the meantime byers overcome by a sense of this new misery added to his manifold grievances gave way to maudlin silent tears  mary ellenyour first wife repeated abner vacantly  yesh said byers thickly my first wifeshelected and picked out fer your shecond wifeby your firstlike dd conundrum how wash i tknow he said with a sudden shriek of public expostulationthash what i wanter know here i come to talk with fren like man to man unshuspecting innoshent as chile about my shecond wife fren drops out carryin off the whiskey then i hear all o suddent voice o mary ellen talkin in kitchen then i come round softly and see mary ellenmy wife as useter bestandin at frens kitchen winder then i lights out quicker n lightnin and scoots and when i gets back home i ups and tells my wife and whosh fault isht who shaid a man oughter tell hish wife you who keepsh other mensh first wivesh at kishen winder to frighten em to tell you  but a change had already come over the face of abner langworthy the anger anxiety astonishment and vacuity that was there had vanished and he looked up with his usual resigned acceptance of the inevitable as he said i reckon thats so and seein its so with goodnatured tolerance he added i reckon ill break rules for oncet and stand ye another drink  he stood another drink and yet another and eventually put the doubly widowed byers to bed in his own room these were but details of a larger tribulationand yet he knew instinctively that his cup was not yet full the further drop of bitterness came a few days later in a line from mary ellen i neednt tell you that all betwixt you and me is off and you kin tell your old woman that her selection for a second wife for you wuz about as bad as your own first selection ye kin tell mr byersyer great friend whom ye never let on ye knewthat when i want another husband i shant take the trouble to ask him to fish one out for me it would be kindbut confusin  he never heard from her again mr byers was duly notified that mrs byers had commenced action for divorce in another state in which concealment of a previous divorce invalidated the marriage but he did not respond the two men became great friendsand assured celibates yet they always spoke reverently of their wife with the touching prefix of our  she was a good woman pardner said byers  and she understood us said abner resignedly  perhaps she had     a buckeye hollow inheritance   the four men on the zip coon ledge had not got fairly settled to their mornings work there was the usual lingering hesitation which is apt to attend the takingup of any regular or monotonous performance shown in this instance in the prolonged scrutiny of a picks point the solemn selection of a shovel or the hefting or weighing of a tappingiron or drill one member becoming interested in a funny paragraph he found in the scrap of newspaper wrapped around his noonday cheese shamelessly sat down to finish it regardless of the prospecting pan thrown at him by another they had taken up their daily routine of mining life like schoolboys at their tasks  hello said ned wyngate joyously recognizing a possible further interruption blamed if the express rider aint comin here  he was shading his eyes with his hand as he gazed over the broad sunbaked expanse of broken flat between them and the highroad they all looked up and saw the figure of a mounted man with a couriers bag thrown over his shoulder galloping towards them it was really an event as their letters were usually left at the grocery at the crossroads  i knew something was goin to happen said wyngate i didnt feel a bit like work this morning  here one of their number ran off to meet the advancing horseman they watched him until they saw the latter rein up and hand a brown envelope to their messenger who ran breathlessly back with it to the ledge as the horseman galloped away again  a telegraph for jackson wells he said handing it to the young man who had been reading the scrap of paper  there was a dead silence telegrams were expensive rarities in those days especially with the youthful bohemian miners of the zip coon ledge they were burning with curiosity yet a singular thing happened accustomed as they had been to a life of brotherly familiarity and unceremoniousness this portentous message from the outside world of civilization recalled their old formal politeness they looked steadily away from the receiver of the telegram and he on his part stammered an apologetic excuse me boys as he broke the envelope  there was another pause which seemed to be interminable to the waiting partners then the voice of wells in quite natural tones said by gum thats funny read that dexterread it out loud  dexter rice the foreman took the proffered telegram from wellss hand and read as follows   your uncle quincy wells died yesterday leaving you sole heir will attend you tomorrow for instructions  baker and twiggs  attorneys sacramento   the three miners faces lightened and turned joyously to wells but his face looked puzzled  may we congratulate you mr wells said wyngate with affected politeness or possibly your uncle may have been english and a title goes with the prop and you may be lord wells or very wellsat least  but here jackson wellss youthful face lost its perplexity and he began to laugh long and silently to himself this was protracted to such an extent that dexter asserted himselfas foreman and senior partner  look here jack dont sit there cackling like a chuckleheaded magpie if you are the heir  icanthelp it gasped jackson i am the heirbut you see boys there aint any property  what do you mean is all that a sell demanded rice  not much telegraphs too expensive for that sort o feelin you see boys ive got an uncle quincy though i dont know him much and he may be dead but his whole fixins consisted of a claim the size of ours and played out long ago a ramshackle lot o sheds called a cottage and a kind of market garden of about three acres where he reared and sold vegetables he was always poor and as for calling it property and me the heirgood lord  a miser as sure as youre born said wyngate with optimistic decision thats always the way youll find every crack of that blessed old shed stuck full of greenbacks and certificates of deposit and lots of gold dust and coin buried all over that cow patch and of course no one suspected it and of course he lived alone and never let any one get into his houseand nearly starved himself lord love you theres hundreds of such cases the world is full of em  thats so chimed in pulaski briggs the fourth partner and i tell you what jacksey well come over with you the day you take possession and just prospect the whole blamed shanty pigsties and potato patch for funand wont charge you anything  for a moment jacksons face had really brightened under the infection of enthusiasm but it presently settled into perplexity again  no you bet the boys around buckeye hollow would have spotted anything like that long ago  buckeye hollow repeated rice and his partners  yes buckeye hollow thats the place not twenty miles from here and a godforsaken hole as you know  a cloud had settled on zip coon ledge they knew of buckeye hollow and it was evident that no good had ever yet come out of that nazareth  theres no use of talking now said rice conclusively youll draw it all from that lawyer shark whos coming here tomorrow and you can bet your life he wouldnt have taken this trouble if there wasnt suthin in it anyhow well knock off work now and call it half a day in honor of our distinguished young friends accession to his baronial estates of buckeye hollow well just toddle down to tomlinsons at the crossroads and have a nip and a quiet game of old sledge at jackseys expense i reckon the estates good for that he added with severe gravity and speaking as a farminded man and the president of this yer company if jackson would occasionally take out and air that telegraphic dispatch of his while were at tomlinsons it might do something for that companys creditwith tomlinson were wantin some new blastin plant bad  oddly enough the telegramaccidentally shown at tomlinsonsproduced a gratifying effect and the zip coon ledge materially advanced in public estimation with this possible infusion of new capital into its resources the company was beset by offers of machinery and goods and it was deemed expedient by the sapient rice that to prevent the dissemination of any more accurate information regarding jacksons property the next day the lawyer should be met at the stage office by one of the members and conveyed secretly past tomlinsons to the ledge  id let you go he said to jackson only it wont do for that dd skunk of a lawyer to think youre too anxioussabe we want to rub into him that we are in the habit out yer of havin things left to us and a fortin more or less falling into us now and then aint nothin alongside of the zip coon claim it wont hurt ye to keep up a big bluff on that hand of yours nobody would dare to call you  indeed this idea was carried out with such elaboration the next day that mr twiggs the attorney was considerably impressed both by the conduct of his guide who although burning with curiosity expressed absolute indifference regarding jackson wellss inheritance and the calmness of jackson himself who had to be ostentatiously called from his work on the ledge to meet him and who even gave him an audience in the hearing of his partners forced into an apologetic attitude he expressed his regret at being obliged to bother mr wells with an affair of such secondary importance but he was obliged to carry out the formalities of the law  what do you suppose the estate is worth asked wells carelessly  i should not think that the house the claim and the land would bring more than fifteen hundred dollars replied twiggs submissively  to the impecunious owners of zip coon ledge it seemed a large sum but they did not show it  you see continued mr twiggs its really a case of willing away property from its obvious or direct inheritors instead of a beneficial grant i take it that you and your uncle were not particularly intimateat least so i gathered when i made the willand his simple object was to disinherit his only daughter with whom he had had some quarrel and who had left him to live with his late wifes brother mr morley brown who is quite wealthy and residing in the same township perhaps you remember the young lady  jackson wells had a dim recollection of this cousin a hateful redhaired schoolgirl and an equally unpleasant memory of this other uncle who was purseproud and had never taken any notice of him he answered affirmatively  there may be some attempt to contest the will continued mr twiggs as the disinheriting of an only child and a daughter offends the sentiment of the people and of judges and jury and the law makes such a will invalid unless a reason is given fortunately your uncle has placed his reasons on record i have a copy of the will here and can show you the clause he took it from his pocket and read as follows i exclude my daughter jocelinda wells from any benefit or provision of this my will and testament for the reason that she has voluntarily abandoned her fathers roof for the house of her mothers brother morley brown has preferred the fleshpots of egypt to the virtuous frugalities of her own home and has discarded the humble friends of her youth and the associates of her father for the meretricious and slavish sympathy of wealth and position in lieu thereof and as compensation therefor i do hereby give and bequeath to her my full and free permission to gratify her frequently expressed wish for another guardian in place of myself and to become the adopted daughter of the said morley brown with the privilege of assuming the name of brown as aforesaid you see he continued as the young ladys present position is a better one than it would be if she were in her fathers house and was evidently a compromise the sentimental consideration of her being left homeless and penniless falls to the ground however as the inheritance is small and might be of little account to you if you choose to waive it i dare say we may make some arrangement  this was an utterly unexpected idea to the zip coon company and jackson wells was for a moment silent but dexter rice was equal to the emergency and turned to the astonished lawyer with severe dignity  youll excuse me for interferin but as the senior partner of this yer ledge and jackson wells yer bein a most important member what affects his usefulness on this claim affects us and we propose to carry out this yer will with all its dips and spurs and angles  as the surprised twiggs turned from one to the other rice continued ez far as we kin understand this little game its the just punishment of a highflying girl as breaks her pore old fathers heart and the reward of a young feller ez has bin to our knowledge ez devoted a nephew as they make em time and time again sittin around our camp fire at night weve heard jacksey saykinder to himself and kinder to us now i wonder whats gone o old uncle quincy and he never sat down to a square meal or ever rose from a square game but what he allus said if old uncle quince was only here now boys id die happy i leave it to you gentlemen if that wasnt jackson wellss gait all the time  there was a prolonged murmur of assent and an affecting corroboration from ned wyngate of that was him that was jacksey all the time  indeed indeed said the lawyer nervously i had quite the idea that there was very little fondness  not on your sidenot on your side said rice quickly uncle quincy may not have anted up in this matter o feelin nor seen his nephews rise you know how it is yourself in these thingsbeing a lawyer and a farminded manits all on one side ginerally theres always one who loves and sacrifices and all that and theres always one who rakes in the pot thats the way o the world and thats why continued rice abandoning his slightly philosophical attitude and laying his hand tenderly and yet with a singularly significant grip on wellss arm we say to him hang on to that will and uncle quincys memory and we hev to say it for hes that tenderhearted and keerless of moneyhaving his own share in this ledgethat ef that girl came whimperin to him hed let her take the prop and let the hull thing slide and then hed remember that he had rewarded that gal that broke the old mans heart and that would upset him again in his work and there you see is just where we come in and we say hang on to that will like grim death  the lawyer looked curiously at rice and his companions and then turned to wells nevertheless i must look to you for instructions he said dryly  but by this time jackson wells although really dubious about supplanting the orphan had gathered the sense of his partners and said with a frank show of decision i think i must stand by the will  then ill have it proved said twiggs rising in the meantime if there is any talk of contesting  if there is you might say suggested wyngate who felt he had not had a fair show in the little comedyye might say to that old skeesicks of a wifes brother if he wants to nipple in that there are four men on the ledgeand four revolvers we are ginrally farminded peaceful men but when an old mans heart is broken and his gray hairs brought down in sorrow to the grave so to speak were bound to attend the funeralsabe  when mr twiggs had departed again accompanied by a partner to guide him past the dangerous shoals of tomlinsons grocery rice clapped his hand on wellss shoulder if it hadnt been for me sonny that shark would have landed you into some compromise with that redhaired gal i saw you weakenin and then i chipped in i may have piled up the agony a little on your love for old quince but if you arent an ungrateful cub thats how you ought to hev been feein anyhow  nevertheless the youthful wells although touched by his elder partners loyalty and convinced of his own disinterestedness felt a painful sense of lost chivalrous opportunity    on mature consideration it was finally settled that jackson wells should make his preliminary examination of his inheritance alone as it might seem inconsistent with the previous indifferent attitude of his partners if they accompanied him but he was implored to yield to no blandishments of the enemy and to even make his visit a secret  he went the familiar flowerspiked trees which had given their name to buckeye hollow had never yielded entirely to improvements and the incursions of mining enterprise and many of them had even survived the disused ditches the scarred flats the discarded levels ruined flumes and roofless cabins of the earlier occupation so that when jackson wells entered the wide straggling street of buckeye that summer morning was filled with the radiance of its blossoms and fragrant with their incense his first visit there ten years ago had been a purely perfunctory and hasty one yet he remembered the ostentatious hotel built in the flush time of its prosperity and already in a green premature decay he recalled the express office and town hall also passing away in a kind of similar green deliquescence the little zinc church now overgrown with fern and brambles and the two or three fine substantial houses in the outskirts which seemed to have sucked the vitality of the little settlement one of thesehe had been toldwas the property of his rich and wicked maternal uncle the hated appropriator of his redheaded cousins affections he recalled his brief visit to the departed testators claim and market garden and his by no means favorable impression of the lonely crabbed old man as well as his relief that his objectionable cousin whom he had not seen since he was a boy was then absent at the rival uncles he made his way across the road to a sunny slope where the market garden of three acres seemed to roll like a river of green rapids to a little run or brook which even in the dry season showed a trickling rill but here he was struck by a singular circumstance the garden rested in a rich alluvial soil and under the quickening californian sky had developed far beyond the ability of its late cultivator to restrain or keep it in order everything had grown luxuriantly and in monstrous size and profusion the garden had even trespassed its bounds and impinged upon the open road the deserted claims and the ruins of the past stimulated by the little cultivation quincy wells had found time to give it it had leaped its three acres and rioted through the hollow there were scarlet runners crossing the abandoned sluices peas climbing the courthouse wall strawberries matting the trail while the seeds and pollen of its few homely eastern flowers had been blown far and wide through the woods by a grim satire nature seemed to have been the only thing that still prospered in that settlement of man  the cabin itself built of unpainted boards consisted of a sittingroom diningroom kitchen and two bedrooms all plainly furnished although one of the bedrooms was better ordered and displayed certain signs of feminine decoration which made jackson believe it had been his cousins room luckily the slight temporary structure bore no deep traces of its previous occupancy to disturb him with its memories and for the same reason it gained in cleanliness and freshness the dry desiccating summer wind that blew through it had carried away both the odors and the sense of domesticity even the adobe hearth had no fireside tales to tellits very ashes had been scattered by the winds and the gravestone of its dead owner on the hill was no more flavorless of his personality than was this plain house in which he had lived and died the excessive vegetation produced by the stirredup soil had covered and hidden the empty tin cans broken boxes and fragments of clothing which usually heaped and littered the tentpegs of the pioneer natures own profusion had thrust them into obscurity jackson wells smiled as he recalled his sanguine partners idea of a treasuretrove concealed and stuffed in the crevices of this tenement already so palpably picked clean by those wholesome scavengers of california the dry air and burning sun yet he was not displeased at this obliteration of a previous tenancy there was the better chance for him to originate something he whistled hopefully as he lounged with his hands in his pockets towards the only fence and gate that gave upon the road something stuck up on the gatepost attracted his attention it was a sheet of paper bearing the inscription in a large hand notice to trespassers look out for the orphan robber a plain signboard in faded black letters on the gate which had borne the legend quincy wells dealer in fruit and vegetables had been rudely altered in chalk to read jackson wells double dealer in wills and codicils and the intimation bouquets sold here had been changed to bequests stole here for an instant the simpleminded jackson failed to discover any significance of this outrage which seemed to him to be merely the wanton mischief of a schoolboy but a sudden recollection of the lawyers caution sent the blood to his cheeks and kindled his indignation he tore down the paper and rubbed out the chalk interpolationand then laughed at his own anger nevertheless he would not have liked his belligerent partners to see it  a little curious to know the extent of this feeling he entered one of the shops and by one or two questions which judiciously betrayed his ownership of the property he elicited only a tradesmans interest in a possible future customer and the ordinary curiosity about a stranger the barkeeper of the hotel was civil but brief and gloomy he had heard the property was willed away on account of some family quarrel which warnt none of his mr wells would find buckeye hollow a mighty dull place after the mines it was played out sucked dry by two or three big mine owners who were trying to freeze out the other settlers so as they might get the place to themselves and boom it brown who had the big house over the hill was the head devil of the gang wells felt his indignation kindle anew and this girl that he had ousted was browns friend was it possible that she was a party to browns designs to get this three acres with the other lands if so his longsuffering uncle was only just in his revenge  he put all this diffidently before his partners on his return and was a little startled at their adopting it with sanguine ferocity they hoped that he would put an end to his thoughts of backing out of it such a course now would be dishonorable to his uncles memory it was clearly his duty to resist these blasted satraps of capitalists he was providentially selected for the purposea village hampden to withstand the tyrant and i reckon that shark of a lawyer knew all about it when he was gettin off that purp stuff about peoples sympathies with the girl said rice belligerently contest the will would he why if we caught that brown with a finger in the pie wed just whip up the boys on this ledge and lynch him you hang on to that three acres and the garden patch of your forefathers sonny and well see you through  nevertheless it was with some misgivings that wells consented that his three partners should actually accompany him and see him put in peaceable possession of his inheritance his instinct told him that there would be no contest of the will and still less any opposition on the part of the objectionable relative brown when the wagon which contained his personal effects and the few articles of furniture necessary for his occupancy of the cabin arrived the exaggerated swagger which his companions had put on in their passage through the settlement gave way to a pastoral indolence equally half real half affected lying on their backs under a buckeye they permitted rice to voice the general sentiment theres a suthin soothin and dreamy in this kind o life jacksey and well make a point of comin here for a couple of days every two weeks to lend you a hand it will be a mighty good change from our nigger work on the claim  in spite of this assurance and the fact that they had voluntarily come to help him put the place in order they did very little beyond lending a cheering expression of unqualified praise and unstinted advice at the end of four hours weeding and trimming the boundaries of the garden they unanimously gave their opinion that it would be more systematic for him to employ chinese labor at once  you see said ned wyngate the chinese naturally take to this kind o business why you cant take up a china plate or saucer but you see em pictured there working at jobs like this and they kin live on green things and rice that cost nothin and chickens youll keep chickens of course  jackson thought that his hands would be full enough with the garden but he meekly assented  ill get a pairyou only want two to begin with continued wyngate cheerfully and in a month or two youve got all you want and eggs enough for market on second thoughts i dont know whether you hadnt better begin with eggs first that is you borry some eggs from one man and a hen from another then you set em and when the chickens are hatched out you just return the hen to the second man and the eggs when your chickens begin to lay to the first man and youve got your chickens for nothingand there you are  this ingenious proposition which was delivered on the last slope of the domain where the partners were lying exhausted from their work was broken in upon by the appearance of a small boy barefooted sunburnt and towheaded who after a moments hurried scrutiny of the group threw a letter with unerring precision into the lap of jackson wells and then fled precipitately jackson instinctively suspected he was connected with the outrage on his fence and gatepost but as he had avoided telling his partners of the incident fearing to increase their belligerent attitude he felt now an awkward consciousness mingled with his indignation as he broke the seal and read as follows   sirthis is to inform you that although you have got hold of the property by underhanded and sneaking ways you aint no right to touch or lay your vile hands on the cherokee rose alongside the house nor on the giant of battles nor on the maidens pride by the gatethe same being the property of miss jocelinda wells and planted by her under the penalty of the law and if you or any of your gang of ruffians touches it or them or any thereof or dont deliver it up when called for in good order you will be persecuted by them  avenger   it is to be feared that jackson would have suppressed this also but the keen eyes of his partners excited by the abruptness of the messenger were upon him he smiled feebly and laid the letter before them but he was unprepared for their exaggerated indignation and with difficulty restrained them from dashing off in the direction of the vanished herald and what could you do he said the boys only a messenger  ill get at that dd skunk brown whos back of him said dexter rice  and what then persisted jackson with a certain show of independence if this stuff belongs to the girl im not certain i shant give them up without any fuss lord i want nothing but what the old man left meand certainly nothing of hers  here ned wyngate was heard to murmur that jackson was one of those men who would lie down and let coyotes crawl over him if they first presented a girls visiting card but he was stopped by rice demanding paper and pencil the former being torn from a memorandum book and a stub of the latter produced from another pocket he wrote as follows   sirin reply to the hogwash you have kindly exuded in your letter of today i have to inform you that you can have what you ask for miss wells and perhaps a trifle on your own account by calling this afternoon onyours truly   now sign it continued rice handing him the pencil  but this will look as if we were angry and wanted to keep the plants protested wells  never you mind sonny but sign leave the rest to your partners and when you lay your head on your pillow tonight return thanks to an overruling providence for providing you with the right gang of ruffians to look after you  wells signed reluctantly and wyngate offered to find a chinaman in the gulch who would take the missive and being a chinaman brown can do any cussin or buck talk through him he added  the afternoon wore on the tall douglas pines near the water pools wheeled their long shadows round and halfway up the slope and the sun began to peer into the faces of the reclining men subtle odors of mint and southernwood stragglers from the garden bruised by their limbs replaced the fumes of their smokedout pipes and the hammers of the woodpeckers were busy in the grove as they lay lazily nibbling the fragrant leaves like peaceful ruminants then came the sound of approaching wheels along the invisible highway beyond the buckeyes and then a halt and silence rice rose slowly bright pin points in the pupils of his gray eyes  bringin a wagon with him to tote the hull shanty away suggested wyngate  or fetched his own ambulance said briggs  nevertheless after a pause the wheels presently rolled away again  wed better go and meet him at the gate said rice hitching his revolver holster nearer his hip that wagon stopped long enough to put down three or four men  they walked leisurely but silently to the gate it is probable that none of them believed in a serious collision but now the prospect had enough possibility in it to quicken their pulses they reached the gate but it was still closed the road beyond it empty  mebbe theyve sneaked round to the cabin said briggs and are holdin it inside  they were turning quickly in that direction when wyngate said hushsome ones there in the brush under the buckeyes  they listened there was a faint rustling in the shadows  come out o that browninto the open dont be shy called out rice in cheerful irony were waitin for ye  but briggs who was nearest the wood here suddenly uttered an exclamationbgosh and fell back openmouthed upon his companions they too in another moment broke into a feeble laugh and lapsed against each other in sheepish silence for a very pretty girl handsomely dressed swept out of the wood and advanced towards them  even at any time she would have been an enchanting vision to these men but in the glow of exercise and sparkle of anger she was bewildering her wonderful hair the color of freshly hewn redwood had escaped from her hat in her passage through the underbrush and even as she swept down upon them in her majesty she was jabbing a hairpin into it with a dexterous feminine hand  the three partners turned quite the color of her hair jackson wells alone remained white and rigid she came on her very short upper lip showing her white teeth with her panting breath  rice was first to speak i begyour pardon missi thought it was brownyou know he stammered  but she only turned a blighting brown eye on the culprit curled her short lip till it almost vanished in her scornful nostrils drew her skirt aside with a jerk and continued her way straight to jackson wells where she halted  we did not know you werehere alone he said apologetically  thought i was afraid to come alone didnt you well you see im not there she made another dive at her hat and hair and brought the hat down wickedly over her eyebrows gimme my plants  jackson had been astonished he would have scarcely recognized in this willful beauty the redhaired girl whom he had boyishly hated and with whom he had often quarreled but there was a recollectionand with that recollection came an instinct of habit he looked her squarely in the face and to the horror of his partners said say please  they had expected to see him fall smitten with the hairpin but she only stopped and then in bitter irony said please mr jackson wells  i havent dug them up yetand it would serve you just right if i made you get them for yourself but perhaps my friends here might help youif you were civil  the three partners seized spades and hoes and rushed forward eagerly only show us what you want they said in one voice the young girl stared at them and at jackson then with swift determination she turned her back scornfully upon him and with a dazzling smile which reduced the three men to absolute idiocy said to the others ill show you and marched away to the cabin  ye mustnt mind jacksey said rice sycophantically edging to her side hes so cut up with losin your father that he loved like a son he isnt himself and dont seem to know whether to ante up or pass out and as for yourself misswhywhat was it he was sayin only just as the young lady came he added turning abruptly to wyngate  everything that cousin josey planted with her own hands must be took up carefully and sent backeven though its killin me to part with it quoted wyngate unblushingly as he slouched along on the other side  miss wellss eyes glared at them though her mouth still smiled ravishingly im sure im troubling you  in a few moments the plants were dug up and carefully laid together indeed the servile briggs had added a few that she had not indicated  would you mind bringing them as far as the buggy thats coming down the hill she said pointing to a buggy driven by a small boy which was slowly approaching the gate the men tenderly lifted the uprooted plants and proceeded solemnly miss wells bringing up the rear towards the gate where jackson wells was still surlily lounging  they passed out first miss wells lingered for an instant and then advancing her beautiful but audacious face within an inch of jacksons hissed out makebelieve and hypocrite  crosspatch and saucebox returned jackson readily still under the malign influence of his boyish past as she flounced away  presently he heard the buggy rattle away with his persecutor but his partners still lingered on the road in earnest conversation and when they did return it was with a singular awkwardness and embarrassment which he naturally put down to a guilty consciousness of their foolish weakness in succumbing to the girls demands  but he was a little surprised when dexter rice approached him gloomily of course he began it aint no call of ours to interfere in family affairs and youve a right to keep em to yourself but if youd been fair and square and above board in what you got off on us about this per  what do you mean demanded the astonished wells  wellcallin her a redhaired gal  wellshe is a redhaired girl said wells impatiently  a man continued rice pityingly that is so prejudiced as to apply such language to a beautiful orphantorn with grief at the loss of a beloved but dd misconstruing parentmerely because she begs a few vegetables out of his potato patch aint to be reasoned with but when you come to look at this thing by and large and as a farminded man sonny youll agree with us that the sooner you make terms with her the better considerin your interest jackseylet alone the claims of humanityweve concluded to withdraw from here until this thing is settled shes sort o mixed us up with your feelings agin her and naturally supposed we object to the color of her hair and bein a penniless orphan rejected by her relations  what stuff are you talking burst in jackson why you saw she treated you better than she did me  steady there you go with that temper of yours that frightened the girl of course she could see that we were farminded men accustomed to the ways of society and not upset by the visit of a lady or the givin up of a few green sticks but let that slide were goin back home tonight sonny and when youve thought this thing over and are straightened up and get your right bearins well stand by you as before well put a man on to do your work on the ledge so ye neednt worry about that  they were quite firm in this decisionhowever absurd or obscure their conclusionsand jackson after his first flash of indignation felt a certain relief in their departure but strangely enough while he had hesitated about keeping the property when they were violently in favor of it he now felt he was right in retaining it against their advice to compromise the sentimental idea had vanished with his recognition of his hateful cousin in the role of the injured orphan and for the same odd reason her prettiness only increased his resentment he was not deceivedit was the same capricious willful redhaired girl  the next day he set himself to work with that dogged steadiness that belonged to his simple nature and which had endeared him to his partners he set half a dozen chinamen to work and followed although apparently directing their methods the great difficulty was to restrain and control the excessive vegetation and he matched the small economies of the chinese against the opulence of the californian soil the garden patch prospered the neighbors spoke well of it and of him but jackson knew that this fierce harvest of early spring was to be followed by the sterility of the dry season and that irrigation could alone make his work profitable in the end he brought a pump to force the water from the little stream at the foot of the slope to the top and allowed it to flow back through parallel trenches again buckeye applauded only the gloomy barkeeper shook his head the moment you get that thing to pay mr wells youll find the hand of brown somewhere getting ready to squeeze it dry  but jackson wells did not trouble himself about brown whom he scarcely knew once indeed while trenching the slope he was conscious that he was watched by two men from the opposite bank but they were apparently satisfied by their scrutiny and turned away still less did he concern himself with the movements of his cousin who once or twice passed him superciliously in her buggy on the road again she met him as one of a cavalcade of riders mounted on a handsome but illtempered mustang which she was managing with an illtemper and grace equal to the brutes to the alternate delight and terror of her cavalier he could see that she had been petted and spoiled by her new guardian and his friends far beyond his conception but why she should grudge him the little garden and the pastoral life for which she was so unsuited puzzled him greatly  one afternoon he was working near the road when he was startled by an outcry from his chinese laborers their rapid dispersal from the strawberry beds where they were working the splintering crash of his fence rails and a commotion among the buckeyes furious at what seemed to him one of the usual wanton attacks upon coolie labor he seized his pick and ran to their assistance but he was surprised to find jocelindas mustang caught by the saddle and struggling between two trees and its unfortunate mistress lying upon the strawberry bed shocked but coolheaded jackson released the horse first who was lashing out and destroying everything within his reach and then turned to his cousin but she had already lifted herself to her elbow and with a trickle of blood and mud on one fair cheek was surveying him scornfully under her tumbled hair and hanging hat  you dont suppose i was trespassing on your wretched patch again do you she said in a voice she was trying to keep from breaking it was that brutewho bolted  i dont suppose you were bullying me this time he said but you were your horseor it wouldnt have happened are you hurt  she tried to move he offered her his hand but she shied from it and struggled to her feet she took a step forwardbut limped  if you dont want my arm let me call a chinaman he suggested  she glared at him if you do ill scream she said in a low voice and he knew she would but at the same moment her face whitened at which he slipped his arm under hers in a dexterous businesslike way so as to support her weight then her hat got askew and down came a long braid over his shoulder he remembered it of old only it was darker than then and two or three feet longer  if you could manage to limp as far as the gate and sit down on the bank id get your horse for you he said i hitched it to a sapling  i saw you didbefore you even offered to help me she said scornfully  the horse would have got awayyou couldnt  if you only knew how i hated you she said with a white face but a trembling lip  i dont see how that would make things any better he said better wipe your face its scratched and muddy and youve been rubbing your nose in my strawberry bed  she snatched his proffered handkerchief suddenly applied it to her face and said i suppose it looks dreadful  like a pigs he returned cheerfully  she walked a little more firmly after this until they reached the gate he seated her on the bank and went back for the mustang that beautiful brute astounded and sore from its contact with the top rail and brambles was cowed and subdued as he led it back  she had finished wiping her face and was hurriedly disentangling two stinging tears from her long lashes before she threw back his handkerchief her sprained ankle obliged him to lift her into the saddle and adjust her little shoe in the stirrup he remembered when it was still smaller you used to ride astride he said a flood of recollection coming over him and its much safer with your temper and that brute  and you she said in a lower voice used to bebut the rest of her sentence was lost in the switch of the whip and the jump of her horse but he thought the word was kinder  perhaps this was why after he watched her canter away he went back to the garden and from the bruised and trampled strawberry bed gathered a small basket of the finest fruit covered them with leaves added a paper with the highly ingenious witticism picked up with you and sent them to her by one of the chinamen her forcible entry moved li sing his foreman also chief

blowns big house topside hill blown firstchop man  had he inquired he might have found this pagan testimony for once corroborated by the christian neighbors  but another incident drove all this from his mind the little streamthe life blood of his gardenran dry inquiry showed that it had been diverted two miles away into browns ditch wellss indignant protest elicited a formal reply from brown stating that he owned the adjacent mining claims and reminding him that mining rights to water took precedence of the agricultural claim but offering by way of compensation to purchase the land thus made useless and sterile jackson suddenly recalled the prophecy of the gloomy barkeeper the end had come but what could the scheming capitalist want with the land equally uselessas his uncle had provedfor mining purposes could it be sheer malignity incited by his vengeful cousin but here he paused rejecting the idea as quickly as it came no his partners were right he was a trespasser on his cousins heritagethere was no luck in ithe was wrong and this was his punishment instead of yielding gracefully as he might he must back down now and she would never know his first real feelings even now he would make over the property to her as a free gift but his partners had advanced him money from their scanty means to plant and work it he believed that an appeal to their feelings would persuade them to forego even that but he shrank even more from confessing his defeat to them than to her  he had little heart in his labors that day and dismissed the chinamen early he again examined his uncles old mining claim on the top of the slope but was satisfied that it had been a hopeless enterprise and wisely abandoned it was sunset when he stood under the buckeyes gloomily looking at the glow fade out of the west as it had out of his boyish hopes he had grown to like the place it was the hour too when the few flowers he had cultivated gave back their pleasant odors as if grateful for his care and then he heard his name called  it was his cousin standing a few yards from him in evident hesitation she was quite pale and for a moment he thought she was still suffering from her fall until he saw in her nervous halfembarrassed manner that it had no physical cause her old audacity and anger seemed gone yet there was a queer determination in her pretty brows  goodevening he said  she did not return his greeting but pulling uneasily at her glove said hesitatingly uncle has asked you to sell him this land  yes  welldont she burst out abruptly  he stared at her  oh im not trying to keep you here she went on flashing back into her old temper so you neednt stare like that i say dont because it aint right it aint fair  why hes left me no alternative he said  thats just itthats why its mean and low i dont care if he is our uncle  jackson was bewildered and shocked  i know its horrid to say it she said with a white face but its horrider to keep it in oh jack when we were little and used to fight and quarrel i never was meanwas i i never was underhandedwas i i never lieddid i and i cant lie now jack she looked hurriedly around her he wants to get hold of the landhe thinks theres gold in the slope and bank by the stream he says dad was a fool to have located his claim so high up jack did you ever prospect the bank  a dawning of intelligence came upon jackson no he said but he added bitterly whats the use he owns the water nowi couldnt work it  but jack if you found the color this would be a mining claim you could claim the water right and as its your land your claim would be first  jackson was startled yes if i found the color  you would find it  would  yes i didon the sly yesterday morning on your slope by the stream when no one was up i washed a panful and got that she took a piece of tissue paper from her pocket opened it and shook into her little palm three tiny pin points of gold  and that was your own idea jossy  yes  your very own  honest injin  wish you may die  true o king  he opened his arms and they mutually embraced then they separated taking hold of each others hands solemnly and falling back until they were at arms length then they slowly extended their arms sideways at full length until this action naturally brought their faces and lips together they did this with the utmost gravity three times and then embraced again rocking on pivoted feet like a metronome alas it was no momentary inspiration the most casual and indifferent observer could see that it was the result of long previous practice and shameless experience and as suchit was a revelation and an explanation     i always suspected that jackson was playin us about that redhaired cousin said rice two weeks later but i cant swallow that purp stuff about her puttin him up to that dodge about a new gold discovery on a fresh claim just to knock out brown no sir he found that gold in openin these irrigatin trenchesthe usual nigger luck findin what youre not lookin arter  well we cant complain for hes offered to work it on shares with us said briggs  yesuntil hes ready to take in another partner  notbrown said his horrified companions  nobut browns adopted daughterthat redhaired cousin     the reincarnation of smith   the extravagant supper party by which mr james farendell celebrated the last day of his bachelorhood was protracted so far into the night that the last guest who parted from him at the door of the principal sacramento restaurant was for a moment impressed with the belief that a certain ruddy glow in the sky was already the dawn but mr farendell had kept his head clear enough to recognize it as the light of some burning building in a remote business district a not infrequent occurrence in the dry season when he had dismissed his guest he turned away in that direction for further information his own countinghouse was not in that immediate neighborhood but sacramento had been once before visited by a rapid and farsweeping conflagration and it behooved him to be on the alert even on this night of festivity  perhaps also a certain anxiety arose out of the occasion he was to be married tomorrow to the widow of his late partner and the marriage besides being an attractive one would settle many business difficulties he had been a fortunate man but like many more fortunate men was not blind to the possibilities of a change of luck the death of his partner in a successful business had at first seemed to betoken that change but his successful though hasty courtship of the inexperienced widow had restored his chances without greatly shocking the decorum of a pioneer community nevertheless he was not a contented man and hardly a determinedalthough an energetic one  a walk of a few moments brought him to the levee of the rivera favored district where his countinghouse with many others was conveniently situated in these early days only a few of these buildings could be said to be permanentfire and flood perpetually threatened them they were merely temporary structures of wood or in the case of mr farendells office a shell of corrugated iron sheathing a onestoried wooden frame more or less elaborate in its interior decorations by the time he had reached it the distant fire had increased on his way he had met and recognized many of his business acquaintances hurrying thithersome to save their own property or to assist the imperfectly equipped volunteer fire department in their unselfish labors it was probably mr farendells peculiar preoccupation on that particular night which had prevented his joining in their brotherly zeal  he unlocked the iron door and lit the hanging lamp that was used in allnight sittings on steamer days it revealed a smartly furnished office with a high desk for his clerks and a smaller one for himself in one corner in the centre of the wall stood a large safe this he also unlocked and took out a few important books as well as a small drawer containing gold coin and dust to the amount of about five hundred dollars the large balance having been deposited in bank on the previous day the act was only precautionary as he did not exhibit any haste in removing them to a place of safety and remained meditatively absorbed in looking over a packet of papers taken from the same drawer the closely shuttered building almost hermetically sealed against light and perhaps sound prevented his observing the steadily increasing light of the conflagration or hearing the nearer tumult of the firemen and the invasion of his quiet district by other equally solicitous tenants the papers seemed also to possess some importance for the stillness being suddenly broken by the turning of the handle of the heavy door he had just closed and its opening with difficulty his first act was to hurriedly conceal them without apparently paying a thought to the exposed gold before him and his expression and attitude in facing round towards the door was quite as much of nervous secretiveness as of indignation at the interruption  yet the intruder appeared though singular by no means formidable he was a man slightly past the middle age with a thin face hollowed at the cheeks and temples as if by illness or asceticism and a grayish beard that encircled his throat like a soiled worsted comforter below his cleanshaven chin and mouth his manner was slow and methodical and even when he shot the bolt of the door behind him the act did not seem aggressive nevertheless mr farendell half rose with his hand on his pistolpocket but the stranger merely lifted his own hand with a gesture of indifferent warning and drawing a chair towards him dropped into it deliberately  mr farendells angry stare changed suddenly to one of surprised recognition josh scranton he said hesitatingly  i reckon responded the stranger slowly thats the name i allus bore and you called yourself farendell well we aint seen each other sens the spring o 50 when ye left me lying nigh petered out with chills and fever on the stanislaus river and sold the claim that me and duffy worked under our very feet and skedaddled for frisco  i only exercised my right as principal owner and to secure my advances began the late mr farendell sharply  but again the thin hand was raised this time with a slow scornful waiving of any explanations it aint that in partickler that ive kem to see ye for tonight said the stranger slowly nor it aint about your takin the name o farendell that friend o yours who died on the passage here with ye and whose papers ye borrowed nor it aint on account o that wife of yours ye left behind in missouri and whose letters you never answered its them things all togetherand suthin else  what the dl do you want then said farendell with a desperate directness that was however a tacit confession of the truth of these accusations  yer allowin that yell get married tomorrow said scranton slowly  yes and be dd to you said farendell fiercely  yer not returned scranton not if i knows it yer goin to climb down yer goin to get up and get yer goin to step down and out yer goin to shut up your desk and your books and this hull consarn inside of an hour and vamose the ranch arter an hour from now thar wont be any mr farendell and no weddin tomorrow  if thats your gameperhaps youd like to murder me at once said farendell with a shifting eye as his hand again moved towards his revolver  but again the thin hand of the stranger was also lifted we aint in the business o murderin or bein murdered or we might hev kem here together me and duffy now if anything happens to me duffy will be left and hes got the proofs  farendell seemed to recognize the fact with the same directness thats it is it he said bluntly well how much do you want only i warn you that i havent much to give  wotever youve got if it was millions it aint enough to buy us up and ye ought to know that by this time responded scranton with a momentary flash in his eyes but the next moment his previous passionless deliberation returned and leaning his arm on the desk of the man before him he picked up a paperweight carelessly and turned it over as he said slowly the fact is mr farendell youve been making us me and duffy tired weve bin watchin you and your doins lyin low and sayin nothin till we concluded that it was about time you handed in your checks and left the board we aint wanted nothin of ye we aint begrudged ye nothin but weve allowed that this yer thing must stop  and what if i refuse said farendell  tharll be some cussin and a big row from you i kalkilateand maybe some fightin all round said scranton dispassionately but it will be all the same in the end the hull thing will come out and youll hev to slide just the same totherwise ef ye slide out now its without a row  and do you suppose a business man like me can disappear without a fuss over it said farendell angrily are you mad  i reckon the hole youll make kin be filled up said scranton dryly but ef ye go now you wont be bothered by the fuss while if you stay youll have to face the music and go too  farendell was silent possibly the truth of this had long since been borne upon him no one but himself knew the incessant strain of these years of evasion and concealment and how he often had been near to some such desperate culmination the sacrifice offered to him was not therefore so great as it might have seemed the knowledge of this might have given him a momentary superiority over his antagonist had scrantons motive been a purely selfish or malignant one but as it was not and as he may have had some instinctive idea of farendells feeling also it made his ultimatum appear the more passionless and fateful and it was this quality which perhaps caused farendell to burst out with desperate abruptness  what in hll ever put you up to this  scranton folded his arms upon farendells desk and slowly wiping his clean jaw with one hand repeated deliberately walli reckon i told ye that before youve been making usme and duffytired he paused for a moment and then rising abruptly with a careless gesture towards the uncovered tray of gold said come ye kin take enuff o that to get away with the less ye take though the less likely youll be to be followed  he went to the door unlocked and opened it a strange light as of a lurid storm interspersed by sheetlike lightning filled the outer darkness and the silence was now broken by dull crashes and nearer cries and shouting a few figures were also dimly flitting around the neighboring empty offices some of which like farendells had been entered by their now alarmed owners  youve got a good chance now continued scranton ye couldnt hev a better its a big firea scorcherand jest the time for a man to wipe himself out and not be missed make tracks where the crowd is thickest and whar yere likely to be seen ez ef ye were helpin ther ll be other men missed tomorrow beside you he added with grim significance but nobodyll know that you was one who really got away  where the imperturbable logic of the strange man might have failed the noise the tumult the suggestion of swiftcoming disaster and the necessity for some immediate action of any kind was convincing farendell hastily stuffed his pockets with gold and the papers he had found and moved to the door already he fancied he felt the hot breath of the leaping conflagration beyond and you he said turning suspiciously to scranton  when youre shut of this and clean off ill fix things and leave toobut not before i reckon he added grimly with a glance at the sky now streaming with sparks like a meteoric shower thar wont be much left here in the morning  a few dull embers pattered on the iron roof of the low building and bounded off in ashes farendell cast a final glance around him and then darted from the building the iron door clanged behind himhe was gone  evidently not too soon for the other buildings were already deserted by their wouldbe salvors who had filled the streets with piles of books and valuables waiting to be carried away then occurred a terrible phenomenon which had once before in such disasters paralyzed the efforts of the firemen a large wooden warehouse in the centre of the block of offices many hundred feet from the scene of active conflagrationwhich had hitherto remained intactsuddenly became enveloped in clouds of smoke and without warning burst as suddenly from roof and upper story into vivid flame there were eyewitnesses who declared that a stream of living fire seemed to leap upon it from the burning district and connected the space between them with an arch of luminous heat in another instant the whole district was involved in a whirlwind of smoke and flame out of whose seething vortex the corrugated iron buildings occasionally showed their shriveling or glowing outlines and then the fire swept on and away  when the sun again arose over the panicstricken and devastated city all personal incident and disaster was forgotten in the larger calamity it was two or three days before the full particulars could be gatheredeven while the dominant and resistless energy of the people was erecting new buildings upon the stillsmoking ruins it was only on the third day afterwards that james farendell on the deck of a coasting steamer creeping out through the fogs of the golden gate read the latest news in a san francisco paper brought by the pilot as he hurriedly comprehended the magnitude of the loss which was far beyond his previous conception he experienced a certain satisfaction in finding his position no worse materially than that of many of his fellow workers they were ruined like himself they must begin their life afreshbut then ah there was still that terrible difference he drew his breath quickly and read on suddenly he stopped transfixed by a later paragraph for an instant he failed to grasp its full significance then he read it again the words imprinting themselves on his senses with a slow deliberation that seemed to him as passionless as scrantons utterances on that fateful night  the loss of life it is now feared is much greater than at first imagined to the list that has been already published we must add the name of james farendell the energetic contractor so well known to our citizens who was missing the morning after the fire his calcined remains were found this afternoon in the warped and twisted iron shell of his countinghouse the wooden frame having been reduced to charcoal in the intense heat the unfortunate man seems to have gone there to remove his books and papersas was evidenced by the iron safe being found openbut to have been caught and imprisoned in the building through the heat causing the metal sheathing to hermetically seal the doors and windows he was seen by some neighbors to enter the building while the fire was still distant and his remains were identified by his keys which were found beneath him a poignant interest is added to his untimely fate by the circumstance that he was to have been married on the following day to the widow of his late partner and that he had at the call of duty that very evening left a dinner party given to celebrate the last day of his bachelorhoodor as it has indeed proved of his earthly existence two families are thus placed in mourning and it is a singular sequel that by this untoward calamity the wellknown firm of farendell  cutler may be said to have ceased to exist  mr farendell started to his feet but a lurch of the schooner as she rose on the long swell of the pacific sent him staggering dizzily back to his seat and checked his first wild impulse to return he saw it all nowthe fire had avenged him by wiping out his persecutor scranton but in the eyes of his contemporaries it had only erased him he might return to refute the story in his own person but the dead mans partner still lived with his secret and his own rehabilitation could only revive his former peril     four years elapsed before the late mr farendell again set foot in the levee of sacramento the steamboat that brought him from san francisco was a marvel to him in size elegance and comfort so different from the little crowded triweekly packet he remembered and it might in a manner have prepared him for the greater change in the city but he was astounded to find nothing to remind him of the pastno landmark nor even ruin of the place he had known blocks of brick buildings with thoroughfares having strange titles occupied the district where his countinghouse had stood and even obliterated its site equally strange names were upon the shops and warehouses in his four years wanderings he had scarcely found a place as unfamiliar he had trusted to the great change in his own appearancethe full beard that he wore and the tanning of a tropical sunto prevent recognition but the precaution was unnecessary there were none to recognize him in the new faces which were the only ones he saw in the transformed city a cautious allusion to the past which he had made on the boat to a fellow passenger had brought only the surprised rejoinder oh that must have been before the big fire as if it was an historic epoch there was something of pain even in this assured security of his loneliness his obliteration was complete  for the late mr farendell had suffered some change of mind with his other mutations he had been singularly lucky the schooner in which he had escaped brought him to acapulco where as a returning californian and a presumably successful one his services and experience were eagerly sought by an english party engaged in developing certain disused mexican mines as the post however was perilously near the route of regular emigration as soon as he had gained a sufficient sum he embarked with some goods to callao where he presently established himself in business resuming his real namethe unambitious but indistinctive one of smith it is highly probable that this prudential act was also his first step towards rectitude for whether the change was a question of moral ethics or merely a superstitious essay in luck he was thereafter strictly honest in business he became prosperous he had been sustained in his flight by the intention that if he were successful elsewhere he would endeavor to communicate with his abandoned fiancee and ask her to join him and share not his name but fortune in exile but as he grew rich the difficulties of carrying out this intention became more apparent he was by no means certain of her loyalty surviving the deceit he had practiced and the revelation he would have to make he was doubtful of the success of any story which at other times he would have glibly invented to take the place of truth already several months had elapsed since his supposed death could he expect her to be less accessible to premature advances now than when she had been a widow perhaps this made him think of the wife he had deserted so long ago he had been quite content to live without regret or affection forgetting and forgotten but in his present prosperity he felt there was some need of putting his domestic affairs into a more secure and legitimate shape to avert any catastrophe like the last here at least would be no difficulty husbands had deserted their wives before this in californian emigration and had been heard of only after they had made their fortune any plausible story would be accepted by her in the joy of his reappearance or if indeed as he reflected with equal complacency she was dead or divorced from him through his desertiona sufficient cause in her own stateand remarried he would at least be more secure he began without committing himself by inquiry and anonymous correspondence his wife he learnt had left missouri for sacramento only a month or two after his own disappearance from that place and her address was unknown  a complication so unlooked for disquieted him and yet whetted his curiosity the only person she might meet in california who could possibly identify him with the late mr farendell was duffy he had often wondered if that mysterious partner of scrantons had been deceived with the others or had ever suspected that the body discovered in the countinghouse was scrantons if not he must have accepted the strange coincidence that scranton had disappeared also the same night in the first six months of his exile he had searched the californian papers thoroughly but had found no record of any doubt having been thrown on the accepted belief it was these circumstances and perhaps a vague fascination not unlike that which impels the malefactor to haunt the scene of his crime that at the end of four years had brought him a man of middle age and assured occupation and fortune back to the city he had fled from  a few days at one of the new hotels convinced him thoroughly that he was in no danger of recognition and gave him the assurance to take rooms more in keeping with his circumstances and his own frankly avowed position as the head of a south american house a cautious acquaintancethrough the agency of his bankerwith a few business men gave him some occupation and the fact of his south american letters being addressed to don diego smith gave a foreign flavor to his individuality which his tanned face and dark beard had materially helped a stronger test convinced him how complete was the obliteration of his former identity one day at the bank he was startled at being introduced by the manager to a man whom he at once recognized as a former business acquaintance but the shock was his alone the formal approach and unfamiliar manner of the man showed that he had failed to recognize even a resemblance but would he equally escape detection by his wife if he met her as accidentallyan encounter not to be thought of until he knew something more of her he became more cautious in going to public places but luckily for him the proportion of women to men was still small in california and they were more observed than observing  a month elapsed in that time he had thoroughly exhausted the local directories in his cautious researches among the smiths for in his fear of precipitating a premature disclosure he had given up his former anonymous advertising and there was a certain occupation in this personal quest that filled his business time he was in no hurry he had a singular faith that he would eventually discover her whereabouts be able to make all necessary inquiries into her conduct and habits and perhaps even enjoy a brief season of unsuspected personal observation before revealing himself and this faith was as singularly rewarded  having occasion to get his watch repaired one day he entered a large jewelers shop and while waiting its examination his attention was attracted by an ordinary oldfashioned daguerreotype case in the form of a heartshaped locket lying on the counter with other articles left for repairs something in its appearance touched a chord in his memory he lifted the halfopened case and saw a much faded daguerreotype portrait of himself taken in missouri before he left in the californian emigration he recognized it at once as one he had given to his wife the faded likeness was so little like his present self that he boldly examined it and asked the jeweler one or two questions the man was communicative yes it was an oldfashioned affair which had been left for repairs a few days ago by a lady whose name and address written by herself were on the card tied to it  mr james smith had by this time fully controlled the emotion he felt as he recognized his wifes name and handwriting and knew that at last the clue was found he laid down the case carelessly gave the final directions for the repairs of his watch and left the shop the address of which he had taken a mental note was to his surprise very near his own lodgings but he went straight home here a few inquiries of his janitor elicited the information that the building indicated in the address was a large one of furnished apartments and offices like his own and that the mrs smith must be simply the housekeeper of the landlord whose name appeared in the directory but not her own yet he waited until evening before he ventured to reconnoitre the premises with the possession of his clue came a slight cooling of his ardor and extreme caution in his further proceedings the housea reconstructed wooden buildingoffered no external indication of the rooms she occupied in the uniformly curtained windows that front the street yet he felt an odd and pleasurable excitement in passing once or twice before those walls that hid the goal of his quest as yet he had not seen her and there was naturally the added zest of expectation he noticed that there was a new building opposite with vacant offices to let a project suddenly occurred to him which by morning he had fully matured he hired a front room in the first floor of the new building had it hurriedly furnished as a private office and on the second morning of his discovery was installed behind his desk at the window commanding a full view of the opposite house there was nothing strange in the south american capitalist selecting a private office in so popular a locality  two or three days elapsed without any result from his espionage he came to know by sight the various tenants the two chinese servants and the solitary irish housemaid but as yet had no glimpse of the housekeeper she evidently led a secluded life among her duties it occurred to him that perhaps she went out possibly to market earlier than he came or later after he had left the office in this belief he arrived one morning after an early walk in a smart spring shower the lingering straggler of the winter rains there were few people astir yet he had been preceded for two or three blocks by a tall woman whose umbrella partly concealed her head and shoulders from view he had noticed however even in his abstraction that she walked well and managed the lifting of her skirt over her trim ankles and wellbooted feet with some grace and cleverness yet it was only on her unexpectedly turning the corner of his own street that he became interested she continued on until within a few doors of his office when she stopped to give an order to a tradesman who was just taking down his shutters he heard her voice distinctly in the quick emotion it gave him he brushed hurriedly past her without lifting his eyes gaining his own doorway he rushed upstairs to his office hastily unlocked it and ran to the window the lady was already crossing the street he saw her pause before the door of the opposite house open it with a latchkey and caught a full view of her profile in the single moment that she turned to furl her umbrella and enter it was his wifes voice he had heard it was his wifes face that he had seen in profile  yet she was changed from the lanky young schoolgirl he had wedded ten years ago or at least compared to what his recollection of her had been had he ever seen her as she really was surely somewhere in that timid freckled halfgrown bride he had known in the first year of their marriage the germ of this selfpossessed matured woman was hidden there was the tone of her voice he had never recalled it before as a lover might yet now it touched him her profile he certainly remembered but not with the feeling it now produced in him would he have ever abandoned her had she been like that or had he changed and was this no longer his old selfperhaps even a self she would never recognize again james smith had the superstitions of a gambler and that vague idea of fate that comes to weak men a sudden fright seized him and he half withdrew from the window lest she should observe him recognize him and by some act precipitate that fate  by lingering beyond the usual hour for his departure he saw her again and had even a full view of her face as she crossed the street the years had certainly improved her he wondered with a certain nervousness if she would think they had done the same for him the complacency with which he had at first contemplated her probable joy at recovering him had become seriously shaken since he had seen her a woman as well preserved and goodlooking as that holding a certain responsible and no doubt lucrative position must have many admirers and be independent he longed to tell her now of his fortune and yet shrank from the test its exposure implied he waited for her return until darkness had gathered and then went back to his lodgings a little chagrined and ill at ease it was rather late for her to be out alone after all what did he know of her habits or associations he recalled the freedom of californian life and the old scandals relating to the lapses of many women who had previously led blameless lives in the atlantic states clearly it behooved him to be cautious yet he walked late that night before the house again eager to see if she had returned and with whom he was restricted in his eagerness by the fear of detection but he gathered very little knowledge of her habits singularly enough nobody seemed to care a little piqued at this he began to wonder if he were not thinking too much of this woman to whom he still hesitated to reveal himself nevertheless he found himself that night again wandering around the house and even watching with some anxiety the shadow which he believed to be hers on the windowblind of the room where he had by discreet inquiry located her whether his memory was stimulated by his quest he never knew but presently he was able to recall step by step and incident by incident his early courtship of her and the brief days of their married life he even remembered the day she accepted him and even dwelt upon it with a sentimental thrill that he probably never felt at the time and it was a distinct feature of his extraordinary state of mind and its concentration upon this particular subject that he presently began to look upon himself as the abandoned and deserted conjugal partner and to nurse a feeling of deep injury at her hands the fact that he was thinking of her and she probably contented with her lot was undisturbed by any memory of him seemed to him a logical deduction of his superior affection  it was therefore quite as much in the attitude of a reproachful and avenging husband as of a merely curious one that one afternoon seeing her issue from her house at an early hour he slipped down the stairs and began to follow her at a secure distance she turned into the principal thoroughfare and presently made one of the crowd who were entering a popular place of amusement where there was an afternoon performance so complete was his selfish hallucination that he smiled bitterly at this proof of heartless indifference and even so far overcame his previous caution as to actually brush by her somewhat rudely as he entered the building at the same moment he was conscious that she lifted her eyes a little impatiently to the face of the awkward stranger he was equally but more bitterly conscious that she had not recognized him he dropped into a seat behind her she did not look at him again with even a sense of disturbance the momentary contact had evidently left no impression upon her she glanced casually at her neighbors on either side and presently became absorbed in the performance when it was over she rose and on her way out recognized and exchanged a few words with one or two acquaintances again he heard her familiar voice almost at his elbow raised with no more consciousness of her contiguity to him than if he were a mere ghost the thought struck him for the first time with a hideous and appalling significance what was he but a ghost to herto every one a man dead buried and forgotten his vanity and selfcomplacency vanished before this crushing realization of the hopelessness of his existence dazed and bewildered he mingled blindly and blunderingly with the departing crowd tossed here and there as if he were an invisible presence stumbling over the impeding skirts of women with a vague apology they heeded not and which seemed in his frightened ears as hollow as a voice from the grave  when he at last reached the street he did not look back but wandered abstractedly through bystreets in the falling rain scarcely realizing where he was until he found himself drenched through with his closed umbrella in his tremulous hand standing at the halfsubmerged levee beside the overflowed river here again he realized how completely he had been absorbed and concentrated in his search for his wife during the last three weeks he had never been on the levee since his arrival he had taken no note of the excitement of the citizens over the alarming reports of terrible floods in the mountains and the daily and hourly fear that they experienced of disastrous inundation from the surcharged river he had never thought of it yet he had read of it and even talked and yet now for the first time in his selfish blind absorption was certain of it he stood still for some time watching doggedly the enormous yellow stream laboring with its burden and drift from many a mountain town and camp moving steadily and fatefully towards the distant bay and still more distant and inevitable ocean for a few moments it vaguely fascinated and diverted him then it as vaguely lent itself to his one dominant haunting thought yes it was pointing him the only way outthe path to the distant ocean and utter forgetfulness again  the chill of his saturated clothing brought him to himself once more he turned and hurried home he went tiredly to his bedroom and while changing his garments there came a knock at the door it was the porter to say that a lady had called and was waiting for him in the sittingroom she had not given her name  the closed door prevented the servant from seeing the extraordinary effect produced by this simple announcement upon the tenant for one instant james smith remained spellbound in his chair it was characteristic of his weak nature and singular prepossession that he passed in an instant from the extreme of doubt to the extreme of certainty and conviction it was his wife she had recognized him in that moment of encounter at the entertainment had found his address and had followed him here he dressed himself with feverish haste not however without a certain care of his appearance and some selection of apparel and quickly forecast the forthcoming interview in his mind for the pendulum had swung back mr james smith was once more the selfsatisfied selfcomplacent and discreetly cautious husband that he had been at the beginning of his quest perhaps with a certain sense of grievance superadded he should require the fullest explanations and guarantees before committing himselfindeed her present call might be an advance that it would be necessary for him to check he even pictured her pleading at his feet a very little stronger effort of his alnaschar imagination would have made him reject her like the fatuous persian glass peddler  he opened the door of the sittingroom deliberately and walked in with a certain formal precision but the figure of a woman arose from the sofa and with a slight outcry half playful half hysterical threw herself upon his breast with the single exclamation jim he started back from the double shock for the woman was not his wife a woman extravagantly dressed still young but bearing even through her artificially heightened color a face worn with excitement excess and premature age yet a face that as he disengaged himself from her arms grew upon him with a terrible recognition a face that he had once thought pretty inexperienced and innocentthe face of the widow of his former partner cutler the woman he was to have married on the day he fled the bitter revulsion of feeling and astonishment was evidently visible in his face for she too drew back for a moment as they separated but she had evidently been prepared if not pathetically inured to such experiences she dropped into a chair again with a dry laugh and a hard metallic voice as she said  well its you anywayand you cant get out of it  as he still stared at her in her inconsistent finery draggled and wet by the storm at her limp ribbons and ostentatious jewelry she continued in the same hard voice  i thought i spotted you once or twice before but you took no notice of me and i reckoned i was mistaken but this afternoon at the temple of music  where said james smith harshly  at the templethe san francisco troupe performancewhere you brushed by me and i heard your voice saying beg pardon i says thats jim farendell  farendell burst out james smith half in simulated astonishment half in real alarm  well smith then if you like better said the woman impatiently though its about the sickest and most playedout dodge of a name you could have pitched upon james smith don diego smith she repeated with a hysteric laugh why it beats the nigger minstrels all hollow well when i saw you there i said thats jim farendell or his twin brother i didnt say his ghost mind you for from the beginning even before i knew it all i never took any stock in that fool yarn about your burnt bones being found in your office  knew all knew what demanded the man with a bravado which he nevertheless felt was hopeless  she rose crossed the room and standing before him placed one hand upon her hip as she looked at him with halfpitying effrontery  look here jim she began slowly do you know what youre doing well youre making me tired in spite of himself a halfsuperstitious thrill went through him as her words and attitude recalled the dead scranton do you suppose that i dont know that you ran away the night of the fire do you suppose that i dont know that you were next to ruined that night and that you took that opportunity of skedaddling out of the country with all the money you had left and leaving folks to imagine you were burnt up with the books you had falsified and the accounts you had doctored it was a mean thing for you to do to me jim for i loved you then and would have been fool enough to run off with you if youd told me all and not left me to find out that you had lost my moneyevery cent cutler had left me in the businesswith the rest  with the fatuousness of a weak man cornered he clung to unimportant details but the body was believed to be mine by every one he stammered angrily my papers and books were burntthere was no evidence  and why was there not she said witheringly staring doggedly in his face because i stopped it because when i knew those bones and rags shut up in that office werent yours and was beginning to make a row about it a strange man came to me and said they were the remains of a friend of his who knew your bankruptcy and had come that night to warn youa man whom you had half ruined once a man who had probably lost his life in helping you away he said if i went on making a fuss hed come out with the whole truthhow you were a thief and a forger andshe stopped  and what else he asked desperately dreading to hear his wifes name next fall from her lips  and thatas it could be proved that his friend knew your secrets she went on in a frightened embarrassed voice you might be accused of making away with him  for a moment james smith was appalled he had never thought of this as in all his past villainy he was too cowardly to contemplate murder he was frightened at the mere accusation of it but he stammered forgetful of all save this new terror he knew i wouldnt be such a fool for the man himself told me duffy had the papers and killing him wouldnt have helped me  mrs cutler stared at him a moment searchingly and then turned wearily away well she said sinking into her chair again he said if id shut my mouth hed shut hisandi did and this she added throwing her hands from her lap a gesture half of reproach and half of contemptthis is what i get for it  more frightened than touched by the womans desperation james smith stammered a vague apologetic disclaimer even while he was loathing with a revulsion new to him her draggled finery her still more faded beauty and the halfdistinct consciousness of guilt that linked her to him but she waved it away a weary gesture that again reminded him of the dead scranton  of course i aint what i was but whos to blame for it when you left me alone without a cent face to face with a lie i had to do something i wasnt brought up to work i like good clothes and you know it better than anybody i aint one of your stage heroines that go out as dependants and governesses and die of consumption but i thought she went on with a shrill hysterical laugh more painful than the weariness which inevitably followed it i thought i might train myself to do it on the stage and i joined barkers company they said i had a face and figure for the stage that face and figure wore out before i had anything more to show and i wasnt big enough to make better terms with the manager they kept me nearly a year doing chambermaids and fairy queens the other side of the footlights where i saw you today then i kicked i suppose i might have married some fool for his money but i was soft enough to think you might be sending for me when you were safe you seem to be mighty comfortable here she continued with a bitter glance around his handsomely furnished room as don diego smith i reckon skedaddling pays better than staying behind  i have only been here a few weeks he said hurriedly i never knew what had become of you or that you were still here  or you wouldnt have come she interrupted with a bitter laugh speak out jim  if thereis anythingi can dofor you he stammered im sure  anything you can do she repeated slowly and scornfully anything you can do now yes she screamed suddenly rising crossing the room and grasping his arms convulsively yes take me away from hereanywhereat once look jim she went on feverishly let bygones be bygonesi wont peach i wont tell on youthough i had it in my heart when you gave me the goby just now ill do anything you saygo to your farthest hidingplacework for youonly take me out of this cursed place  her passionate pleading stung even through his selfishness and loathing he thought of his wifes indifference yes he might be driven to this and at least he must secure the only witness against his previous misconduct we will see he said soothingly gently loosening her hands we must talk it over he stopped as his old suspiciousness returned but you must have some friends he said searchingly some one who has helped you  none only onehe helped me at first she hesitatedduffy  duffy said james smith recoiling  yes when he had to tell me all she said in halffrightened tones he was sorry for me listen jim he was a square man for all he was devoted to his partnerand you cant blame him for that i think he helped me because i was alone for nothing else jim i swear it he helped me from time to time maybe he might have wanted to marry me if he had not been waiting for another woman that he loved a married woman that had been deserted years ago by her husband just as you might have deserted me if wed been married that day he helped her and paid for her journey here to seek her husband and set her up in business  what are you talking aboutwhat woman stammered james smith with a strange presentiment creeping over him  a mrs smith yes she said quickly as he started not a sham name like yours but really and truly smiththat was her husbands name im not lying jim she went on evidently mistaking the cause of the sudden contraction of the mans face i didnt invent her nor her name there is such a woman and duffy loves herand her only and he never never was anything more than a friend to me i swear it  the room seemed to swim around him she was staring at him but he could see in her vacant eyes that she had no conception of his secret nor knew the extent of her revelation duffy had not dared to tell all he burst into a coarse laugh what matters duffy or the silly woman hed try to steal away from other men  but he didnt try to steal her and shes only silly because she wants to be true to her husband while he lives she told duffy shed never marry him until she saw her husbands dead face more fool she she added bitterly  until she saw her husbands dead face was all that james smith heard of this speech his wifes faithfulness through years of desertion her long waiting and truthfulness even the bitter commentary of the equally injured woman before him were to him as nothing to what that single sentence conjured up he laughed again but this time strangely and vacantly enough of this duffy and his intrusion in my affairs until im able to settle my account with him come he added brusquely if we are going to cut out of this at once ive got much to do come here again tomorrow early this duffydoes he live here  no in marysville  good come early tomorrow  as she seemed to hesitate he opened a drawer of his table and took out a handful of gold and handed it to her she glanced at it for a moment with a strange expression put it mechanically in her pocket and then looking up at him said with a forced laugh i suppose that means i am to clear out  until tomorrow he said shortly  if the sacramento dont sweep us away before then she interrupted with a reckless laugh the rivers broken through the leveea clear sweep in two places where i live the waters up to the doorstep they say its going to be the biggest flood yet youre all right here youre on higher ground  she seemed to utter these sentences abstractedly disconnectedly as if to gain time he made an impatient gesture  all right im going she said compressing her lips slowly to keep them from trembling you havent forgotten anything as he turned half angrily towards her she added hurriedly and bitterly anythingfor tomorrow  no  she opened the door and passed out he listened until the trail of her wet skirt had descended the stairs and the street door had closed behind her then he went back to his table and began collecting his papers and putting them away in his trunks which he packed feverishly yet with a set and determined face he wrote one or two letters which he sealed and left upon his table he then went to his bedroom and deliberately shaved off his disguising beard had he not been so preoccupied in one thought he might have been conscious of loud voices in the street and a hurrying of feet on the wet sidewalk but he was possessed by only one idea he must see his wife that evening how he knew not yet but the way would appear when he had reached his office in the building opposite hers three hours had elapsed before he had finished his preparations on going downstairs he stopped to give some directions to the porter but his room was empty passing into the street he was surprised to find it quite deserted and the shops closed even a drinking saloon at the corner was quite empty he turned the corner of the street and began the slight descent towards his office to his amazement the lower end of the street which was crossed by the thoroughfare which was his destination was blocked by a crowd of people as he hurried forward to join them he suddenly saw moving down that thoroughfare what appeared to his startled eyes to be the smokestacks of some small flatbottomed steamer he rubbed his eyes it was no illusion for the next moment he had reached the crowd who were standing half a block away from the thoroughfare and on the edge of a lagoon of yellow water whose main current was the thoroughfare he was seeking and between whose houses submerged to their first stories a steamboat was really paddling other boats and rafts were adrift on its sluggish waters and a boatman had just landed a passenger in the backwater of the lower half of the street on which he stood with the crowd  possessed of his one idea he fought his way desperately to the water edge and the boat and demanded a passage to his office the boatman hesitated but james smith promptly offered him double the value of his craft the act was not deemed singular in that extravagant epoch and the sympathizing crowd cheered his solitary departure as he declined even the services of the boatman the next moment he was off in midstream of the thoroughfare paddling his boat with a desperate but inexperienced hand until he reached his office which he entered by the window the building which was new and of brick showed very little damage from the flood but in far different case was the one opposite on which his eyes were eagerly bent and whose cheap and insecure foundations he could see the flood was already undermining there were boats around the house and men hurriedly removing trunks and valuables but the one figure he expected to see was not there he tied his own boat to the window there was evidently no chance of an interview now but if she were leaving there would be still the chance of following her and knowing her destination as he gazed she suddenly appeared at a window and was helped by a boatman into a flatbottomed barge containing trunks and furniture she was evidently the last to leave the other boats put off at once and none too soon for there was a warning cry a quick swerving of the barge and the end of the dwelling slowly dropped into the flood seeming to sink on its knees like a stricken ox a great undulation of yellow water swept across the street inundating his office through the open window and half swamping his boat beside it at the same time he could see that the current had changed and increased in volume and velocity and from the cries and warning of the boatmen he knew that the river had burst its banks at its upper bend he had barely time to leap into his boat and cast it off before there was a foot of water on his floor  but the new current was carrying the boats away from the higher level which they had been eagerly seeking and towards the channel of the swollen river the barge was first to feel its influence and was hurried towards the river against the strongest efforts of its boatmen one by one the other and smaller boats contrived to get into the slack water of crossing streets and one was swamped before his eyes but james smith kept only the barge in view his difficulty in following it was increased by his inexperience in managing a boat and the quantity of drift which now charged the current trees torn by their roots from some upland bank sheds logs timber and the bloated carcasses of cattle choked the stream all the ruin worked by the flood seemed to be compressed in this disastrous current once or twice he narrowly escaped collision with a heavy beam or the bed of some farmers wagon once he was swamped by a tree and righted his frail boat while clinging to its branches  and then those who watched him from the barge and shore said afterwards that a great apathy seemed to fall upon him he no longer attempted to guide the boat or struggle with the drift but sat in the stern with intent forward gaze and motionless paddles once they strove to warn him called to him to make an effort to reach the barge and did what they could in spite of their own peril to alter their course and help him but he neither answered nor heeded them and then suddenly a great log that they had just escaped seemed to rise up under the keel of his boat and it was gone after a moment his face and head appeared above the current and so close to the stern of the barge that there was a slight cry from the woman in it but the next moment and before the boatman could reach him he was drawn under it and disappeared they lay on their oars eagerly watching but the body of james smith was sucked under the barge and in the midchannel of the great river was carried out towards the distant sea     there was a strange meeting that night on the deck of a relief boat which had been sent out in search of the missing barge between mrs smith and a grave and anxious passenger who had chartered it when he had comforted her and pointed out as indeed he had many times before the loneliness and insecurity of her unprotected life she yielded to his arguments but it was not until many months after their marriage that she confessed to him on that eventful night she thought she had seen in a moment of great peril the vision of the dead face of her husband uplifted to her through the water     lanty fosters mistake   lanty foster was crouching on a low stool before the dying kitchen fire the better to get its fading radiance on the book she was reading beyond through the open window and door the fire was also slowly fading from the sky and the mountain ridge whence the sun had dropped half an hour before the view was uphill and the skyline of the hill was marked by two or three gibbetlike poles from which on a now invisible line between them depended certain objectsmere black silhouettes against the skywhich bore weird likeness to human figures absorbed as she was in her book she nevertheless occasionally cast an impatient glance in that direction as the sunlight faded more quickly than her fire for the fluttering objects were the weeks wash which had to be brought in before night fell and the mountain wind arose it was strong at that altitude and before this had ravished the clothes from the line and scattered them along the highroad leading over the ridge once even lashing the shy schoolmaster with a pair of lantys own stockings and blinding the parson with a really tempestuous petticoat  a whiff of wind down the bigthroated chimney stirred the log embers on the hearth and the girl jumped to her feet closing the book with an impatient snap she knew her mothers voice would follow it was hard to leave her heroine at the crucial moment of receiving an explanation from a presumed faithless lover just to climb a hill and take in a lot of soulless washing but such are the infelicities of stolen romance reading she threw the clothesbasket over her head like a hood the handle resting across her bosom and shoulders and with both her hands free started out of the cabin but the darkness had come up from the valley in one stride after its mountain fashion had outstripped her and she was instantly plunged in it still the outline of the ridge above her was visible with the white steadfast stars that were not there a moment ago and by that sign she knew she was late she had to battle against the rushing wind now which sung through the inverted basket over her head and held her back but with bent shoulders she at last reached the top of the ridge and the level yet here owing to the shifting of the lighter background above her she now found herself again encompassed with the darkness the outlines of the poles had disappeared the white fluttering garments were distinct apparitions waving in the wind like dancing ghosts but there certainly was a queer misshapen bulk moving beyond which she did not recognize and as she at last reached one of the poles a shock was communicated to it through the clothesline and the bulk beyond then she heard a voice say impatiently  what in hll am i running into now  it was a mans voice and from its elevation the voice of a man on horseback she answered without fear and with slow deliberation  inter our clothesline i reckon  oh said the man in a halfapologetic tone then in brisker accents the very thing i want i say can you give me a bit of it the ring of my saddle girth has fetched loose i can fasten it with that  i reckon replied lanty with the same unconcern moving nearer the bulk which now separated into two parts as the man dismounted how much do you want  a foot or two will do  they were now in front of each other although their faces were not distinguishable to either lanty who had been following the lines with her hand here came upon the end knotted around the last pole this she began to untie  what a place to hang clothes he said curiously  mighty dryin tho returned lanty laconically  and your house is it near by he continued  just down the ridgeye kin see from the edge got a knife she had untied the knot  noyeswait he had hesitated a moment and then produced something from his breast pocket which he however kept in his hand as he did not offer it to her she simply held out a section of the rope between her hands which he divided with a single cut she saw only that the instrument was long and keen then she lifted the flap of the saddle for him as he attempted to fasten the loose ring with the rope but the darkness made it impossible with an ejaculation he fumbled in his pockets my last match he said striking it as he crouched over it to protect it from the wind lanty leaned over also with her apron raised between it and the blast the flame for an instant lit up the ring the mans dark face mustache and white teeth set together as he tugged at the girth and lantys brown velvet eyes and soft round cheek framed in the basket then it went out but the ring was secured  thank you said the man with a short laugh but i thought you were a humpbacked witch in the dark there  and i couldnt make out whether you was a cow or a bar returned the young girl simply  here however he quickly mounted his horse but in the action something slipped from his clothes struck a stone and bounded away into the darkness  my knife he said hurriedly please hand it to me but although the girl dropped on her knees and searched the ground diligently it could not be found the man with a restrained ejaculation again dismounted and joined in the search  havent you got another match suggested lanty  noit was my last he said impatiently  just you hol on here she said suddenly and ill run down to the kitchen and fetch you a light i wont be long  no no said the man quickly dont i couldnt wait ive been here too long now look here you come in daylight and find it andjust keep it for me will you he laughed ill come for it and now if youll only help to set me on that road again for its so infernal black i cant see the mares ears ahead of me i wont bother you any more thank you  lanty had quietly moved to his horses head and taken the bridle in her hand and at once seemed to be lost in the gloom but in a few moments he felt the muffled thud of his horses hoof on the thick dust of the highway and its still hot impalpable powder rising to his nostrils  thank you he said again im all right now and in the pause that followed it seemed to lanty that he had extended a parting hand to her in the darkness she put up her own to meet it but missed his which had blundered onto her shoulder before she could grasp it she felt him stooping over her the light brush of his soft mustache on her cheek and then the starting forward of his horse but the retaliating box on the ear she had promptly aimed at him spent itself in the black space which seemed suddenly to have swallowed up the man and even his light laugh  for an instant she stood still and then swinging the basket indignantly from her shoulder took up her suspended task it was no light one in the increasing wind and the unfastened clothesline had precipitated a part of its burden to the ground through the loosening of the rope but on picking up the trailing garments her hand struck an unfamiliar object the strangers lost knife she thrust it hastily into the bottom of the basket and completed her work as she began to descend with her burden she saw that the light of the kitchen fire seen through the windows was augmented by a candle her mother was evidently awaiting her  pretty time to be fetchin in the wash said mrs foster querulously but what can you expect when folks stand gossipin and philanderin on the ridge instead o tendin to their work  now lanty knew that she had not been gossipin nor philanderin yet as the parting salute might have been open to that imputation and as she surmised that her mother might have overheard their voices she briefly said to prevent further questioning that she had shown a stranger the road but for her mothers unjust accusation she would have been more communicative as mrs foster went back grumblingly into the sittingroom lanty resolved to keep the knife at present a secret from her mother and to that purpose removed it from the basket but in the light of the candle she saw it for the first time plainlyand started  for it was really a dagger jeweledhandled and richly wroughtsuch as lanty had never looked upon before the hilt was studded with gems and the blade which had a cutting edge was damascened in blue and gold her soft eyes reflected the brilliant setting her lips parted breathlessly then as her mothers voice arose in the other room she thrust it back into its velvet sheath and clapped it into her pocket its rare beauty had confirmed her resolution of absolute secrecy to have shown it now would have made no end of talk and she was not sure but that her parents would have demanded its custody and it was given to her by him to keep this settled the question of moral ethics she took the first opportunity to run up to her bedroom and hide it under the mattress  yet the thought of it filled the rest of her evening when her household duties were done she took up her novel again partly from force of habit and partly as an attitude in which she could think of it undisturbed for what was fiction to her now true it possessed a certain reminiscent value a dagger had appeared in several romances she had devoured but she never had a clear idea of one before the count sprang back and drawing from his belt a richly jeweled dagger hissed between his teeth or more to the purpose take this said orlando handing her the rubyhilted poignard which had gleamed upon his thigh and should the caitiff attempt thy unguarded innocence  did ye hear what your father was sayin lanty started it was her mothers voice in the doorway and she had been vaguely conscious of another voice pitched in the same querulous key which indeed was the dominant expression of the small ranchers of that fertile neighborhood possibly a too complaisant and unaggressive nature had spoiled them  yesno said lanty abstractedly what did he say  if you wasnt taken up with that fool book said mrs foster glancing at her daughters slightly conscious color yed know he allowed yed better not leave yer filly in the far pasture nights that gang o mexican horsethieves is out again and raided mckinnons stock last night  this touched lanty closely the filly was her own property and she was breaking it for her own riding but her distrust of her parents interference was greater than any fear of horsestealers shes mighty uneasy in the barn and she added with a proud consciousness of that beautiful yet carnal weapon upstairs i reckon i ken protect her and myself agin any mexican horsethieves  my but were gettin high and mighty responded mrs foster with deep irony did you git all that outer your fool book  mebbe said lanty curtly  nevertheless her thoughts that night were not entirely based on written romance she wondered if the stranger knew that she had really tried to box his ears in the darkness also if he had been able to see her face his she remembered at least the flash of his white teeth against his dark face and darker mustache which was quite as soft as her own hair but if he thought for a minnit that she was goin to allow an entire stranger to kiss herhe was mighty mistaken she should let him know it pretty quick she should hand him back the dagger quite careless like and never let on that shed thought anything of it perhaps that was the reason why before she went to bed she took a good look at it and after taking off her straight beltless calico gown she even tried the effect of it thrust in the stiff waistband of her petticoat with the jeweled hilt displayed and thought it looked charmingas indeed it did and then having said her prayers like a good girl and supplicated that she should be less tetchy with her parents she went to sleep and dreamed that she had gone out to take in the wash again but that the clothes had all changed to the queerest lot of folks who were all fighting and struggling with each other until she lanty drawing her dagger rushed up singlehanded among them crying disperse ye craven cursdisperse i say and they dispersed  yet even lanty was obliged to admit the next morning that all this was somewhat incongruous with the baking of corn dodgers the frying of fish the making of beds and her other household duties and dismissed the stranger from her mind until he should happen along in her freer and more acceptable outdoor duties she even tolerated the advances of neighboring swains who made a point of passing by fosters ranch and who were quite aware that atalanta foster alias lanty was one of the prettiest girls in the country but lantys toleration consisted in that singular performance known to herself as giving them as good as they sent being a lazy traversing qualified with scorn of all that they advanced how long they would have put up with this from a plain girl i do not know but lantys short upper lip seemed framed for indolent and fascinating scorn and her dreamy eyes usually looked beyond the questioner or blunted his bolder glances in their velvety surfaces the libretto of these scenes was not exhaustive eg  the swain with bold bad gayety saw that shy schoolmaster hangin round your ridge yesterday orter know by this time that shyness with a gal dont pay  lanty decisively mebbe he allows it dont get left as often as impudence  the swain ignoring the reply and his previous attitude and becoming more direct i was calkilatin to say that with these yer hossthieves about yer filly aint safe in the pasture i took a turn round there two or three times last evening to see if she was all right  lanty with a flattering show of interest no did ye now i was jest wonderin  the swain eagerly i didquite late too why thats nothin miss atalanty to what id do for you  lanty musing with far offeyes then thats why she was so awful skeerd and frightened just jumpin outer her skin with horror i reckoned it was a bar or panther or a spook you ought to have waited till she got accustomed to your looks  nevertheless despite this elegant raillery lanty was enough concerned in the safety of her horse to visit it the next day with a view of bringing it nearer home she had just stepped into the alder fringe of a dry run when she came suddenly upon the figure of a horseman in the run who had been hidden by the alders from the plain beyond and who seemed to be engaged in examining the hoof marks in the dust of the old ford something about his figure struck her recollection and as he looked up quickly she saw it was the owner of the dagger but he appeared to be lighter of hair and complexion and was dressed differently and more like a vaquero yet there was the same flash of his teeth as he recognized her and she knew it was the same man  alas for her preparation without the knife she could not make that haughty return of it which she had contemplated and more than that she was conscious she was blushing nevertheless she managed to level her pretty brown eyebrows at him and said sharply that if he followed her to her home she would return his property at once  but im in no hurry for it he said with a laughthe same light laugh and pleasant voice she rememberedand id rather not come to the house just now the knife is in good hands i know and ill call for it when i want it and until thenif its all the same to youkeep it to yourselfkeep it dark as dark as the night i lost it  i dont go about blabbing my affairs said lanty indignantly and if it hadnt been dark that night youd have had your ears boxedyou know why  the stranger laughed again waved his hand to lanty and galloped away  lanty was a little disappointed the daylight had taken away some of her illusions he was certainly very goodlooking but not quite as picturesque mysterious and thrilling as in the dark and it was very queerhe certainly did look darker that night who was he and why was he lingering near her he was different from her neighborsher admirers he might be one of those locaters from the big towns who prospect the lands with a view of settling government warrants on themthey were always so secret until they had found what they wanted she did not dare to seek information of her friends for the same reason that she had concealed his existence from her motherit would provoke awkward questions and it was evident that he was trusting to her secrecy too the thought thrilled her with a new pride and was some compensation for the loss of her more intangible romance it would be mighty fine when he did call openly for his beautiful knife and declared himself to have them all know that she knew about it all along  when she reached home to guard against another such surprise she determined to keep the weapon with her and distrusting her pocket confided it to the cheap little countrymade corset which only for the last year had confined her budding figure and which now perhaps heaved with an additional pride she was quite abstracted during the rest of the day and paid but little attention to the gossip of the farm lads who were full of a daring raid two nights before by the mexican gang on the large stock farm of a neighbor the vigilant committee had been baffled it was even alleged that some of the smaller ranchmen and herders were in league with the gang it was also believed to be a widespread conspiracy to have a political complexion in its combination of an alien race with southwestern filibusters the legal authorities had been reinforced by special detectives from san francisco lanty seldom troubled herself with these matters she knew the exaggeration she suspected the ignorance of her rural neighbors she roughly referred it in her own vocabulary to jaw a peculiarly masculine quality but later in the evening when the domestic circle in the sittingroom had been augmented by a neighbor and lanty had taken refuge behind her novel as an excuse for silence zob hopper the enamored swain of the previous evening burst in with more astounding news a posse of the sheriff had just passed along the ridge they had corraled part of the gang and rescued some of the stock the leader of the gang had escaped but his capture was inevitable as the roads were stopped all the same im glad to see ye took my advice miss atalanty and brought in your filly he concluded with an insinuating glance at the young girl  but miss atalanty curling a quarter of an inch of scarlet lip above the edge of her novel here allowed that if his advice or the filly had to be took she didnt know which was worse  i wonder ye kin talk to sech peartness mr hopper said mrs foster severely she aint got eyes nor senses for anythin but that book  talkin o whats to be took put in the diplomatic neighbor you bet it aint that mexican leader no sir hes been stopped before thisand then got clean away all the same one o them detectives got him once and disarmed himbut he managed to give them the slip after all why hes that full o shifts and disguises thar aint no spottin him he walked right under the constables nose oncet and took a drink with the sheriff that was arter himand the blamed fool never knew it he kin change even the color of his hair quick as winkin  is he a real mexicana regular greaser asked the paternal foster cos i never heard that they wuz smart  no they say he comes o old spanish stock a bad egg they threw outer the nest i reckon put in hopper eagerly seeing a strange animated interest dilating lantys eyes and hoping to share in it but hes reglar hightoned you bet why i knew a man who seed him in his own campprinked out in a velvet jacket and silk sash with gold chains and buttons down his wide pants and a dagger stuck in his sash with a handle just blazin with jewls yes miss atalanty they say that one stone at the topa green stone what they call an emralwas worth the price o a frisco houselot true ez you live ehwhats up now  lantys book had fallen on the floor as she was rising to her feet with a white face still more strange and distorted in an affected yawn behind her little hand yer makin me that sick and nervous with yer fool yarns she said hysterically that im goin to get a little fresh air its just stifling here with lies and terbacker with another high laugh she brushed past him into the kitchen opened the door and then paused and turning ran rapidly up to her bedroom here she locked herself in tore open the bosom of her dress plucked out the dagger threw it on the bed where the green stone gleamed for an instant in the candlelight and then dropped on her knees beside the bed with her whirling head buried in her cold red hands  it had all come to her in a flash like a blaze of lightningthe black haunting figure on the ridge the broken saddle girth the abandonment of the dagger in the exigencies of flight and concealment the second meeting the skulking in the dry alderhidden run the changed dress the lightercolored hair but always the same voice and laughthe leader the fugitive the mexican horsethief and she the godforsaken fool the chuckleheaded nigger baby with not half the sense of her own filly or that sopheaded hopperhad never seen it sheshe who would be the laughingstock of them allshe had thought him a locater a towny from frisco and she had consented to keep his knife until he would call for ityes call for it with fire and flame perhaps the trampling of hoofs pistol shotsandyet  yethe had trusted her yes trusted her when he knew a word from her lips would have brought the whole district down on him when the mere exposure of that dagger would have identified and damned him trusted her a second time when she was within cry of her house when he might have taken her filly without her knowing it and now she remembered vaguely that the neighbors had said how strange it was that her fathers stock had not suffered as theirs had he had protected themhe who was now a fugitiveand their men pursuing him she rose suddenly with a single stamp of her narrow foot and as suddenly became cool and sane and then quite her old self again she lazily picked up the dagger and restored it to its place in her bosom that done with her color back and her eyes a little brighter she deliberately went downstairs again stuck her little brown head into the sittingroom said cheerfully still yawpin you folks and quietly passed out into the darkness  she ran swiftly up to the ridge impelled by the blind memory of having met him there at night and the one vague thought to give him warning but it was dark and empty with no sound but the rushing wind and then an idea seized her if he were haunting the vicinity still he might see the fluttering of the clothes upon the line and believe she was there she stooped quickly and in the merciful and exonerating darkness stripped off her only white petticoat and pinned it on the line it flapped fluttered and streamed in the mountain wind she lingered and listened but there came a sound she had not counted onthe clattering hoofs of not one but many horses on the lower road she ran back to the house to find its inmates already hastening towards the road for news she took that chance to slip in quietly go to her room whose window commanded a view of the ridge and crouching low behind it she listened she could hear the sound of voices and the dull trampling of heavy boots on the dusty path towards the barnyard on the other side of the housea pause and then the return of the trampling boots and the final clattering of hoofs on the road again then there was a tap on her door and her mothers querulous voice  oh yer there are ye wellits the best place fer a girlwith all these mans doins goin on theyve got that mexican horsethief and have tied him up in your fillys stall in the barntill the frisco deputy gets back from rounding up the others so ye jest stay where ye are till theyve come and gone and were shut o all that cattle are ye mindin  all right maw taint no call o mine anyhow returned lanty through the halfopen door  at another time her mother might have been startled at her passive obedience still more would she have been startled had she seen her daughters face now behind the closed doorwith her little mouth set over her clenched teeth and yet it was her own child and lanty was her mothers real daughter the same pioneer blood filled their veins the blood that had never nourished cravens or degenerates but had given itself to sprinkle and fertilize desert solitudes where man might follow small wonder then that this frontierborn lanty whose first infant cry had been answered by the yelp of wolf and scream of panther whose fathers rifle had been leveled across her cradle to cover the stealthy indian who prowled outside small wonder that she should feel herself equal to these mans doins and prompt to take a part for even in the first shock of the news of the capture she recalled the fact that the barn was old and rotten that only that day the filly had kicked a board loose from behind her stall which she lanty had lightly returned to avoid making a fuss if his captors had not noticed it or trusted only to their guards she might make the opening wide enough to free him  two hours later the guard nearest the now sleeping house a farm hand of the fosters saw his employers daughter slip out and cautiously approach him a devoted slave of lantys and familiar with her impulses he guessed her curiosity and was not averse to satisfy it and the sense of his own importance to her whispers of affected halfterrified interest he responded in whispers that the captive was really in the fillys stall securely bound by his wrists behind his back and his feet hobbled to a post that lanty couldnt see him for it was dark inside and he was sitting with his back to the wall as he couldnt sleep comfble lyin down lantys eyes glowed but her face was turned aside  and ye aint reckonin his friends will come and rescue him said lanty gazing with affected fearfulness in the darkness  not much theres two other guards down in the corral and id fire my gun and bring em up  but lanty was gazing openmouthed towards the ridge whats that wavin on the ridge she said in awestricken tones  she was pointing to the petticoata vague distant moving object against the horizon  why thats some o the wash on the line aint it  washtwo days in the week said lanty sharply wots gone of you  thets so muttered the man and it want there at sundown ill swear praps id better call the guard and he raised his rifle  dont said lanty catching his arm suppose its nothin theyll laugh at ye creep up softly and see ye aint afraid are ye if ye are give me yer gun and ill go  this settled the question as lanty expected the man cocked his piece and bending low began cautiously to mount the acclivity lanty waited until his figure began to fade and then ran like fire to the barn  she had arranged every detail of her plan beforehand crouching beside the wall of the stall she hissed through a crack in thrilling whispers dont move dont speak for your lifes sake wait till i hand you back your knife then do the best you can then slipping aside the loosened board she saw dimly the black outline of curling hair back shoulders and tied wrists of the captive drawing the knife from her pocket with two strokes of its keen cutting edge she severed the cords threw the knife into the opening and darted away yet in that moment she knew that the man was instinctively turning towards her but it was one thing to free a horsethief and another to stop and philander with him  she ran halfway up the ridge and met the farm hand returning it was only a bit of washing after all and he was glad he hadnt fired his gun on the other hand lanty confessed she had got so skeert being alone that she came to seek him she had the shivers wasnt her hand cold it was but thrilling even in its coldness to the bashfully admiring man and she was that weak and dizzy he must let her lean on his arm going down and they must go slow she was sure he was cold too and if he would wait at the back door she would give him a drink of whiskey thus lanty with her brain afire her eyes and ears straining into the darkness and the vague outline of the barn beyond another moment was protracted over the drink of whiskey and then lanty with a faint archness made him promise not to tell her mother of her escapade and she promised on her part not to say anything about his stalking a petticoat on the clothesline and then shyly closed the door and regained her room he must have got away by this time or have been discovered she believed they would not open the barn door until the return of the posse  she was right it was near daybreak when they returned and again crouching low beside her window she heard with a fierce joy the sudden outcry the oaths the wrangling voices the summoning of her father to the front door and then the tumultuous sweeping away again of the whole posse and a blessed silence falling over the rancho and then lanty went quietly to bed and slept like a threeyear child  perhaps that was the reason why she was able at breakfast to listen with lazy and even rosy indifference to the startling events of the night to the sneers of the farm hands at the posse who had overlooked the knife when they searched their prisoner as well as the stupidity of the corral guard who had never heard him make a hole the size of a house in the barn side once she glanced demurely at silas briggsthe farm hand and the poor fellow felt consoled in his shame at the remembrance of their confidences  but lantys tranquillity was not destined to last long there was again the irruption of exciting news from the highroad the mexican leader had been recaptured and was now safely lodged in brownsville jail those who were previously loud in their praises of the successful horsethief who had baffled the vigilance of his pursuers were now equally keen in their admiration of the new san francisco deputy who in turn had outwitted the whole gang it was he who was fertile in expedients he who had studied the whole country and even risked his life among the gang and he who had again closed the meshes of the net around the escaped outlaw he was already returning by way of the rancho and might stop there a momentso that they could all see the hero such was the power of success on the countryside outwardly indifferent inwardly bitter lanty turned away she should not grace his triumph if she kept in her room all day and when there was a clatter of hoofs on the road again lanty slipped upstairs  but in a few moments she was summoned captain lance wetherby assistant chief of police of san francisco deputy sheriff and exu s scout had requested to see miss foster a few moments alone lanty knew what it meanther secret had been discovered but she was not the girl to shirk the responsibility she lifted her little brown head proudly and with the same resolute step with which she had left the house the night before descended the stairs and entered the sittingroom at first she saw nothing then a remembered voice struck her ear she started looked up and gasping fell back against the door it was the stranger who had given her the dagger the stranger she had met in the runthe horsethief himself no no she saw it all nowshe had cut loose the wrong man  he looked at her with a smile of sadnessas he drew from his breastpocket that dreadful dagger the very sight of which lanty now loathed this is the second time miss foster he said gently that i have taken this knife from murietta the mexican bandit once when i disarmed him three weeks ago and he escaped and last night when he had again escaped and i recaptured him after i lost it that night i understood from you that you had found it and were keeping it for me he paused a moment and went on i dont ask you what happened last night i dont condemn you for it i can believe what a girl of your courage and sympathy might rightly do if her pity were excited i only askwhy did you give him back that knife i trusted you with  why why did i burst out lanty in a daring gush of truth scorn and temper because i thought you were that horsethief there  he drew back astonished and then suddenly came that laugh that lanty remembered and now hailed with joy i believe you by jove he gasped that first night i wore the disguise in which i have tracked him and mingled with his gang yes i see it all nowand more i see that to you i owe his recapture  to me echoed the bewildered girl how  why instead of making for his cave he lingered here in the confines of the ranch he thought you were in love with him because you freed him and gave him his knife and stayed to see you  but lanty had her apron to her eyes whose first tears were filling their velvet depths and her voice was broken as she said  then hecaredagood deal more for methan some people  but there is every reason to believe that lanty was wrong at least later events that are part of the history of fosters rancho and the foster family pointed distinctly to the contrary     an ali baba of the sierras   johnny starleigh found himself again late for school it was always happening it seemed to be inevitable with the process of going to school at all and it was no fault o his something was always occurringsome eccentricity of nature or circumstance was invariably starting up in his daily path to the schoolroom he may not have been thinkin of squirrels and yet the rarest and most evasive of that species were always crossing his trail he may not have been huntin honey and yet a wild bees nest in the hollow of an oak absolutely obtruded itself before him he wasnt birdcatchin and yet there was a yellowhammer always within stones throw he had heard how grown men hunters always saw the most wonderful animals when they hadnt got a gun with em and it seemed to be his lot to meet them in his restricted possibilities on the way to school if nature was thus capricious with his elders why should folk think it strange if she was as mischievous with a small boy  on this particular morning johnny had been beguiled by the unmistakable footprintsso like his ownof a bears cub what chances he had of ever coming up with them or what he would have done if he had he did not know he only knew that at the end of an hour and a half he found himself two miles from the schoolhouse and from the position of the sun at least an hour too late for school he knew that nobody would believe him the punishment for complete truancy was little worse than for being late he resolved to accept it and by way of irrevocability at once burnt his ships behind himin devouring part of his dinner  thus fortified in his outlawry he began to look about him he was on a thickly wooded terrace with a blank wall of outcrop on one side nearly as high as the pines which pressed close against it he had never seen it before it was two or three miles from the highroad and seemed to be a virgin wilderness but on close examination he could see with the eye of a boy bred in a mining district that the wall of outcrop had not escaped the attention of the mining prospector there were marks of his pick in some attractive quartz seams of the wall and farther on a more ambitious attempt evidently by a party of miners to begin a tunnel shown in an abandoned excavation and the heap of debris before it it had evidently been abandoned for some time as ferns already forced their green fronds through the stones and gravel and the yerba buena vine was beginning to mat the surface of the heap but the boys fancy was quickly taken by the traces of a singular accident and one which had perhaps arrested the progress of the excavators the roots of a large pinetree growing close to the wall had been evidently loosened by the excavators and the tree had fallen with one of its largest roots still in the opening the miners had made and apparently blocking the entrance the large tree lay as it fellmidway across another but much smaller outcrop of rock which stood sharply about fifteen feet above the level of the terracewith its gaunt dead limbs in the air at a low angle to johnnys boyish fancy it seemed so easily balanced on the rock that but for its imprisoned root it would have made a capital seesaw this he felt must be looked to hereafter but here his attention was arrested by something more alarming his quick ear attuned like an animals to all woodland sounds detected the crackling of underwood in the distance his equally sharp eye saw the figures of two men approaching but as he recognized the features of one of them he drew back with a beating heart a hushed breath and hurriedly hid himself in the shadow for he had seen that figure once beforeflying before the sheriff and an armed posseand had never forgotten it it was the figure of spanish pete a notorious desperado and sluice robber  finding he had been unobserved the boy took courage and his small faculties became actively alive the two men came on together cautiously and at a little distance the second man whom johnny did not know parted from his companion and began to loiter up and down looking around as if acting as a sentinel for the desperado who advanced directly to the fallen tree suddenly the sentinel uttered an exclamation and spanish pete paused the sentinel was examining the ground near the heap of debris  whats up growled the desperado  foot tracks werent here before and fresh ones too  johnnys heart sank it was where he had just passed  spanish pete hurriedly joined his companion  foot tracks be  he said scornfully what fool would be crawlin round here barefooted its a young bar  johnny knew the footprints were his own yet he recognized the truth of the resemblance it was uncomplimentary but he felt relieved the desperado came forward and to the boys surprise began to climb the small ridge of outcrop until he reached the fallen tree johnny saw that he was carrying a heavy stone whats the blamed fool goin to do he said to himself the mans evident ignorance regarding footprints had lessened the boys awe of him but the strangers next essay took johnnys breath away standing on the fallen tree trunk at its axis on the outcrop he began to rock it gently to johnnys surprise it began to move the upper end descended slowly lifting the root in the excavation at the lower end and with it a mass of rock and revealing a cavern behind large enough to admit a man johnny gasped the desperado coolly deposited the heavy stone on the tree beyond its axis on the rock so that it would keep the tree in position leaped from the tree to the rock and quickly descended at which he was joined by the other man who was carrying two heavy chamoisleather bags they both proceeded to the opening thus miraculously disclosed and disappeared in it  johnny sat breathless wondering expectant but not daring to move the men might come out at any moment he had seen enough to know that their enterprise as well as their cave was a secret and that the desperado would subject any witness to it however innocent or unwilling to horrible penalties the time crept slowly byhe heard every rap of a woodpecker in a distant tree a blue jay dipped and lighted on a branch within his reach but he dared not extend his hand his legs were infested by ants he even fancied he heard the dry hollow rattle of a rattlesnake not a yard from him and then the entrance of the cave was darkened and the two men reappeared johnny stared he would have rubbed his eyes if he had dared they were not the same men did the cave contain others who had been all the while shut up in its dark recesses was there a band would they all swarm out upon him should he run for his life  but the illusion was only momentary a longer look at them convinced him that they were the same men in new clothes and disguised and as one remounted the outcrop johnnys keen eyes recognized him as spanish pete he merely kicked away the stone the root again descended gently over the opening and the tree recovered its former angle the two hurried away but johnny noticed that they were emptyhanded the bags had been left behind  the boy waited patiently listening with his ear to the ground like an indian for the last rustle of fern and crackle of underbrush and then emerged stiff and cramped from his concealment but he no longer thought of flight curiosity and ambition burned in his small veins he quickly climbed up the outcrop picked up the fallen stone and in spite of its weight lifted it to the prostrate tree here he paused and from his coign of vantage looked and listened the solitude was profound then mounting the tree and standing over its axis he tried to rock it as the others had alas johnnys heart was stout his courage unlimited his perception allembracing his ambition boundless but his actual avoirdupois was only that of a boy of ten the tree did not move but johnny had played seesaw before and quietly moved towards its highest part it slowly descended under the changed centre of gravity and the root arose disclosing the opening as before yet here the little hero paused he waited with his eyes fixed on the opening ready to fly on the sallying out of any one who had remained concealed he then placed the stone where he had stood leaped down and ran to the opening  the change from the dazzling sunlight to the darkness confused him at first and he could see nothing on entering he stumbled over something which proved to be a bottle in which a candle was fitted and a box of matches evidently used by the two men lighting the candle he could now discern that the cavern was only a few yards long the beginning of a tunnel which the accident to the tree had stopped in one corner lay the clothes that the men had left and which for a moment seemed all that the cavern contained but on removing them johnny saw that they were thrown over a rifle a revolver and the two chamoisleather bags that the men had brought there they were so heavy that the boy could scarcely lift them his face flushed his hands trembled with excitement to a boy whose truant wanderings had given him a fair knowledge of mining he knew that weight could have but one meaning gold he hurriedly untied the nearest bag but it was not the gold of the locality of the tunnel of the bed rock it was flake gold the gold of the river it had been taken from the miners sluices in the distant streams the bags before him were the spoils of the sluice robberspoils that could not be sold or even shown in the district without danger spoils kept until they could be taken to marysville or sacramento for disposal all this might have occurred to the mind of any boy of the locality who had heard the common gossip of his elders but to johnnys fancy an idea was kindled peculiarly his own here was a cavern like that of the forty thieves in the story book and he was the ali baba who knew its secret he was not obliged to say open sesame but he could say it if he liked if he was showing it off to anybody  yet alas he also knew it was a secret he must keep to himself he had nobody to trust it to his father was a charcoalburner of small means a widower with two children johnny and his elder brother sam the latter a flagrant incorrigible of twentytwo with a tendency to dissipation and low company had lately abandoned his fathers roof only to reappear at intervals of hilarious or maudlin intoxication he had always been held up to johnny as a warning or with the gloomy prognosis that he johnny was already following in his tortuous footsteps even if he were here he was not to be thought of as a confidant still less could he trust his father who would be sure to bungle the secret with sheriffs and constables and end by bringing down the vengeance of the gang upon the family as for himself he could not dispose of the gold if he were to take it the exhibition of a single flake of it to the adult public would arouse suspicion and as it was johnnys hard fate to be always doubted he might be connected with the gang as a truant he knew he had no moral standing but he also had the superstitionquite characteristic of childhoodthat being in possession of a secret he was a participant in its criminalityand bound as it were by terrible oaths and then a new idea seized him he carefully put back everything as he had found it extinguished the candle left the cave remounted the tree and closed the opening again as he had seen the others do it with the addition of murmuring shut sesame to himself and then ran away as fast as his short legs could carry him  well clear of the dangerous vicinity he proceeded more leisurely for about a mile until he came to a low whitewashed fence inclosing a small cultivated patch and a neat farmhouse beyond here he paused and cowering behind the fence with extraordinary facial contortions produced a cry not unlike the scream of a blue jay repeating it at intervals he was presently relieved by observing the approach of a nankeen sunbonnet within the inclosure above the line of fence stopping before him the sunbonnet revealed a rosy little face more than usually plump on one side and a neck enormously wrapped in a scarf it was meely amelia stryker a schoolmate detained at home by mumps as johnny was previously aware for with the famous indiscretion of some other great heroes he was about to intrust his secret and his destiny to one of the weaker sex and what were the minor possibilities of contagion to this  playin hookey agin said the young lady with a cordial and even expansive smile exclusively confined to one side of her face  um sod you be ef youd bin whar i hev he said with harrowing mystery  nosay said meely eagerly  at which johnny clutching at the top of the fence with hurried breath told his story but not all with the instinct of a true artist he withheld the manner in which the opening of the cave was revealed said nothing about the tree and i grieve to say added the words open sesame as the important factor to the operation neither did he mention the name of spanish pete for all of which he was afterwards duly grateful  meet me at the burnt pine down the crossroads at four oclock he said in conclusion and ill show ye  why not now said meely impatiently  couldnt much as my life is worth must keep watching out you come at four  and with an assuring nod he released the fence and trotted off he returned cautiously in the direction of the cave he was by no means sure that the robbers might not return that day and his mysterious rendezvous with meely veiled a certain prudence and it was well for as he stealthily crept around the face of the outcrop hidden in the ferns he saw from the altered angle of the tree that the cavern was opened he remained motionless with bated breath then he heard the sound of subdued voices from the cavern and a figure emerged from the opening johnny grasped the ferns rigidly to check the dreadful cry that rose to his lips at its sight for that figure was his own brother  there was no mistaking that weak wicked face even then flushed with liquor johnny had seen it too often thus but never before as a thiefs face he gave a little gasp and fell back upon that strange reserve of apathy and reticence in which children are apt to hide their emotions from us at such a moment he watched impassively the two other men who followed his brother out to give him a small bag and some instructions and then returned within their cave while his brother walked quickly away he watched him disappear he did not move for even if he had followed him he could not bear to face him in his shame and then out of his sullen despair came a boyish idea of revenge it was those two men who had made his brother a thief  he was very near the tree he crept stealthily on his hands and knees through the bracken and as stealthily climbed the wedge of outcrop and then leaped like a wild cat on the tree with incredible activity he lifted the balancing stone and as the tree began to move in a flash of perception transferred it to the other side of its axis and felt the roots and debris under that additional weight descend quickly with something like a crash over the opening then he took to his heels he ran so swiftly that all unknowingly he overtook a figure who turning glanced at him and then disappeared in the wood it was his second and last view of his brother as he never saw him again  but now strange to say the crucial and most despairing moment of his days experience had come he had to face meely stryker under the burnt pine and the promise he could not keep and to tell her that he had lied to her it was the only way to save his brother now his small wits and alas his smaller methods were equal to the despairing task as soon as he saw her waiting under the tree he fell to capering and dancing with an extravagance in which hysteria had no small part sold sold sold again and got the money he laughed shrilly  the girl looked at him with astonishment which changed gradually to scorn and then to anger johnnys heart sank but he redoubled his antics  whos sold she said disdainfully  you be you swallered all that stuff about ali baba you wanted to be morgy anna ho ho and ive made you play hookeyfrom home  you hateful horrid little liar  johnny accepted his punishment meeklyin his heart gratefully i reckoned youd laugh and not get mad he said submissively the girl turned with tears of rage and vexation in her eyes and walked away johnny followed at a humble distance perhaps there was something instinctively touching in the boys remorse for they made it up before they reached her fence  nevertheless johnny went home miserable luckily for him his father was absent at a vigilance committee called to take cognizance of the late sluice robberies and although this temporarily concealed his offense of truancy the news of the vigilance meeting determined him to keep his lips sealed he lay all night wondering how long it would take the robbers to dig themselves out of the cave and whether they suspected their imprisonment was the work of an enemy or only an accident for several days he avoided the locality and even feared the vengeful appearance of spanish pete some night at his fathers house it was not until the end of a fortnight that he had the courage to revisit the spot the tree was in its normal position but immovable and a great quantity of fresh debris at the mouth of the cave convinced him that the robbers after escaping had abandoned it as unsafe his brother did not return and either the activity of the vigilance committee or the lack of a new place of rendezvous seemed to have dispersed the robbers from the locality for they were not heard of again  the next ten years brought an improvement to mr starleighs fortunes johnny starleigh then a student at san jose one morning found a newspaper clipping in a letter from miss amelia stryker it read as follows the excavators in the new tunnel in heavystone ridge lately discovered the skeletons of two unknown men who had evidently been crushed and entombed some years previously by the falling of a large tree over the mouth of their temporary refuge from some river gold found with them they were supposed to be part of the gang of sluice robbers who infested the locality some years ago and were hiding from the vigilants  for a few days thereafter johnny starleigh was thoughtful and reserved but he did not refer to the paragraph in answering the letter he decided to keep it for later confidences when miss stryker should become mrs starleigh     miss peggys proteges   the string of peggys sunbonnet had become untiedso had her right shoe these were not unusual accidents to a country girl of ten but as both of her hands were full she felt obliged to put down what she was carrying this was further complicated by the nature of her burdena halffledged shrike and a baby gopherpicked up in her walk it was impossible to wrap them both in her apron without serious peril to one or the other she could not put either down without the chance of its escaping its like that dreadful riddle of the ferryman who had to take the wolf and the sheep in his boat said peggy to herself though i dont believe anybody was ever so silly as to want to take a wolf across the river but looking up she beheld the approach of sam bedell a sixfoot tunnelman of the blue cement lead and hailing him begged him to hold one of her captives the giant loathing the little mouselike ball of fur chose the shrike hold him by the feet for he bites awful said peggy as the bird regarded sam with the diabolically intense frown of his species then dropping the gopher unconcernedly in her pocket she proceeded to rearrange her toilet the tunnelman waited patiently until peggy had secured the nankeen sunbonnet around her fresh but freckled cheeks and with a reckless display of yellow flannel petticoat and stockings like peppermint sticks had doubleknotted her shoestrings viciously when he ventured to speak  same old game peggy thought youd got rather discouraged with your happy family arter that new owl o yours had gathered em in  peggys cheek flushed slightly at this ungracious allusion to a former collection of hers which had totally disappeared one evening after the introduction of a new member in the shape of a singularly venerable and peacefullooking horned owl  i could have tamed him too said peggy indignantly if ned myers who gave him to me hadnt been training him to ketch things and never let on anything about it to me he was a reglar game owl  and wot are ye goin to do with the colonel here said sam indicating under that gallant title the infant shrike who with his claws deeply imbedded in sams finger was squatting like a malignant hunchback and resisting his transfer to peggy wont he make it rather lively for the others he looks powful discontented for one so young  thats his nater said peggy promptly jess wait till i tame him ef hed been left along o his folks hed grow up like em hes a butcher birdwot they call a ninekiller kills nine birds a day yes true ez you live sticks em up on thorns outside his nest jest like a butchers shop till he gets hungry ive seen em  and how do you kalkilate to tame him asked sam  by being good to him and lovin him said peggy stroking the head of the bird with infinite gentleness  that means youve got to do all the butchering for him said the cynical sam  peggy shook her head disdaining a verbal reply  ye cant bring him up on sugar and crackers like a polly persisted sam  ye ken do anythin with critters if you aint afeerd of em and love em said peggy shyly  the tall tunnelman looking down into the depths of peggys sunbonnet saw something in the round blue eyes and grave little mouth that made him think so too but here peggys serious little face took a shade of darker concern as her arm went down deeper into her pocket and her eyes got rounder  itsitsburrered out she said breathlessly  the giant leaped briskly to one side hol on said peggy abstractedly with infinite gravity she followed with her fingers a seam of her skirt down to the hem popped them quickly under it and produced with a sigh of relief the missing gopher  youll do said sam in fearful admiration mebbe youll make suthin out o the colonel too but i never took stock in that there owl he was too durned selfrighteous for a decent bird now run along afore anythin else fetches loose agin so long  he patted the top of her sunbonnet gave a little pull to the short brown braid that hung behind her temptinglywhich no miner was ever known to resistand watched her flutter off with her spoils he had done so many times before for the great foolish heart of the blue cement ridge had gone out to peggy baker the little daughter of the blacksmith quite early there were others of the family notably two elder sisters invincible at picnics and dances but peggy was as necessary to these men as the blue jay that swung before them in the dim woods the squirrel that whisked across their morning path or the woodpecker who beat his tattoo at their midday meal from the hollow pine above them she was part of the nature that kept them young her truancies and vagrancies concerned them not she was a law to herself like the birds and squirrels there were bearded lips to hail her wherever she went and a blue or redshirted arm always stretched out in any perilous pass or dangerous crossing  her peculiar tastes were an outcome of her nature assisted by her surroundings left a good deal to herself in her infancy she made playfellows of animated nature around her without much reference to selection or fitness but always with a fearlessness that was the result of her own observation and unhampered by tradition or other childrens timidity she had no superstition regarding the venom of toads the poison of spiders or the earpenetrating capacity of earwigs she had experiences and revelations of her ownwhich she kept sacredly to herself as children doand one was in regard to a rattlesnake partly induced however by the indiscreet warning of her elders she was cautioned not to take her bread and milk into the woods and was told the affecting story of the little girl who was once regularly visited by a snake that partook of her bread and milk and who was ultimately found rapping the head of the snake for gorging more than his share and not taking a poon as me do it is needless to say that this incautious caution fired peggys adventurous spirit she took a bowlful of milk to the haunt of a rattler near her home but without making the pretense of sharing it generously left the whole to the reptile after repeating this hospitality for three or four days she was amazed one morning on returning to the house to find the snakean elderly one with a dozen rattlesdevotedly following her alarmed not for her own safety nor that of her family but for the existence of her grateful friend in danger of the blacksmiths hammer she took a circuitous route leading it away then recalling a bit of woodland lore once communicated to her by a charcoalburner she broke a spray of the white ash and laid it before her in the track of the rattlesnake he stopped instantly and remained motionless without crossing the slight barrier she repeated this experiment on later occasions until the reptile understood her she kept the experience to herself but one day it was witnessed by a tunnelman on that day peggys reputation was made  from this time henceforth the major part of blue cement ridge became serious collectors for what was known as peggys menagerie and two of the tunnelmen constructed a stockaded inclosurenot half a mile from the blacksmiths cabin but unknown to himfor the reception of specimens for a long time its existence was kept a secret between peggy and her loyal friends her parents aware of her eccentric tastes only through the introduction of such smaller creatures as lizards toads and tarantulas into their housewhich usually escaped from their tin cans and boxes and sought refuge in the family slippershad frowned upon her zoological studies her mother found that her woodland rambles entailed an extraordinary wear and tear of her clothing a pinafore reduced to ribbons by a young fox and a straw hat half swallowed by a mountain kid did not seem to be a natural incident to an ordinary walk to the schoolhouse her sisters thought her tastes low and her familiar association with the miners inconsistent with their own dignity but peggy went regularly to school was a fair scholar in elementary studies what she knew of natural history in fact quite startled her teachers and being also a teachable child was allowed some latitude as for peggy herself she kept her own faith unshaken her little creed whose shibboleth was not to be afraid of gods creatures but to love em sustained her through reprimand torn clothing and it is to be feared occasional bites and scratches from the loved ones themselves  the unsuspected contiguity of the menagerie to the house had its drawbacks and once nearly exposed her a mountain wolf cub brought especially for her from the higher northern sierras with great trouble and expense by jack ryder of the lone star lead unfortunately escaped from the menagerie just as the child seemed to be in a fair way of taming it yet it had been already familiarized enough with civilization to induce it to stop in its flight and curiously examine the blacksmiths shop a shout from the blacksmith and a hurled hammer sent it flying again with mr baker and his assistant in full pursuit but it quickly distanced them with its long tireless gallop and they were obliged to return to the forge lost in wonder and conjecture for the blacksmith had recognized it as a stranger to the locality and as a man of oracular pretension had a startling theory to account for its presence this he confided to the editor of the local paper and the next issue contained an editorial paragraph our presage of a severe winter in the higher sierras and consequent spring floods in the valleys has been startlingly confirmed mountain wolves have been seen in blue cement ridge and our esteemed fellow citizen mr ephraim baker yesterday encountered a halfstarved cub entering his premises in search of food mr baker is of the opinion that the mother of the cub driven down by stress of weather was in the immediate vicinity nothing but the distress of the only responsible mother of the cub peggy and loyalty to her kept jack ryder from exposing the absurdity publicly but for weeks the camp fires of blue cement ridge shook with the suppressed and unhallowed joy of the miners who were in the guilty secret  but fortunately for peggy the most favored of her cherished possessions was not obliged to be kept secret that one exception was an indian dog this was also a gift and had been procured with great difficulty by a packer from an indian encampment on the oregon frontier the difficulty was in plain english that it had been stolen from the indians at some peril to the stealers scalp it was a mongrel to all appearances of no recognized breed or outward significance yet of a quality distinctly its own it was absolutely and totally uncivilized whether this was a hereditary trait or the result of degeneracy no one knew it refused to enter a house it would not stay in a kennel it would not eat in public but gorged ravenously and stealthily in the shadows it had the slink of a tramp and in its patched and mottled hide seemed to simulate the rags of a beggar it had the tirelessness without the affected limp of a coyote yet it had none of the ferocity of barbarians with teeth that could gnaw through the stoutest rope and toughest lariat it never bared them in anger it was cringing without being amiable or submissive it was gentle without being affectionate  yet almost insensibly it began to yield to peggys faith and kindness gradually it seemed to single her out as the one being in this vast whitefaced and fully clothed community that it could trust it presently allowed her to half drag half lead it to and fro from school although on the approach of a stranger it would bite through the rope or frantically endeavor to efface itself in peggys petticoats it was trying even to the childs sweet gravity to face the ridicule excited by its appearance on the road and its habit of carrying its tail between its legsat such an inflexible curve that on the authority of sam bedell a misstep caused it to turn a back somersaultwas painfully disconcerting but peggy endured this as she did the greater dangers of the high street in the settlement where she had often at her own risk absolutely to drag the dazed and bewildered creature from under the wheels of carts and the heels of horses but this shyness wore offor rather was eventually lost in the dogs complete and utter absorption in peggy his limited intelligence and imperfect perceptions were excited for her alone his singularly keen scent detected her wherever or how remote she might be her passage along a blind trail her deviations from the school path her more distant excursions were all mysteriously known to him it seemed as if his senses were concentrated in this one faculty no matter how unexpected or unfamiliar the itinerary lo the poor indianas the men had nicknamed him in possible allusion to his untutored mindalways arrived promptly and silently  it was to this singular faculty that peggy owed one of her strangest experiences one saturday afternoon she was returning from an errand to the village when she was startled by the appearance of lo in her path for the reason already given she no longer took him with her to these active haunts of civilization but had taught him on such occasions to remain as a guard outside the stockade which contained her treasures after reading him a severe lecture on this flagrant abandonment of his trust enforced with great seriousness and an admonitory forefinger she was concerned to see that the animal appeared less agitated by her reproof than by some other disturbance he ran ahead of her instead of at her heels as was his usual custom and barkeda thing he rarely did presently she thought she discovered the cause of this in the appearance from the wood of a dozen men armed with guns they seemed to be strangers but among them she recognized the deputy sheriff of the settlement the leader noticed her and after a word or two with the others the deputy approached her  you and lo had better be scooting home by the highroad outer thisor ye might get hurt he said half playfully half seriously  peggy looked fearlessly at the men and their guns  look ez ef you was huntin she said curiously  we are said the leader  wot you huntin  the deputy glanced at the others bar he replied  bar repeated the child with the quick resentment which a palpable falsehood always provoked in her there aint no bar in ten miles see yourself huntin bar ho  the man laughed never you mind missy said the deputy you trot along he laid his hand very gently on her head faced her sunbonnet towards the near highway gave the usual parting pull to her brown pigtail added make a beeline home and turned away  lo uttered the first growl known in his history whereat peggy said with lofty forbearance serve you jest right ef i set my dog on you  but force is no argument and peggy felt this truth even of herself and lo so she trotted away nevertheless lo showed signs of hesitation after a few moments peggy herself hesitated and looked back the men had spread out under the trees and were already lost in the woods but there was more than one trail through it and peggy knew it  and here an alarming occurrence startled her a curiously striped brown and white squirrel whisked past her and ran up a tree peggys round eyes became rounder there was but one squirrel of that kind in all the length and breadth of blue cement ridge and that was in the menagerie even as she looked it vanished peggy faced about and ran back to the road in the direction of the stockade lo bounding before her but another surprise awaited her there was the clutter of short wings under the branches and the sunlight flashed upon the iris throat of a woodduck as it swung out of sight past her but in this single glance peggy recognized one of the latest and most precious of her acquisitions there was no mistake now with a despairing little cry to lo the menageries broke loose she ran like the wind towards it she cared no longer for the mandate of the men the trail she had taken was out of their sight they were proceeding so slowly and cautiously that she and lo quickly distanced them in the same direction she would have yet time to reach the stockade and secure what was left of her treasures before they came up and drove her away yet she had to make a long circuit to avoid the blacksmiths shop and cabin before she saw the stockade lifting its fourfoot walls around an inclosure a dozen feet square in the midst of a manzanita thicket but she could see also broken coops pens cages and boxes lying before it and stopped once even in her grief and indignation to pick up a rubythroated lizard one of its late inmates that had stopped in the trail stiffened to stone at her approach the next moment she was before the roofless walls and then stopped stiffened like the lizard for out of that peaceful ruin which had once held the wild and untamed vagabonds of earth and sky arose a type of savagery and barbarism the child had never before looked uponthe head and shoulders of a hunted desperate man  his head was bare and his hair matted with sweat over his forehead his face was unshorn and the black roots of his beard showed against the deadly pallor of his skin except where it was scratched by thorns or where the red spots over his cheek bones made his cheeks look as if painted his eyes were as insanely bright he panted as quickly he showed his white teeth as perpetually his movements were as convulsive as those captured animals she had known yet he did not attempt to fly and it was only when with a sudden effort and groan of pain he half lifted himself above the stockade that she saw that his leg bandaged with his cravat and handkerchief stained a dull red dragged helplessly beneath him he stared at her vacantly for a moment and then looked hurriedly into the wood behind her  the child was more interested than frightened and more curious than either she had grasped the situation at a glance it was the hunted and the hunters suddenly he started and reached for his rifle which he had apparently set down outside when he climbed into the stockade he had just caught sight of a figure emerging from the wood at a distance but the weapon was out of his reach  hand me that gun he said roughly  but peggy did not stir the figure came more plainly and quite unconsciously into full view an easy shot at that distance  the man uttered a horrible curse and turned a threatening face on the child but peggy had seen something like that in animals she had captured she only said gravely  ef you shoot that gun youll bring em all down on you  all he demanded  yes a dozen folks with guns like yours said peggy you jest crouch down and lie low dont move watch me  the man dropped below the stockade peggy ran swiftly towards the unsuspecting figure evidently the leader of the party but deviated slightly to snatch a tiny spray from a whiteash tree she never knew that in that brief interval the wounded man after a supreme effort had possessed himself of his weapon and for a moment had covered her with its deadly muzzle she ran on fearlessly until she saw that she had attracted the attention of the leader when she stopped and began to wave the whiteash wand before her the leader halted conferred with some one behind him who proved to be the deputy sheriff stepping out he advanced towards peggy and called sharply  i told you to get out of this come be quick  youd better get out yourself said peggy waving her ash spray and quicker too  the deputy stopped staring at the spray wots up  rattlers  where  everywhere round yea reglar nest of em thats your way round she pointed to the right and again began beating the underbrush with her wand the men had meantime huddled together in consultation it was evident that the story of peggy and her influence on rattlesnakes was well known and in all probability exaggerated after a pause the whole party filed off to the right making a long circuit of the unseen stockade and were presently lost in the distance peggy ran back to the fugitive the fire of savagery and desperation in his eyes had gone out but had been succeeded by a glazing film of faintness  can youget mesome water he whispered  the stockade was near a springa necessity for the menagerie peggy brought him water in a dipper she sighed a little her butcher birdnow lost foreverhad been the last to drink from it  the water seemed to revive him the rattlesnakes scared the cowards he said with an attempt to smile were there many rattlers  there wasnt any said peggy a little spitefully cept youa twolegged rattler  the rascal grinned at the compliment  onelegged you mean he said indicating his helpless limb  peggys heart relented slightly wot you goin to do now she said you cant stay on there you know it blongs to me she was generous but practical  were those things i fired out yours  yes  mighty rough of me  peggy was slightly softened kin you walk  no  kin you crawl  not as far as a rattler  ez far ez that clearin  yes  theres a hoss tethered out in that clearin i kin shift him to this end  youre white all through said the man gravely  peggy ran off to the clearing the horse belonged to sam bedell but he had given peggy permission to ride it whenever she wished this was equivalent in peggys mind to a permission to place him where she wished she consequently led him to a point nearest the stockade and thoughtfully close beside a stump but this took some time and when she arrived she found the fugitive already there very thin and weak but still smiling  ye kin turn him loose when you get through with him hell find his way back said peggy now i must go  without again looking at the man she ran back to the stockade then she paused until she heard the sound of hoofs crossing the highway in the opposite direction from which the pursuers had crossed and knew that the fugitive had got away then she took the astonished and still motionless lizard from her pocket and proceeded to restore the broken coops and cages to the empty stockade  but she never reconstructed her menagerie nor renewed her collection people said she had tired of her whim and that really she was getting too old for such things perhaps she was but she never got old enough to reveal her story of the last wild animal she had tamed by kindness nor was she quite sure of it herself until a few years afterwards on commencement day at a boardingschool at san jose when they pointed out to her one of the most respectable trustees but they said he was once a gambler who had shot a man with whom he had quarreled and was nearly caught and lynched by a vigilance committee     the goddess of excelsior   when the two isolated mining companies encamped on sycamore creek discovered on the same day the great excelsior lead they met around a neutral camp fire with that grave and almost troubled demeanor which distinguished the successful prospector in those days perhaps the term prospectors could hardly be used for men who had labored patiently and lightheartedly in the one spot for over three years to gain a daily yield from the soil which gave them barely the necessaries of life perhaps this was why now that their reward was beyond their most sanguine hopes they mingled with this characteristic gravity an ambition and resolve peculiarly their own unlike most successful miners they had no idea of simply realizing their wealth and departing to invest or spend it elsewhere as was the common custom on the contrary that night they formed a high resolve to stand or fall by their claims to develop the resources of the locality to build up a town and to devote themselves to its growth and welfare and to this purpose they bound themselves that night by a solemn and legal compact  many circumstances lent themselves to so original a determination the locality was healthful picturesque and fertile sycamore creek a considerable tributary of the sacramento furnished them a generous water supply at all seasons its banks were well wooded and interspersed with undulating meadow land its distance from stagecoach communicationnine milescould easily be abridged by a wagon road over a practically level country indeed all the conditions for a thriving settlement were already there it was natural therefore that the most sanguine anticipations were indulged by the more youthful of the twenty members of this sacred compact the sites of a hotel a bank the express companys office stage office and courthouse with other necessary buildings were all mapped out and supplemented by a theatre a public park and a terrace along the river bank it was only when clinton grey an intelligent but youthful member on offering a plan of the town with five avenues eighty feet wide radiating from a central plaza and the courthouse explained that it could be commanded by artillery in case of an armed attack upon the building that it was felt that a line must be drawn in anticipatory suggestion nevertheless although their determination was unabated at the end of six months little had been done beyond the building of a wagon road and the importation of new machinery for the working of the lead the peculiarity of their design debarred any tentative or temporary efforts they wished the whole settlement to spring up in equal perfection so that the first stagecoach over the new road could arrive upon the completed town we dont want to show up in a biled shirt and a plug hat and our trousers stuck in our boots said a figurative speaker nevertheless practical necessity compelled them to build the hotel first for their own occupation pending the erection of their private dwellings on allotted sites the hotel a really elaborate structure for the locality and period was a marvel to the workmen and casual teamsters it was luxuriously fitted and furnished yet it was in connection with this outlay that the event occurred which had a singular effect upon the fancy of the members  washington trigg a western member who had brought up the architect and builder from san francisco had returned in a state of excitement he had seen at an art exhibition in that city a small replica of a famous statue of california and without consulting his fellow members had ordered a larger copy for the new settlement he however made up for his precipitancy by an extravagant description of his purchase which impressed even the most cautious its the figger of a mighty pretty girl in them spirit clothes they allus wear holding a divinin rod for findin gold afore her in one hand all the while shes hidin behind her in the other hand a branch o thorns out of sight the idea beindont you seethat blamed old fortyniners like us or ordinary greenhorns aint allowed to see the difficulties theyve got to go through before reaching a strike mighty cute aint it its to be made lifesizethat is about the size of a girl of that kind dont you see he explained somewhat vaguely and will look powerful fetchin standin onto a pedestal in the hall of the hotel in reply to some further cautious inquiry as to the exact details of the raiment and of any possible shock to the modesty of lady guests at the hotel he replied confidently oh thats all right its the regulation uniform of goddesses and angelssorter as if theyd caught up a sheet or a cloud to fling round em before coming into this world afore folks and being an allegory so to speak it aint as if it was me or you prospectin in high water and being of bronze it  looks like a squaw eh interrupted a critic or a cursed chinaman  and if its of metal it will weigh a ton how are we going to get it up here said another  but here mr trigg was on sure ground ive ordered it cast holler and if necessary in two sections he returned triumphantly a child could tote it round and set it up  its arrival was therefore looked forward to with great expectancy when the hotel was finished and occupied by the combined excelsior companies it was to come from new york via san francisco where however there was some delay in its transshipment and still further delay at sacramento it finally reached the settlement over the new wagon road and was among the first freight carried there by the new express company and delivered into the new express office the boxa packingcase nearly three feet square by five feet longbore superficial marks of travel and misdirection inasmuch as the original address was quite obliterated and the outside lid covered with corrected labels it was carried to a private sittingroom in the hotel where its beauty was to be first disclosed to the president of the united companies three of the committee and the excited and triumphant purchaser a less favored crowd of members and workmen gathered curiously outside the room then the lid was carefully removed revealing a quantity of shavings and packing paper which still hid the outlines of the goddess when this was promptly lifted a stare of blank astonishment fixed the faces of the party it was succeeded by a quick hysteric laugh and then a dead silence  before them lay a dressmakers dummy the wire and padded model on which dresses are fitted and shown with its armless and headless bust abruptly ending in a hooped wire skirt it completely filled the sides of the box  shut the door said the president promptly  the order was obeyed the single hysteric shriek of laughter had been followed by a deadly ironical silence the president with supernatural gravity lifted it out and set it up on its small round disklike pedestal  its some cussed fool blunder of that confounded express company burst out the unlucky purchaser but there was no echo to his outburst he looked around with a timid tentative smile but no other smile followed his  it looks said the president with portentous gravity like the beginnings of a fine woman that might show up if you gave her time into a firstclass goddess of course she aint all here other boxes with sections of her i reckon are under way from her factory and will meander along in the course of the year considerin this as a samplei think gentlemen he added with gloomy precision we are prepared to accept it and signify well take more  it aint perhaps exactly the idee that weve been led to expect from previous description said dick flint with deeper seriousness for instance this yer branch of thorns we heard of ez bein held behind her is wantin as is the arms that held it but even if they had arrived anybody could see the thorns through them wires and so give the hull show away  jam it into its box again and well send it back to the confounded express company with a cussin letter again thundered the wretched purchaser  no sonny said the president with gentle but gloomy determination well fasten on to this little show jest as it is and see what follows it aint every day that a firstclass sell like this is worked off on us accidentally  it was quite true the settlement had long since exhausted every possible form of practical joking and languished for a new sensation and here it was it was not a thing to be treated angrily nor lightly nor dismissed with that single hysteric laugh it was capable of the greatest possibilities indeed as washington trigg looked around on the imperturbably ironical faces of his companions he knew that they felt more true joy over the blunder than they would in the possession of the real statue but an exclamation from the fifth member who was examining the box arrested their attention  theres suthin else here  he had found under the heavier wrapping a layer of tissuepaper and under that a further envelope of linen lightly stitched together a knife blade quickly separated the stitches and the linen was carefully unfolded it displayed a beautifully trimmed evening dress of pale blue satin with a dressinggown of some exquisite white fabric armed with lace the men gazed at it in silence and then the one single expression broke from their lips  her duds  stop boys said clint grey as a movement was made to lift the dress towards the model leave that to a man who knows whats the use of my having left five grownup sisters in the states if i havent brought a little experience away with me this sort of thing aint to be pulled on like trousers no sirthis is the way shes worked  with considerable dexterity unexpected gentleness and some taste he shook out the folds of the skirt delicately and lifted it over the dummy settling it skillfully upon the wire hoops and drawing the bodice over the padded shoulders this he then proceeded to fasten with hooks and eyesa work of some patience forty eager fingers stretched out to assist him but were waved aside with a look of pained decorum as he gravely completed his task then falling back he bade the others do the same and they formed a contemplative semicircle before the figure  up to that moment a delighted but unsmiling consciousness of their own absurdities a keen sense of the humorous possibilities of the original blunder and a mischievous recognition of the mortification of triggwhose only safety now lay in accepting the mistake in the same spirithad determined these grownup schoolboys to artfully protract a joke that seemed to be providentially delivered into their hands but now an odd change crept on them the light from the open window that gave upon the enormous pines and the rolling prospect up to the dim heights of the sierras fell upon this strange incongruous yet perfectly artistic figure for the dress was the skillful creation of a great parisian artist and in its exquisite harmony of color shape and material it not only hid the absurd model but clothed it with an alarming grace and refinement a queer feeling of awe of shame and of unwilling admiration took possession of them some of themfrom remote western townshad never seen the like before those who had had forgotten it in those five years of selfexile of healthy independence and of contiguity to nature in her unaffected simplicity all had been familiar with the garish extravagant and dazzling femininity of the californian towns and cities but never had they known anything approaching the ideal grace of this type of exalted even if artificial womanhood and although in the fierce freedom of their little republic they had laughed to scorn such artificiality a few yards of satin and lace cunningly fashioned and thrown over a frame of wood and wire touched them now with a strange sense of its superiority the better to show its attractions clinton grey had placed the figure near a fulllength goldframed mirror beside a marbletopped table yet how cheap and tawdry these splendors showed beside this work of art how cruel was the contrast of their own rough working clothes to this miracle of adornment which that same mirror reflected and even when clinton grey the enthusiast looked towards his beloved woods for relief he could not help thinking of them as a more fitting frame for this strange goddess than this new house into which she had strayed their gravity became real their gibes in some strange way had vanished  must have cost a pile of money said one merely to break an embarrassing silence  my sister had a friend who brought over a dress from paris not as hightoned as that that cost five hundred dollars said clinton grey  how much did you say that spiritclad old rag of yours costthorns and all said the president turning sharply on trigg  trigg swallowed this depreciation of his own purchase meekly seven hundred and fifty dollars without the express charges  thats only twofifty more said the president thoughtfully if we call it quits  but said trigg in alarm we must send it back  not much sonny said the president promptly well hang on to this until we hear where that thorny old chump of yours has fetched up and is actin her conundrums and mebbe we can swap even  but how will we explain it to the boys queried trigg theyre waitin outside to see it  there wont be any explanation said the president in the same tone of voice in which he had ordered the door shut well just say that the statue hasnt come which is the frozen truth and this box only contained some silk curtain decorations wed ordered which is only half a lie and still more firmly this secret doesnt go out of this room gentlemenor i aint your president im not going to let you give yourselves away to that crowd outsideyou hear me have you ever allowed your unfettered intellect to consider what theyd say about thiswhat a godsend it would be to every man wed ever had a pull on in this camp why it would last em a whole year wed never hear the end of it no gentlemen i prefer to live here without shootin my fellow man but i cant promise it if they once start this joke agin us  there was a swift approval of this sentiment and the five members shook hands solemnly  now said the president well just fold up that dress again and put it with the figure in this closethe opened a large dressingchest in the suite of rooms in which they stoodand well each keep a key well retain this room for committee purposes so that no one need see the closet see now take off the dress be careful there youre not handlin pay dirt though its about as expensive steady  yet it was wonderful to see the solicitude and care with which the dress was recovered and folded in its linen wrapper  hold on exclaimed triggas the dummy was lifted into the chestwe havent tried on the other dress  yes yes repeated the others eagerly theres another  well keep that for next committee meeting gentlemen said the president decisively lock her up trigg   the three following months wrought a wonderful change in excelsiorwonderful even in that land of rapid growth and progress their organized and matured plans executed by a full force of workmen from the county town completed the twenty cottages for the members the bank and the town hall visitors and intending settlers flocked over the new wagon road to see this new utopia whose founders holding the land and its improvements as a corporate company exercised the right of dictating the terms on which settlers were admitted the feminine invasion was not yet potent enough to affect their consideration either through any refinement or attractiveness being composed chiefly of the industrious wives and daughters of small traders or temporary artisans yet it was found necessary to confide the hotel to the management of mr dexter marsh his wife and one intelligent but somewhat plain daughter who looked after the accounts there were occasional lady visitors at the hotel attracted from the neighboring towns and settlements by its picturesqueness and a vague suggestiveness of its being a wateringplaceand there was the occasional flash in the decorous street of a sacramento or san francisco gown it is needless to say that to the five men who held the guilty secret of committee room no 4 it only strengthened their belief in the superelegance of their hidden treasure at their last meeting they had fitted the second dresswhich turned out to be a vapory summer housefrock or morning wrapperover the dummy and opinions were divided as to its equality with the first however the same subtle harmony of detail and grace of proportion characterized it  and you see said clint grey its jest the sort o rig in which a man would be most likely to know herand not in her warpaint which would be only now and then  already she had become an individuality  hush said the president he had turned towards the door at which some one was knocking lightly  come in  the door opened upon miss marsh secretary and hotel assistant she had a business aspect and an open letter in her hand but hesitated at the evident confusion she had occasioned two of the gentlemen had absolutely blushed and the others regarded her with inane smiles or affected seriousness they all coughed slightly  i beg your pardon she said not ungracefully a slight color coming into her sallow cheek which in conjunction with the gold eyeglasses gave her at least in the eyes of the impressible clint a certain piquancy but my father said you were here in committee and i might consult you i can come again if you are busy  she had addressed the president partly from his office his comparatively extreme agehe must have been at least thirtyand possibly for his extremer good looks he said hurriedly its just an informal meeting and then more politely what can we do for you  we have an application for a suite of rooms next week she said referring to the letter and as we shall be rather full father thought you gentlemen might be willing to take another larger room for your meetings and give up these which are part of a suiteand perhaps not exactly suitable  quite impossible quite so really out of the question said the members in a rapid chorus  the young girl was evidently taken aback at this unanimity of opposition she stared at them curiously and then glanced around the room were quite comfortable here said the president explanatorily andin factits just what we want  we could give you a closet like that which you could lock up and a mirror she suggested with the faintest trace of a smile  tell your father miss marsh said the president with dignified politeness that while we cannot submit to any change we fully appreciate his business foresight and are quite prepared to see that the hotel is properly compensated for our retaining these rooms as the young girl withdrew with a puzzled curtsy he closed the door placed his back against it and said  what the deuce did she mean by speaking of that closet  reckon she allowed we kept some fancy drinks in there said trigg and calkilated that we wanted the marble stand and mirror to put our glasses on and make it look like a swell private bar thats all  humph said the president  their next meeting however was a hurried one and as the president arrived late when the door closed smartly behind him he was met by the worried faces of his colleagues  heres a go said trigg excitedly producing a folded paper the games up the hull show is busted that cussed old statuethe reglar old hag herselfis on her way here theres a bill o lading and the express companys letter and shell be trundled down here by express at any moment  well said the president quietly  well replied the members aghast do you know what that means  that we must rig her up in the hall on a pedestal as we reckoned to do returned the president coolly  but you dont sabe said clinton grey thats all very well as to the hag but now we must give her up with an adoring glance towards the closet  does the letter say so  no said trigg hesitatingly no but i reckon we cant keep both  why not said the president imperturbably if we paid for em  as the men only stared in reply he condescended to explain  look here i calculated all these risks after our last meeting while you boys were just fussin round doin nothing i wrote to the express company that a box of womens damaged duds had arrived here while we were looking for our statue that you chaps were so riled at bein sold by them that you dumped the whole blamed thing in the creek but i added if theyd let me know what the damage was id send em a draft to cover it after a spell of waitin they said theyd call it square for two hundred dollars considering our disappointment and i sent the draft thats spurred them up to get over our statue i reckon and now that its coming it will set us right with the boys  and she said clinton grey again pointing to the locked chest belongs to us  until we can find some lady guest that will take her with the rooms returned the president a little cynically  but the arrival of the real statue and its erection in the hotel vestibule created a new sensation the members of the excelsior company were loud in its praises except the executive committee whose coolness was looked upon by the others as an affectation of superiority it awakened the criticism and jealousy of the nearest town  we hear said the red dog advertiser that the longpromised statue has been put up in that hightoned hash dispensary they call a hotel at excelsior it represents an emaciated squaw in a scanty blanket gathering roots and carrying a bit of thornbush kindlings behind her the hightoned close corporation of excelsior may consider this a fair allegory of california we should say it looks mighty like a prophetic forecast of a hard winter on sycamore creek and scarcity of provisions however it isnt our funeral though its rather depressing to the casual visitor on his way to dinner for a long time this work of art was missing and supposed to be lost but by being sternly and persistently rejected at every express office on the route it was at last taken in at excelsior  there was some criticism nearer home  what do you think of it miss marsh said the president politely to that active young secretary as he stood before it in the hall the young woman adjusted her eyeglasses over her aquiline nose  as an idea or a woman sir  as a woman madam said the president letting his brown eyes slip for a moment from miss marshs corncolored crest over her straight but scant figure down to her smart slippers  well sir she could wear your boots and there isnt a corset in sacramento would go round her  thank you he returned gravely and moved away for a moment a wild idea of securing possession of the figure some dark night and in company with his fellowconspirators of trying those beautiful clothes upon her passed through his mind but he dismissed it and then occurred a strange incident which startled even his cool american sanity  it was a beautiful moonlight night and he was returning to a bedroom at the hotel which he temporarily occupied during the painting of his house it was quite late he having spent the evening with a san francisco friend after a business conference which assured him of the remarkable prosperity of excelsior it was therefore with some human exaltation that he looked around the sleeping settlement which had sprung up under the magic wand of their good fortune the full moon had idealized their youthful designs with something of their own youthful coloring graciously softening the garish freshness of paint and plaster hiding with discreet obscurity the disrupted banks and broken woods at the beginning and end of their broad avenues paving the rough river terrace with tessellated shadows and even touching the rapid stream which was the source of their wealth with a pactolean glitter  the windows of the hotel before him darkened within flashed in the moonbeams like the casements of aladdins palace mingled with his ambition tonight were some softer fancies rarely indulged by him in his forecast of the future of excelsiora dream of some fair partner in his life after this task was accomplished yet always of some one moving in a larger world than his youth had known rousing the half sleeping porter he found however only the spectral goldseeker in the vestibulethe rays of his solitary candle falling upon her diviningrod with a quaint persistency that seemed to point to the stairs he was ascending when he reached the first landing the rising wind through an open window put out his light but although the staircase was in darkness he could see the long corridor above illuminated by the moonlight throughout its whole length he had nearly reached it when the slow but unmistakable rustle of a dress in the distance caught his ear he paused not only in the interest of delicacy but with a sudden nervous thrill he could not account for the rustle came nearerhe could hear the distinct froufrou of satin and then to his bewildered eyes what seemed to be the figure of the dummy arrayed in the pale blue evening dress he knew so well passed gracefully and majestically down the corridor he could see the shapely folds of the skirt the symmetry of the bodice even the harmony of the trimmings he raised his eyes half affrightedly prepared to see the headless shoulders but theyand what seemed to be a headwere concealed in a floating cloud or nubia of some fleecy tissue as if for protection from the evening air he remained for an instant motionless dazed by this apparent motion of an inanimate figure but as the absurdity of the idea struck him he hurriedly but stealthily ascended the remaining stairs resolved to follow it but he was only in time to see it turn into the angle of another corridor which when he had reached it was empty the figure had vanished  his first thought was to go to the committee room and examine the locked closet but the key was in his desk at home he had no light and the room was on the other side of the house besides he reflected that even the detection of the figure would involve the exposure of the very secret they had kept intact so long he sought his bedroom and went quietly to bed but not to sleep a curiosity more potent than any sense of the trespass done him kept him tossing half the night who was this woman whom the clothes fitted so well he reviewed in his mind the guests in the house but he knew none who could have carried off this masquerade so bravely  in the morning early he made his way to the committee room but as he approached was startled to observe two pairs of boots a mans and a womans conjugally placed before its door now thoroughly indignant he hurried to the office and was confronted by the face of the fair secretary she colored quickly on seeing himbut the reason was obvious  you are coming to scold me sir but it is not my fault we were full yesterday afternoon when your friend from san francisco came here with his wife we told him those were your rooms but he said he would make it right with youand my father thought you would not be displeased for once everything of yours was put into another room and the closet remains locked as you left it  amazed and bewildered the president could only mutter a vague apology and turn away had his friends wife opened the door with another key in some fit of curiosity and disported herself in those clothes if so she dare not speak of her discovery  an introduction to the lady at breakfast dispelled this faint hope she was a plump woman whose generous proportions could hardly have been confined in that pale blue bodice she was frank and communicative with no suggestion of mischievous concealment  nevertheless he made a firm resolution as soon as his friends left he called a meeting of the committee he briefly informed them of the accidental occupation of the room but for certain reasons of his own said nothing of his ghostly experience but he put it to them plainly that no more risks must be run and that he should remove the dresses and dummy to his own house to his considerable surprise this suggestion was received with grave approval and a certain strange relief  we kinder thought of suggesting it to you before said mr trigg slowly and that mebbe weve played this little game long enoughfor suthins happened thats makin it anything but funny wed have told you before but we dassent speak out clint and tell the president what we saw the other night and dont mince matters  the president glanced quickly and warningly around him i thought he said sternly that wed dropped all fooling its no time for practical joking now  honest injunits gospel truth speak up clint  the president looked on the serious faces around him and was himself slightly awed  its a matter of two or three nights ago said grey slowly that trigg and i were passing through sycamore woods just below the hotel it was after twelvebright moonlight so that we could see everything as plain as day and we were dead sober just as we passed under the sycamores trigg grabs my arm and says hi i looked up and there not ten yards away standing dead in the moonlight was that dummy she was all in whitethat dress with the fairy frills you knowand had whats more a head at least something white all wrapped around it and over her shoulders at first we thought you or some of the boys had dressed her up and lifted her out there for a joke and left her to frighten us so we started forward and thenits the gospel truthshe moved away gliding like the moonbeams and vanished among the trees  did you see her face asked the president  no you bet i didnt try toit would have haunted me forever  what do you mean  thisi mean it was that girl the box belonged to shes dead somewhereas youll find out sooner or laterand has come back for her clothes ive often heard of such things before  despite his coolness at this corroboration of his own experience and impressed by greys unmistakable awe a thrill went through the president for an instant he was silent  that will do boys he said finally its a queer story but remember its all the more reason now for our keeping our secret as for those things ill remove them quietly and at once  but he did not  on the contrary prolonging his stay at the hotel with plausible reasons he managed to frequently visit the committee room or its vicinity at different and unsuspected hours of the day and night more than that he found opportunities to visit the office and under pretexts of business connected with the economy of the hotel management informed himself through miss marsh on many points a few of these details naturally happened to refer to herself her prospects her tastes and education he learned incidentally what he had partly known that her father had been in better circumstances and that she had been gently nurturedthough of this she made little account in her pride in her own independence and devotion to her duties but in his own persistent way he also made private notes of the breadth of her shoulders the size of her waist her height length of her skirt her movements in walking and other apparently extraneous circumstances it was natural that he acquired some supplemental factsthat her eyes under her eyeglasses were a tender gray and touched with the melancholy beauty of nearsightedness that her face had a sensitive mobility beyond the mere charm of color and like most people lacking this primitive and striking element of beauty what was really fine about her escaped the first sight as for instance it was only by bending over to examine her accounts that he found that her indistinctive hair was as delicate as floss silk and as electrical it was only by finding her romping with the children of a guest one evening that he was startled by the appalling fact of her youth but about this time he left the hotel and returned to his house  on the first yearly anniversary of the great strike at excelsior there were some changes in the settlement notably the promotion of mr marsh to a more important position in the company and the installation of miss cassie marsh as manageress of the hotel as miss marsh read the official letter signed by the president conveying in complimentary but formal terms this testimony of their approval and confidence her lip trembled slightly and a tear trickling from her light lashes dimmed her eyeglasses so that she was fain to go up to her room to recover herself alone when she did so she was startled to find a wire dummy standing near the door and neatly folded upon the bed two elegant dresses a note in the presidents own hand lay beside them a swift blush stung her cheek as she read   dear miss marshwill you make me happy by keeping the secret that no other woman but yourself knows and by accepting the clothes that no other woman but yourself can wear   the next moment with the dresses over her arm and the ridiculous dummy swinging by its wires from her other hand she was flying down the staircase to committee room no 4 the door opened upon its sole occupant the president  oh sir how cruel of you she gasped it was only a joke of mine    i always intended to tell you    it was very foolish but it seemed so funny    you see i thought it was    the dress you had bought for your future intendedsome young lady you were going to marry  it is said the president quietly and he closed the door behind her  and it was
