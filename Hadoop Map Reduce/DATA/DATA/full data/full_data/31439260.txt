part i  letters of marque     letters of marque   i  of the beginning of things of the taj and the globetrotter the young man from manchester and certain moral reflections  novdec 1887   except for those who under compulsion of a sick certificate are flying bombaywards it is good for every man to see some little of the great indian empire and the strange folk who move about it it is good to escape for a time from the house of rimmonbe it office or cutcheryand to go abroad under no more exacting master than personal inclination and with no more definite plan of travel than has the horse escaped from pasture free upon the countryside the first result of such freedom is extreme bewilderment and the second reduces the freed to a state of mind which for his sins must be the normal portion of the globetrotterthe man who does kingdoms in days and writes books upon them in weeks and this desperate facility is not as strange as it seems by the time that an englishman has come by sea and rail via america japan singapur and ceylon to india he canthese eyes have seen him do somaster in five minutes the intricacies of the indian bradshaw and tell an old resident exactly how and where the trains run can we wonder that the intoxication of success in hasty assimilation should make him overbold and that he should try to graspbut a full account of the insolent globetrotter must be reserved he is worthy of a book given absolute freedom for a month the mind as i have said fails to take in the situation and after much debate contents itself with following in old and wellbeaten wayspaths that we in india have no time to tread but must leave to the country cousin who wears his pagri tailfashion down his back and says cabman to the driver of the ticcaghari  now jeypore from the angloindian point of view is a station on the rajputanamalwa line on the way to bombay where half an hour is allowed for dinner and where there ought to be more protection from the sun than at present exists some few more learned than the rest know that garnets come from jeypore and here the limits of our wisdom are set we do not to quote the calcutta shopkeeper come out for the good of our ealth and what touring we accomplish is for the most part off the line of rail  for these reasons and because he wished to study our winter birds of passage one of the few thousand englishmen in india on a date and in a place which have no concern with the story sacrificed all his selfrespect and becameat enormous personal inconveniencea globetrotter going to jeypore and leaving behind him for a little while all that old and wellknown life in which commissioners and deputycommissioners governors and lieutenantgovernors aidesdecamp colonels and their wives majors captains and subalterns after their kind move and rule and govern and squabble and fight and sell each others horses and tell wicked stories of their neighbours but before he had fully settled into his part or accustomed himself to saying please take out this luggage to the coolies at the stations he saw from the train the taj wrapped in the mists of the morning  there is a story of a frenchman who feared not god nor regarded man sailing to egypt for the express purpose of scoffing at the pyramids andthough this is hard to believeat the great napoleon who had warred under their shadow it is on record that that blasphemous gaul came to the great pyramid and wept through mingled reverence and contrition for he sprang from an emotional race to understand his feelings it is necessary to have read a great deal too much about the taj its design and proportions to have seen execrable pictures of it at the simla fine arts exhibition to have had its praises sung by superior and travelled friends till the brain loathed the repetition of the word and then sulky with want of sleep heavyeyed unwashed and chilled to come upon it suddenly under these circumstances everything you will concede is in favour of a cold critical and not too impartial verdict as the englishman leaned out of the carriage he saw first an opaltinted cloud on the horizon and later certain towers the mists lay on the ground so that the splendour seemed to be floating free of the earth and the mists rose in the background so that at no time could everything be seen clearly then as the train sped forward and the mists shifted and the sun shone upon the mists the taj took a hundred new shapes each perfect and each beyond description it was the ivory gate through which all good dreams come it was the realization of the gleaming halls of dawn that tennyson sings of it was veritably the aspiration fixed the sigh made stone of a lesser poet and over and above concrete comparisons it seemed the embodiment of all things pure all things holy and all things unhappy that was the mystery of the building it may be that the mists wrought the witchery and that the taj seen in the dry sunlight is only as guidebooks say a noble structure the englishman could not tell and has made a vow that he will never go nearer the spot for fear of breaking the charm of the unearthly pavilions  it may be too that each must view the taj for himself with his own eyes working out his own interpretation of the sight it is certain that no man can in cold blood and colder ink set down his impressions if he has been in the least moved  to the one who watched and wondered that november morning the thing seemed full of sorrowthe sorrow of the man who built it for the woman he loved and the sorrow of the workmen who died in the buildingused up like cattle and in the face of this sorrow the taj flushed in the sunlight and was beautiful after the beauty of a woman who has done no wrong  here the train ran in under the walls of agra fort and another trainof thought incoherent as that written abovecame to an end let those who scoff at overmuch enthusiasm look at the taj and thenceforward be dumb it is well on the threshold of a journey to be taught reverence and awe  but there is no reverence in the globetrotter he is brazen a young man from manchester was travelling to bombay in orderhow the words hurtto be home by christmas he had come through america new zealand and australia and finding that he had ten days to spare at bombay conceived the modest idea of doing india i dont say that ive done it all but you may say that ive seen a good deal then he explained that he had been much pleased at agra much pleased at delhi and last profanation very much pleased at the taj indeed he seemed to be going through life just then much pleased at everything with rare and sparkling originality he remarked that india was a big place and that there were many things to buy verily this young man must have been a delight to the delhi boxwallahs he had purchased shawls and embroidery to the tune of a certain number of rupees duly set forth and he had purchased jewellery to another tune these were gifts for friends at home and he considered them very eastern if silver filigree work modelled on palais royal patterns or aniline blue scarves be eastern he had succeeded in his hearts desire for some inscrutable end it had been decreed that man shall take a delight in making his fellowman miserable the englishman began to point out gravely the probable extent to which the young man from manchester had been swindled and the young man said by jove you dont say so i hate being done if theres anything i hate its being done  he had been so happy in the thought of getting home by christmas and so charmingly communicative as to the members of his family for whom such and such gifts were intended that the englishman cut short the record of fraud and soothed him by saying that he had not been so very badly done after all this consideration was misplaced for his peace of mind restored the young man from manchester looked out of the window and waving his hand over the empire generally said i say look here all those wells are wrong you know the wells were on the wheel and inclined plane system but he objected to the incline and said that it would be much better for the bullocks if they walked on level ground then light dawned upon him and he said i suppose its to exercise all their muscles y know a canal horse is no use after he has been on the towpath for some time he cant walk anywhere but on the flat y know and i suppose its just the same with bullocks the spurs of the aravalis under which the train was running had evidently suggested this brilliant idea which passed uncontradicted for the englishman was looking out of the window  if one were bold enough to generalise after the manner of globetrotters it would be easy to build up a theory on the well incident to account for the apparent insanity of some of our cold weather visitors even the young man from manchester could evolve a complete idea for the training of wellbullocks in the east at thirty seconds notice how much the more could a cultivated observer from let us say an english constituency blunder and pervert and mangle we in this country have no time to work out the notion which is worthy of the consideration of some leisurely teuton intellect  envy may have prompted a too bitter judgment of the young man from manchester for as the train bore him from jeypore to ahmedabad happy in his getting home by christmas pleased as a child with his delhi atrocities pinkcheeked whiskered and superbly selfconfident the englishman whose home for the time was a dark bungaloathsome hotel watched his departure regretfully for he knew exactly to what sort of genial cheery british household rich in untravelled kin that young man was speeding it is pleasant to play at globetrotting but to enter fully into the spirit of the piece one must also be going home for christmas     ii  shows the charm of rajputana and of jeypore the city of the globetrotter of its founder and its embellishment explains the use and destiny of the studbred and fails to explain many more important matters   if any part of a land strewn with dead mens bones have a special claim to distinction rajputana as the cockpit of india stands first east of suez men do not build towers on the tops of hills for the sake of the view nor do they stripe the mountain sides with bastioned stone walls to keep in cattle since the beginning of time if we are to credit the legends there was fightingheroic fightingat the foot of the aravalis and beyond in the great deserts of sand penned by those kindly mountains from spreading over the heart of india the thirtysix royal races fought as royal races know how to do chohan with rahtor brother against brother son against father laterbut excerpts from the tangled tale of force fraud cunning desperate love and more desperate revenge crime worthy of demons and virtues fit for gods may be found by all who care to look in the book of the man who loved the rajputs and gave a lifes labours in their behalf from delhi to abu and from the indus to the chambul each yard of ground has witnessed slaughter pillage and rapine but today the capital of the state that dhola rae son of soora singh hacked out more than nine hundred years ago with the sword from some weaker rulers realm is lighted with gas and possesses many striking and english peculiarities  dhola rae was killed in due time and for nine hundred years jeypore torn by the intrigues of unruly princes and princelings fought asiatically  when and how jeypore became a feudatory of british power and in what manner we put a slur upon rajput honourpunctilious as the honour of the pathanare matters of which the globetrotter knows more than we do he reads upto quote his own wordsa city before he comes to us and straightway going to another city forgets or worse still mixes what he has learntso that in the end he writes down the rajput a mahratta says that lahore is in the northwest provinces and was once the capital of sivaji and piteously demands a guidebook on all india a thing that you can carry in your trunk y knowthat gives you plain descriptions of things without mixing you up here is a chance for a writer of discrimination and void of conscience  but to return to jeyporea pink city set on the border of a blue lake and surrounded by the low red spurs of the aravalisa city to see and to puzzle over there was once a ruler of the state called jey singh who lived in the days of aurungzeb and did him service with foot and horse he must have been the solomon of rajputana for through the fortyfour years of his reign his wisdom remained with him he led armies and when fighting was over turned to literature he intrigued desperately and successfully but found time to gain a deep insight into astronomy and by what remains above ground now we can tell that whatsoever his eyes desired he kept not from him knowing his own worth he deserted the city of amber founded by dhola rae among the hills and six miles further in the open plain bade one vedyadhar his architect build a new city as seldom indian city was built beforewith huge streets straight as an arrow sixty yards broad and crossstreets broad and straight many years afterward the good people of america builded their towns after this pattern but knowing nothing of jey singh they took all the credit to themselves  he built himself everything that pleased him palaces and gardens and temples and then died and was buried under a white marble tomb on a hill overlooking the city he was a traitor if history speak truth to his own kin and he was an accomplished murderer but he did his best to check infanticide he reformed the mahometan calendar he piled up a superb library and he made jeypore a marvel  later on came a successor educated and enlightened by all the lamps of british progress and converted the city of jey singh into a surprisea big bewildering practical joke he laid down sumptuous trottoirs of hewn stone and central carriage drives also of hewn stone in the main street he that is to say colonel jacob the superintending engineer of the state devised a water supply for the city and studded the ways with standpipes he built gas works set afoot a school of art a museumall the things in fact which are necessary to western municipal welfare and comfort and saw that they were the best of their kind how much colonel jacob has done not only for the good of jeypore city but for the good of the state at large will never be known because the officer in question is one of the not small class who resolutely refuse to talk about their own work the result of the good work is that the old and the new the rampantly raw and the sullenly old stand cheekbyjowl in startling contrast thus the sacred bull of shira trips over the rails of a steel tramway which brings out the city rubbish the lacquered and painted cart behind the two little staglike trotting bullocks catches its primitive wheels in the castiron gaslamp post with the brass nozzle atop and all rajputana gayly clad smallturbaned swaggering rajputana circulates along the magnificent pavements  the fortresscrowned hills look down upon the strange medley one of them bears on its flank in huge white letters the cheery inscription welcome this was made when the prince of wales visited jeypore to shoot his first tiger but the average traveller of today may appropriate the message to himself for jeypore takes great care of strangers and shows them all courtesy this by the way demoralises the globetrotter whose first cry is where can we get horses where can we get elephants who is the man to write to for all these things  thanks to the courtesy of the maharaja it is possible to see everything but for the incurious who object to being driven through their sights a journey down any one of the great main streets is a days delightful occupation the view is as unobstructed as that of the champs Élysées but in place of the whitestone fronts of paris rises a long line of openwork screenwall the prevailing tone of which is pink caramelpink but houseowners have unlimited license to decorate their tenements as they please jeypore broadly considered is hindu and her architecture of the riotous manyarched type which even the globetrotter after a short time learns to call hindu it is neither temperate nor noble but it satisfies the general desire for something that really looks indian  a perverse taste for low company drew the englishman from the pavementto walk upon a real stone pavement is in itself a privilegeup a sidestreet where he assisted at a quail fight and found the lowcaste rajput a cheery and affable soul the owner of the losing quail was a trooper in the maharajas army he explained that his pay was six rupees a month paid bimonthly he had to pay the cost of his khaki blouse brownleather accoutrements and jackboots lance saddle sword and horse were given free he refused to tell for how many months in the year he was drilled and said vaguely that his duties were mainly escort ones and he had no fault to find with them the defeat of his quail had vexed him and he desired the sahib to understand that the sowars of his highnesss army could ride a clumsy attempt at a compliment so fired his martial blood that he climbed into his saddle and then and there insisted on showing off his horsemanship the road was narrow the lance was long and the horse was a big one but no one objected and the englishman sat him down on a doorstep and watched the fun the horse seemed in some shadowy way familiar his head was not the lean head of the kathiawar nor his crest the crest of the marwarri and his forelegs did not belong to these stony districts where did he come from the sowar pointed northward and said from amritsar but he pronounced it armtzar many horses had been bought at the spring fairs in the punjab they cost about two hundred rupees eachperhaps more the sowar could not say some came from hissar and some from other places beyond delhi they were very good horses that horse there he pointed to one a little distance down the street is the son of a big government horsethe kind that the sirkar make for breeding horsesso high the owner of that horse swaggered up jaw bandaged and catmoustached and bade the englishman look at his mount bought of course when a colt both men together said that the sahib had better examine the maharaja sahibs stable where there were hundreds of horses huge as elephants or tiny as sheep  to the stables the englishman accordingly went knowing beforehand what he would find and wondering whether the sirkars big horses were meant to get mounts for rajput sowars the maharajas stables are royal in size and appointments the enclosure round which they stand must be about half a mile longit allows ample space for exercising besides paddocks for the colts the horses about two hundred and fifty are bedded in pure white sandbad for the coat if they roll but good for the feetthe pickets are of white marble the heelropes in every case of good sound rope and in every case the stables are exquisitely clean each stall contains above the manger a curious little bunk for the syce who if he uses the accommodation must assuredly die once each hot weather  a journey round the stables is saddening for the attendants are very anxious to strip their charges and the stripping shows so much a few men in india are credited with the faculty of never forgetting a horse they have once seen and of knowing the produce of every stallion they have met the englishman would have given something for their company at that hour his knowledge of horseflesh was very limited but he felt certain that more than one or two of the sleek perfectly groomed countrybreds should have been justifying their existence in the ranks of the british cavalry instead of eating their heads off on six seers1 of gram and one of sugar per diem but they had all been honestly bought and honestly paid for and there was nothing in the wide world to prevent his highness if he wished to do so from sweeping up the pick and pride of all the studbred horses in the punjab the attendants appeared to take a wicked delight in saying eshtudbred2 very loudly and with unnecessary emphasis as they threw back the loincloth sometimes they were wrong but in too many cases they were right  1 a seer is about two pounds  2 studbred ie bred at the indian government studs  the englishman left the stables and the great central maidan where a nervous biluchi was being taught by a perfect network of ropes to monkeyjump and went out into the streets reflecting on the working of horsebreeding operations under the government of india and the advantages of having unlimited money wherewith to profit by other peoples mistakes  then as happened to the great tartarin of tarescon wild beasts began to roar and a crowd of little boys laughed the lions of jeypore are tigers caged in a public place for the sport of the people who hiss at them and disturb their royal feelings two or three of the six great brutes are magnificent all of them are shorttempered and the bars of their captivity not too strong a pariahdog was furtively trying to scratch out a fragment of meat from between the bars of one of the cages and the occupant tolerated him growing bolder the starveling growled the tiger struck at him with his paw and the dog fled howling with fear when he returned he brought two friends with him and the three mocked the captive from a distance  it was not a pleasant sight and suggested globetrottersgentlemen who imagine that more curricles should come at their bidding and on being undeceived become abusive     iii  does not in any sort describe the dead city of amber but gives detailed information about a cottonpress   and what shall be said of amber queen of the passthe city that jey singh bade his people slough as snakes cast their skins the globetrotter will assure you that it must be done before anything else and the globetrotter is for once perfectly correct amber lies between six and seven miles from jeypore among the tumbled fragments of the hills and is reachable by so prosaic a conveyance as a ticcaghari and so uncomfortable a one as an elephant he is provided by the maharaja and the people who make india their prey are apt to accept his services as a matter of course  rise very early in the morning before the stars have gone out and drive through the sleeping city till the pavement gives place to cactus and sand and educational and enlightened institutions to mile upon mile of semidecayed hindu templesbrown and weatherbeatenrunning down to the shores of the great man sagar lake wherein are more ruined temples palaces and fragments of causeways the waterbirds have their home in the halfsubmerged arcades and the crocodile nuzzles the shafts of the pillars it is a fitting prelude to the desolation of amber beyond the man sagar the road of today climbs uphill and by its side runs the huge stone causeway of yesterdayblocks sunk in concrete down this path the swords of amber went out to kill a triple wall rings the city and at the third gate the road drops into the valley of amber in the half light of dawn a great city sunk between hills and built round three sides of a lake is dimly visible and one waits to catch the hum that should arise from it as the day breaks the air in the valley is bitterly chill with the growing light amber stands revealed and the traveller sees that it is a city that will never wake a few beggars live in huts at the end of the valley but the temples the shrines the palaces and the tiersontiers of houses are desolate trees grow upon and split the walls the windows are filled with brushwood and the cactus chokes the street the englishman made his way up the side of the hill to the great palace that overlooks everything except the red fort of jeighur guardian of amber as the elephant swung up the steep roads paved with stone and built out on the sides of the hill he looked into empty houses where the little grey squirrel sat and scratched its ears the peacock walked on the housetops and the blue pigeon roosted within he passed under ironstudded gates whose hinges were eaten out with rust and by walls plumed and crowned with grass and under more gateways till at last he reached the palace and came suddenly into a great quadrangle where two blinded arrogant stallions covered with red and gold trappings screamed and neighed at each other from opposite ends of the vast space for a little time these were the only visible living beings and they were in perfect accord with the spirit of the spot afterwards certain workmen appeared for it seems that the maharaja keeps the old palace of his forefathers in good repair but they were modern and mercenary and with great difficulty were detached from the skirts of the traveller a somewhat extensive experience of palaceseeing had taught him that it is best to see palaces alone for the oriental as a guide is undiscriminating and sets too great a store on corrugated iron roofs and glazed drainpipes  so the englishman went into this palace built of stone bedded on stone springing out of scarped rock and reached by stone waysnothing but stone presently he stumbled across a little temple of kali a gem of marble tracery and inlay very dark and at that hour of the morning very cold  if as violletleduc tells us to believe a building reflects the character of its inhabitants it must be impossible for one reared in an eastern palace to think straightly or speak freely orbut here the annals of rajputana contradict the theoryto act openly the cramped and darkened rooms the narrow smoothwalled passages with recesses where a man might wait for his enemy unseen the maze of ascending and descending stairs leading nowhither the everpresent screens of marble tracery that may hide or reveal so muchall these things breathe of plot and counterplot league and intrigue in a living palace where the sightseer knows and feels that there are human beings everywhere and that he is followed by scores of unseen eyes the impression is almost unendurable in a dead palacea cemetery of loves and hatreds done with hundreds of years ago and of plottings that had for their end though the greybeards who plotted knew it not the coming of the british tourist with guidebook and sunhatoppression gives place to simply impertinent curiosity the englishman wandered into all parts of the palace for there was no one to stop himnot even the ghosts of the dead queensthrough ivorystudded doors into the womens quarters where a stream of water once flowed over a chiselled marble channel a creeper had set its hands upon the lattice there and there was dust of old nests in one of the niches in the wall did the lady of light virtue who managed to become possessed of so great a portion of jey singhs library ever set her dainty feet in the trim garden of the hall of pleasure beyond the screenwork was it in the fortypillared hall of audience that the order went forth that the chief of birjooghar was to be slain and from what wall did the king look out when the horsemen clattered up the steep stone path to the palace bearing on their saddlebows the heads of the bravest of rajore there were questions innumerable to be asked in each court and keep and cell but the only answer was the cooing of the pigeons  if a man desired beauty there was enough and to spare in the palace and of strength more than enough with inlay and carved marble with glass and colour the kings who took their pleasure in that now desolate pile made all that their eyes rested upon royal and superb but any description of the artistic side of the palace if it were not impossible would be wearisome the wise man will visit it when time and occasion serve and will then in some small measure understand what must have been the riotous sumptuous murderous life to which our governors and lieutenantgovernors commissioners and deputy commissioners colonels and captains and the subalterns have put an end  from the top of the palace you may read if you please the book of ezekiel written in stone upon the hillside coming up the englishman had seen the city from below or on a level he now looked into its very heartthe heart that had ceased to beat there was no sound of men or cattle or grindstones in those pitiful streetsnothing but the cooing of the pigeons at first it seemed that the palace was not ruined at allthat soon the women would come up on the housetops and the bells would ring in the temples but as he attempted to follow with his eye the turns of the streets the englishman saw that they died out in wood tangle and blocks of fallen stone that some of the houses were rent with great cracks and pierced from roof to road with holes that let in the morning sun the dripstones of the eaves were gaptoothed and the tracery of the screens had fallen out so that zenanarooms lay shamelessly open to the day on the outskirts of the city the strongwalled houses dwindled and sank down to mere stoneheaps and faint indications of plinth and wall hard to trace against the background of stony soil the shadow of the palace lay over twothirds of the city and the trees deepened the shadow he who has bent him oer the dead after the hour of which byron sings knows that the features of the man become blunted as it werethe face begins to fade the same hideous look lies on the face of the queen of the pass and when once this is realised the eye wonders that it could have ever believed in the life of her she is the city whose graves are set in the side of the pit and her company is round about her graves sister of pathros zoan and no  moved by a thoroughly insular instinct the englishman took up a piece of plaster and heaved it from the palace wall into the dark streets it bounded from a housetop to a windowledge and thence into a little square and the sound of its fall was hollow and echoing as the sound of a stone in a well then the silence closed up upon the sound till in the faraway courtyard below the roped stallions began screaming afresh there may be desolation in the great indian desert to the westward and there is desolation on the open seas but the desolation of amber is beyond the loneliness either of land or sea men by the hundred thousand must have toiled at the walls that bound it the temples and bastions that stud the walls the fort that overlooks all the canals that once lifted water to the palace and the garden in the lake of the valley renan could describe it as it stands today and verestchaguin could paint it  arrived at this satisfactory conclusion the englishman went down through the palace and the scores of venomous and suggestive little rooms to the elephant in the courtyard and was taken back in due time to the nineteenth century in the shape of his highness the maharajas cottonpress returning a profit of twentyseven per cent and fitted with two engines of fifty horsepower each an hydraulic press capable of exerting a pressure of three tons per square inch and everything else to correspond it stood under a neat corrugated iron roof close to the jeypore railway station and was in most perfect order but somehow it did not taste well after amber there was aggressiveness about the engines and the smell of the raw cotton  the modern side of jeypore must not be mixed with the ancient     iv  the temple of mahadeo and the manners of such as see india the man by the watertroughs and his knowledge the voice of the city and what it said personalities and the hospital the house beautiful of jeypore and its builders   from the cottonpress the englishman wandered through the wide streets till he came into an hindu templerich in marble stone and inlay and a deep and tranquil silence close to the public library of the state the brazen bull was hung with flowers and men were burning the evening incense before mahadeo while those who had prayed their prayer beat upon the bells hanging from the roof and passed out secure in the knowledge that the god had heard them if there be much religion there is little reverence as westerns understand the term at the services of the gods of the east a tiny little maiden child of a monstrously ugly walleyed priest staggered across the marble pavement to the shrine and threw with a gust of childish laughter the blossoms she was carrying into the lap of the great mahadeo himself then she made as though she would leap up to the bell and ran away still laughing into the shadow of the cells behind the shrine while her father explained that she was but a baby and that mahadeo would take no notice the temple he said was specially favoured by the maharaja and drew from lands an income of twenty thousand rupees a year thakoors and great men also gave gifts out of their benevolence and there was nothing in the wide world to prevent an englishman from following their example  by this timefor amber and the cottonpress had filled the hoursnight was falling and the priests unhooked the swinging jets and began to light up the impassive face of mahadeo with gas they used swedish matches  full night brought the hotel and its curiously composed human menagerie  there is if a workaday world will believe a society entirely outside and unconnected with that of the stationa planet within a planet where nobody knows anything about the collectors wife the colonels dinnerparty or what was really the matter with the engineer it is a curious an insatiably curious thing and its literature is newmans bradshaw wandering old armssellers and others live upon it and so do the garnetmen and the makers of ancient rajput shields the world of the innocents abroad is a touching and unsophisticated place and its very atmosphere urges the angloindian unconsciously to an extravagant mendacity can you wonder then that a guide of longstanding should in time grow to be an accomplished liar  into this world sometimes breaks the angloindian returned from leave or a fugitive to the sea and his presence is like that of a wellknown landmark in the desert the old armsseller knows and avoids him and he is detested by the jobber of gharis who calls every one my lord in english and panders to the glaring race anomaly by saying that every carriage not under his control is rotten my lord having been used by natives one of the privileges of playing at tourist is the brevetrank of lord  there are many and some very curious methods of seeing india one of these is buying english translations of the more zolaistic of zolas novels and reading them from breakfast to dinnertime in the verandah yet another even simpler is american in its conception take a newmans bradshaw and a blue pencil and race up and down the length of the empire ticking off the names of the stations done to do this thoroughly keep strictly to the railway buildings and form your conclusions through the carriagewindows these eyes have seen both ways of working in full blast and on the whole the first is the most commendable  let us consider now with due reverence the modern side of jeypore it is difficult to write of a nickelplated civilisation set down under the immemorial aravalis in the first state of rajputana the redgrey hills seem to laugh at it and the evershifting sanddunes under the hills take no account of it for they advance upon the bases of the monogrammed coronetcrowned lampposts and fill up the points of the natty tramways near the waterworks which are the outposts of the civilisation of jeypore  escape from the city by the railway station till you meet the cactus and the mudbank and the maharajas cottonpress pass between a tramway and a trough for wayfaring camels till your foot sinks ankledeep in soft sand and you come upon what seems to be the fringe of illimitable desertmound upon mound of tussocks overgrown with plumed grass where the parrots sit and swing here if you have kept to the road you shall find a dam faced with stone a great tank and pumping machinery fine as the heart of a municipal engineer can desirepure water sound pipes and wellkept engines if you belong to what is sarcastically styled an able and intelligent municipality under the british rule go down to the level of the tank scoop up the water in your hands and drink thinking meanwhile of the defects of the town whence you came the experience will be a profitable one there are statistics in connection with the waterworks figures relating to threethrowplungers delivery and supply which should be known to the professional reader they would not interest the unprofessional who would learn his lesson among the thronged standpipes of the city  while the englishman was preparing in his mind a scathing rebuke for an erring municipality that he knew of a camel swung across the sands its drivers jaw and brow bound mummyfashion to guard against the dust the man was evidently a stranger to the place for he pulled up and asked the englishman where the drinkingtroughs were he was a gentleman and bore very patiently with the englishmans absurd ignorance of his dialect he had come from some village with an unpronounceable name thirty kos away to see his brothers son who was sick in the big hospital while the camel was drinking the man talked lying back along his mount he knew nothing of jeypore except the names of certain englishmen in it the men who he said had made the waterworks and built the hospital for his brothers sons comfort  and this is the curious feature of jeypore though happily the city is not unique in its peculiarity when the late maharaja ascended the throne more than fifty years ago it was his royal will and pleasure that jeypore should advance whether he was prompted by love for his subjects desire for praise or the magnificent vanity with which jey singh must have been so largely dowered are questions that concern nobody in the latter years of his reign he was supplied with englishmen who made the state their fatherland and identified themselves with its progress as only englishmen can behind them stood the maharaja ready to spend money with a lavishness that no supreme government would dream of and it would not be too much to say that they together made the state what it is when ram singh died madho singh his successor a conservative hindu forbore to interfere in any way with the work that was going forward it is said in the city that he does not overburden himself with the cares of state the driving power being mainly in the hands of a bengali who has everything but the name of minister nor do the englishmen it is said in the city mix themselves with the business of government their business being wholly executive  they can according to the voice of the city do what they please and the voice of the citynot in the main roads but in the little sidealleys where the stallless bull blocks the pathattests how well their pleasure has suited the pleasure of the people in truth to men of action few things could be more delightful than having a state of fifteen thousand square miles placed at their disposal as it were to leave their mark on unfortunately for the vagrant traveller those who work hard for practical ends prefer not to talk about their doings and he must therefore pick up what information he can at secondhand or in the city the men at the standpipes explain that the maharaja sahibs father gave the order for the waterworks and that yakub jacob sahib made themnot only in the city but out away in the district did the people grow more crops thereby of course they did were canals made only to wash in how much more crops who knows the sahib had better go and ask some official increased irrigation means increase of revenue for the state somewhere but the man who brought about the increase does not say so  after a few days of amateur globetrotting a shamelessness great as that of the other loaferthe rednosed man who hangs about one garden and is always on the eve of starting for calcuttapossesses the masquerader so that he feels equal to asking a resident for a parcelgilt howdah or dropping into dinner with a lieutenantgovernor no man has a right to keep anything back from a globetrotter who is a mild temperate gentlemanly and unobtrusive seeker after truth therefore he who without a word of enlightenment sends the visitor into a city which he himself has beautified and adorned and made clean and wholesome deserves unsparing exposure and the city may be trusted to betray him the malli in the ram newas gardensgardens which are finer than any in india and fit to rank with the best in parissays that the maharaja gave the order and yakub sahib made the gardens he also says that the hospital just outside the gardens was built by yakub sahib and if the sahib will go to the centre of the gardens he will find another big building a museum by the same hand  but the englishman went first to the hospital and found the outpatients beginning to arrive a hospital cannot tell lies about its own progress as a municipality can sick folk either come or lie in their own villages in the case of the mayo hospital they came and the operation book showed that they had been in the habit of coming doctors at issue with provincial and local administrations civil surgeons who cannot get their indents complied with grounddown and mutinous practitioners all india over would do well to visit the mayo hospital jeypore they might in the exceeding bitterness of their envy be able to point out some defects in its supplies or its beds or its splints or in the absolute isolation of the womens quarters from the mens  from the hospital the englishman went to the museum in the centre of the gardens and was eaten up by it for museums appealed to him the casing of the jewel was in the first place superba wonder of carven white stone of the indosaracenic style it stood on a stone plinth and was rich in stonetracery green marble columns from ajmir red marble white marble colonnades courts with fountains richly carved wooden doors frescoes inlay and colour the ornamentation of the tombs of delhi the palaces of agra and the walls of amber have been laid under contribution to supply the designs in bracket arch and soffit and stonemasons from the jeypore school of art have woven into the work the best that their hands could produce the building in essence if not in the fact of today is the work of freemasons the men were allowed a certain scope in their choice of detail and the resultbut it should be seen to be understood as it stands in those imperial gardens and observe the man who had designed it who had superintended its erection had said no word to indicate that there were such a thing in the place or that every foot of it from the domes of the roof to the cool green chunam dadoes and the carving of the rims of the fountains in the courtyard was worth studying round the arches of the great centre court are written in sanskrit and hindi texts from the great hindu writers of old bearing on the beauty of wisdom and the sanctity of true knowledge  in the central corridor are six great frescoes each about nine feet by five copies of illustrations in the royal folio of the razmnameh the mahabharata which abkar caused to be done by the best artists of his day the original is in the museum and he who can steal it will find a purchaser at any price up to fifty thousand pounds     v  of the sordidness of the supreme government on the revenue side and of the palace of jeypore a great kings pleasurehouse and the work of the servants of state   internally there is in all honesty no limit to the luxury of the jeypore museum it revels in south kensington casesof the approved patternthat turn the beholder homesick and south kensington labels whereon the description measurements and price of each object are fairly printed these make savage one who knows how labelling is bungled in some of the government museumsour starved barns that are supposed to hold the economic exhibits not of little states but of great provinces  the floors are of dark red chunam overlaid with a discreet and silent matting the doors where they are not plate glass are of carved wood no two alike hinged by sumptuous brass hinges on to marble jambs and opening without noise on the carved marble pillars of each hall are fixed revolving cases of the south kensington pattern to show textile fabrics gold lace and the like in the recesses of the walls are more cases and on the railing of the gallery that runs round each of the three great central rooms are fixed low cases to hold natural history specimens and wax models of fruits and vegetables  hear this governments of india from the punjab to madras the doors come true to the jamb the cases which have been through a hot weather are neither warped nor cracked nor are there unseemly tallowdrops and flaws in the glasses the maroon cloth on or against which the exhibits are placed is of close texture untouched by the moth neither stained nor meagre nor sunfaded the revolving cases revolve freely without rattling there is not a speck of dust from one end of the building to the other because the menial staff are numerous enough to keep everything clean and the curators office is a veritable officenot a shed or a bathroom or a loosebox partitioned from the main building these things are so because money has been spent on the museum and it is now a rebuke to all other museums in india from calcutta downwards whether it is not too good to be buried away in a native state is a question which envious men may raise and answer as they choose not long ago the editor of a bombay paper passed through it but having the interests of the egocentric presidency before his eyes dwelt more upon the idea of the building than its structural beauties saying that bombay who professed a weakness for technical education should be ashamed of herself and he was quite right  the system of the museum is complete in intention as are its appointments in design at present there are some fifteen thousand objects of art covering a complete exposition of the arts from enamels to pottery and from brassware to stonecarving of the state of jeypore they are compared with similar arts of other lands thus a damios sworda gem of lacquerplated silk and studworkflanks the tulwars of marwar and the jezails of tonk and reproductions of persian and russian brasswork stand side by side with the handicrafts of the pupils of the jeypore school of art a photograph of his highness the present maharaja is set among the arms which are the most prominent features of the first or metalroom as the villagers enter they salaam reverently to the photo and then move on slowly with an evidently intelligent interest in what they see ruskin could describe the scene admirablypointing out how reverence must precede the study of art and how it is good for englishmen and rajputs alike to bow on occasion before geislers cap they thumb the revolving cases of cloths do those rustics and artlessly try to feel the texture through the protecting glass the main object of the museum is avowedly provincialto show the craftsman of jeypore the best that his predecessors could do and what foreign artists have done in timebut the curator of the museum has many schemes which will assuredly bear fruit in time and it would be unfair to divulge them let those who doubt the thoroughness of a museum under one mans control built filled and endowed with royal generosityan institution perfectly independent of the government of indiago and exhaustively visit dr hendleys charge at jeypore like the man who made the building he refuses to talk and so the greater part of the work that he has in hand must be guessed at  at one point indeed the curator was taken off his guard a huge map of the kingdom showed in green the portions that had been brought under irrigation while blue circles marked the towns that owned dispensaries i want to bring every man in the state within twenty miles of a dispensaryand ive nearly done it said he then he checked himself and went off to foodgrains in little bottles as being neutral and colourless things envy is forced to admit that the arrangement of the museumfar too important a matter to be explained offhandis continental in its character and has a definite end and bearinga trifle omitted by many institutions other than museums butin fine what can one say of a collection whose very labels are giltedged shameful extravagance nothing of the kindonly finish perfectly in keeping with the rest of the fittingsa finish that we in kutcha3 india have failed to catch  3 casual halffinished  from the museum go out through the city to the maharajas palaceskilfully avoiding the man who would show you the maharajas european billiardroomand wander through a wilderness of sunlit sleepy courts gay with paint and frescoes till you reach an inner square where smiling greybearded men squat at ease and play chaupur4just such a game as cost the pandavs the fair draupadiwith inlaid dice and gayly lacquered pieces these ancients are very polite and will press you to play but give no heed to them for chaupur is an expensive gameexpensive as quailfighting when you have backed the wrong bird and the people are laughing at your inexperience the maharajas palace is gay overwhelmingly rich in candelabra painted ceilings gilt mirrors and other evidences of a too hastily assimilated civilisation but if the evidence of the ear can be trusted the old old game of intrigue goes on as merrily as of yore a figure in saffron came out of a dark arch into the sunlight almost falling into the arms of one in pink where have you come from i have been to see  the name was unintelligible that is a lie you have not then across the court some one laughed a low croaking laugh the pink and saffron figures separated as though they had been shot and disappeared into separate boltholes it was a curious little incident and might have meant a great deal or just nothing at all it distracted the attention of the ancients bowed above the chaupur cloth  4 something like parchesi  in the palacegardens there is even a greater stillness than that about the courts and here nothing of the west unless a critical soul might take exception to the lampposts at the extreme end lies a lakelike tank swarming with muggers5 it is reached through an opening under a block of zenana buildings remembering that all beasts by the palaces of kings or the temples of priests in this country would answer to the name of brother the englishman cried with the voice of faith across the water and the mysterious freemasonry did not fail at the far end of the tank rose a ripple that grew and grew and grew like a thing in a nightmare and became presently an aged mugger as he neared the shore there emerged the green slime thick upon his eyelids another beast and the two together snapped at a cigarbuttthe only reward for their courtesy then disgusted they sank stern first with a gentle sigh now a muggers sigh is the most suggestive sound in animal speech it suggested first the zenana buildings overhead the walled passes through the purple hills beyond a horse that might clatter through the passes till he reached the man sagar lake below the passes and a boat that might row across the man sagar till it nosed the wall of the palacetank and thenthen uprose the mugger with the filth upon his forehead and winked one horny eyelidin truth he didand so supplied a fitting end to a foolish fiction of old days and things that might have been but it must be unpleasant to live in a house whose base is washed by such a tank  5 crocodiles  and so back through the chunamed courts and among the gentle sloping paths between the orange trees up to an entrance of the palace guarded by two rusty brown dogs from kabul each big as a man and each requiring a mans charpoy to sleep upon very gay was the front of the palace very brilliant were the glimpses of the damaskcouched gilded rooms within and very very civilised were the lampposts with ram singhs monogram devised to look like v r at the bottom and a coronet at the top an unseen brass band among the orange bushes struck up the overture of the bronze horse those who know the music will see at once that that was the only tune which exactly and perfectly fitted the scene and its surroundings it was a coincidence and a revelation  in his time and when he was not fighting jey singh the second who built the city was a great astronomera royal omar khayyam for he like the tentmaker of nishapur reformed a calendar and strove to wring their mysteries from the stars with instruments worthy of a king but in the end he wrote that the goodness of the almighty was above everything and died leaving his observatory to decay without the palacegrounds  from the bronze horse to the grassgrown enclosure that holds the yantr samrat or prince of dials is rather an abrupt passage jey singh built him a dial with a gnomon some ninety feet high to throw a shadow against the sun and the gnomon stands today though there is grass in the kiosque at the top and the flight of steps up the hypotenuse is worn he built also a zodiacal dialtwelve dials upon one platformto find the moment of true noon at any time of the year and hollowed out of the earth place for two hemispherical cups cut by belts of stone for comparative observations  he made cups for calculating eclipses and a mural quadrant and many other strange things of stone and mortar of which people hardly know the names and but very little of the uses once said a man in charge of two tiny elephants indur and har a sahib came with the viceroy and spent eight days in the enclosure of the great neglected observatory seeing and writing things in a book but he understood sanskritthe sanskrit upon the faces of the dials and the meaning of the gnoma and pointers nowadays no one understands sanskritnot even the pundits but without doubt jey singh was a great man  the hearer echoed the statement though he knew nothing of astronomy and of all the wonders in the observatory was only struck by the fact that the shadow of the prince of dials moved over its vast plate so quickly that it seemed as though time wroth at the insolence of jey singh had loosed the horses of the sun and were sweeping everythingdainty palacegardens and ruinous instrumentsinto the darkness of eternal night so he went away chased by the shadow on the dial and returned to the hotel where he found men who saidthis must be a catchword of globetrottersthat they were much pleased at amber they further thought that houserent would be cheap in those parts and sniggered over the witticism there is a class of tourists and a strangely large one who individually never get farther than the much pleased state under any circumstances this same class of tourists it has also been observed are usually free with hackneyed puns vapid phrases and alleged or bygone jokes jey singh in spite of a few discreditable laches was a temperate and tolerant man but he would have hanged those globetrotters in their trunkstraps as high as the yantr samrat  next morning in the grey dawn the englishman rose up and shook the sand of jeypore from his feet and went with master coryatt and sir thomas roe to adsmir wondering whether a year in jeypore would be sufficient to exhaust its interest and why he had not gone out to the tombs of the dead kings and the passes of gulta and the fort of motee dungri but what he wondered at mostknowing how many men who have in any way been connected with the birth of an institution do to the end of their days continue to drag forward and exhume their labours and the honours that did not come to themwas the work of the two men who together for years past have been pushing jeypore along the stonedressed paths of civilisation peace and comfort servants of the raj they called themselves and surely they have served the raj past all praise the people in the city and the cameldriver from the sandhills told of their work they themselves held their peace as to what they had done and when pressed referredcrowning basenessto reports printed ones     vi  showing how her majestys mails went to udaipur and fell out by the way   arrived at ajmir the englishman fell among tents pitched under the shadow of a huge banian tree and in them was a punjabi now there is no brotherhood like the brotherhood of the pauper province for it is even greater than the genial and unquestioning hospitality which in spite of the loafer and the globetrotter seems to exist throughout india ajmir being british territory though the inhabitants are allowed to carry arms is the headquarters of many of the banking firms who lend to the native states the complaint of the setts6 today is that their trade is bad because an unsympathetic government induces native states to make railways and become prosperous look at jodhpur said a gentleman whose possessions might be roughly estimated at anything between thirty and fortyfive lakhs time was when jodhpur was always in debtand not so long ago either now theyve got a railroad and are carrying salt over it and as sure as i stand here they have a surplus what can we do poor pauper however he makes a little profit on the fluctuations in the coinage of the states round him for every small king seems to have the privilege of striking his own image and inflicting the great exchange question on his subjects it is a poor state that has not two seers and five different rupees  6 native bankers  from a criminal point of view ajmir is not a pleasant place the native states lie all round and about it and portions of the district are ten miles off native statelocked on every side thus the criminal who may be a burglarious meena lusting for the money bags of the setts or a peshawari down south on a cold weather tour has his plan of campaign much simplified  the englishman made only a short stay in the town hearing that there was to be a ceremonytamasha covers a multitude of thingsat the capital of his highness the maharana of udaipura town some hundred and eighty miles south of ajmir not known to many people beyond viceroys and their staffs and the officials of the rajputana agency so he took a neemuch train in the very early morning and with the punjabi went due south to chitor the point of departure for udaipur in time the aravalis gave place to a dead flat stonestrewn plain thick with dhakjungle later the datepalm fraternised with the dhak and low hills stood on either side of the line to this succeeded a tract rich in pure white stonethe line was ballasted with it then came more low hills each with a cocks comb of splintered rock overlooking dhakjungle and villages fenced with thornsplaces that at once declared themselves tigerish last the huge bulk of chitor showed itself on the horizon the train crossed the gumber river and halted almost in the shadow of the hills on which the old pride of udaipur was set  it is difficult to give an idea of the chitor fortress but the long line of brown wall springing out of bushcovered hill suggested at once those pictures such as the graphic publishes of the inflexible or the devastationgigantic menofwar with a very low freeboard ploughing through green sea the hill on which the fort stands is shipshaped and some miles long and from a distance every inch appears to be scarped and guarded but there was no time to see chitor the business of the day was to get if possible to udaipur from chitor station which was composed of one platform one telegraphroom a bench and several vicious dogs  the state of udaipur is as backward as jeypore is advancedif we judge it by the standard of civilisation it does not approve of the incursions of englishmen and to do it justice it thoroughly succeeds in conveying its silent sulkiness still where there is one english resident one doctor one engineer one settlement officer and one missionary there must be a mail at least once a day there was a mail the englishman men said might go by it if he liked or he might not then with a great sinking of the heart he began to realise that his caste was of no value in the stony pastures of mewar among the swaggering gentlemen who were so lavishly adorned with arms there was a mail the ghost of a tonga with tattered sidecloths and patched roof inconceivably filthy within and without and it was her majestys there was another tongaan aram tonga a carriage of easebut the englishman was not to have it it was reserved for a rajput thakur who was going to udaipur with his tail the thakur in claretcoloured velvet with a blue turban a revolverarmy patterna sword and five or six friends also with swords came by and indorsed the statement now the mail tonga had a wheel which was destined to become the wheel of fate and to lead to many curious things two diseased yellow ponies were extracted from a dunghill and yoked to the tonga and after due deliberation her majestys mail started the thakur following  in twelve hours or thereabouts the seventy miles between chitor and udaipur would be accomplished behind the tonga cantered an armed sowar he was the guard the thakurs tonga came up with a rush ran deliberately across the bows of the englishman chipped a pony and passed on one lives and learns the thakur seems to object to following the foreigner  at the haltingstages once in every six miles that is to say the ponies were carefully undressed and all their accoutrements fitted more or less accurately on to the backs of any ponies that might happen to be near the released animals finding their way back to their stables alone and unguided there were no grooms and the harness hung on by special dispensation of providence still the ride over a good road driven through a pitilessly stony country had its charms for a while at sunset the low hills turned to opal and winered and the brown dust flew up pure gold for the tonga was running straight into the sinking sun now and again would pass a traveller on a camel or a gang of bunjarras7 with their packbullocks and their women and the sun touched the brasses of their swords and guns till the poor wretches seemed rich merchants come back from travelling with sindbad  7 gipsy traders  on a rock on the righthand side thirtyfour great vultures were gathered over the carcass of a steer and this was an evil omen they made unseemly noises as the tonga passed and a raven came out of a bush on the right and answered them to crown all one of the hide and skin castes sat on the lefthand side of the road cutting up some of the flesh that he had stolen from the vultures could a man desire three more inauspicious signs for a nights travel twilight came and the hills were alive with strange noises as the red moon nearly at her full rose over chitor to the low hills of the mad geological formation the tumbled strata that seem to obey no law succeeded level ground the pasture lands of mewar cut by the beruch and wyan streams running over smooth waterworn rock and as the heavy embankments and ample waterways showed very lively in the rainy season  in this region occurred the last and most inauspicious omen of all something had gone wrong with a crupper a piece of blue and white punkahcord the englishman pointed it out and the driver descending danced on that lonely road an unholy dance singing the while the dumchi8 the dumchi the dumchi in a shrill voice then he returned and drove on while the englishman wondered into what land of lunatics he was heading at an average speed of six miles an hour it is possible to see a great deal of the country and under brilliant moonlight mewar was desolately beautiful there was no night traffic on the road no one except the patient sowar his shadow an inky blot on white cantering twenty yards behind once the tonga strayed into a company of date trees that fringed the path and once rattled through a little town and once the ponies shied at what the driver said was a rock but it jumped up in the moonlight and went away  8 the crupper  then came a great blasted heath whereon nothing was more than six inches higha wilderness covered with grass and low thorn and here as nearly as might be midway between chitor and udaipur the wheel of fate which had been for some time beating against the side of the tonga came off and her majestys mails two bags including parcels collapsed on the wayside while the englishman repented him that he had neglected the omens of the vultures and the raven the lowcaste man and the mad driver  there was a consultation and an examination of the wheel but the whole tonga was rotten and the axle was smashed and the axle pins were bent and nearly redhot it is nothing said the driver the mail often does this what is a wheel he took a big stone and began hammering proudly on the tire to show that that at least was sound a hasty courtmartial revealed that there was absolutely not one single relief vehicle on the whole road between chitor and udaipur  now this wilderness was so utterly waste that not even the barking of a dog or the sound of a nightfowl could be heard luckily the thakur had some twenty miles back stepped out to smoke by the roadside and his tonga had been passed meanwhile the sowar was sent back to find that tonga and bring it on he cantered into the haze of the moonlight and disappeared then said the driver had there been no tonga behind us i should have put the mails on a horse because the sirkars mail cannot stop the englishman sat down upon the parcelsbag for he felt that there was trouble coming the driver looked east and west and said i too will go and see if the tonga can be found for the sirkars dak cannot stop meantime oh sahib do you take care of the mailsone bag and one bag of parcels so he ran swiftly into the haze of the moonlight and was lost and the englishman was left alone in charge of her majestys mails two unhappy ponies and a lopsided tonga he lit a fire for the night was bitterly cold and only mourned that he could not destroy the whole of the territories of his highness the maharana of udaipur but he managed to raise a very fine blaze before he reflected that all this trouble was his own fault for wandering into native states undesirous of englishmen  the ponies coughed dolorously from time to time but they could not lift the weight of a dead silence that seemed to be crushing the earth after an interval measurable by centuries sowar driver and thakurs tonga reappeared the latter full to the brim and bubbling over with humanity and bedding we will now said the driver not deigning to notice the englishman who had been on guard over the mails put the sirkars mail into this tonga and go forward amiable heathen he was goinghe said soto leave the englishman to wait in the sahara for certainly thirty hours and perhaps fortyeight tongas are scarce on the udaipur road there are a few occasions in life when it is justifiable to delay her majestys mail this was one of them seating himself upon the parcelsbag the englishman cried in what was intended to be a very terrible voice but the silence soaked it up and left only a thin trickle of sound that any one who touched the bags would be hit with a stick several times over the head the bags were the only link between him and the civilisation he had so rashly foregone and there was a pause  the thakur put his head out of the tonga and spoke shrilly in mewari the englishman replied in englishurdu the thakur withdrew his head and from certain grunts that followed seemed to be wakening his retainers then two men fell sleepily out of the tonga and walked into the night come in said the thakur you and your baggage my pistol is in that corner be careful the englishman taking a mailbag in one hand for safetys sakethe wilderness inspires an angloindian cockney with unreasoning fearclimbed into the tonga which was then loaded far beyond plimsoll mark and the procession resumed its journey every one in the vehicleit seemed as full as the railway carriage that held alice through the lookingglasswas sahib and hazur except the englishman he was simple tum thou and a revolver army pattern was printing every diamond in the chequerwork of its handle on his right hip when men desired him to move they prodded him with the handles of tulwars till they had coiled him into an uneasy lump then they slept upon him or cannoned against him as the tonga bumped it was an aram tonga a tonga for ease that was the bitterest thought of all  in due season the harness began to break once every five minutes and the driver vowed that the wheels would give way also  after eight hours in one position it is excessively difficult to walk still more difficult to climb up an unknown road into a dakbungalow but he who has sought sleep on an arsenal and under the bodies of burly rajputs can do it the grey dawn brought udaipur and a french bedstead as the tonga jingled away the englishman heard the familiar crack of broken harness so he was not the jonah he had been taught to consider himself all through that night of penance  a jackal sat in the verandah and howled him to sleep and he dreamed that he caught a viceroy under the walls of chitor and beat him with a tulwar till he turned into a dakpony whose near foreleg was perpetually coming off and who would say nothing but tum when he was asked why he had not built a railway from chitor to udaipur     vii  touching the children of the sun and their city and the hatmarked caste and their merits and a good mans works in the wilderness   it was worth a nights discomfort and revolverbeds to sleep uponthis city of the suryavansi hidden among the hills that encompass the great pichola lake truly the king who governs today is wise in his determination to have no railroad to his capital his predecessor was more or less enlightened and had he lived a few years longer would have brought the iron horse through the dobarrithe green gate which is the entrance of the girwa or girdle of hills around udaipur and with the train would have come the tourist who would have scratched his name upon the temple of garuda and laughed horselaughs upon the lake let us therefore be thankful that the capital of mewar is hard to reach  each man in this land who has any claims to respectability walks armed carrying his tulwar sheathed in his hand or hung by a short sling of cotton passing over the shoulder under his left armpit his matchlock or smoothbore if he has one is borne naked on the shoulder  now it is possible to carry any number of lethal weapons without being actually dangerous an unhandy revolver for instance may be worn for years and at the end accomplish nothing more noteworthy than the murder of its owner but the rajputs weapons are not meant for display the englishman caught a cameldriver who talked to him in mewari which is a heathenish dialect something like multani to listen to and the man very gracefully and courteously handed him his sword and matchlock the latter a heavy stumpstock arrangement without pretence of sights the blade was as sharp as a razor and the gun in perfect working order the coiled fuse on the stock was charred at the end and the curled ramshorn powderhorn opened as readily as a muchhandled whiskyflask unfortunately ignorance of mewari prevented conversation so the cameldriver resumed his accoutrements and jogged forward on his beasta superb black one with the short curled hubshee hairwhile the englishman went to the city which is built on hills on the borders of the lake by the way everything in udaipur is built on a hill there is no level ground in the place except the durbar gardens of which more hereafter because colour holds the eye more than form the first thing noticeable was neither temple nor fort but an everrecurring picture painted in the rudest form of native art of a man on horseback armed with a lance charging an elephantofwar as a rule the elephant was depicted on one side the housedoor and the rider on the other there was no representation of an army behind the figures stood alone upon the whitewash on house and wall and gate again and again and again a highly intelligent priest grunted that it was a picture a private of the maharanas regular army suggested that it was an elephant while a wheatseller his sword at his side was equally certain that it was a raja beyond that point his knowledge did not go the explanation of the picture is this in the days when raja maun of amber put his sword at akbars service and won for him great kingdoms akbar sent an army against mewar whose then ruler was pertap singh most famous of all the princes of mewar selim akbars son led the army of the toork the rajputs met them at the pass of huldighat and fought till onehalf of their band was slain once in the press of battle pertap on his great horse chytak came within striking distance of selims elephant and slew the mahout but selim escaped to become jehangir afterwards and the rajputs were broken that was three hundred years ago and men have reduced the picture to a sort of diagram that the painter dashes in in a few minutes without it would seem knowing what he is commemorating  thinking of these things the englishman made shift to get to the city and presently came to a tall gate the gate of the sun on which the elephantspikes that he had seen rotted with rust at amber were new and pointed and effective the city gates are said to be shut at night and there is a story of a viceroys guardofhonour which arrived before daybreak being compelled to crawl ignominiously man by man through a little wicketgate while the horses had to wait without till sunrise but a civilised yearning for the utmost advantages of octroi and not a fierce fear of robbery and wrong is at the bottom of the continuance of this custom the walls of the city are loopholed for musketry but there seem to be no mounting for guns and the moat without the walls is dry and gives cattle pasture coarse rubble in concrete faced with stone makes the walls moderately strong  internally the city is surprisingly clean though with the exception of the main street paved after the fashion of jullundur of which men say the pavement was put down in the time of alexander and worn by myriads of naked feet into deep barrels and grooves in the case of udaipur the feet of the passengers have worn the rock veins that crop out everywhere smooth and shiny and in the rains the narrow gullies must spout like firehoses the people have been untouched by cholera for four years proof that providence looks after those who do not look after themselves for neemuch cantonment a hundred miles away suffered grievously last summer and what do you make in udaipur swords said the man in the shop throwing down an armful of tulwars kuttars and khandas on the stones do you want any look here hereat he took up one of the commoner swords and flourished it in the sunshine then he bent it double and as it sprang straight began to make it speak armvenders in udaipur are a sincere race for they sell to people who really use their wares the man in the shop was rudedistinctly so his first flush of professional enthusiasm abated he took stock of the englishman and said calmly what do you want with a sword then he picked up his goods and retreated while certain small boys who deserved a smacking laughed riotously from the coping of a little temple hard by swords seem to be the sole manufacture of the place at least none of the inhabitants the englishman spoke to could think of any other  there is a certain amount of personal violence in and about the state or else where would be the good of the weapons there are occasionally dacoities more or less important but these are not often heard of and indeed there is no special reason why they should be dragged into the light of an unholy publicity for the land governs itself in its own way and is always in its own way which is by no means ours very happy the thakurs live each in his own castle on some rockfaced hill much as they lived in the days of tod though their chances of distinguishing themselves except in the school and dispensary line are strictly limited nominally they pay chutoond or a sixth of their revenues to the state and are under feudal obligations to supply their head with so many horsemen per thousand rupees but whether the chutoond justifies its name and what is the exact extent of the tail leviable they and perhaps the rajputana agency alone know they are quiet give no trouble except to the wild boar and personally are magnificent men to look at the rajput shows his breeding in his hands and feet which are almost disproportionately small and as well shaped as those of a woman his stirrups and swordhandles are even more unusable by westerns than those elsewhere in india whereas the bhils knifehandle gives as large a grip as an english one now the little bhil is an aborigine which is humiliating to think of his tongue which may frequently be heard in the city seems to possess some variant of the zulu click which gives it a weird and unearthly character from the main gate of the city the englishman climbed uphill towards the palace and the jugdesh temple built by one juggat singh at the beginning of the last century this building must bebut ignorance is a bad guidejain in character from basement to the stone socket of the temple flagstaff it is carved in high relief with elephants men gods and monsters in friezes of wearying profusion  the management of the temple have daubed a large portion of the building with whitewash for which their revenues should be cut for a year or two the main shrine holds a large brazen image of garuda and in the corners of the courtyard of the main pile are shrines to mahadeo and the jovial potbellied ganesh there is no repose in this architecture and the entire effect is one of repulsion for the clustered figures of man and brute seem always on the point of bursting into unclean wriggling life but it may be that the builders of this form of house desired to put the fear of all their many gods into the hearts of the worshippers  from the temple whose steps are worn smooth by the feet of men and whose courts are full of the faint smell of stale flowers and old incense the englishman went to the palaces which crown the highest hill overlooking the city here too whitewash had been unsparingly applied but the excuse was that the stately fronts and the pierced screens were built of a perishable stone which needed protection against the weather one projecting window in the façade of the main palace had been treated with minton tiles luckily it was too far up the wall for anything more than the colour to be visible and the pale blue against the pure white was effective  a picture of ganesh looks out over the main courtyard which is entered by a triple gate and hard by is the place where the kings elephants fight over a low masonry wall in the side of the hill on which the palaces stand is built stabling for horses and elephantsproof that the architects of old must have understood their business thoroughly the palace is not a show place and consequently the englishman did not see much of the interior but he passed through open gardens with tanks and pavilions very cool and restful till he came suddenly upon the pichola lake and forgot altogether about the palace he found a sheet of steelblue water set in purple and grey hills bound in on one side by marble bunds the fair white walls of the palace and the grey timeworn ones of the city and on the other fading away through the white of shallow water and the soft green of weed marsh and rankpastured riverfield into the land  to enjoy open water thoroughly live for a certain number of years barred from anything better than the yearly swell and shrinkage of one of the five rivers and then come upon two and a half miles of solid restful lake with a cool wind blowing off it and little waves spitting against the piers of a veritable albeit hideously ugly boathouse on the faith of an exile from the sea you will not stay long among palaces be they never so lovely or in little rooms panelled with dutch tiles  and here follows a digression there is no life so good as the life of a loafer who travels by rail and road for all things and all people are kind to him from the chill miseries of a dakbungalow where they slew one hen with as much parade as the french guillotined pranzini to the wellordered sumptuousness of the residency was a step bridged over by kindly and unquestioning hospitality so it happened that the englishman was not only able to go upon the lake in a softcushioned boat with everything handsome about him but might had he chosen have killed wildduck with which the lake swarms  the mutter of water under a boats nose was a pleasant thing to hear once more starting at the head of the lake he found himself shut out from sight of the main sheet of water in a loch bounded by a sunk broken bund to steer across which was a matter of some nicety beyond that lay a second pool spanned by a narrowarched bridge built men said long before the city of the rising sun which is little more than three hundred years old the bridge connects the city with brahmapuraa whiter walled enclosure filled with many brahmins and ringing with the noise of their conches beyond the bridge the body of the lake with the city running down to it comes into full view and providence has arranged for the benefit of such as delight in colours that the rajputni shall wear the most striking tints that she can buy in the bazaars in order that she may beautify the ghâts where she comes to bathe  the bathingledge at the foot of the city wall was lighted with women clad in raw vermilion dull red indigo and skyblue saffron and pink and turquoise the water faithfully doubling everything but the first impression was of the unreality of the sight for the englishman found himself thinking of the simla fine arts exhibition and the overdaring amateurs who had striven to reproduce scenes such as these then a woman rose up and clasping her hands behind her head looked at the passing boat and the ripples spread out from her waist in blinding white silver far across the water as a picture a daringly insolent picture it was superb  the boat turned aside to shores where huge turtles were lying and a stork had built her a nest big as a haycock in a withered tree and a bevy of coots were flapping and gabbling in the weeds or between great leaves of the victoria regiaan escape from the state gardens here were divers and waders kingfishers and snakynecked birds of the cormorant family but no duck they had seen the guns in the boat and were flying to and fro in companies across the lake or settlingwise thingsin the glare of the sun on the water the lake was swarming with them but they seemed to know exactly how far a twelvebore would carry perhaps their knowledge had been gained from the englishman at the residency later as the sun left the lake and the hills began to glow like opals the boat made her way to the shallow side of the lake through fields of watergrass and dead lotusraffle that rose as high as the bows and clung lovingly about the rudder and parted with the noise of silk when it is torn there she waited for the fall of twilight when the duck would come home to bed and the englishman sprawled upon the cushions in deep content and laziness as he looked across to where two marble palaces floated upon the waters and saw all the glory and beauty of the city and wondered whether tod in cocked hat and stiff stock had ever come shooting among the reeds and if so how in the world he had ever managed to bowl over  duck and drake by jove confiding beasts werent they hi lalla jump out and get them it was a brutal thing this doublebarrelled murder perpetrated in the silence of the marsh when the kingly wildduck came back from his wanderings with his mate at his side butbutthe birds were very good to eat  if the venetian owned the pichola sagar he might say with justice see it and die but it is better to live and go to dinner and strike into a new lifethat of the men who bear the hatmark on their brow as plainly as the wellborn native carries the trisul of shiva  they are of the same caste as the toilers on the frontiertough bronzed men with wrinkles at the corners of the eyes gotten by looking across much sunglare when they would speak of horses they mention arab ponies and their talk for the most part drifts bombaywards or to abu which is their simla by these things the traveller may see that he is far away from the presidency and will presently learn that he is in a land where the railway is an incident and not an indispensable luxury folk tell strange stories of drives in bullockcarts in the rains of breakdowns in nullahs fifty miles from everywhere and of elephants that used to sink for rest and refreshment halfway across swollen streams every place here seems fifty miles from everywhere and the legs of a horse are regarded as the only natural means of locomotion also and this to the indian cockney who is accustomed to the bleached or office man is curious there are to be found many veritable tigermennot storyspinners but such as have in their wanderings from bikaneer to indore dropped their tiger in the way of business they are enthusiastic over princelings of little known fiefs lords of austere estates perched on the tops of unthrifty hills hard riders and good sportsmen and five six yes fully nine hundred miles to the northward lives the sister branch of the same castethe men who swear by pathan biluch and brahui with whom they have shot or broken bread  there is a saying in upper india that the more desolate the country the greater the certainty of finding a padresahib the proverb seems to hold good in udaipur where the scotch presbyterian mission have a post and others at todgarh to the north and elsewhere to arrive under providence at the cure of souls through the curing of bodies certainly seems the rational method of conversion and this is exactly what the missions are doing their padre in udaipur is also an md and of him a rather striking tale is told conceiving that the city could bear another hospital in addition to the state one he took furlough went home and there by crusade and preaching raised sufficient money for the scheme so that none might say that he was beholden to the state returning he built his hospital a very model of neatness and comfort and opening the operationbook announced his readiness to see any one and every one who was sick how the call was and is now responded to the dry records of that book will show and the name of the padresahib is honoured as these ears have heard throughout udaipur and far around the faith that sends a man into the wilderness and the secular energy which enables him to cope with an evergrowing demand for medical aid must in time find their reward if patience and unwearying selfsacrifice carry any merit they should do so soon today the people are willing enough to be healed and the general influence of the padresahib is very great but beyond that still it was impossible to judge aright     viii  divers passages of speech and action whence the nature arts and disposition of the king and his subjects may be observed   in this land men tell sad stories of the death of kings not easily found elsewhere and also speak of sati which is generally supposed to be out of date in a manner which makes it seem very near and vivid be pleased to listen to some of the tales but with all the names cut out because a king has just as much right to have his family affairs respected as has a british householder paying income tax  once upon a time that is to say when the british power was well established in the land and there were railways was a king who lay dying for many days and all including the englishmen about him knew that his end was certain but he had chosen to lie in an outer court or pleasurehouse of his palace and with him were some twenty of his favourite wives the place in which he lay was very near to the city and there was a fear that his womankind should on his death going mad with grief cast off their veils and run out into the streets uncovered before all men in which case nothing not even the power of the press and the locomotive and the telegraph and cheap education and enlightened municipal councils could have saved them from the burningpyre for they were the wives of a king so the political did his best to induce the dying man to go to the fort of the city a safe place close to the regular zenana where all the women could be kept within walls he said that the air was better in the fort but the king refused and that he would recover in the fort but the king refused after some days the latter turned and said why are you so keen sahib upon getting my old bones up to the fort driven to his last defences the political said simply well maharana sahib the place is close to the road you see and  the king saw and said oh thats it ive been puzzling my brain for four days to find out what on earth you were driving at ill go tonight but there may be some difficulty began the political you think so said the king if i only hold up my little finger the women will obey me go now and come back in five minutes and all will be ready for departure as a matter of fact the political withdrew for the space of fifteen minutes and gave orders that the conveyances which he had kept in readiness day and night should be got ready in fifteen minutes those twenty women with their handmaidens were packed and ready for departure and the king died later at the fort and nothing happened here the englishman asked why a frantic woman must of necessity become a sati and felt properly abashed when he was told that she must there was nothing else for her if she went out unveiled  the rushout forces the matter and indeed if you consider the matter from the rajput point of view it does  then followed a very grim tale of the death of another king of the long vigil by his bedside before he was taken off the bed to die upon the ground of the shutting of a certain mysterious door behind the bedhead which shutting was followed by a rustle of womens dress of a walk on the top of the palace to escape the heated air of the sick room and then in the grey dawn the wail upon wail breaking from the zenana as the news of the kings death went in i never wish to hear anything more horrible and awful in my life you could see nothing you could only hear the poor wretches said the political with a shiver  the last restingplace of the maharanas of udaipur is at ahar a little village two miles east of the city here they go down in their robes of state their horse following behind and here the political saw after the death of a maharana the dancinggirls dancing before the poor white ashes the musicians playing among the cenotaphs and the golden hookah sword and watervessel laid out for the naked soul doomed to hover twelve days round the funeral pyre before it could depart on its journey toward a fresh birth once in a neighbouring state it is said one of the dancinggirls stole a march in the next worlds precedence and her lords affections upon the legitimate queens the affair happened by the way after the mutiny and was accomplished with great pomp in the light of day subsequently those who might have stopped it but did not were severely punished the girl said that she had no one to look to but the dead man and followed him to use tods formula through the flames it would be curious to know whether sati is altogether abolished among these lonely hills in the walled holds of the thakurs  but to return from the burningground to modern udaipur as at present worked under the maharana and his prime minister rae punna lal c i e to begin with his highness is a racial anomaly in that judged by the strictest european standard he is a man of temperate life the husband of one wife whom he married before he was chosen to the throne after the death of the maharana sujjun singh in 1884 sujjun singh died childless and gave no hint of his desires as to succession andomitting all the genealogical and political reasons which would drive a man madfutteh singh was chosen by the thakurs from the seorati branch of the family which sangram singh ii founded he is thus a younger son of a younger branch of a younger family which lucid statement should suffice to explain everything the man who could deliberately unravel the succession of any one of the rajput states would be perfectly capable of explaining the politics of all the frontier tribes from jumrood to quetta  roughly speaking the maharana and the prime ministerin whose family the office has been hereditary for many generationsdivide the power of the state they control more or less the mahand raj sabha or council of direction and revision this is composed of many of the rawats and thakurs of the state and the poet laureate who under a less genial administration would be presumably the registrar there are also district officers officers of customs superintendents of the mint masters of the horses and supervisor of doles which last is pretty and touching the state officers itself and the englishmans investigations failed to unearth any bengalis the commandant of the state army about five thousand men of all arms is a retired noncommissioned officer a mr lonergan who as the medals on his breast attest has done the state some service and now in his old age rejoices in the local rank of majorgeneral and teaches the maharajas guns to make uncommonly good practice the infantry are smart and well set up while the cavalryrare thing in native stateshave a distinct notion of keeping their accoutrements clean they are further well mounted on light wiry mewar and kathiawar horses incidentally it may be mentioned that the pathan comes down with his pickings from the punjab to udaipur and finds a market there for animals that were much better employed in our servicebut the complaint is a stale one let us see later on what the jodhpur stables hold and then formulate an indictment against the government so much for the indigenous administration of udaipur the one drawback in the present maharaja from the official point of view is his want of education he is a thoroughly good man but was not brought up with the kingship before his eyes consequently he is not an englishspeaking man  there is a story told of him which is worth the repeating an englishman who flattered himself that he could speak the vernacular fairly well paid him a visit and discoursed with a round mouth the maharana heard him politely and turning to a satellite demanded a translation which was given then said the maharanaspeak to him in angrezi the angrezi spoken by the interpreter was urdu as the sahibs speak it and the englishman having ended his conference departed abashed but this backwardness is eminently suited to a place like udaipur and a european prince is not always a desirable thing the curious and even startling simplicity of his life is worth preserving here is a specimen of one of his days rising at fourand the dawn can be bitterly chillhe bathes and prays after the custom of his race and at six is ready to take in hand the first instalment of the days work which comes before him through his prime minister and occupies him for three or four hours till the first meal of the day is ready at two oclock he attends the mahand raj sabha and works till five retiring at a healthily primitive hour he is said to have his hand fairly firmly upon the reins of rule and to know as much as most monarchs know of the way in which his revenuessome thirty lakhsare disposed of the prime ministers career has been a chequered and interesting one including a dismissal from power this was worked by the queens from behind the screen an arrest and an attack with swords which all but ended in his murder he has not so much power as his predecessors had for the reason that the present maharaja allows little but tigershooting to distract him from the supervision of the state his highness by the way is a firstclass shot and has bagged eighteen tigers already he preserves his game carefully and permission to kill tigers is not readily obtainable  a curious instance of the old order giving place to the new is in process of evolution and deserves notice the prime ministers son futteh lal a boy of twenty years old has been educated at the mayo college ajmir and speaks and writes english there are few native officials in the state who do this and the consequence is that the lad has won a very fair insight into state affairs and knows generally what is going forward both in the eastern and western spheres of the little court in time he may qualify for direct administrative powers and udaipur will be added to the list of the states that are governed english fashion what the end will be after three generations of princes and dewans have been put through the mill of the rajkumar colleges those who live will learn  more interesting is the question for how long can the vitality of a people whose life was arms be suspended men in the north say that by the favour of the government which brings peace the sikh sirdars are rotting on their lands and the rajput thakurs say of themselves that they are growing rusty the old old problem forces itself on the most unreflective mind at every turn in the gay streets of udaipur a frenchman might write behold there the horse of the rajputfoaming panting caracoling but always fettered with his head so majestic upon his bosom so amply filled with a generous heart he rages but he does not advance see there the destiny of the rajput who bestrides him and upon whose left flank bounds the sabre uselessthe haberdashery of the ironmonger only pity the horse in reason for that life there is his raison dêtre pity ten thousand times more the rajput for he has no raison dêtre he is an anachronism in a blue turban  the gaul might be wrong but tod wrote things which seem to support this view in the days when he wished to make bufferstates of the land he loved so well  let us visit the durbar gardens where little naked cupids are trampling upon fountains of fatted fish all in bronze where there are cypresses and red paths and a deerpark full of all varieties of deer besides two growling fluffy little panther cubs a black panther who is the prince of darkness and a gentleman and a terracefull of tigers bears and guzerat lions brought from the king of oudhs sale     ix  of the pigdrive which was a pantherkilling and of the departure to chitor   above the durbar gardens lie low hills in which the maharana keeps very strictly guarded his pig and his deer and anything else that may find shelter in the low scrub or under the scattered boulders these preserves are scientifically parcelled out with high redstone walls and here and there are dotted tiny shootingstandsmasonry sentryboxes in which five or six men may sit at ease and shoot it had been arranged to entertain the englishmen who were gathered at the residency to witness the investiture of the king with the g c s ithat there should be a little pigdrive in front of the kala odey or black shootingbox the rajput is a man and a brother in respect that he will ride shoot eat pig and drink strong waters like an englishman of the pighunting he makes almost a religious duty and of the winedrinking no less read how desperately they used to ride in udaipur at the beginning of the century when tod always in his cocked hat to be sure counted up the tale of accidents at the end of the days sport  there is something unfair in shooting pig but each man who went out consoled himself with the thought that it was utterly impossible to ride the brutes up the almost perpendicular hillsides or down rocky ravines and that he individually would only go just for the fun of the thing those who stayed behind made rude remarks on the subject of pork butchers and the dangers that attended shooting from a balcony there are ways and ways of slaying pigfrom the orthodox method which begins with the boarthe boarthe mighty boar overnight and ends with a shaky bridlehand next morn to the sober and solitary potshot at dawn from a railway embankment running through river marsh but the perfect way is this get a large fourhorse break and drive till you meet an unlimited quantity of padelephants waiting at the foot of rich hillpreserves mount slowly and with dignity and go in swinging procession by the marblefaced border of one of the most lovely lakes on earth strike off on a semiroad semihilltorrent path through unthrifty thorny jungle and so climb up and up and up till you see spread like a map below the lake and the palace and the city hemmed in by the sea of hills that lies between udaipur and mount abu a hundred miles away then take your seat in a comfortable chair in a fine twostoried grand stand with an awning spread atop to keep off the sun while the rawat of amet and the prime ministers heirno lessinvite you to take your choice of the many rifles spread on a ledge at the front of the building this gentlemen who screw your pet ponies at early dawn after the sounder that vanishes into cover soon as sighted or painfully follow the tiger through the burning heats of mewar in may this is shooting after the fashion of ouidain musk and ambergris and patchouli  it is demoralising one of the best and hardest riders of the lahore tent club in the old days as the boars of bouli lena singh knew well said openly this is a firstclass scheme and fell to testing his triggers as though he had been a pothunter from his birth derision and threats of exposure moved him not give me an armchair said he this is the proper way to deal with pig and he put up his feet on the ledge and stretched himself  there were many weapons to choose from the doublebarrelled 500 express whose bullet is a tearing rending shell to the rawat of amets regulation military martinihenri a profane public at the residency had suggested clubs and saws as amply sufficient for the work in hand here they were moved by envy which passion was tenfold increased whenbut this comes later on the beat was along a deep gorge in the hills flanked on either crest by stone walls manned with beaters immediately opposite the shootingbox the wall on the upper or higher hill made a sharp turn downhill contracting the space through which the pig would have to pass to a gut which was variously said to be from one hundred and fifty to four hundred yards across most of the shooting was up or down hill  a philanthropic desire not to murder more bhils than were absolutely necessary to maintain a healthy current of human life in the hilly tracts coupled with a wellfounded dread of the hinder or horse end of a doublebarrelled 500 express which would be sure to go off both barrels together led the englishman to take a gunless seat in the background then a silence fell upon the party and very far away up the gorge the heated afternoon air was cut by the shrill tremolo squeal of the bhil beaters now a man may be in no sort or fashion a shikarimay hold buddhistic objections to the slaughter of living thingsbut there is something in the extraordinary noise of an agitated bhil which makes even the most peaceful mortals get up and yearn like tartarin of tarescon for lions always at a safe distance be it understood as the beat drew nearer under the squealingthe ulallululuwas heard a longdrawn bitternlike boom of sooor sooor pig pig and the crashing of boulders the guns rose in their places forgetting that each and all had merely come to see the fun and began to fumble among the little mounds of cartridges under the chairs presently tripping delicately over the rocks a pig stepped out of a cactusbush and the fusillade began the dust flew and the branches chipped but the pig went ona bluegrey shadow almost undistinguishable against the rocks and took no harm sighting shots said the guns sulkily the beat came nearer and then the listener discovered what the bubbling scream was like for he forgot straightway about the beat and went back to the dusk of an easter monday in the gardens of the crystal palace before the bombardment of kars set piece ten thousand feet square had been illuminated and about five hundred arries were tickling a thousand arriets their giggling and nothing else was the noise of the bhil so curiously does sydenham and western rajputana meet then came another pig who was smitten to the death and rolled down among the bushes drawing his last breath in a human and horrible manner  but full on the crest of the hill blown alongthere is no other word to describe itlike a ball of thistledown passed a brown shadow and men cried bagheera or panther according to their nationalities and blazed the shadow leaped the wall that had turned the pig downhill and vanished among the cactus never mind said the prime ministers son consolingly well beat the other side of the hill afterwards and get him yet oh hes a mile off by this time said the guns but the rawat of amet a magnificent young man smiled a sweet smile and said nothing more pig passed and were slain and many more broke back through the beaters who presently came through the cover in scores they were in russet green and red uniform each man bearing a long spear and the hillside was turned on the instant to a camp of robin hoods foresters then they brought up the dead from behind bushes and under rocksamong others a twentyseveninch brute who bore on his flank all pigs shot in a beat are exofficio boars a hideous halfhealed scar big as a mans hand of a bullet wound express bullets are ghastly things in their effects for as the shikari is never tired of demonstrating they knock the inside of animals into pulp  the second beat of the reverse side of the hill had barely begun when the panther returneduneasily as if something were keeping her backmuch lower down the hill then the face of the rawat of amet changed as he brought his gun up to his shoulder looking at him as he fired one forgot all about the mayo college at which he had been educated and remembered only some trivial and outofdate affairs in which his forefathers had been concerned when a bridegroom with his bride at his side charged down the slope of the chitor road and died among akbars men there are stories connected with the house of amet which are told in mewar today the young mans face for as short a time as it takes to pull trigger and see where the bullet falls was a white light upon all these tales  then the mask shut down as he clicked out the cartridge and very sweetly gave it as his opinion that some other gun not his own had bagged the panther who lay shot through the spine feebly trying to drag herself downhill into cover it is an awful thing to see a big beast die when the soul is wrenched out of the struggling body in ten seconds wild horses shall not make the englishman disclose the exact number of shots that were fired it is enough to say that four englishmen now scattered to the four winds of heaven are each morally certain that he and he alone shot that panther in time when distance and the mirage of the sands of uodhpur shall have softened the harsh outlines of truth the englishman who did not fire a shot will come to believe that he was the real slayer and will carefully elaborate that lie  a few minutes after the murder a twoyearold cub came trotting along the hillside and was bowled over by a very pretty shot behind the left ear and through the palate then the beaters lances showed through the bushes and the guns began to realise that they had allowed to escape or had driven back by their fire a multitude of pig  this ended the beat and the procession returned to the residency to heap dead panthers upon those who had called them pork butchers and to stir up the lake of envy with the torpedo of brilliant description the englishmans attempt to compare the fusillade which greeted the panther to the continuous drumming of a tenbarrelled nordenfeldt was however coldly received thus harshly is truth treated all the world over  and then after a little time came the end and a return to the road in search of new countries but shortly before the departure the padresahib who knows every one in udaipur read a sermon in a sentence the maharanas investiture which has already been described in the indian papers had taken place and the carriages duly escorted by the erinpura horse were returning to the residency in a niche of waste land under the shadow of the main gate a place strewn with rubbish and shards of pottery a dilapidated old man was trying to control his horse and a hookah on the saddlebow the blundering garron had been made restive by the rush past and the hookah all but fell from the hampered hands see that man said the padre tersely thats  singh he intrigued for the throne not so very long ago it was a pitiful little picture and needed no further comment  for the benefit of the loafer it should be noted that udaipur will never be pleasant or accessible until the present mail contractors have been hanged they are extortionate and untruthful and their one set of harness and one tonga are as rotten as pears however the weariness of the flesh must be great indeed to make the wanderer blind to the beauties of a journey by clear starlight and in biting cold to chitor about six miles from udaipur the granite hills close in upon the road and the air grows warmer until with a rush and a rattle the tonga swings through the great dobarra the gate in the double circle of hills round udaipur on to the pastures of mewar more than once the girwa has been a deathtrap to those who rashly entered it and an army has been cut up on the borders of the pichola lake even now the genius of the place is strong upon the hills and as he felt the cold air from the open ground without the barrier the englishman found himself repeating the words of one of the hatmarked tribe whose destiny kept him within the dobarra you must have a hobby of some kind in these parts or youll die very lovely is udaipur and thrice pleasant are a few days spent within her gates but  read what tod said who stayed two years behind the dobarra and accepted the deserts of marwar as a delightful change  it is good to be free a wanderer upon the highways knowing not what tomorrow will bring forthwhether the walledin niceties of an english household rich in all that makes life fair and desirable or a sleepless night in the society of a goodscumbookingofficecumparcelsclerk on fifteen rupees a month who tells in stilted english the story of his official life while the telegraph gibbers like a maniac once in an hour and then is dumb and the pariahdogs fight and howl over the cottonbales on the platform  verily there is no life like life on the roadwhen the skies are cool and all men are kind     x  a little of the history of chitor and the malpractices of a sheelephant   there is a certain want of taste an almost actual indecency in seeing the sun rise on the earth until the heathaze begins and the distances thicken nature is so very naked that the actæon who has surprised her dressing blushes sunrise on the plains of mewar is an especially brutal affair  the moon was burnt out and the air was bitterly cold when the englishman headed due east in his tonga and the patient sowar behind nodded and yawned in the saddle there was no warning of the days advent the horses were unharnessed at one haltingstage in the thick soft shadows of night and ere their successors had limped under the bar a raw and cruel light was upon all things so that the englishman could see every rent seam in the rocks around a little further and he came upon the black bulk of chitor between him and the morning sun it has already been said that the fort resembles a manofwar every distant view heightens this impression for the swell of the sides follows the form of a ship and the bastions on the south wall make the sponsons in which the machineguns are mounted from bow to stern the thing more than three miles long is between three and five hundred feet high and from onehalf to onequarter of a mile broad have patience now to listen to a rough history of chitor  in the beginning no one knows clearly who scraped the hillsides of the hill rising out of the bare plain and made of it a place of strength it is written that eleven and a half centuries ago bappa rawul the demigod whose stature was twenty cubits whose loincloth was five hundred feet long and whose spear was beyond the power of mortal man to lift took chitor from man singh the mori prince and wrote the first chapter of the history of mewar which he received readymade from man singh who if the chronicles speak sooth was his uncle many and very marvellous legends cluster round the name of bappa rawul and he is said to have ended his days far away from india in khorasan where he married an unlimited number of the daughters of heth and was the father of all the nowshera pathans some who have wandered by the signposts of inscription into the fogs of old time aver that two centuries before bappa rawul took chitor the mori division of the pramar rajputs who are the ruling family of mewar had found a hold in bhilwara and for four centuries before that time had ruled in kathiawar and had royally sacked and slain and been sacked and slain in turn but these things are for the curious and the scholar and not for the reader who reads lightly nine princes succeeded bappa between 728 and 1068 ad and among these was one alluji who built a jain tower upon the brow of the hill for in those days though the sun was worshipped men were all jains  and here they lived and sallied into the plains and fought and increased the borders of their kingdom or were suddenly and stealthily murdered or stood shoulder to shoulder against the incursions of the devil men from the north in 1150 ad was born samar singh and he married into the family of prithi raj the last hindu emperor of delhi who was at feud in regard to a succession question with the prince of kanauj in the war that followed kanauj being hard pressed by prithi raj and samar singh called shahabuddin ghori to his aid at first samar singh and prithi raj broke the army of the northern somewhere in the lower punjab but two years later shahabuddin came again and after three days fighting on the banks of the kaggar slew samar singh captured and murdered prithi raj and sacked delhi and amber while samar singhs favourite queen became sati at chitor but another wife a princess of patun kept her life and when shahabuddin sent down kutbuddin to waste her lands led the rajput army in person from chitor and defeated kutbuddin  then followed confusion through eleven turbulent reigns that the annalist has failed to unravel once in the years between 1193 and the opening of the fourteenth century chitor must have been taken by the mussulman for it is written that one prince recovered chitor and made the name of rana to be recognised by all six princes were slain in battles against the mussulman in vain attempts to clear the land from the presence of the infidel  then alauddin khilji the pathan emperor swept the country to the dekkan in those days and these things are confusedly set down as having happened at the end of the thirteenth century a relative of rana lakhsman singh the then rana of chitor had married a rajput princess of ceylonpudmini and she was fairest of all flesh on earth her fame was sung through the land by the poets and she became in some sort the helen of chitor alauddin heard of her beauty and promptly besieged the fort when he found his enterprise too difficult he prayed that he might be permitted to see pudminis face in a mirror and this wish so says the tale was granted knowing that the rajput was a gentleman he entered chitor almost unarmed saw the face in the mirror and was well treated the husband of the fair pudmini accompanying him in return to the camp at the foot of the hill like raja runjeet in the ballad the rajput he       trusted a mussulmans word       wah wah trust a liar to lie     out of his eyrie they tempted my bird       fettered his wings that he could not fly  pudminis husband was caught by a trick and alauddin demanded pudmini as the price of his return the rajputs here showed that they too could scheme and sent in great state pudminis litter to the besiegers intrenchments but there was no pudmini in the litter and her following of handmaidens was a band of seven hundred armed men thus in the confusion of a campfight pudminis husband was rescued and alauddins soldiery followed hard on his heels to the gates of chitor where the best and bravest on the rock were killed before alauddin withdrew only to return soon after and with a doubled army besiege in earnest his first attack men called the halfsack of chitor for though he failed to win within the walls he killed the flower of the rajputs the second attack ended in the first sack and the awful sati of the women on the rock  when everything was hopeless and the very terrible goddess who lives in the bowels of chitor had spoken and claimed for death eleven out of the twelve of the ranas sons all who were young or fair women betook themselves to a great underground chamber and the fires were lit and the entrance was walled up and they died the rajputs opened the gates and fought till they could fight no more and alauddin the victorious entered a wasted and desolated city he wrecked everything except only the palace of pudmini and the old jain tower before mentioned that was all he could do for there were few men alive of the defenders of chitor when the day was won and the women were ashes underground  ajai singh the one surviving son of lakshman singh had at his fathers insistence escaped from chitor to carry on the line when better days should come he brought up hamir son of one of his elder brothers to be a thorn in the side of the invader and hamir overthrew maldeo chief of jhalore and vassal of alauddin into whose hands alauddin had not too generously given what was left of chitor so the sesodias came to their own again and the successors of hamir extended their kingdoms and rebuilt chitor as kings know how to rebuild cities in a land where human labour and life are cheaper than bread and water for two centuries saith tod mewar flourished exceedingly and was the paramount kingdom of all rajasthan greatest of all the successors of hamir was kumbha rana who when the ghilzai dynasty was rotting away and viceroys declared themselves kings met defeated took captive and released without ransom mahmoud of malwa kumbha rana built a tower of victory nine stories high to commemorate this and the other successes of his reign and the tower stands today a mark for miles across the plains  but the wellestablished kingdom weakened and the rulers took favourites and disgusted their best supportersafter the immemorial custom of too prosperous rulers also they murdered one another in 1535 ad bahadur shah king of gujarat seeing the decay and remembering how one of his predecessors together with mahmoud of malwa had been humbled by mewar in years gone by set out to take his revenge of time and mewar then ruled by rana bikrmajit who had made a new capital at deola bikrmajit did not stay to give battle in that place his chiefs were out of hand and chitor was the heart and brain of mewar so he marched thither and the gods were against him bahadur shah mined one of the chitor bastions and wiped out in the explosion the hara prince of boondee with five hundred followers jowahir bae bikrmajits mother headed a sally from the walls and was slain there were frank gunners among bahadur shahs forces and they hastened the end the rajputs made a second johur a sacrifice greater than the sacrifice of pudmini and thirteen thousand were blown up in the magazines or stabbed or poisoned before the gates were opened and the defenders rushed down  out of the carnage was saved udai singh a babe of the blood royal who grew up to be a coward and a shame to his line the story of his preservation is written large in tod and edwin arnold sings it read it who are interested but when udai singh came to the throne of chitor through blood and misrule after bahadur shah had withdrawn from the wreck of the fort akbar sat on the throne of delhi and it was written that few people should withstand the guardian of mankind moreover udai singh was the slave of a woman it was akbars destiny to subdue the rajputs and to win many of them to his own service sending a rajput prince of amber to get him faraway arrakan akbar marched against chitor once and was repulsed the woman who ruled udai singh heading a charge against the besiegers because of the love she bore to her lover something of this sort had happened in alauddins time and like alauddin akbar returned and sat down in a huge camp before chitor in 1568 ad udai singh fled what was coming and because the goddess of chitor demands always that a crowned head must fall if the defence of her home is to be successful chitor fell as it had fallen beforein a johur of thousands a last rush of the men and the entry of the conqueror into a reeking ruined slaughterpen akbars sack was the most terrible of the three for he killed everything that had life upon the rock and wrecked and overturned and spoiled the wonder the lasting wonder is that he did not destroy kumbha ranas tower of victory the memorial of the defeat of a mahometan prince with the third sack the glory of chitor departed and udai singh founded himself a new capital the city of udaipur though chitor was recovered in jehangirs time by udai singhs grandson it was never again made the capital of mewar it stood and rotted where it stood till enlightened and loyal feudatories in the present years of grace made attempts with the help of executive engineers to sweep it up and keep it in repair the above is roughly very roughly indeed the tale of the sacks of chitor  follows an interlude for the study even of inaccurate history is indigestible to many there was an elephant at chitor to take birds of passage up the hill and sheshe was fiftyone years old and her name was gerowliacame to the dakbungalow for the englishman let not the word dakbungalow deceive any man into believing that there is even moderate comfort at chitor gerowlia waited in the sunshine and chuckled to herself like a female pauper when she receives snuff her mahout said that he would go away for a drink of water so he walked and walked and walked till he disappeared on the stonestrewn plains and the englishman was left alone with gerowlia aged fiftyone she had been tied by the chain on her near hind leg to a pillar of the verandah but the string was coir and more an emblem of authority than a means of restraint when she had thoroughly exhausted all the resources of the country within range of her trunk she ate up the string and began to investigate the verandah there was more coir string and she ate it all while the carpenter who was repairing the dakbungalow cursed her and her ancestry from afar about this time the englishman was roused to a knowledge of the business for gerowlia having exhausted the string tried to come into the verandah she had most unwisely been pampered with biscuits an hour before the carpenter stood on an outcrop of rock and said angrily see what damage your hathi has done sahib tisnt my hathi said the sahib plaintively you ordered it quoth he and it has been here ever so long eating up everything he threw pieces of stone at gerowlia and went away it is a terrible thing to be left alone with an unshackled elephant even though she be a venerable spinster gerowlia moved round the dakbungalow blowing her nose in a nervous and undecided manner and presently found some more string and thatch which she ate this was too much the englishman went out and spoke to her she opened her mouth and salaamed meaning thereby biscuits so long as she remained in this position she could do no harm  imagine a boundless rockstrewn plain broken here and there by low hills dominated by the rock of chitor and bisected by a single metregauge railway track running into the infinite and unrelieved by even a wayinspectors trolly in the foreground put a brandnew dakbungalow furnished with a french bedstead and nothing else in the verandah place an embarrassed englishman smiling into the open mouth of an idiotic female elephant but gerowlia could not live on smiles alone finding that no food was forthcoming she shut her mouth and renewed her attempts to get into the verandah and ate more thatch to say hi to an elephant is a misdirected courtesy it quickens the pace and if you flick her on the trunk with a wet towel she curls the trunk out of harms way special education is necessary a little breechless boy passed carrying a lump of stone hit her on the feet sahib said he hit her on the feet gerowlia had by this time nearly scraped off her pad and there were no signs of the mahout the englishman went out and found a tentpeg and returning in the extremity of his wrath smote her bitterly on the nails of the near forefoot  gerowlia held up her foot to be beaten and made the most absurd noisessquawked in fact exactly like an old lady who has narrowly escaped being run over she backed out of the verandah still squawking on three feet and in the open held up near and off forefoot alternately to be beaten it was very pitiful for one swing of her trunk could have knocked the englishman flat he ceased whacking her but she squawked for some minutes and then fell placidly asleep in the sunshine when the mahout returned he beat her for breaking her tether exactly as the englishman had done but much more severely and the ridiculous old thing hopped on three legs for fully five minutes come along sahib said the mahout i will show this mother of bastards who is the driver fat daughter of the devil sit down you would eat thatch would you how does the iron taste and he gave gerowlia a headache which affected her temper all through the afternoon she set off across the railway line which runs below the rock of chitor into broken ground cut up with nullahs and covered with low scrub over which it would have been difficult to have taken a surefooted horse so fragmentary and disconnected was its nature     xi  proves conclusively the existence of the dark tower visited by childe rolande and of bogey who frightens children   the gamberi riverclear as a troutstreamruns through the waste round chitor and is spanned by an old bridge very solid and massive said to have been built before the sack of alauddin the bridge is in the middle of the streamthe floods have raced round either end of itand is reached by a steeply sloping stone causeway from the bridge to the new town of chitor which lies at the foot of the hill runs a straight and wellkept road flanked on either side by the scattered remnants of old houses and here and there fallen temples the road like the bridge is no new thing and is wide enough for twenty horsemen to ride abreast  new chitor is a very dirty and apparently thriving little town full of grainmerchants and sellers of arms the ways are barely wide enough for the elephant of dignity and the little brown babies of impudence the englishman went through always on a slope painfully accentuated by gerowlia who with all possible respect to her years must have been a baggageanimal and no true sahibs mount let the local baedeker speak for a moment the ascent to chitor which begins from within the southeast angle of the town is nearly a mile to the upper gate with a slope of about 1 in 15 there are two zigzag bends and on the three portions thus formed are seven gates of which one however has only the basement left this is the language of fact which very properly leaves out of all account the genius of the place who sits at the gate nearest the new city and is with the sightseer throughout the first impression of repulsion and awe is given by a fragment of tumbled sculpture close to a red daubed lingam near the padal pol or lowest gate it is a piece of frieze and the figures of the men are worn nearly smooth by time what is visible is finely and frankly obscene to an english mind  the road is protected on the cliff side by a thick stone wall loopholed for musketry one aperture to every two feet between fifteen and twenty feet high this wall is being repaired throughout its length by the maharana of udaipur on the hillside among the boulders loose stones and dhakscrub lips stone wreckage that must have come down from the brown bastions above  as gerowlia laboured up the stoneshod slope the englishman wondered how much life had flowed down this sluice of battles and been lost at the padal polthe last and lowest gatewhere in the old days the besieging armies put their best and bravest battalions once at the head of the lower slope there is a clear rundown of a thousand yards with no chance of turning aside either to the right or left even as he wondered he was brought abreast of two stone chhatris each carrying a red daubed stone they were the graves of two very brave men jeemal of bedmore and kalla who fell in akbars sack fighting like rajputs read the story of their deaths and learn what manner of warriors they were their graves were all that spoke openly of the hundreds of struggles on the lower slope where the fight was always fiercest  at last after half an hours climb the main gate the ram pol was gained and the englishman passed into the city of chitor andthen and there formed a resolution since broken not to write one word about it for fear that he should be set down as a babbling and a gushing enthusiast objects of archæological interest are duly described in an admirable little book of chitor which after one look the englishman abandoned one cannot do chitor with a guidebook the chaplain of the english mission to jehangir said the best that was to be said when he described the place three hundred years ago writing quaintly chitor an ancient great kingdom the chief city so called which standeth on a mighty high hill flat on the top walled about at the least ten english miles there appear to this day above a hundred churches ruined and divers fair palaces which are lodged in like manner among their ruins as many englishmen by the observation have guessed its chief inhabitants today are zum and ohim birds and wild beasts but the stately ruins thereof give a shadow of its beauty while it flourished in its pride gerowlia struck into a narrow pathway forcing herself through gardentrees and disturbing the peacocks an evil guideman on the ground waved his hand and began to speak but was silenced the death of amber was as nothing to the death of chitora body whence the life had been driven by riot and the sword men had parcelled the gardens of her palaces and the courtyards of her temples into fields and cattle grazed among the remnants of the shattered tombs but over allover rent and bastion split templewall pierced roof and prone pillarlay the shadow of its beauty while it flourished in its pride the englishman walked into a stately palace of many rooms where the sunlight streamed in through wall and roof and up crazy stone stairways held together it seemed by the marauding trees in one bastion a windsown peepul had wrenched a thick slab clear of the wall but held it tight pressed in a crook of a branch as a man holds down a fallen enemy under his elbow shoulder and forearm in another place a strange uncanny wind sprung from nowhere was singing all alone among the pillars of what may have been a hall of audience the englishman wandered so far in one palace that he came to an almost blackdark room high up in a wall and said proudly to himself i must be the first man who has been here meaning no harm or insult to any one but he tripped and fell and as he put out his hands he felt that the stairs had been worn hollow and smooth by the thread of innumerable naked feet then he was afraid and came away very quickly stepping delicately over fallen friezes and bits of sculptured men so as not to offend the dead and was mightily relieved when he recovered his elephant and allowed the guide to take him to kumbha ranas tower of victory  this stands like all things in chitor among ruins but time and the other enemies have been good to it it is a jain edifice nine storeys high crowned atopwas this designed insult or undesigned repairwith a purely mahometan dome where the pigeons and the bats live excepting this blemish the tower of victory is nearly as fair as when it left the hands of the builder whose name has not been handed down to us it is to be observed here that the first or more ruined tower of victory built in allujis days when chitor was comparatively young was raised by some pious jain as proof of conquest over things spiritual the second tower is more worldly in intent  those who care to look may find elsewhere a definition of its architecture and its more striking peculiarities it was in kind but not in degree like the jugdesh temple at udaipur and as it exceeded it in magnificence so its effect upon the mind was more intense the confusing intricacy of the figures with which it was wreathed from top to bottom the recurrence of the one calm face the god enthroned holding the wheel of the law and the appalling lavishness of decoration all worked toward the instilment of fear and aversion  surely this must have been one of the objects of the architect the tower in the arrangement of its stairways is like the interior of a chinese carved ivory puzzleball the idea given is that even while you are ascending you are wrapping yourself deeper and deeper in the tangle of a mighty maze add to this the halflight the thronging armies of sculptured figures the mad profusion of design splashed as impartially upon the undersides of the stone windowslabs as upon the doorbeam of the thresholdadd most abhorrent of all the slippery sliminess of the walls always worn smooth by naked men and you will understand that the tower is not a soothing place to visit the englishman fancied presumptuously that he had in a way grasped the builders idea and when he came to the top storey and sat among the pigeons his theory was this to attain power wrote the builder of old in sentences of fine stone it is necessary to pass through all sorts of closepacked horrors treacheries battles and insults in darkness and without knowledge whether the road leads upward or into a hopeless culdesac kumbha rana must many times have climbed to the top storey and looked out toward the uplands of malwa on the one side and his own great mewar on the other in the days when all the rock hummed with life and the clatter of hooves upon the stony ways and mahmoud of malwa was safe in hold how he must have swelled with pridefine insolent pride of life and rule and powerpower not only to break things but to compel such builders as those who piled the tower to his royal will there was no decoration in the top storey to bewilder or amazenothing but wellgrooved stoneslabs and a boundless view fit for kings who traced their ancestry      from times when forth from the sunlight the first of our kings          came down     and had the earth for his footstool and wore the stars for his          crown  the builder had left no mark behind himnot even a mark on the threshold of the door or a sign in the head of the topmost step the englishman looked in both places believing that those were the places generally chosen for markcutting so he sat and meditated on the beauties of kingship and the unholiness of hindu art and what power a shadowland of lewd monstrosities had upon those who believed in it and what lord dufferin who is the nearest approach to a king in this india must have thought when aidedecamps clanked after him up the narrow steps but the day was wearing and he came downin both sensesand in his descent the carven things on every side of the tower and above and below once more took hold of and perverted his fancy so that he arrived at the bottom in a frame of mind eminently fitted for a descent into the gaumukh which is nothing more terrible than a little spring falling into a reservoir in the side of the hill  he stumbled across more ruins and passed between tombs of dead ranis till he came to a flight of steps built out and cut out from rock going down as far as he could see into a growth of trees on a terrace below him the stone of the steps had been worn and polished by the terrible naked feet till it showed its markings clearly as agate and where the steps ended in a rockslope there was a visible glair a great snailtrack upon the rocks it was hard to keep safe footing upon the sliminess the air was thick with the sick smell of stale incense and grains of rice were scattered upon the steps but there was no one to be seen now this in itself was not specially alarming but the genius of the place must be responsible for making it so the englishman slipped and bumped on the rocks and arrived more suddenly than he desired upon the edge of a dull blue tank sunk between walls of timeless masonry in a slabbedin recess water was pouring through a shapeless stone gargoyle into a trough which trough again dripped into the tank almost under the little trickle of water was the loathsome emblem of creation and there were flowers and rice around it water was trickling from a score of places in the cut face of the hill oozing between the edges of the steps and welling up between the stone slabs of the terrace trees sprouted in the sides of the tank and hid its surroundings it seemed as though the descent had led the englishman firstly two thousand years away from his own century and secondly into a trap and that he would fall off the polished stones into the stinking tank or that the gaumukh would continue to pour water until the tank rose up and swamped him or that some of the stone slabs would fall forward and crush him flat  then he was conscious of remembering with peculiar and unnecessary distinctness that from the gaumukh a passage led to the subterranean chambers in which the fair pudmini and her handmaids had slain themselves and that tod had written and the stationmaster at chitor had said that some sort of devil or ghoul or something stood at the entrance of that approach all of which was a nightmare bred in full day and folly to boot but it was the fault of the genius of the place who made the englishman feel that he had done a great wrong in trespassing into the very heart and soul of all chitor and behind him the gaumukh guggled and choked like a man in his deaththroe the englishman endured as long as he couldabout two minutes then it came upon him that he must go quickly out of this place of years and bloodmust get back to the afternoon sunshine and gerowlia and the dakbungalow with the french bedstead he desired no archæological information he wished to take no notes and above all he did not care to look behind him where stood the reminder that he was no better than the beasts that perish but he had to cross the smooth worn rocks and he felt their sliminess through his bootsoles it was as though he were treading on the soft oiled skin of a hindu as soon as the steps gave refuge he floundered up them and so came out of the gaumukh bedewed with that perspiration which follows alike on honest toil orchildish fear  this said he to himself is absurd and sat down on the fallen top of a temple to review the situation but the gaumukh had disappeared he could see the dip in the ground and the beginning of the steps but nothing more  perhaps it was absurd it undoubtedly appeared so later yet there was something uncanny about it all it was not exactly a feeling of danger or pain but an apprehension of great evil  in defence it may be urged that there is moral just as much as there is mine chokedamp if you get into a place laden with the latter you die and if into the home of the former you  behave unwisely as constitution and temperament prompt if any man doubt this let him sit for two hours in a hot sun on an elephant stay half an hour in the tower of victory and then go down into the gaumukh which it must never be forgotten is merely a set of springs three or four in number issuing from the cliff face at cowmouth carvings now mutilated the water evidently percolating from the hathi kund above falls first in an old pillared hall and thence into the masonry reservoir below eventually when abundant enough supplying a little waterfall lower down that gentlemen and ladies on the honour of one who has been frightened of the dark in broad daylight is the gaumukh as though photographed  the englishman regained gerowlia and demanded to be taken away but gerowlias driver went forward instead and showed him a new mahal just built by the present maharana carriage drives however do not consort well with chitor and the shadow of her ancient beauty the return journey past temple after temple and palace upon palace began in the failing light and gerowlia was still blundering up and down narrow bypathsfor she possessed all an old womans delusion as to the slimness of her waist when the twilight fell and the smoke from the town below began to creep up the brown flanks of chitor and the jackals howled then the sense of desolation which had been strong enough in all conscience in the sunshine began to grow and grow  near the ram pol there was some semblance of a town with living people in it and a priest sat in the middle of the road and howled aloud upon his gods until a little boy came and laughed in his face and he went away grumbling this touch was deeply refreshing in the contemplation of it the englishman clean forgot that he had overlooked the gathering in of materials for an elaborate statistical historical geographical account of chitor all that remained to him was a shuddering reminiscence of the gaumukh and two lines of the holy grail      and up into the sounding halls he passed     but nothing in the sounding halls he saw  post scriptumthere was something very uncanny about the genius of the place he dragged an easeloving egotist out of the french bedstead with the gilt knobs at head and foot into a more than usually big follynothing less than a seeing of chitor by moonlight there was no possibility of getting gerowlia out of her bed and a mistrust of the maharanas soldiery who in the daytime guarded the gates prompted the englishman to avoid the public way and scramble straight up the hillside along an attempt at a path which he had noted from gerowlias back there was no one to interfere and nothing but an infinity of pestilent nullahs and loose stones to check owls came out and hooted at him and animals ran about in the dark and made uncouth noises it was an idiotic journey and it endedoh horror in that unspeakable gaumukhthis time entered from the opposite or brushwooded side as far as could be made out in the dusk and from the chuckle of the water which by night was peculiarly malevolent  escaping from this place crabfashion the englishman crawled into chitor and sat upon a flat tomb till the moon a very inferior and secondhand one rose and turned the city of the dead into a city of scurrying ghoulsin sobriety jackals the ruins took strange shapes and shifted in the half light and cast objectionable shadows  it was easy enough to fill the rock with the people of old times and a very beautiful account of chitor restored made out by the help of tod and bristling with the names of the illustrious dead would undoubtedly have been written had not a woman a living breathing woman stolen out of a templewhat was she doing in that galleyand screamed in piercing and publicspirited fashion the englishman got off the tomb and departed rather more noisily than a jackal feeling for the moment that he was not much better somebody opened a door with a crash and a man cried out who is there but the cause of the disturbance was for his sins being most horribly scratched by some thorny scrub over the edge of the hillthere are no bastions worth speaking of near the gaumukhand the rest was partly rolling partly scrambling and mainly bad language  when you are too lucky sacrifice something a beloved pipe for choice to ganesh the englishman has seen chitor by moonlightnot the best moonlight truly but the watery glare of a nearly spent moonand his sacrifice to luck is this he will never try to describe what he has seenbut will keep it as a loveletter a thing for one pair of eyes onlya memory that few men today can be sharers in and does he through this fiction evade insulting by pen and ink a scene as lovely wild and unmatchable as any that mortal eyes have been privileged to rest upon  an intelligent and discriminating public are perfectly at liberty to form their own opinions     xii  contains the history of the bhumia of jhaswara and the record of a visit to the house of strange stories demonstrates the felicity of loaferdom which is the veritable companionship of the indian empire and proposes a scheme for the better officering of two departments   come away from the monstrous gloom of chitor and escape northwards the place is unclean and terrifying let us catch today by both hands and return to the stationmaster who is also bookingparcels and telegraphclerk and who never seems to go to bedand to the comfortably wadded bunks of the rajputanamalwa line  while the train is running be pleased to listen to the perfectly true story of the bhumia of jhaswara which is a story the sequel whereof has yet to be written once upon a time a rajput landholder a bhumia and a mahometan jaghirdar were nextdoor neighbours in ajmir territory they hated each other thoroughly for many reasons all connected with land and the jaghirdar was the bigger man of the two in those days it was the law that the victims of robbery or dacoity should be reimbursed by the owner of the lands on which the affair had taken place the ordinance is now swept away as impracticable there was a highway robbery on the bhumias holding and he vowed that it had been put up by the mahometan who he said was an ahab the reivegelt payable nearly ruined the rajput and he labouring under a galling grievance or a groundless suspicion fired the jaghirdars crops was detected and brought up before the english judge who gave him four years imprisonment to the sentence was appended a recommendation that on release the rajput should be put on heavy securities for good behaviour otherwise wrote the judge who seems to have known the people he was dealing with he will certainly kill the jaghirdar four years passed and the jaghirdar obtained wealth and consideration and was made let us say a khan bahadur and an honorary magistrate but the bhumia remained in gaol and thought over the highway robbery when the day of release came a new judge hunted up his predecessors finding and recommendation and would have put the bhumia on security sahib said the bhumia i have no people i have been in gaol what am i now and who will find security for me if you will send me back to gaol again i can do nothing and i have no friends so they released him and he went away into an outlying village and borrowed a sword from one house and had it sharpened in another for love two days later fell the birthday of the khan bahadur and the honorary magistrate and his friends and servants and dependants made a little levee and did him honour after the native custom the bhumia also attended the levee but no one knew him and he was stopped at the door of the courtyard by the servant say that the bhumia of jhaswara has come to pay his salaams said he they let him in and in the heart of ajmir city in broad daylight and before all the jaghirdars household he smote off his enemys head so that it rolled upon the ground then he fled and though they raised the countryside against him he was never caught and went into bikanir  five years later word came to ajmir that chimbo singh the bhumia of jhaswara had taken service under the thakur sahib of palitana the case was an old one and the chances of identification misty but the suspected was caught and brought in and one of the leading native barristers of the bombay bar was retained to defend him he said nothing and continued to say nothing and the case fell through he is believed to be wanted now for a fresh murder committed within the last few months out bikanir way  and now that the train has reached ajmir the crewe of rajputana whither shall a tramp turn his feet the englishman set his stick on end and it fell with its point northwest as nearly as might be this being translated meant jodhpur which is the city of the houyhnhnms if you would enjoy jodhpur thoroughly quit at ajmir the decent conventionalities of station life and make it your business to move among gentlemengentlemen in the ordnance or the commissariat or better still gentlemen on the railway at ajmir gentlemen will tell you what manner of place jodhpur is and their accounts though flavoured with oaths are amusing in their eyes the desert that rings the city has no charms and they discuss affairs of the state as they understand them in a manner that would curl the hair on a politicals august head jodhpur has been but things are rather better now a muchfavoured camping ground for the lightcavalry of the roadthe loafers with a certain amount of brain and great assurance the explanation is simple there are more than four hundred horses in his highnesss city stables alone and where the houyhnhnm is there also will be the yahoo this is sad but true  besides the uhlans who come and go on heaven knows what mysterious errands there are bagmen travelling for the big english firms jodhpur is a good customer and purchases all sorts of things more or less useful for the state or its friends these are the gentlemen to know if you would understand something of matters which are not written in reports  the englishman took a train from ajmir to marwar junction which is on the road to mount abu westward from ajmir and at five in the morning under pale moonlight was uncarted at the beginning of the jodhpur state railwayone of the quaintest little lines that ever ran a locomotive it is the maharajas very own and pays about ten per cent but its quaintness does not lie in these things it is worked with rude economy and started life by singularly and completely falsifying the government estimates for its construction an intelligent bureau asserted that it could not be laid down for less thanbut the error shall be glossed over it was laid down for a little more than seventeen thousand rupees a mile with the help of secondhand rails and sleepers and it is currently asserted that the stationmasters are flagmen pointsmen ticketcollectors and everything else except platforms and lamprooms as only two trains are run in the twentyfour hours this economy of staff does not matter the state line with the comparatively new branch to the pachpadra saltpits pays handsomely and is exactly suited to the needs of its users true there is a certain haziness as to the hour of starting but this allows laggards more time and fills the packed carriages to overflowing  from marwar junction to jodhpur the train leaves the aravalis and goes northwards into the region of death that lies beyond the luni river sand ak bushes and sandhills varied with occasional patches of unthrifty cultivation make up the scenery rain has been very scarce in marwar this year and the country consequently shows at its worst for almost every square mile of a kingdom nearly as large as scotland is dependent on the sky for its crops in a good season a large village can pay from seven to nine thousand rupees revenue without blenching in a bad one all the kings horses and all the kings men may think themselves lucky if they raise fifteen rupees from the same place the fluctuation is startling  from a countryside which to the uninitiated seems about as valuable as a stretch of west african beach the state gets a revenue of nearly forty lakhs and men who know the country vow that it has not been one tithe exploited and that there is more to be made from salt marble andcurious thing in this wildernessgood forest conservancy than an openhanded durbar dreams of an amiable weakness for unthinkingly giving away villages where ready cash failed has somewhat hampered the revenue in past years but nowand for this the maharaja deserves great creditjodhpur has a large and genuine surplus and a very compact little scheme of railway extension before turning to a consideration of the city of jodhpur hear a true story in connection with the hyderabadpachpadra project which those interested in the scheme may lay to heart  his state line his ownest own as has been said very much delighted the maharaja who in one or two points is not unlike sir theodore hope of sainted memory pleased with the toy he said effusively in words which may or may not have reached the ears of the hyderabadpachpadra people this is a good business if the government will give me independent jurisdiction ill make and open the line straight away from pachpadra to the end of my dominions ie all but to hyderabad  then up and spake an elder knight sat at the kings right knee who knew something about the railway map of india and the controlling power of strategical lines maharaja sahibhere is the indus valley state line and here is the bombaybaroda line where would you be by jove quoth the maharaja though he swore by quite another god i see and thus he abandoned the idea of a hyderabad line and turned his attention to an extension to nagore with a branch to the makrana marble quarries which are close to the sambhar salt lake near jeypore and in the fulness of time that extension will be made and perhaps extended to bahawalpur  the englishman came to jodhpur at midday in a hot fierce sunshine that struck back from the sands and the ledges of red rock as though it were may instead of december the line scorned such a thing as a regular ordained terminus the single track gradually melted away into the sands close to the station was a grim stone dakbungalow and in the verandah stood a brisk bagandflaskbegirdled individual cracking his joints with excess of irritation  nota benewhen one is on the road it is above all things necessary to pass the time o day to fellowwanderers failure to comply with this law implies that the offender is too good for his company and this on the road is the unpardonable sin the englishman passed the time o day in due and ample form ha ha said the gentleman with the bag isnt this a sweet place there aint no ticcagharies and there aint nothing to eat if you havent brought your vittles an they charge you threeeight for a bottle of whisky oh its a sweet place here he skipped about the verandah and puffed then turning upon the englishman he said fiercely what have you come here for now this was rude because the ordinary form of salutation on the road is usually and what are you for meaning what house do you represent the englishman answered dolefully that he was travelling for pleasure which simple explanation offended the little man with the courierbag he snapped his joints more excruciatingly than ever for pleasure my god for pleasure come here an wait five weeks for your money an mark what im tellin you now you dont get it then but peraps your ideas of pleasure is different from most peoples for pleasure yah he skipped across the sands toward the station for he was going back with the down train and vanished in a whirlwind of luggage and the fluttering of female skirts in jodhpur the women are baggage coolies a level drawling voice spoke from an inner room es a bit upset thats what e is i remember when i was at gworliorthe rest of the story was lost and the englishman set to work to discover the nakedness of the dakbungalow for reasons which do not concern the public it is made as bitterly uncomfortable as possible the food is infamous and the charges seem to be wilfully pitched about eighty per cent above the tariff so that some portion of the bill at least may be paid without bloodshed or the unseemly defilement of walls with the contents of drinking glasses this is shortsighted policy and it would perhaps be better to lower the prices and hide the tariff and put a guard about the house to prevent jackalmolested donkeys from stampeding into the verandahs but these be details jodhpur dakbungalow is a merry merry place and any writer in search of new ground to locate a madly improbable story in could not do better than study it diligently in front lies sand riddled with innumerable antholes and beyond the sand the red sandstone wall of the city and the mahometan buryingground that fringes it fragments of sandstone set on end mark the resting places of the faithful who are of no great account here above everything a mark for miles around towers the dunred pile of the fort which is also a palace this is set upon sandstone rock whose sharper features have been worn smooth by the wash of the windblown sand it is as monstrous as anything in dores illustrations of the contes drolatiques and wherever it wanders the eye comes back at last to its fantastic bulk there is no greenery on the rock nothing but fierce sunlight or black shadow a line of red hills forms the background of the city and this is as bare as the picked bones of camels that lie bleaching on the sand below  wherever the eye falls it sees a camel or a string of camelslean racerbuilt sowarri camels or heavy black shaghaired trading ships bent on their way to the railway station through the night the air is alive with the bubbling and howling of the brutes who assuredly must suffer from nightmare in the morning the chorus round the station is deafening  knowing what these camels meant but trusting nevertheless that the road would not be very bad the englishman went into the city left a wellkunkered road turned through a sandworn red sandstone gate and sank ankledeep in fine reddish white sand this was the main thoroughfare of the city two tame lynxes shared it with a donkey and the rest of the population seemed to have gone to bed in the hot weather between ten in the morning and four in the afternoon all jodhpur stays at home for fear of death by sunstroke and it is possible that the habit extends far into what is officially called the cold weather or perhaps being brought up among sands men do not care to tramp them for pleasure the city internally is a walled and secret place each courtyard being hidden from view by a red sandstone wall except in a few streets where the shops are poor and mean  in an old house now used for the storing of tents akbars mother lay two months before the guardian of mankind was born drawing breath for her flight to umarkot across the desert seeing this place the englishman thought of many things not worth the putting down on paper and went on till the sand grew deeper and deeper and a great camel heavily laden with stone came round a corner and nearly stepped on him as the evening fell the city woke up and the goats and the camels and the kine came in by hundreds and men said that wild pig which are strictly preserved by the princes for their own sport were in the habit of wandering about the roads now if they do this in the capital what damage must they not do to the crops in the district men said that they did a very great deal of damage and it was hard to keep their noses out of anything they took a fancy to on the evening of the englishmans visit the maharaja went out as is his laudable custom alone and unattended to a road actually in the city along which one specially big pig was in the habit of passing his highness got his game with a single shot behind the shoulder and in a few days it was pickled and sent off to the maharana of udaipur as a lovegift there is great friendship between jodhpur and udaipur and the idea of one king going abroad to shoot game for another has something very pretty and quaint in it  night fell and the englishman became aware that the conservancy of jodhpur might be vastly improved strong stenches say the doctors are of no importance but there came upon every breath of heated airand in jodhpur city the air is warm in midwinterthe faint sweet sickly reek that one has always been taught to consider specially deadly a few months ago there was an impressive outbreak of cholera in jodhpur and the residency doctor who really hoped that the people would be brought to see sense did his best to bring forward a general cleansingscheme but the city fathers would have none of it their fathers had been trying to poison themselves in welldefined ways for an indefinite number of years and they were not going to have any of the sahibs sweepernonsense  to clinch everything one travelled member of the community rose in his place and said why ive been to simla yes to simla and even i dont want it  when the black dusk had shut down the englishman climbed up a little hill and saw the stars come out and shine over the desert very far away some cameldrivers had lighted a fire and were singing as they sat by the side of their beasts sound travels as far over sand as over water and their voices came into the city wall and beat against it in multiplied echoes  then he returned to the house of strange storiesthe dakbungalowand passed the time o day with a lighthearted bagmana cockney in whose heart there was no thought of india though he had travelled for years throughout the length and breadth of the empire and over new burma as well there was a fort in jodhpur but you see that was not in his line of business exactly and there were stables but you may take my word for it them who has much to do with horses is a bad lot you get hold of the maharajas coachman and hell drive you all round the shop im only waiting here collecting money jodhpur dakbungalow seems to be full of men waiting here they lie in long chairs in the verandah and tell each other interminable stories or stare citywards and express their opinion of some dilatory debtor they are all waiting for something and they vary the monotony of a life they make wilfully dull beyond words by waging war with the dakbungalow khansama then they return to their long chairs or their couches and sleep some of them in old days used to wait as long as six weekssix weeks in may when the sixty miles from marwar junction to jodhpur was covered in three days by slowpacing bullock carts some of them are bagmen able to describe the demerits of every dakbungalow from the peshin to pagan and southward to hyderabadmen of substance who have the trades at their back it is a terrible thing to be in the trades that great doomsday book of calcutta in whose pages are written the names of doubtful clients let lighthearted purchasers take note  and the others who wait and swear and spit and exchange anecdoteswhat are they bummers landsharks skirmishers for their bread it would be cruel in a fellowtramp to call them loafers their lien upon the state may have its origin in horses or anything else for the state buys anything vendible from abdul rahmans most promising importations to a patent selfacting corkscrew they are a mixed crew but amusing and full of strange stories of adventure by land and sea and their ends are as curiously brutal as their lives a wanderer was once swept into the great still backwater that divides the loaferdom of upper indiathat is to say calcutta and bombayfrom the northgoing current of madras where nym and pistol are highly finished articles with certificates of education this backwater is a dangerous place to break down in as the men on the road know well you can run rajputana in a pair o sack breeches an an old hat but go to central injia with money says the wisdom of the road so the waif died in the bazaar and the barrackmaster sahib gave orders for his burial it might have been the bazaar sergeant or it might have been an hireling who was charged with the disposal of the body at any rate it was an irishman who said to the barrackmaster sahib fwhat about that loafer well whats the matter im considtherin whether im to mash in his thick head or to break his long legs he wont fit the storecoffin anyways  here the story ends it may be an old one but it struck the englishman as being rather unsympathetic in its nature and he has preserved it for this reason were the englishman a mere secretary of state instead of an enviable and unshackled vagabond he would remodel that philanthropic institution of teaching young subalterns how to spellvariously called the intelligence and the political departmentand giving each boy the pair of sack breeches and old hat above prescribed would send him out for a twelvemonth on the road not that he might learn to swear australian oaths which are superior to any ones in the market or to drink bazaardrinks which are very bad indeed but in order that he might gain an insight into the tertiary politics of statesthings less imposing than successioncases and less wearisome than boundary disputes but very well worth knowing  a small volume might be written of the ways and the tales of indian loafers of the more brilliant ordersuch chevaliers of the order of industry as would throw their glasses in your face did you call them loafers they are a genial blasphemous blustering crew and preëminent even in a land of liars     xiii  a kings house and country further consideration of the hatmarked caste   the hospitality that spreads tables in the wilderness and shifts the stranger from the back of the hired camel into a twohorse victoria must be experienced to be appreciated  to those unacquainted with the peculiarities of the nativetrained horse this advice may be worth something sit as far back as ever you can and if oriental courtesy have put an english bit and bridoon in a mouth by education intended for a spiked curb leave the whole contraption alone once acquainted with the comparative smoothness of english ironmongery your mount will grow frivolous in which event a fourpound steeplechase saddle accepted through sheer shame offers the very smallest amount of purchase to untrained legs  the englishman rode up to the fort and by the way learnt all these things and many more he was provided with a racking female horse who swept the gullies of the city by dancing sideways  the road to the fort which stands on the hill of strife wound in and out of sixtyfoot hills with a skilful avoidance of all shade and this was at high noon when puffs of heated air blew from the rocks on all sides what must the heat be in may the englishmans companion was a cheery brahmin who wore the lightest of turbans and sat the smallest of neat little countrybreds awful said the brahmin but not so bad as in the district look there and he pointed from the brow of a bad eminence across the quivering heathaze to where the white sand faded into bleach blue sky and the horizon was shaken and tremulous its very bad in summer would knock youoh yesall to smash but we are accustomed to it a rockstrewn hill about half a mile as the crow flies from the fort was pointed out as the place whence at the beginning of this century the pretender sowae besieged raja maun for five months but could make no headway against his foe one gun of the enemys batteries specially galled the fort and the jodhpur king offered a village to any of his gunners who should dismount it it was smashed said the brahmin oh yes all to pieces practically the city which lies below the fort is indefensible and during the many wars of marwar has generally been taken up by the assailants without resistance  entering the fort by the jeypore gate and studiously refraining from opening his umbrella the englishman found shadow and coolth took off his hat to the tunbellied trunknosed god of goodluck who had been very kind to him in his wanderings and sat down near half a dozen of the maharajas guns bearing the mark a broome cossipore 1857 or g hutchinson cossipore 1838 now rock and masonry are so curiously blended in this great pile that he who walks through it loses sense of being among buildings it is as though he walked through mountaingorges the stonepaved inclined planes and the tunnellike passages driven under a hundred feet height of buildings increase this impression in many places the wall and rock runs up unbroken by any window for forty feet  it would be a weeks work to pick out even roughly the names of the dead who have added to the buildings or to describe the bewildering multiplicity of courts and ranges of rooms and in the end the result would be as satisfactory as an attempt to describe a nightmare it is said that the rock on which the fort stands is four miles in circuit but no man yet has dared to estimate the size of the city that they call the palace or the mileage of its ways ever since ras joda four hundred years ago listened to the voice of a jogi and leaving mundore built his eyrie on the birds nest as the hill of strife was called the palaces have grown and thickened even today the builders are still at work takht singh the present rulers predecessor built royally an incomplete bastion and a hall of flowers are among the works of his pleasure hidden away behind a mighty wing of carved red sandstone lie rooms set apart for viceroys durbar halls and dinnerrooms without end a gentle gloom covers the evidences of the catholic taste of the state in articles of bigotry and virtue but there is enough light to show the raison dêtre of the men who wait in the dakbungalow and after all what is the use of royalty in these days if a man may not take delight in the pride of the eye kumbha rana the great man of chitor fought like a rajput but he had an instinct which made him build the tower of victory at who knows what cost of money and life the fightinginstinct thrown back upon itself must have some sort of outlet and a merciful providence wisely ordains that the kings of the east in the nineteenth century shall take pleasure in shopping on an imperial scale dresden china snuffboxes mechanical engines electroplated fishslicers musical boxes and gilt blownglass christmastree balls do not go well with the splendours of a palace that might have been built by titans and coloured by the morning sun but there are excuses to be made for kings who have no fighting to do  in one of the higher bastions stands a curious specimen of one of the earliest mitrailleusesa cumbrous machine carrying twenty gunbarrels in two rows which smallarm fire is flanked by two tiny cannon as a muzzleloading implement its value after the first discharge would be insignificant but the soldiers lounging by assured the englishman that it had done good service in its time  a man may spend a long hour in the upper tiers of the palaces but still far from the rooftops in looking out across the desert there are englishmen in these wastes who say gravely that there is nothing so fascinating as the sand of bikanir and marwar you see explained an enthusiast of the hatmarked caste you are not shut in by roads and you can go just as you please and somehow it grows upon you as you get used to it and you end yknow by falling in love with the place look steadily from the palace westward where the city with its tanks and serais is spread at your feet and you will in a lame way begin to understand the fascination of the desert which by those who have felt it is said to be even stronger than the fascination of the road the city is of red sandstone and dull and sombre to look at beyond it where the white sand lies the country is dotted with camels limping into the eiwigkeit or coming from the same place trees appear to be strictly confined to the suburbs of the city very good if you look long enough across the sands while a voice in your ear is telling you of halfburied cities old as old time and wholly unvisited by sahibs of districts where the white man is unknown and of the wonders of faraway jeysulmir ruled by a halfdistraught king sandlocked and now smitten by a terrible food and water famine you will if it happen that you are of a sedentary and civilised nature experience a new emotionwill be conscious of a great desire to take one of the lobbing camels and get away into the desert away from the last touch of today to meet the past face to face some day a novelist will exploit the unknown land from the rann where the wild ass breeds northward and eastward till he comes to the indus  but the officials of marwar do not call their country a desert on the contrary they administer it very scientifically and raise as has been said about thirtyeight lakhs from it to come back from the influence and the possible use of the desert to more prosaic facts read quickly a rough record of things in modern marwar the old is drawn in tod who speaks the truth the maharajas right hand in the work of the state is maharaj sir pertab singh prime minister adc to the prince of wales capable of managing the marwari who intrigues like amarwari equally capable as has been seen of moving in london society and colonel of a newly raised crack cavalry corps the englishman would have liked to have seen him but he was away in the desert somewhere either marking a boundary or looking after a succession case not very long ago as the setts of ajmir knew well there was a state debt of fifty lakhs this has now been changed into a surplus of three lakhs and the revenue is growing also the simple dacoit who used to enjoy himself very pleasantly has been put into a department and the thug with him  consequently for the department takes a genuine interest in this form of shikar and the gaol legirons are not too light dacoities have been reduced to such an extent that men say you may send a woman with her ornaments upon her from sojat to phalodi and she will not lose a nosering again and this in a rajput state is an important matter the boundaries of nearly every village in marwar have been demarcated and boundary fights in which both sides preferred smallarm fire to the regulation club are unknown the openhanded system of giving away villages had raised a large and unmannerly crop of jaghirdars these have been taken up and brought in hand by sir pertab singh to the better order of the state  a punjabi sirdar har dyal singh has reformed or made rather courts on the civil and criminal side and his hand is said to be found in a good many sweepings out of old corners it must always be borne in mind that everything that has been done was carried through over and under unlimited intrigue for jodhpur is a native state intrigue must be met with intrigue by all except gordons or demigods and it is curious to hear how a reduction in tariff or a smoothing out of some tangled court had to be worked by shift and byway the tales are comic but not for publication howbeit har dyal singh got his training in part under the punjab government and in part in a little native state far away in the himalayas where intrigue is not altogether unknown to the credit of the pauper province be it said it is not easy to circumvent a punjabi the details of his work would be dry reading the result of it is good and there is justice in marwar and order and firmness in its administration  naturally the landrevenue is the most interesting thing in marwar from an administrative point of view the basis of it is a tank about the size of a swimmingbath with a catchment of several hundred square yards draining through leeped channels when god sends the rain the people of the village drink from the tank when the rains fail as they failed this year they take to their wells which are brackish and breed guineaworm for these reasons the revenue like the republic of san domingo is never alike for two years running there are no canal questions to harry the authorities but the fluctuations are enormous under the aravalis the soil is good further north they grow millet and pasture cattle though said a revenue officer cheerfully god knows what the brutes find to eat apropos of irrigation the one canal deserves special mention as showing how george stephenson came to jodhpur and astonished the inhabitants six miles from the city proper lies the balsaman sagar a great tank in the hot weather when the city tanks ran out or stank it was the pleasant duty of the women to tramp twelve miles at the end of the days work to fill their lotahs in the hot weather jodhpur islet a simile suffice sukkur in june would be simla to jodhpur  the state engineer who is also the jodhpur state line for he has no european subordinates conceived the idea of bringing the water from the balsaman into the city was the city grateful not in the least it is said that the sahib wanted the water to run uphill and was throwing money into the tank being true marwaris men betted on the subject the canala built out one for water must not touch earth in these partswas made at a cost of something over a lakh and the water came down because its source was a trifle higher than the city now in the hot weather the women need not go for long walks but the marwari cannot understand how it was that the waters came down to jodhpur from the marwari to money matters is an easy step formerly that is to say up to within a very short time the treasury of jodhpur was conducted in a shiftless happygolucky sort of fashion not uncommon in native states whereby the mahajuns held the bag and made unholy profits on discount and other things to the confusion of the durbar funds and their own enrichment there is now a treasury modelled on english lines and english in the important particular that money is not to be got from it for the asking and the items of expenditure are strictly looked after  in the middle of all this bustle of reform planned achieved frustrated and replanned and the neverending underground warfare that surges in a native state move the english officersthe irreducible minimum of exiles as a caste the working englishmen in native states are curiously interesting and the traveller whose tact by this time has been blunted by tramping sits in judgment upon them as he has seen them in the first place they are they must be the fittest who have survived for though here and there you shall find one chafing bitterly against the burden of his life in the wilderness one to be pitied more than any chained beast the bulk of the caste are honestly and unaffectedly fond of their work fond of the country around them and fond of the people they deal with in each state their answer to a question is the same the men with whom they are in contact are all right when you know them but youve got to know them first as the musichall song says their hands are full of work so full that when the incult wanderer said what do you find to do they look upon him with contempt and amazement exactly as the wanderer himself had once looked upon a globetrotter who had put to him the same impertinent query andbut here the englishman may be wrongit seemed to him that in one respect their lives were a good deal more restful and concentrated than those of their brethren under the british government there was no talk of shiftings and transfers and promotions stretching across a province and a half and no man said anything about simla to one who has hitherto believed that simla is the hub of the empire it is disconcerting to hear oh simla thats where you bengalis go we havent anything to do with simla down here and no more they have their talk and their interests run in the boundaries of the states they serve and most striking of all the gossipy element seems to be cut altogether it is a backwater of the river of angloindian lifeor is it the main current the broad stream that supplies the motive power and is the other life only the noisy ripple on the surface you who have lived not merely looked at both lives decide much can be learnt from the talk of the caste many curious many amusing and some startling things one hears stories of men who take a poor impoverished state as a man takes a wife for better or worse and moved by some incomprehensible ideal of virtue consecratethat is not too big a wordconsecrate their lives to that state in all singleheartedness and purity such men are few but they exist today and their names are great in lands where no englishman travels again the listener hears tales of grizzled diplomats of rajputanamachiavellis who have hoisted a powerful intriguer with his own intrigue and bested priestly cunning and the guile of the oswal simply that the way might be clear for some scheme which should put money into a tottering treasury or lighten the taxation of a few hundred thousand menor both for this can be done one tithe of that force spent on their own personal advancement would have carried such men very far  truly the hatmarked caste are a strange people they are so few and so lonely and so strong they can sit down in one place for years and see the works of their hands and the promptings of their brain grow to actual and beneficent life bringing good to thousands less fettered than the direct servant of the indian government and working over a much vaster charge they seem a bigger and a more largeminded breed and that is saying a good deal  but let the others the little people bound down and supervised and strictly limited and incometaxed always remember that the hatmarked are very badly off for shops if they want a necktie they must get it up from bombay and in the rains they can hardly move about and they have no amusements and must go a days railway journey for a rubber and their drinkingwater is doubtful and there is less than one white woman per ten thousand square miles  after all comparative civilisation has its advantages     xiv  among the houyhnhnms   jodhpur differs from the other states of rajputana in that its royalty are peculiarly accessible to an inquiring public there are wanderers the desire of whose life it is to see nabobs which is the globetrotters title for any one in unusually clean clothes or an oudh taluqdar in gala dress men asked in jodhpur whether the englishman would like to see his highness the englishman had a great desire to do so if his highness would be in no way inconvenienced then they scoffed oh he wont durbar you you neednt flatter yourself if hes in the humour hell receive you like an english countrygentleman how in the world could the owner of such a place as jodhpur palace be in any way like an english countrygentleman the englishman had not long to wait in doubt his highness intimated his readiness to see the englishman between eight and nine in the morning at the raikabagh the raikabagh is not a palace for the lower storey and all the detached buildings round it are filled with horses nor can it in any way be called a stable because the upper storey contains sumptuous apartments full of all manner of valuables both of the east and the west nor is it in any sense a pleasuregarden for it stands on soft white sand close to a multitude of litter and sand training tracks and is devoid of trees for the most part therefore the raikabagh is simply the raikabagh and nothing else it is now the chosen residence of the maharaja who loves to live among his four hundred or more horses all jodhpur is horsemad by the way and it behoves any one who wishes to be any one to keep his own racecourse the englishman went to the raikabagh which stands half a mile or so from the city and passing through a long room filled with saddles by the dozen bridles by the score and bits by the hundred was aware of a very small and lively little cherub on the roof of a gardenhouse he was carefully muffled for the morning was chill good morning he cried cheerfully in english waving a mittened hand are you going to see my faver and the horses it was the maharaja kanwar the crown prince the apple of the maharajas eye and one of the quaintest little bodies that ever set an englishman disrespectfully laughing he studies english daily with one of the english officials of the state and stands a very good chance of being thoroughly spoiled for he is a general pet as befits his dignity he has his own carriage or carriages his own twelvehand stable his own house and retinue  a few steps further on in a little enclosure in front of a small twostoried white bungalow sat his highness the maharaja deep in discussion with the state engineer he wore an english ulster and within ten paces of him was the first of a long range of stalls there was an informality of procedure about jodhpur which after the strained etiquette of other states was very refreshing the state engineer who has a growing line to attend to cantered away and his highness after a few introductory words knowing what the englishman would be after said come along and look at the horses other formality there was absolutely none even the indispensable knot of hangerson stood at a distance and behind a paling in this most rustic country residence a wellbred foxterrier took command of the proceedings after the manner of dogs the world over and the maharaja led to the horseboxes but a man turned up bending under the weight of much bacon oh heres the pig i shot for udaipur last night you see that is the best piece its pickled and thats what makes it yellow to look at he patted the great side that was held up there will be a camel sowar to meet it half way to udaipur and i hope udaipur will be pleased with it it was a very big pig and where did you shoot it maharaja sahib here said his highness smiting himself high up under the armpit where else would you have it certainly this descendant of raja maun was more like an english countrygentleman than the englishman in his ignorance had deemed possible he led on from horsebox to horsebox the terrier at his heels pointing out each horse of note and jodhpur has many theres raja twice winner of the civil service cup the englishman looked reverently and raja rewarded his curiosity with a vicious snap for he was being dressed over and his temper was out of joint close to him stood autocrat the grey with the nutmeg marks on the offshoulder a picture of a horse also disturbed in his mind next to him was a chestnut arab a hopeless cripple for one of his knees had been smashed and the leg was doubled up under him it was turquoise who six or eight years ago rewarded good feeding by getting away from his groom falling down and ruining himself but who none the less has lived an honoured pensioner on the maharajas bounty ever since no horses are shot in the jodhpur stables and when one diesthey have lost not more than twentyfive in six yearshis funeral is an event he is wrapped in a white sheet which is strewn with flowers and amid the weeping of the saises is borne away to the burial ground  after doing the honours for nearly half an hour the maharaja departed and as the englishman has not seen more than forty horses he felt justified in demanding more and he got them eclipse and young revenge were out downcountry but sherwood at the stud shere ali conqueror tynedale sherwood ii a maiden of abdul rahmans and many others of note were in and were brought out among the veterans a wrathful rampant red horse still came brian boru whose name has been written large in the chronicles of the indian turf jerking his sais across the road his nearfore is altogether gone but as a pensioner he condescends to go in harness and is then said to be a handful he certainly looks it  at the two hundred and fiftyseventh horse and perhaps the twentieth block of stables the englishmans brain began to reel and he demanded rest and information on a certain point he had gone into some fifty stalls and looked into all the rest and in the looking had searchingly sniffed but as truly as he was then standing far below brian borus bony withers never the ghost of a stench had polluted the keen morning air the city of the houyhnhnms was specklessly cleancleaner than any stable racing or private that he had been into how was it done the pure white sand accounted for a good deal and the rest was explained by one of the masters of horse each horse has one sais at leastold ringwood has fourand we make em work if we didnt wed be mucked up to the horses bellies in no time everything is cleaned off at once and whenever the sands tainted its renewed theres quite enough sand you see hereabouts of course we cant keep their coats so good as in other stables by reason of the rolling but we can keep em pretty clean  to the eye of one who knew less than nothing about horseflesh this immaculate purity was very striking and quite as impressive was the condition of the horses which was englishquite english naturally none of them were in any sort of training beyond daily exercise but they were fit and in such thoroughly good fettle many of them were out on the various tracks and many were coming in roughly two hundred go out of a morning and it is to be feared learn from the heavy going of the jodhpur courses how to hang in their stride this is a matter for those who know but it struck the englishman that a good deal of the unsatisfactory performances of the jodhpur stables might be accounted for by their having lost their clean stride on the sand and having to pick it up gradually on the less holding downcountry coursesunfortunately when they were not doing training gallops but the real thing  it was pleasant to sit down and watch the rush of the horses through the great openinggates are not affectedgoing on to the countryside where they take the air here a boisterous unschooled arab shot out across the road and cried ha ha in the scriptural manner before trying to rid himself of the grinning black imp on his back behind him a cabulisurely all cabulis must have been born with pelhams in their mouthsbored sulkily across the road or threw himself across the path of a tall mildeyed kurnalbred youngster whose cocked ears and swinging head showed that though he was so sedate he was thoroughly taking in his surroundings and would very much like to know if there were anybody better than himself on the course that morning impetuous as a schoolboy and irresponsible as a monkey one of the princes polo ponies not above racing in his own set would answer the question by rioting past the pupil of parrott the monogram on his bodycloth flapping free in the wind and his head and hogged tail in the elements the youngster would swing himself round and polkamazurka for a few paces till his attention would be caught by some dainty child of the desert fresh from the bombay stables sweating at every sound backing and filling like a rudderless ship then thanking his stars that he was wiser than some people number 177 would lob on to the track and settle down to his spin like the gentleman he was elsewhere the eye fell upon a cloud of nameless ones purchases from abdul rahman whose worth will be proved next hot weather when they are seriously taken in handskirmishing over the face of the land and enjoying themselves immensely high above everything else like a collier among barges screaming shrilly a black flamboyant marwari stallion with a crest like the crest of a barb barrelbellied gooserumped and rivermaned pranced through the press while the slowpacing waler carriagehorses eyed him with deep disfavour and the maharaja kanwars tiny mount capered under his pink roman nose kicking up as much dust as the foxhall colt who had got on to a lovely patch of sand and was dancing a saraband in it in and out of the tangle going down to or coming back from the courses ran shuffled rocketed plunged sulked or stampeded countless horses of all kinds shapes and descriptionsso that the eye at last failed to see what they were and only retained a general impression of a whirl of bays greys iron greys and chestnuts with white stockings some as good as could be desired others average but not one distinctly bad  we have no downright bad uns in this stable whats the use said the master of horse calmly they are all good beasts and one with another must cost more than a thousand rupees each this years new ones bought from bombay and the pick of our own studs are a hundred strong about may be more yes they look all right enough but you can never know what they are going to turn out livestock is very uncertain and how are the stables managed how do you make room for the fresh stock something this way here are all the new ones and parrotts lot and the english colts that maharaja pertab singh brought out with him from home winterlake out o queens consort that chestnut is with the two white stockings youre looking at now well next hot weather we shall see what theyre made of and which is who theres so many that the trainer hardly knows em one from another till they begin to be a good deal forward those that havent got the pace or that the maharaja dont fancy theyre taken out and sold for what theyll bring the man who takes the horses out has a good job of it he comes back and says i sold such and such for so much and heres the money thats all well our rejections are worth having they have taken prizes at the poona horse show see for yourself is there one of those that you wouldnt be glad to take for a hack and look well after too only theyre no use to us and so out they go by the score weve got sixty ridingboys perhaps more and theyve got their work cut out to keep them all going what youve seen are only the stables weve got one stud at bellara eighty miles out and they come in sometimes in droves of three and four hundred from the stud they raise marwaris there too but thats entirely under native management weve got nothing to do with that the natives reckon a marwari the best countrybred you can lay hands on and some of them are beauties crests on em like the top of a wave well theres that stud and another stud and reckoning one with another i should say the maharaja has nearer twelve hundred than a thousand horses of his own for this place here two wagonloads of grass come in every day from marwar junction lord knows how many saddles and bridles weve got i never counted i suppose weve about forty carriages not counting the ones that get shabby and are stacked in places in the city as i suppose youve seen we take em out in the morning a regular string altogether brakes and all but the prettiest turnout we ever turned out was lady dufferins pony fourinhand walersthirteentwo the wheelers i think and thirteenone the leaders they took prizes in poona that was a pretty turnout the prettiest in india lady dufferin she drove it when the viceroy was down here last year there are bicycles and tricycles in the carriage department too i dont know how many but when the viceroys camp was held there was about one apiece for the gentlemen with remounts theyre somewhere about the place now if you want to see them how do we manage to keep the horses so quiet youll find some o the youngsters play the goat a good deal when they come out o stable but as you say theres no vice generally its this way we dont allow any currycombs if we did the saises would be wearing out their brushes on the combs its all elbowgrease here theyve got to go over the horses with their hands they must handle em and a native hes afraid of a horse now an english groom when a horse is doing the fool clips him over the head with a currycomb or punches him in the belly and that hurts the horses feelings a native he just stands back till the trouble is over he must handle the horse or hed get into trouble for not dressing him so it comes to all handling and no licking and thats why you wont get hold of a really vicious brute in these stables old ringwood he had four saises and he wanted em every one but the other horses have no more than one sais apiece the maharaja he keeps fourteen or fifteen horses for his own riding not that he cares to ride now but he likes to have his horses and no one else can touch em then theres the horses that he mounts his visitors on when they come for pigsticking and such like and then theres a lot of horses that go to maharaja pertab singhs new cavalry regiment so you see a horse can go through all three degrees sometimes before he gets sold and be a good horse at the end of it and i think thats about all  a cloud of youngsters sweating freely and ready for any mischief shot past on their way to breakfast and the conversation ended in a cloud of sand and the drumming of hurrying hooves  in the raikabagh are more racing cups than this memory holds the names of chiefest of all was the delhi assemblage cupthe imperial vase of solid gold won by crown prince the other pieces of plate were not so imposing but of all the crown jewels the most valuable appeared at the end of the inspection it was the small maharaja kanwar lolling in state in a huge barouchehis toes were at least two feet off the floorthat was taking him from his morning drive have you seen my horses said the maharaja kanwar the four twelvehand ponies had been duly looked over and the future ruler of jodhpur departed satisfied     xv  treats of the startling effect of a reduction in wages and the pleasures of loaferdom paints the state of the boondi road and the treachery of ganesh of situr   a twentyfive per cent reduction all roun an no certain leave when you wants it of course the best men goes somewhere else thats only natural and eres this sanguinary down mail astickin in the eye of the khundwa down i tell you sir injias a bad placea very bad place tisnt what it was when i came out one and thirty year ago an the drivers was getting their seven and eight undred rupees a month an was treated as men  the englishman was on his way to nasirabad and a gentleman in the railway was explaining to him the real reason of the decadence of the empire it was because the rajputanamalwa railway had cut all its employés twentyfive per cent it is ungenerous to judge a caste by a few samples but the englishman had on the road and elsewhere seen a good deal of gentlemen on the railway and they spend their pay in a manner that would do credit to an income of a thousand a month now they say that the twentyfive per cent reduction deprives them of all the pleasures of life so much the better if it makes them moderately economical in their expenditure revolving these things in his mind together with one or two stories of extravagances not quite fit for publication the englishman came to nasirabad before sunrise and there to an evillooking tonga quoth ram baksh proprietor driver sais and everything else calmly at this time of the year and having regard to the heat of the sun who wants a top to a tonga i have no top i have a top but it would take till twelve oclock to put it on and behold sahib padre martum sahib went in this tonga to deoli all the officer sahibs of deoli and nasirabad go in this tonga for shikar this is a shutintonga when church and army are brought against one argument is in vain but to take a soft officebred unfortunate into the wilderness upon a skeleton a diagram of a conveyance is brutality ram baksh did not see it and headed his two thirteenhand rats straight towards the morning sun along a beautiful military road we shall get to deoli in six hours said ram baksh the boastful and even as he spoke the spring of the tonga bar snapt mit a harplike melodious twang what does it matter said ram baksh has the sahib never seen a tongairon break before padre martum sahib and all the officer sahibs in deoli ram baksh said the englishman sternly i am not a padre sahib nor an officer sahib and if you say anything more about padre martum sahib or the officer in deoli i shall grow very angry ram baksh  humph said ram baksh i knew you were not a padre sahib the little mishap was patched up with string and the tonga went on merrily it is stevenson who says that the invitation to the road natures great morning song has not yet been properly understood or put to music the first note of it

are only a loafer in a flannel shirt bound if god pleases to little boondi somewhere beyond the faint hills beyond the plain  but there was alloy in this delight men had told the englishman darkly that boondi state had no love for englishmen that there was nowhere to stop and that no one would do anything for money love was out of the question further it was an acknowledged fact that there were no englishmen of any kind in boondi but the englishman trusted that ganesh would be good to him and that he would somehow or other fall upon his feet as he had fallen before the road from nasirabad to deoli being military in its nature is nearly as straight as a ruler and about as smooth here and there little rocky hills the last offshoots of the aravalis to the west break the ground but the bulk of it is fair and without pimples the deoli force are apparently so utterly irregular that they can do without a telegraph have their mails carried by runners and dispense with bridges over all the fiftysix miles that separate them from nasirabad however a man who goes shikarring for any length of time in one of ram bakshs tongas would soon learn to dispense with anything and everything all the sahibs use my tonga ive got eight of them and twenty pairs of horses said ram baksh they go as far as gangra where the tigers are for they are shutintongas now the englishman knew gangra slightly having seen it on the way to udaipur and it was as perverse and rocky a place as any man would desire to see he politely expressed doubt i tell you my tongas go anywhere said ram baksh testily a haywagonthey cut and stack their hay in these partsblocked the road ram baksh ran the tonga to one side into a rut fetched up on a treestump rebounded on to a rock and struck the road again observe said ram baksh but that is nothing you wait till we get on the boondi road and ill make you shake shake like a bottle is it very bad ive never been to boondi myself but i hear it is all rocksgreat rocks as big as this tonga but though he boasted himself and his horses nearly all the way he could not reach deoli in anything like the time he had set forth if i am not at boondi by four he had said at six in the morning let me go without my fee but by midday he was still far from deoli and boondi lay twentyeight miles beyond that station what can i do said he ive laid out lots of horsesany amount but the fact is ive never been to boondi i shant go there in the night ram bakshs lots of horses were three pair between nasirabad and deolithree pair of undersized ponies who did wonders at one place after he had quitted a cotton wagon a drove of gipsies and a man on horseback with his carbine across his saddlebow the englishman came to a stretch of road so utterly desolate that he said now i am clear of everybody who ever knew me this is the beginning of the waste into which the scapegoat was sent  from a bush by the roadside sprang up a fat man who cried aloud in english how does your honour do i met your honour in simla this year are you quite well yaas i am here your honour remembers me i am travelling yaas ha ha and he went on leaving his honour bemazed it was a babua simla babu of that there could be no doubt but who he was or what he was doing thirty miles from anywhere his honour could not make out the native moves about more than most folk except railway people imagine the big banking firms of upper india naturally keep in close touch with their great changehouses in ajmir despatching and receiving messengers regularly so it comes to pass that the necessitous circumstances of lieutenant mcrannamack of the tyneside tailtwisters quartered on the frontier are thoroughly known and discussed a thousand miles south of the cantonment where the lighthearted lieutenant goes to his moneylender  this is by the way let us return to the banks of the banas river where poor carey as tod calls him came when he was sickening for his last illness the banas is one of those streams which runs over golden sands with feet of silver but from the scarp of its banks deoli in the rains must be isolated ram baksh questioned hereon vowed that all the officer sahibs never dreamed of halting but went over in boats or on elephants according to ram baksh the men of deoli must be wonderful creatures they do nothing but use his tongas a break in some low hills gives on to the dead flat plain in which deoli stands you must stop here for the night said ram baksh i will not take my horses forward in the dark god knows where the dakbungalow is ive forgotten but any one of the officer sahibs in deoli will tell you  those in search of a new emotion would do well to run about an apparently empty cantonment in a disgraceful shootingtonga hunting for a place to sleep in chaprassis come out of back verandahs and are rude and regimental babus hop off godowns and are flippant while in the distance a sahib looks out of his room and eyes the dusty forlornhope with silent contempt it should be mentioned that the dust on the deoli road not only powders but masks the face and raiment of the passenger  next morning ram baksh was awake with the dawn and clamorous to go on to boondi ive sent a pair of horses big horses out there and the sais is a fool perhaps they will be lost i want to find them he dragged his unhappy passenger on the road once more and demanded of all who passed the dakbungalow which was the way to boondi observe said he there can be only one road and if i hit it we are all right and ill show you what the tonga can do amen said the englishman devoutly as the tonga jumped into and out of a larger hole without doubt this is the boondi road said ram baksh it is so bad  it has been before said that the boondi state has no great love for sahibs the state of the road proves it this said ram baksh tapping the wheel to see whether the last plunge had smashed a spoke is a very good road you wait till you see what is ahead and the funeral staggered onover irrigation cuts through buffalo wallows and dried pools stamped with the hundred feet of kine this by the way is the most cruel road of all up rough banks where the rock ledges peered out of the dust down steepcut dips ornamented with large stones and along twofeet deep ruts of the rains where the tonga went slantwise even to the verge of upsetting it was a royal roada native roada raj road of the roughest and through all its jolts and bangs and bumps and dips and heaves the eye of ram baksh rolled in its bloodshot socket seeking for the big horses he had so rashly sent into the wilderness the ponies that had done the last twenty miles into deoli were nearly used up and did their best to lie down in the dry beds of nullahs  a man came by on horseback his servant walking before with platter and mealbag have you seen any horses hereabouts cried ram baksh horses what the devil have i to do with your horses dyou think ive stolen them now this was decidedly a strange answer and showed the rudeness of the land an old woman under a tree cried out in a strange tongue and ran away it was a dreamlike experience this hunting for horses in a wilderness with neither house nor hut nor shed in sight if we keep to the road long enough we must find them look at the road this raj ought to be smitten with bullets ram baksh had been pitched forward nearly on the offponys rump and was in a very bad temper indeed the funeral found a housea house walled with thornsand near by were two big horses thirteentwo if an inch and harnessed quite regardless of expense  everything was repacked and rebound with triple ropes and the sahib was provided with an extra cushion but he had reached a sort of dreamsome nirvana having several times bitten his tongue through cut his boot against the wheeledge and twisted his legs into a trueloversknot there was no further sense of suffering in him he was even beginning to enjoy himself faintly and by gasps the road struck boldly into hills with all their teeth on edge that is to say their strata breaking across the road in little ripples the effect of this was amazing the tonga skipped merrily as a young fawn from ridge to ridge it shivered it palpitated it shook it slid it hopped it waltzed it ricochetted it bounded like a kangaroo it blundered like a sledge it swayed like a topheavy coach on a downgrade it kicked like a badly coupled railway carriage it squelched like a countrycart it squeaked in its torment and lastly it essayed to plough up the ground with its nose after three hours of this performance it struck a tiny little ford set between steeply sloping banks of white dust where the water was clear brown and full of fish and here a blissful halt was called under the shadow of the high bank of a tobacco field  would you taste one of the real pleasures of life go through severe acrobatic exercises in and about a tonga for four hours then having eaten and drank till you can no more sprawl in the cool of a nullah bed with your head among the green tobacco and your mind adrift with the one little cloud in a royally blue sky earth has nothing more to offer her children than this deep delight of animal wellbeing there were butterflies in the tobaccosix different kinds and a little rat came out and drank at the ford to him succeeded the flight into egypt the white banks of the ford framed the picture perfectlythe mother in blue on a great white donkey holding the child in her arms and joseph walking beside his hand upon the donkeys withers by all the laws of the east joseph should have been riding and the mother walking this was an exception decreed for the englishmans special benefit it was very warm and very pleasant and somehow the passers by the ford grew indistinct and the nullah became a big english garden with a cuckoo singing far down in the orchard among the appleblossoms the cuckoo started the dream he was the only real thing in it for on waking the garden slipped back into the water but the cuckoo remained and called and called for all the world as though he had been a veritable english cuckoo cuckoocuckoocuck then a pause and renewal of the cry from another quarter of the horizon after that the ford became distasteful so the procession was driven forward and in time plunged into what must have been a big city once but the only inhabitants were oilmen there were abundance of tombs here and one carried a lifelike carving in high relief of a man on horseback spearing a footsoldier hard by this place the road or rut turned by great gardens very cool and pleasant full of tombs and blackfaced monkeys who quarrelled among the tombs and shut in from the sun by gigantic banians and mango trees under the trees and behind the walls priests sat singing and the englishman would have inquired into what strange place he had fallen but the men did not understand him  ganesh is a mean little god of circumscribed powers he was dreaming with a red and flushed face under a banian tree and the englishman gave him four annas to arrange matters comfortably at boondi his priest took the four annas but ganesh did nothing whatever as shall be shown later his only excuse is that his trunk was a good deal worn and he would have been better for some more silver leaf but that was no fault of the englishman  beyond the dead city was a jhil full of snipe and duck winding in and out of the hills and beyond the jhil hidden altogether among the hills was boondi the nearer to the city the viler grew the road and the more overwhelming the curiosity of the inhabitants but what befel at boondi must be reserved for another chapter     xvi  the comedy of errors and the exploitation of boondi the castaway of the dispensary and the children of the schools a consideration of the shields of rajasthan and other trifles   it is high time that a new treaty were made with maha rao raja ram singh bahadur raja of boondi he keeps the third article of the old one too faithfully which says that he shall not enter into negotiations with any one without the consent of the british government he does not negotiate at all arrived at boondi gate the englishman asked where he might lay his head for the night and the quarter guard with one accord said the sukh mahal which is beyond the city and the tonga went thither through the length of the town till it arrived at a pavilion on a lakea place of two turrets connected by an open colonnade the house was open to the winds of heaven and the pigeons of the raj but the latter had polluted more than the first could purify a snowybearded chowkidar crawled out of a place of tombs which he seemed to share with some monkeys and threw himself into anglosaxon attitudes he was a great deal worse than ram baksh for he said that all the officer sahibs of deoli came to the sukh mahal for shikar andnever went away again so pleased were they the sahib had brought the honour of his presence and he was a very old man and without a written permit could do nothing then he fell deeply asleep without warning and there was a pause of one hour only which the englishman spent in seeing the lake it like the jhils on the road wound in and out among the hills and on the bund side was bounded by a hill of black rock crowned with a chhatri of grey stone below the bund was a garden as fair as eye could wish and the shores of the lake were dotted with little temples given a habitable housea mere dakbungalowit would be a delightful spot to rest in warned by some bitter experiences in the past the englishman knew that he was in for the demisemiroyal or embarrassing reception when a man being the unwelcome guest of a paternal state is neither allowed to pay his way and make himself comfortable nor is he willingly entertained when he saw a oneeyed munshi clerk he felt certain that ganesh had turned upon him at last the munshi demanded and received the purwana or written permit then he sat down and questioned the traveller exhaustively as to his character and profession having thoroughly satisfied himself that the visitor was in no way connected with the government or the agenty sahib bahadur he took no further thought of the matter and the day began to draw in upon a grassy bund an openwork pavilion and a disconsolate tonga  at last the faithful servitor who had helped to fight the battle of the mail bags at udaipur broke his silence and vowing that all these devilpeoplenot more than twelvehad only come to see the fun suggested the breaking of the munshis head and indeed that seemed the best way of breaking the ice for the munshi had in the politest possible language put forward the suggestion that there was nothing particular to show that the sahib who held the purwana had really any right to hold it the chowkidar woke up and chanted a weird chant accompanied by the anglosaxon attitudes a new set he was an old man and all the sahiblog said so and within the pavilion were tables and chairs and lamps and bathtubs and everything that the heart of man could desire even now an enormous staff of menials were arranging all these things for the comfort of the sahib bahadur and protector of the poor who had brought the honour and glory of his presence all the way from deoli what did tables and chairs and eggs and fowls and very bright lamps matter to the raj he was an old man and  who put the present raja on the throne lake sahib promptly answered the chowkidar i was there that is the news of many old years now tod says it was he himself who installed lalji the beloved in the year 1821 the englishman began to lose faith in the chowkidar the munshi said nothing but followed the englishman with his one workable eye a merry little breeze crisped the waters of the lake and the fish began to frolic before going to bed  is nobody going to do or bring anything said the englishman faintly wondering whether the local gaol would give him a bed if he killed the munshi i am an old man said the chowkidar and because of their great respect and reverence for the sahib in whose presence i am only a bearer of orders and a servant awaiting them men many men are bringing now tentflies which i with my own hands will wrap here and there there and here in and about the pillars of the place and thus you o sahib who have brought the honour of your presence to the boondi raj over the road to deoli which is a kutcha road will be provided with a very fine and large apartment over which i will watch while you go to kill the tigers in these hills  by this time two youths had twisted canvas round some of the pillars of the colonnade making a sort of loosebox with a twofoot airway all round the top there was no door but there were unlimited windows into this enclosure the chowkidar heaped furniture on which many generations of pigeons had evidently been carried off by cholera until he was entreated to desist what said he scornfully are tables and chairs to this raj if six be not enough let the presence give an order and twelve shall be forthcoming everything shall be forthcoming here he filled a native lamp with kerosene oil and set it in a box upon a stick luckily the oil which he poured so lavishly from a quart bottle was bad or he would have been altogether consumed  night had fallen long before this magnificence was ended the superfluous furniturechairs for the most partwas shovelled out into the darkness and by the light of a flamboyant lampleta merry wind forbade candlesthe englishman went to bed and was lulled to sleep by the rush of the water escaping from the overflow trap and the splash of the waterturtle as he missed the evasive fish it was a curious sight cats and dogs rioted about the enclosure and a wind from the lake bellied the canvas the brushwood of the hills around snapped and cracked as beasts went through it and creaturesnot jackalsmade dolorous noises on the lake it seemed that hundreds of waterbirds were keeping a hotel and that there were arrivals and departures throughout the night the raj insisted upon providing a guard of two sepoys very pleasant men on four rupees a month these said that tigers sometimes wandered about on the hills above the lake but were most generally to be found five miles away and the englishman promptly dreamed that a oneeyed tiger came into his tent without a purwana but it was only a wild cat after all and it fled before the shoes of civilisation  the sukh mahal was completely separated from the city and might have been a countryhouse it should be mentioned that boondi is jammed into a vshaped gorgethe valley at the main entrance being something less than five hundred yards across as it splays out the thickly packed houses follow its lines and seen from above seem like cattle herded together preparatory to a stampede through the gate owing to the set of the hills very little of the city is visible except from the palace it was in search of this latter that the englishman went abroad and became so interested in the streets that he forgot all about it for a time jeypore is a showcity and is decently drained udaipur is blessed with a state engineer and a printed form of government for jodhpur the dry sand the burning sun and an energetic doctor have done a good deal but boondi has none of these things the crampedness of the locality aggravates the evil and it can only be in the rains which channel and furrow the rocky hillsides that boondi is at all swept out the nal sagar a lovely little stretch of water takes up the head of the valley called banda gorge and must in the nature of things receive a good deal of unholy drainage but setting aside this weakness it is a fascinating placethis jumbled city of straight streets and cool gardens where gigantic mangoes and peepuls intertwine over gurgling watercourses and the cuckoo comes at midday it boasts no foolish municipality to decree when a house is dangerous and uninhabitable the newer shops are built into on to over and under timeblackened ruins of an older day and the little children skip about tottering arcades and grassgrown walls while their parents chatter below in the crowded bazaar in the black slums the same stones seem to be used over and over again for housebuilding wheeled conveyances are scarce in boondi citythere is scant room for carts and the streets are paved with knobsome stones unpleasant to walk over from time to time an inroad of bunjaras packbullocks sweeps the main streets clear of life or one of the rajas elephantshe has twelve of themblocks the way but for the most part the footpassengers have all the city for their own  they do not hurry themselves they sit in the sun and think or put on all the arms in the family and hung with ironmongery parade before their admiring friends others lean dark men with bound jaws and only a tulwar for weapon dive in and out of the dark alleys on errands of state it is a beautifully lazy city doing everything in the real true original native way and it is kept in very good order by the durbar there either is or is not an order for everything there is no order to sell fishinghooks or to supply an englishman with milk or to change for him currency notes he must only deal with the durbar for whatever he requires and wherever he goes he must be accompanied by at least two armed men they will tell him nothing for they know or affect to know nothing of the city they will do nothing except shout at the little innocents who joyfully run after the stranger and demand pice but there they are and there they will stay till he leaves the city accompanying him to the gate and waiting there a little to see that he is fairly off and away englishmen are not encouraged in boondi the intending traveller would do well to take a full suit of political uniform with the sunflowers and the little black sword to sit down upon the local god is the agenty sahib and he is an incarnation without a nameat least among the lower classes the educated when speaking of him always use the courtly bahadur affix and yet it is a mean thing to gird at a state which after all is not bound to do anything for intrusive englishmen without any visible means of livelihood the king of this fair city should declare the blockade absolute and refuse to be troubled with any one except colonnel baltah agenty sahib bahadur and the politicals if ever a railway is run through kotah as men on the bombay side declare it must be the cloistered glory of boondi will depart for kotah is only twenty miles easterly of the city and the road is moderately good in that day the globetrotter will pry about the place and the charitable dispensarya gem among dispensarieswill be public property  the englishman was hunting for the statue of a horse a great horse hight hunja who was a steed of irak and a kings gift to rao omeda one time monarch of boondi he found it in the city square as tod had said and it was an unlovely statue carven after the dropsical fashion of later hindu art no one seemed to know anything about it a little further on one cried from a byway in rusty english come and see my dispensary there are only two men in boondi who speak english one is the head and the other the assistant teacher of the english side of boondi free school the third was some twenty years ago a pupil of the lahore medical college when that institution was young and he only remembered a word here and there he was head of the charitable dispensary and insisted upon then and there organising a small levee and pulling out all his books escape was hopeless nothing less than a formal inspection and introduction to all the native physicians would serve there were sixteen beds in and about the courtyard and between twenty and thirty outpatients stood in attendance making allowances for untouched orientalism the dispensary is a good one and must relieve a certain amount of human misery there is no other in all boondi the operationbook kept in english showed the principal complaints of the country they were asthama numonia skindiseas dabalaty and loinbite this last item occurred again and againthree and four cases per weekand it was not until the doctor said sher se mara that the englishman read it aright it was lionbite or tiger if you insist upon zoological accuracy there was one incorrigible idiot a handsome young man naked as the day who sat in the sunshine shivering and pressing his hands to his head i have given him blisters and setonshave tried native and english treatment for two years but it is no use he is always as you see him and now he stays here by the favour of the durbar which is a very good and pitiful durbar said the doctor there were many such pensioners of the durbarmen afflicted with chronic asthama who stayed by favour and were kindly treated they were resting in the sunshine their hands on their knees sure that their daily dole of grain and tobacco and opium would be forthcoming all folk even little children eat opium here said the doctor and the dietbook proved it after laboriousinvestigation of everything down to the last indent to bombay for europe medicines the englishman was suffered to depart sir i thank  began the native doctor but the rest of the sentence stuck sixteen years in boondi does not increase knowledge of english and he went back to his patients gravely conning over the name of the principal of the lahore medical schoola college nowwho had taught him all he knew and to whom he intended to write there was something pathetic in the mans catching at news from the outside world of men he had known as assistant and house surgeons who are now rai bahadurs and his parade of the few shreds of english that still clung to him may he treat loinbites and catrack successfully for many years in the happy indolent fashion that must have merits which we cannot understand he is doing a good work and the durbar allows his dispensary as much as it wants  close to the dispensary stood the free school and thither an importunate munshi steered the englishman who by this time was beginning to persuade herself that he really was an accredited agent of government sent to report on the progress of boondi from a peepulshaded courtyard came a clamour of young voices thirty or forty little ones from five to eight years old were sitting in an open verandah learning accounts and hindustani said the teacher no need to ask from what castes they came for it was written on their faces that they were mahajans oswals aggerwals and in one or two cases it seemed sharawaks of guzerat they were learning the business of their lives and in time would take their fathers places and show in how many ways money might be manipulated here the professiontype came out with startling distinctness through the chubbiness of almost babyhood or the delicate suppleness of maturer years in mouth and eyes and hands it betrayed itself the rahtor who comes of a fighting stock is a fine animal and well bred the hara who seems to be more compactly built is also a fine animal but for a race that show blood in every line of their frame from the arch of the instep to the modelling of the head the financialtrading is too coarse a wordthe financial class of rajputana appears to be the most remarkable later in life may become clouded with fat jowl and paunch but in his youth his quickeyed nimble youth the young marwar to give him his business title is really a thing of beauty his manners are courtly the bare ground and a few slates sufficed for the children who were merely learning the ropes that drag states but the english class of boys from ten to twelve was supplied with real benches and forms and a table with a cloth top the assistant teacher for the head was on leave was a selftaught man of boondi young and delicate looking who preferred reading to speaking english his youngsters were supplied with the third english reading book and were painfully thumbing their way through a doggerel poem about an old man with hoary hair one boy bolder than the rest slung an english sentence at the visitor and collapsed it was his little stockintrade and the rest regarded him enviously the durbar supports the school which is entirely free and open a just distinction being maintained between the various castes the old race prejudice against payment for knowledge came out in reply to a question you must not sell teaching said the teacher and the class murmured applausively you must not sell teaching  the population of boondi seems more obviously mixed than that of the other states there are four or five thousand mahometans within its walls and a sprinkling of aborigines of various varieties besides the human raffle that the bunjaras bring in their train with pathans and sleek delhi men the new heraldry of the state is curioussomething after this sort or a demigod sable issuant of flames holding in right hand a sword and in the left a bowall proper in chief a dagger of the second sheathed vert fessewise over seven arrows in sheaf of the second this latter blazon boondi holds in commemoration of the defeat of an imperial prince who rebelled against the delhi throne in the days of jehangir when boondi for value received took service under the mahometan it might also be but here there is no certainty the memorial of rao ruttons victory over prince khoorm when the latter strove to raise all rajputana against jehangir his father or of a second victory over a riotous lordling who harried mewar a little later for this exploit the annals say jehangir gave rao rutton honorary flags and kettledrums which may have been melted down by the science of the heralds college into the blazon aforesaid all the heraldry of rajputana is curious and to such as hold that there is any worth in the royal science interesting udaipurs shield is naturally gules a sun in splendour as befits the children of the sun and fire and one of the most ancient houses in india her crest is the straight rajput sword the khanda for an account of the worship of which very powerful divinity read tod the supporters are a bhil and a rajput attired for the forlornhope commemorating not only the defences of chitor but also the connection of the great bappa rawul with the bhils who even now play the principal part in the crownmarking of a rana of udaipur here again tod explains the matter at length banswara claims alliance with udaipur and carries a sun with a label of difference of some kind jeypore has the fivecoloured flag of amber with a sun because the house claim descent from rama and her crest is a kuchnar tree which is the bearing of dasaratha father of rama the white horse which faces the tiger as supporter may or may not be memorial of the great aswamedha yuga or horse sacrifice that jey singh who built jeypore didnot carry out  jodhpur has the fivecoloured flag with a falcon in which shape durga the patron goddess of the state has been sometimes good enough to appear she has perched in the form of a wagtail on the howdah of the chief of jeysulmir whose shield is blazoned with forts in a desert land and a naked left arm holding a broken spear because the legend goes jeysulmir was once galled by a horse with a magic spear they tell the story today but it is a long one the supporters of the shieldthis is canting heraldry with a vengeanceare antelopes of the desert spangled with gold coin because the state was long the refuge of the wealthy bankers of india  bikanir a younger house of jodhpur carries three white hawks on the fivecoloured flag the patron goddess of bikanir once turned the thorny jungle round the city to fruit trees and the crest therefore is a green treestrange emblem for a desert principality the motto however is a good one when the greater part of the rajput states were vassals of akbar and he sent them abroad to do his will certain princes objected to crossing the indus and asked bikanir to head the mutiny because his state was the least accessible he consented on condition that they would all for one day greet him thus jey jangal dar badshah history shows what became of the objectors and bikanirs motto hail to the king of the waste proves that the tale must be true but from boondi to bikanir is a long digression bred by idleness on the bund of the burra it would have been sinful not to let down a line into those crowded waters and the guards who were mahometans said that if the sahib did not eat fish they did and the sahib fished luxuriously catching two and three pounders of a perchlike build whenever he chose to cast he was wearied of schools and dispensaries and the futility of heraldry accorded well with sloththat is to say boondi  it should be noted none the less that in this part of the world the soberest mind will believe anythingbelieve in the ghosts by the gau mukh and the dead thakurs who get out of their tombs and ride round the burra talao at boondiwill credit every legend and lie that rises as naturally as the red flush of sunset to gild the dead glories of rajasthan     xvii  shows that there may be poetry in a bank and attempts to show the wonders of the palace of boondi   this is a devils place you have come to sahib no grass for the horses and the people dont understand anything and their dirty pice are no good in nasirabad look here ram baksh wrathfully exhibited a handful of lumps of copper the nuisance of taking a native out of his own beat is that he forthwith regards you not only as the author of his being but of all his misfortunes as well he is as hampering as a frightened child and as irritating as a man padre martum sahib never came here said ram baksh with an air of one who had been led against his will into bad company  a story about a rat that found a piece of turmeric and set up a bunnias shop had sent the oneeyed munshi away but a company of lesser munshis runners and the like were in attendance and they said that money might be changed at the treasury which was in the palace it was quite impossible to change it anywhere elsethere was no order from the sukh mahal to the palace the road ran through the heart of the city and by reason of the continual shouting of the munshis not more than ten thousand of the fifty thousand people of boondi knew for what purpose the sahib was journeying through their midst cataract was the most prevalent affliction cataract in its worst forms and it was therefore necessary that men should come very close to look at the stranger they were in no sense rude but they stared devoutly he has not come for shikar and he will not take petitions he has come to see the place and god knows what he is the description was quite correct as far as it went but somehow or another when shouted out at four crossways in the midst of a very pleasant little gathering it did not seem to add to dignity or command respect  it has been written the coup doeil of the castellated palace of boondi from whichever side you approach it is perhaps the most striking in india whoever has seen the palace of boondi can easily picture to himself the hanging gardens of semiramis this is trueand more too to give on paper any adequate idea of the boondikimahal is impossible jeypore palace may be called the versailles of india udaipurs house of state is dwarfed by the hills round it and the spread of the pichola lake jodhpurs house of strife grey towers on red rock is the work of giants but the palace of boondi even in broad daylight is such a palace as men build for themselves in uneasy dreamsthe work of goblins more than of men it is built into and out of the hillside in gigantic terrace on terrace and dominates the whole of the city but a detailed description of it were useless owing to the dip of the valley in which the city stands it can only be well seen from one place the main road of the city and from that point looks like an avalanche of masonry ready to rush down and block the gorge like all the other palaces of rajputana it is the work of many hands and the present raja has thrown out a bastion of no small size on one of the lower levels which has been four or five years in the building no one knows where the hill begins and where the palace ends men say that there are subterranean chambers leading into the heart of the hills and passages communicating with the extreme limits of taragarh the giant fortress that crowns the hill and flanks the whole of the valley on the palace side they say that there is as much room under as above ground and that none have traversed the whole extent of the palace looking at it from below the englishman could readily believe that nothing was impossible for those who had built it the dominant impression was of heightheight that heaved itself out of the hillside and weighed upon the eyelids of the beholder the steep slope of the land had helped the builders in securing this effect from the main road of the city a steep stonepaved ascent led to the first gatename not communicated by the zealous following two gaudily painted fishes faced each other over the arch and there was little except glaring colour ornamentation visible this gate gave into what they called the chowk of the palace and one had need to look twice ere realising that this open space crammed with human life was a spur of the hill on which the palace stood paved and built over there had been little attempt at levelling the ground the footworn stones followed the contours of the ground and ran up to the walls of the palace smooth as glass immediately facing the gate of the fish was the quarterguard barracks a dark and dirty room and here in a chamber hollowed out in a wall were stored the big drums of state the nakarras the appearance of the englishman seemed to be the signal for smiting the biggest of all and the dull thunder rolled up the palace chowk and came back from the unpierced palace walls in hollow groaning it was an eerie welcomethis single sullen boom in this enclosure four hundred years ago if the legend be true a son of the great rao bando who dreamed a dream as pharaoh did and saved boondi from famine left a little band of haras to wait his bidding while he went up into the palace and slew his two uncles who had usurped the throne and abandoned the faith of their fathers when he had pierced one and hacked the other as they sat alone and unattended he called out to his followers who made a slaughterhouse of the enclosure and cut up the usurpers adherents at the best of times men slip on these smooth stones and when the place was swimming in blood foothold must have been treacherous indeed  an inquiry for the place of the murder of the unclesit is marked by a staircase slab or tod the accurate is at faultwas met by the answer that the treasury was close at hand they speak a pagan tongue in boondi swallow half their words and adulterate the remainder with local patois what can be extracted from a people who call four miles variously do kosh do kush dhi hkas dooa koth and diakast all one word the countryfolk are quite unintelligible which simplifies matters it is the catching of a shadow of a meaning here and there the hunting for directions cloaked in dialect that is annoying foregoing his archæological researches the englishman sought the treasury he took careful notes he even made a very bad drawing but the treasury of boondi defied pinning down before the public there was a gash in the brown flank of the palaceand this gash was filled with people a broken bees comb with the whole hive busily at work on repairs will give a very fair idea of this extraordinary placethe heart of boondi the sunlight was very vivid without and the shadows were heavy within so that little could be seen except this clinging mass of humanity wriggling like maggots in a carcass a stone staircase ran up to a rough verandah built out of the wall and in the wall was a cavelike room the guardian of whose depths was one of the refined financial classes a man with very small hands and soft low voice he was girt with a sword and held authority over the durbar funds he referred the englishman courteously to another branch of the department to find which necessitated a blundering progress up another narrow staircase crowded with loungers of all kinds here everything shone from constant contact of bare feet and hurrying bare shoulders the staircase was the thing that seen from without had produced the bees comb impression at the top was a long verandah shaded from the sun and here the boondi treasury worked under the guidance of a greyhaired old man whose sword lay by the side of his comfortably wadded cushion he controlled twenty or thirty writers each wrapped round a huge country paper accountbook and each far too busy to raise his eyes  the babble on the staircase might have been the noise of the sea so far as these men were concerned it ebbed and flowed in regular beats and spread out far into the courtyard below now and again the clickclickclick of a scabbard tip being dragged against the wall cut the dead sound of tramping naked feet and a soldier would stumble up the narrow way into the sunlight he was received and sent back or forward by a knot of keeneyed loungers who seemed to act as a buffer between the peace of the secretariat and the pandemonium of the administrative saises and grasscutters mahouts of elephants brokers mahajuns villagers from the district and here and there a shockheaded aborigine swelled the mob on and at the foot of the stairs as they came up they met the buffermen who spoke in low voices and appeared to filter them according to their merits some were sent to the far end of the verandah where everything melted away in a fresh crowd of dark faces others were sent back and joined the detachment shuffling for their shoes in the chowk one servant of the palace withdrew himself to the open underneath the verandah and there sat yapping from time to time like a hungry dog the grass the grass the grass but the men with the accountbooks never stirred and they bowed their heads gravely and made entry or erasure turning back the rustling leaves not often does a reach of the river of life so present itself that it can without alteration be transferred to canvas but the treasury of boondi the view up the long verandah stood complete and ready for any artist who cared to make it his own and by that lighter and less malicious irony of fate who is always giving nuts to those who have no teeth the picture was clinched and brought together by a winking brass hookahbowl of quaint design pitched carelessly upon a roll of dull red cloth in the foreground the faces of the accountants were of pale gold for they were an untanned breed and the face of the old man their controller was frosted silver  it was a strange treasury but no other could have suited the palace the englishman watched openmouthed blaming himself because he could not catch the meaning of the orders given to the flying chaprassies nor make anything of the hum in the verandah and the tumult on the stairs the old man took the commonplace currency note and announced his willingness to give change in silver we have no small notes here he said they are not wanted in a little while when you next bring the honour of your presence this way you shall find the silver  the englishman was taken down the steps and fell into the arms of a bristly giant who had left his horse in the courtyard and the giant spoke at length waving his arms in the air but the englishman could not understand him and dropped into the hubbub at the palace foot except the main lines of the building there is nothing straight or angular about it the rush of people seems to have rounded and softened every corner as a river grinds down boulders from the lowest tier two zigzags all of rounded stones sunk in mortar took the englishman to a gate where two carved elephants were thrusting at each other over the arch and because neither he nor any one round him could give the gate a name he called it the gate of the elephants here the noise from the treasury was softened and entry through the gate brought him into a wellknown world the drowsy peace of a kings palace there was a courtyard surrounded by stables in which were kept chosen horses and two or three grooms were sleeping in the sun there was no other life except the whir and coo of the pigeons in timethough there really is no such a thing as time off the line of railwayan official appeared begirt with the skewerlike keys that open the native bayonetlocks each from six inches to a foot long where was the raj mahal in which sixtysix years ago tod formally installed ram singh who is now in his eleventh year fair and with a lively intelligent cast of face the warden made no answer but led to a room overlooking the courtyard in which two armed men stood before an empty throne of white marble they motioned silently that none must pass immediately before the seat of the king but go round keeping to the far side of the double row of pillars near the walls were stone slabs pierced to take the butts of long venomous black bamboo lances rude coffers were disposed about the room and ruder sketches of ganesh adorned the walls the men said the warden watch here day and night because this place is the rutton daulat that you will concede is lucid enough he who does not understand it may go to for a thickheaded barbarian  from the rutton daulat the warden unlocked doors that led into a hall of audiencethe chutter mahalbuilt by raja chutter lal who was killed more than two hundred years ago in the latter days of shah jehan for whom he fought two rooms each supported on double rows of pillars flank the open space in the centre of which is a marble reservoir here the englishman looked anxiously for some of the atrocities of the west and was pleased to find that with the exception of a vase of artificial flowers and a clock there was nothing that jarred with the exquisite pillars and the raw blaze of colour in the roofs of the rooms in the middle of these impertinent observations something sighedsighed like a distressed ghost unaccountable voices are at all times unpleasant especially when the hearer is some hundred feet or so above ground in an unknown palace in an unknown land a gust of wind had found its way through one of the latticed balconies and had breathed upon a thin plate of metal some astrological instrument slung gongwise on a tripod the tone was as soft as that of an Æolian harp and because of the surroundings infinitely more plaintive  there was an inlaid ivory door set in lintel and posts crusted with lookingglassall apparently old work this opened into a darkened room where there were gilt and silver charpoys and portraits in the native fashion of the illustrious dead of boondi beyond the darkness was a balcony clinging to the sheer side of the palace and it was then that the englishman realised to what a height he had climbed without knowing it he looked down upon the bustle of the treasury and the stream of life flowing into and out of the gate of the fishes where the big drums lie lifting his eyes he saw how boondi city had built itself spreading from west to east as the confined valley became too narrow and the years more peaceable the boondi hills are the barrier that separates the stony uneven ground near deoli from the flats of kotah twenty miles away from the palace balcony the road to the eye is clear to the banks of the chumbul river which was the debatable ford in times gone by and was leaped as all rivers with any pretensions to a pedigree have been by more than one magic horse northward and easterly the hills run out to indurgarh and southward and westerly to territory marked disputed on the map in the present year of grace from this balcony the raja can see to the limit of his territory eastward his empire all under his hand he is or the politicals err that same ram singh who was installed by tod in 1821 and for whose success in killing his first deer tod was by the queenmother of boondi bidden to rejoice today the people of boondi say this durbar is very old so old that few men remember its beginning for that was in our fathers time it is related also of boondi that on the occasion of the queens jubilee they said proudly that their ruler had reigned for sixty years and he was a man they saw nothing astonishing in the fact of a woman having reigned for fifty history does not say whether they jubilated for there are no englishmen in boondi to write accounts of demonstrations and foundationstone laying to the daily newspaper and boondi is very very small in the early morning you may see a man pantingly chased out of the city by another man with a naked sword this is the mail and the mailguard and the effect is as though runner and swordsman lay under a doomthe one to fly with the fear of death always before him as men fly in dreams and the other to perpetually fail of his revenge  the warden unlocked more doors and led the englishman still higher but into a gardena heavily timbered garden with a tank for gold fish in the midst for once the impassive following smiled when they saw that the englishman was impressed  this said they is the rang bilas but who made it who knows it was made long ago the englishman looked over the gardenwall a foothigh parapet and shuddered there was only the flat side of the palace and a drop on to the stones of the zigzag scores of feet below above him was the riven hillside and the decaying wall of taragarh and behind him this fair garden hung like mahomets coffin but full of the noise of birds and the talking of the wind in the branches the warden entered into a lengthy explanation of the nature of the delusion showing howbut he was stopped before he was finished his listener did not want to know how the trick was done here was the garden and there were three or four storeys climbed to reach it at one end of the garden was a small room under treatment by native artists who were painting the panels with historical pictures in distemper theirs was florid polychromatic art but skirting the floor was a series of frescoes in red black and white of combats with elephants bold and temperate as good german work they were worn and defaced in places but the hand of some bygone limner who did not know how to waste a line showed under the bruises and scratches and put the newer work to shame  here the tour of the palace ended and it must be remembered that the englishman had not gone the depth of three rooms into one flank acres of building lay to the right of him and above the lines of the terraces he could see the tops of green trees who knew how many gardens such as the rang bilas were to be found in the palace no one answered directly but all said that there were many the warden gathered up his keys and locking each door behind him as he passed led the way down to earth but before he had crossed the garden the englishman heard deep down in the bowels of the palace a womans voice singing and the voice rang as do voices in caves all palaces in india excepting dead ones such as that of amber are full of eyes in some as has been said the idea of being watched is stronger than in others in boondi palace it was overpoweringbeing far worse than in the green shuttered corridors of jodhpur there were trapdoors on the tops of terraces and windows veiled in foliage and bullseyes set low in unexpected walls and many other peepholes and places of vantage in the end the englishman looked devoutly at the floor but when the voice of the woman came up from under his feet he felt that there was nothing left for him but to go yet excepting only this voice there was deep silence everywhere and nothing could be seen  the warden returned to the chutter mahal to pick up a lost key the brass table of the planets was sighing softly to itself as it swung to and fro in the wind that was the last view of the interior of the palace the empty court and the swinging sighing astrolabe  about two hours afterwards when he had reached the other side of the valley and seen the full extent of the buildings the englishman began to realise first that he had not been taken through onetenth of the palace and secondly that he would do well to measure its extent by acres in preference to meaner measures but what made him blush hotly all alone among the tombs on the hillside was the idea that he with his ridiculous demands for eggs firewood and sweet drinking water should have clattered and chattered through any part of it at all  he began to understand why boondi does not encourage englishmen     xviii  of the uncivilised night and the departure to things civilised showing how a friend may keep an appointment too well   let us go hence my songs she will not hear let us go hence together without fear but ram baksh the irrepressible sang it in altogether a baser key he came by night to the pavilion on the lake while the sepoys were cooking their fish and reiterated his whine about the devildom of the country into which the englishman had dragged him padre martum sahib would never have thus treated the owner of sixteen horses all fast and big ones and eight superior shutintongas let us get away said ram baksh you are not here for shikar and the water is very bad it was indeed except when taken from the lake and then it only tasted fishy we will go ram baksh said the englishman we will go in the very early morning and in the meantime here is fish to stay your stomach with  when a transparent piece of canvas which fails by three feet to reach ceiling or floor is the only bar between the east and the west he would be a churl indeed who stood upon invidious race distinctions the englishman went out and fraternised with the militarythe fourrupee soldiers of boondi who guarded him they were armed one with an old tower musket crazy as to nipple and hammer one with a nativemade smoothbore and one with a composite contrivanceenglish sporting muzzleloader stock with a compartment for a jointed cleaningrod and hammered octagonal native barrel wirefastened a tuft of cotton on the foresight all three guns were loaded and the owners were very proud of them they were simple folk these menatarms with an inordinate appetite for broiled fish they were not always soldiers they explained they cultivated their crops until called for any duty that might turn up they were paid now and again at intervals but they were paid in coin and not in kind  the munshis and the vakils and the runners had departed after seeing that the englishman was safe for the night so the freedom of the little gathering on the bund was unrestrained the chowkidar came out of his cave into the firelight he took a fish and incontinently choked for he was a feeble old man set right again he launched into a very long and quite unintelligible story while the sepoys said reverently he is an old man and remembers many things as he babbled the night shut in upon the lake and the valley of boondi the last cows were driven into the water for their evening drink the waterfowl and the monkeys went to bed and the stars came out and made a new firmament in the untroubled bosom of the lake the light of the fire showed the ruled lines of the bund springing out of the soft darkness of the wooded hill on the left and disappearing into the solid darkness of a bare hill on the right below the bund a man cried aloud to keep wandering pigs from the gardens whose treetops rose to a level with the bundedge beyond the trees all was swaddled in gloom when the gentle buzz of the unseen city died out it seemed as though the bund were the very swordwide bridge that runs as every one knows between this world and the next the water lapped and muttered and now and again a fish jumped with the shatter of broken glass blurring the peace of the reflected heavens      and duller should i be than some fat weed     that rolls itself at ease on lethes wharf  the poet who wrote those lines knew nothing whatever of lethes wharf the englishman had found it and it seemed to him at that hour and in that place that it would be good and desirable never to return to the commissioners and the deputy commissioners any more but to lie at ease on the warm sunlit bund by day and at night near a shadowbreeding fire to listen for the strangled voices and whispers of the darkness in the hills thus after as long a life as the chowkidars dying easily and pleasantly and being buried in a red tomb on the borders of the lake surely no one would come to reclaim him across those weary weary miles of rockstrewn road and this said the chowkidar raising his voice to enforce attention is true talk everybody knows it and now the sahib knows it i am an old man he fell asleep at once with his head on the clay pipe that was doing duty for a whole huqa among the company he had been talking for nearly a quarter of an hour  see how great a man is the true novelist six or seven thousand miles away walter besant of the golden pen had created mr maliphantthe ancient of figureheads in the all sorts and conditions of men and here in boondi the englishman had found mr maliphant in the withered flesh so he drank walter besants health in the water of the burra talao one of the sepoys turned himself round with a clatter of accoutrements shifted his blanket under his elbow and told a tale it had something to do with his khet and a gunna which certainly was not sugarcane it was elusive at times it seemed that it was a woman then changed to a right of way and lastly appeared to be a tax but the more he attempted to get at its meaning through the curious patois in which its doings or its merits were enveloped the more dazed the englishman became none the less the story was a fine one embellished with much dramatic gesture which told powerfully against the firelight then the second sepoy who had been enjoying the pipe all the time told a tale the purport of which was that the dead in the tombs round the lake were wont to get up of nights and go hunting this was a fine and ghostly story and its dismal effect was much heightened by some clamour of the night far up the lake beyond the floor of stars  the third sepoy said nothing he had eaten too much fish and was fast asleep by the side of the chowkidar  they were all mahometans and consequently all easy to deal with a hindu is an excellent person but  but  there is no knowing what is in his heart and he is hedged about with so many strange observances  this hindu or musalman bent which each englishmans mind must take before he has been three years in the country is of course influenced by province or presidency in rajputana generally the political swears by the hindu and holds that the mahometan is untrustworthy but a man who will eat with you and take your tobacco sinking the fiction that it has been doctored with infidel wines cannot be very bad after all  that night when the tales were all told and the guard bless them were snoring peaceably in the starlight a man came stealthily into the enclosure of canvas and woke the englishman muttering sahib sahib in his ear it was no robber but some poor devil with a petitiona grimy welted paper he was absolutely unintelligible and stammered almost to dumbness he stood by the bed alternately bowing to the earth and standing erect his arms spread aloft and his whole body working as he tried to force out some rebellious word in a key that should not wake the men without what could the englishman do he was no government servant and had no concern with petitions the man clicked and choked and gasped in his desperate desire to make the sahib understand but it was no use and in the end he departed as he had comebowed abject and unintelligible                                       let every word written against ganesh be rescinded it was by his ordering that the englishman saw such a dawn on the burra talao as he had never before set eyes on every fair morning is a reprint blurred perhaps of the first day but this splendour was a thing to be put aside from all other days and remembered the stars had no fire in them and the fish had stopped jumping when the black water of the lake paled and grew grey while he watched it seemed to the englishman that voices on the hills were intoning the first verses of genesis the grey light moved on the face of the waters till with no interval a bloodred glare shot up from the horizon and inky black against the intense red a giant crane floated out towards the sun in the stillshadowed city the great palace drum boomed and throbbed to show that the gates were open while the dawn swept up the valley and made all things clear the blind man who said the blast of a trumpet is red spoke only the truth the breaking of the red dawn is like the blast of a trumpet  what said the chowkidar picking the ashes of the overnight fire out of his beard what i say are five eggs or twelve eggs to such a raj as ours what also are fowlswhat are  there was no talk of fowls where is the fowlman from whom you got the eggs he is here no he is there i do not know i am an old man and i and the raj supply everything without price the fowlman will be paid by the stateliberally paid let the sahib be happy wah wah  experience of forced labour in himalayan villages had made the englishman very tender in raising supplies that were given gratis but the fowlman could not be found and the value of his wares was later paid to ganeshganesh of situr for that is the name of the village full of priests through which the englishman had passed in ignorance two days before a double handful of sweet smelling flowers made the receipt  boondi was wideawake before halfpast seven in the morning her hunters on foot and on horse were filing towards the deoli gate they would hunt tiger and deer they said even with matchlocks and muzzle loaders as uncouth as those the sahib saw they were a merry company and chaffed the quarterguard at the gate unmercifully when a bullockcart laden with the cases of the batoum naphtha and oil company blocked the road one of them had been a soldier of the queen and excited by the appearance of a sahib did so rebuke and badger the quarterguard for their slovenliness that they threatened to come out of the barracks and destroy him  so after one last look at the palace high up the hillside the englishman was borne away along the deoli road the peculiarity of boondi is the peculiarity of the covered pitfall one does not see it till one falls into it a quarter of a mile from the gate town and palace were invisible but the englishman was grieved at heart he had fallen in love with boondi the beautiful and believed that he would never again see anything half so fair the utter untouchedness of the town was onehalf the charm and its association the other read tod who is far too good to be chipped or sampled read tod luxuriously on the bund of the burra talao and the spirit of the place will enter into you and you will be happy  to enjoy life thoroughly haste and bustle must be abandoned ram baksh has said that englishmen are always bothering to go forward and for this reason though beyond doubt they pay well and readily are not wise men he gave utterance to this philosophy after he had mistaken his road and pulled up in what must have been a disused quarry hard by a canefield there were patches and pockets of cultivation along the rocky road where men grew cotton chillies tobacco and sugarcane i will get you sugarcane said ram baksh then we will go forward and perhaps some of these junglyfools will tell us where the road is a jungly fool a tender of goats did in time appear but there was no hurry the sugarcane was sweet and purple and the sun warm  the englishman lay out at high noon on the crest of a rolling upland crowned with rock and heard as a loafer had told him he would hear the set of the day which is as easily discernible as the change of tone between the rising and the falling tide at a certain hour the impetus of the morning dies out and all things living and inanimate turn their thoughts to the prophecy of the coming night the little wandering breezes drop for a time and when they blow afresh bring the message the set of the day as the loafer said has changed the machinery is beginning to run down the unseen tides of the air are falling this moment of change can only be felt in the open and in touch with the earth and once discovered seems to place the finder in deep accord and fellowship with all things on earth perhaps this is why the genuine loafer though frequently drunk is always polite to the stranger and shows such a genial tolerance towards the weaknesses of mankind black white or brown  in the evening when the jackals were scuttling across the roads and the cranes had gone to roost came deoli the desolate and an unpleasant meeting six days away from his kind had bred in a cockney heart a great desire to see a fellowsubject an elaborate loaf through the cantonmentfifteen minutes walk from end to endshowed only one distant dogcart and a small english child with an ayah there was grass in the soldierly straight roads and some of the crosscuts had never been used at all since the days when the cantonment had been first laid out in the western corner lay the cemeterythe only carefully tended and newly whitewashed thing in this godforgotten place some years ago a man had said goodby to the englishman adding cheerily we shall meet again the worlds a very little place y know  his prophecy was a true one for the two met indeed but the prophet was lying in deoli cemetery near the well which is decorated so ecclesiastically with funeral urns     xix  comes back to the railway after reflections on the management of the empire and so home again with apology to all who have read thus far   in the morning the tonga rattled past deoli cemetery into the open where the deoli irregulars were drilling they marked the beginning of civilisation and white shirts and so they seemed altogether detestable yet another days jolting enlivened by the philosophy of ram baksh and then came nasirabad the last pair of ponies suggested serious thought they had covered eighteen miles at an average speed of eight miles an hour and were wellconditioned little rats a colonel sahib gave me this one for a present said ram baksh flicking the near one it was his childs pony the child was five years old when he went away the colonel sahib said ram baksh you are a good man never have i seen such a good man this horse is yours ram baksh was getting a horses work out of a childs pony surely we in india work the land much as the colonel sahib worked his sons mount making it do childs work when so much more can be screwed out of it a native and a native state deals otherwise with horse and holding perhaps our extreme scrupulousness in handling may be statecraft but after even a short sojourn in places which are dealt with not so tenderly it seems absurd there are states where things are done and done without protest that would make the hair of the educated native stand on end with horror these things are of course not expedient to write because their publication would give a great deal of unnecessary pain and heartsearching to estimable native administrators who have the hope of a star before their eyes and would not better matters in the least  note this fact though with the exception of such journals as occupying a central position in british territory levy blackmail from the neighbouring states there are no independent papers in rajputana a king may start a weekly to encourage a taste for sanskrit and high hindi or a prince may create a court chronicle but that is all a free press is not allowed and this the native journalist knows with good management he can keeping under the shadow of our flag raise two hundred rupees from a big man here and five hundred from a rich man there but he does not establish himself across the border to one who has reason to hold a stubborn disbelief in even the elementary morality of the native press this bashfulness and lack of enterprise is amusing but to return to the native states administrations there is nothing exactly wrong in the methods of government that are overlaid with english terms and forms they are vigorous in certain points and where they are not vigorous there is a cheery happygoluckiness about the arrangement that must be seen to be understood the shift and play of a mans fortune across the border is as sudden as anything in the days of harounalraschid of blessed memory and there are stories to be got for the unearthing as wild and as improbable as those in the thousand and one nights most impressive of all is the way in which the country is used and its elasticity under pressure in the good old days the durbar raised everything it could from the people and the king spent as much as ever he could on his personal pleasures now the institution of the political agent has stopped the grabbing for which by the way some of the monarchs are not in the least gratefuland smoothed the outward face of things but there is still a difference between our ways and the ways of the other places a year spent among native states ought to send a man back to the decencies and the law courts and the rights of the subject with a supreme contempt for those who rave about the oppressions of our brutal bureaucracy one month nearly taught an average englishman that it was the proper thing to smite anybody of mean aspect and obstructive tendencies on the mouth with a shoe hear what an intelligent loafer said his words are at least as valuable as these babblings he was as usual wonderfully drunk and the gift of speech came upon him the conversationhe was a great politician this loaferhad turned on the poverty of india poor said he of course its poor oh yes dd poor and im poor an youre poor altogether do you expect people will give you money without you ask em no i tell you sir theres enough money in india to pave hell with if you could only get at it ive kep servants in my day did they ever leave me without a hundred or a hundred and fifty rupees put byand never touched you mark that does any black man who had been in guvment service go away without hundreds an hundreds put by and never touched you mark that money the place stinks o moneyjust kept out o sight do you ever know a native that didnt say garib admi im a poor man theyve been sayin garib admi so long that the guvment learns to believe em and now theyre all bein treated as though they was paupers im a pauper an youre a pauperwe avent got anything hid in the groundan sos every white man in this forsaken country but the injian hes a rich man how do i know because ive tramped on foot or warrant pretty well from one end of the place to the other an i know what im talkin about and this ere guvment goes peckin an fiddlin over its tuppennyhapenny little taxes as if it was afraid which it is you see how they do things in  its six sowars here and ten sowars there andpay up you brutes or well pull your ears over your head and when theyve taken all they can get the headman he says this is a dashed poor yield ill come again of course the people digs up something out of the ground and they pay i know the way its done and thats the way to do it you cant go to an injian an say look here can you pay me five rupees he says garib admi of course an would say it if he was as rich as banker but if you send half a dozen swords at him and shift the thatch off of his roof hell pay guvment cant do that i dont suppose it could there is no reason why it shouldnt but it might do something like it to show that it wasnt going to have no nonsense why id undertake to raise a hundred millionwhat am i talking ofa hundred and fifty million pounds from this country per annum and it wouldnt be strained then one hundred and fifty millions you could raise as easy as paint if you just made these ere injians understand that they had to pay an make no bones about it its enough to make a man sick to go in over yonder to  and see what they do and then come back an see what we do perfectly sickenin it is borrer money why the country could pay herself an everything she wants if she was only made to do it its this blooomin garib admi swindle thats been going on all these years that has made fools o the guvment  then he became egotistical this ragged ruffian who conceived that he knew the road to illimitable wealth and told the story of his life interspersed with anecdotes that would blister the paper they were written on but through all his ravings he stuck to his hundredandfiftymillion theory and though the listener dissented from him and the brutal cruelty with which his views were stated an unscientific impression remained not to be shaken off across the border one feels that the country is being used exploited made to sit up so to speak in our territories the feeling is equally strong of wealth just round the corner as the loafer said of a people wrapped up in cotton wool and ungetatable will any man who really knows something of a little piece of india and has not the fear of running counter to custom before his eyes explain how this impression is produced and why it is an erroneous one  nasirabad marked the end of the englishmans holiday and there was sorrow in his heart come back again said ram baksh cheerfully and bring a gun with you then ill take you to gungra and ill drive you myself drive you just as well as ive driven these four days past an amicable openminded soul was ram baksh may his tongas never grow less                                       this ere burma fever is a bad thing to have its pulled me down awful an now i am going to peshawar are you the stationmaster it was thomaswhitecheeked sunkeneyed drawnmouthed thomastravelling from nasirabad to peshawar on pass and with him was a corporal new to his stripes and doing station duty every thomas is interesting except when he is too drunk to speak this thomas was an enthusiast he had volunteered from a homegoing regiment shattered by burma fever into a regiment at peshawar had broken down at nasirabad on his way up with his draft and was now journeying into the unknown to pick up another medal theres sure to be something on the frontier said this gaunt haggard boyhe was little more though he reckoned four years service and considered himself somebody when theres anything going peshawars the place to be in they tell me but i hear we shall have to march down to calcutta in no time the corporal was a little man and showed his friend off with great pride ah you should have come to us said he were the regiment we are well i went with the rest of our men said thomas theres three hundred of us volunteered to stay on and we all went for the same regiment not but what im saying yours is a good regiment he added with grave courtesy this loosed the corporals tongue and he descanted on the virtues of the regiment and the merits of the officers it has been written that thomas is devoid of esprit de corps because of the jerkiness of the arrangements under which he now serves if this be true he manages to conceal his feelings very well for he speaks most fluently in praise of his own regiment and for all his youth has a keen appreciation of the merits of his officers go to him when his heart is opened and hear him going through the roll of the subalterns by a grading totally unknown in the army list and you will pick up something worth the hearing thomas with the burma fever on him tried to cut in from time to time with stories of his officers and what they had done when we was marchin all up and down burma but the little corporal went on gayly  they made a curious contrastthese two types the lathy townbred thomas with hockbottle shoulders a little education and a keen desire to get more medals and stripes and the little deepchested bullnecked corporal brimming over with vitality and devoid of any ideas beyond the regiment and the end of both lives in all likelihood would be a nameless grave in some cantonment buryingground with if the case were specially interesting and the regimental doctor had a turn for the pen an obituary notice in the indian medical journal it was an unpleasant thought  from the army to the navy is a perfectly natural transition but one hardly to be expected in the heart of india dawn showed the railway carriage full of riotous boys for the agra and mount abu schools had broken up for holidays surely it was natural enough to ask a childnot a boy but a childwhether he was going home for the holidays and surely it was a crushing a petrifying thing to hear in a clear treble tinged with icy scorn no im on leave im a midshipman two officers of her majestys navymids of a manowar at bombaywere going upcountry on ten days leave they had not travelled much more than twice round the world but they should have printed the fact on a label they chattered like daws and their talk was as a whiff of fresh air from the open sea while the train ran eastward under the aravalis at that hour their lives were bound up in and made glorious by the hope of riding a horse when they reached their journeys end much had they seen cities and men and the artless way in which they interlarded their conversation with allusions to one of those shoregoing chaps you see was delicious they had no cares no fears no servants and an unlimited stock of wonder and admiration for everything they saw from the cute little wellscoops to a herd of deer grazing on the horizon it was not until they had opened their young hearts with infantile abandon that the listener could guess from the incidental argot where these pocketulysseses had travelled south african norwegian and arabian words were used to help out the slang of shipboard and a copious vocabulary of shipboard terms complicated with modern greek as free from selfconsciousness as children as ignorant as beings from another planet of the angloindian life into which they were going to dip for a few days shrewd and observant as befits men of the world who have authority and neathanded and resourceful as  bluejackets they were a delightful study and accepted freely and frankly the elaborate apologies tendered to them for the unfortunate mistake about the holidays the roads divided and they went their way and there was a shadow after they had gone for the globetrotter said to his wife what i like about jeyporeaccent on the first syllable if you pleaseis its characteristic easternness and the globetrotters wife said yes it is purely oriental  this was jeypore with the gasjets and the waterpipes as was shown at the beginning of these trivial letters and the globetrotter and his wife had not been to amber joyful thought they had not seen the soft splendours of udaipur the nightmare of chitor the grim power of jodhpur and the virgin beauties of boondifairest of all places that the englishman had set eyes on the globetrotter was great in the matter of hotels and food but he had not lain under the shadow of a tonga in soft warm sand eating cold pork with a pocketknife and thanking providence who put sweetwater streams where wayfarers wanted them he had not drunk out the brilliant coldweather night in the company of a king of loafers a grimy scallawag with a six days beard and an unholy knowledge of native states he had attended service in cantonment churches but he had not known what it was to witness the simple solemn ceremonial in the dining room of a faraway residency when all the english folk within a hundredmile circuit bowed their heads before the god of the christians he had blundered about temples of strange deities with a guide at his elbow but he had not known what it was to attempt conversation with a temple dancinggirl not such an one as edwin arnold invented and to be rewarded for a misturned compliment with a deftly heaved bunch of marigold buds in his respectable bosom yet he had undoubtedly lost much and the measure of his loss was proven in his estimate of the orientalism of jeypore  but what had he who sat in judgment upon him gained one perfect month of loaferdom to be remembered above all others and the night of the visit to chitor to be remembered even when the month is forgotten also the sad knowledge that of all the fair things seen the inept pen gives but a feeble and blurred picture  let those who have read to the end pardon a hundred blemishes     from sea to sea     from sea to sea  marchseptember 1889  no i  of freedom and the necessity of using her the motive and the scheme that will come to nothing a disquisition upon the otherness of things and the torments of the damned      when all the world is young lad       and all the trees are green     and every goose a swan lad       and every lass a queen     then hey for boot and horse lad       and oer the world away     young blood must have its course lad       and every dog its day   after seven years it pleased necessity whom we all serve to turn to me and say now you need do nothing whatever you are free to enjoy yourself i will take the yoke of bondage from your neck for one year what do you choose to do with my gift and i considered the matter in several lights at first i held notions of regenerating society but it appeared that this would demand more than a year and perhaps society would not be grateful after all then i would fain enter upon one monumental bust but i reflected that this at the outside could endure but three months while the headache would last for nine then came by the person that i most hatea globetrotter he sitting in my chair discussed india with the unbridled arrogance of five weeks on a cooks ticket he was from england and had dropped his manners in the suez canal i assure you said he that you who live so close to the actual facts of things cannot form dispassionate judgments of their merits you are too near now i he waved his hand modestly and left me to fill the gaps  i considered him from his new helmet to his deckshoes and i perceived that he was but an ordinary man i thought of india maligned and silent india given up to the illconsidered wanderings of such as heof the land whose people are too busy to reply to the libels upon their life and manners it was my destiny to avenge india upon nothing less than threequarters of the world the idea necessitated sacrificespainful sacrificesfor i had to become a globetrotter with a helmet and deckshoes in the interests of our little world i would endure these things and more i would deliver brawling judgments all day long on all things unashamed i would go toward the rising sun till i reached the heart of the world and once more smelt london asphalt  the indian public never gave me a brief i took it appointing myself commissioner in general for our own sweet selves then all the aspects of life changed as they say the appearance of his room grows strange to a dying man when he sees it upon the last morning and knows that it will confront him no more i had wilfully stepped aside from the current of our existence and had no part in any of our interests upcountry the peach was beginning to bud and men said that by cause of the heavy snows in the hills the hot weather would be a short one that was nothing to me the punkahs and their pullers sat together in the verandah and the public buildings spawned thermantidotes the coppersmith sang in the garden and the early wasp hummed low down by the doorhandle and they prophesied of the hot weather to come these things were no concern of mine i was dead and looked upon the old life as a dead manwithout interest and without concern  it was a strange life i had lived it for seven years or one day i could not be certain which all that i knew was that i could watch men going to their offices while i slept luxuriously could go out at any hour of the day and sit up to any hour of the night secure that each morning would bring no toil i understood with what emotions the freed convict regards the prison he has quittedinsight which had hitherto been denied me and i further saw how intense is the selfishness of the irresponsible man some said that the coming year would be one of scarcity and distress because unseasonable rains were falling i was grieved i feared that the rains might break the railway line to the sea and so delay my departure again the season would be a sickly one i fancied that necessity might repent of her gift and for mere jest wipe me off the face of the earth ere i had seen anything of what lay upon it there was trouble on the afghan frontier perhaps an armycorps would be mobilised and perhaps many men would die leaving folk to mourn for them at the hillstations my dread was that a russian manofwar might intercept the steamer which carried my precious self between yokohama and san francisco let armageddon be postponed i prayed for my sake that my personal enjoyments may not be interfered with war famine and pestilence would be so inconvenient to me and i abased myself before necessity the great goddess and said ostentatiously it is naught it is naught and you neednt look at me when i wander about surely we are only virtuous by compulsion of earning our daily bread  so i looked upon men with new eyes and pitied them very much indeed they worked they had to i was an aristocrat i could call upon them at inconvenient hours and ask them why they worked and whether they did it often then they grunted and the envy in their eyes was a delight to me i dared not however mock them too pointedly lest necessity should drag me back by the collar to take my still warm place by their side when i had disgusted all who knew me i fled to calcutta which i was pained to see still persisted in being a city and transacting commerce after i had formally cursed it one year ago that curse i now repeat in the hope that the unsavoury capital will collapse one must begin to smoke at five in the morningwhich is neither night nor dayon coming across the howrah bridge for it is better to get a headache from honest nicotine than to be poisoned by evil smells and a man who otherwise was a nice man though he worked with his hands and his head asked me why the scandal of the simla exodus was allowed to continue to him i made answer it is because this sewer is unfit for human habitation it is because you are all one gigantic mistakeyou and your monuments and your merchants and everything about you i rejoice to think that scores of lakhs of rupees have been spent on public offices at a place called simla that scores and scores will be spent on the delhikalka line in order that civilised people may go there in comfort when that line is opened your big city will be dead and buried and done with and i hope it will teach you a lesson your city will rot sir and he said when people are buried here they turn into adipocere in five days if the weather is rainy they saponify you know i said go and saponify for i hate calcutta but he took me to the eden gardens instead and begged me for my own sake not to go round the world in this prejudiced spirit i was unhappy and ill but he vowed that my spleen was due to my simla way of looking at things  all this world of ours knows something about the eden gardens which are supposed by the uninitiated of the mofussil to represent the gilded luxury of the metropolis as a matter of fact they are hideously dull the inhabitants appear in tophats and frockcoats and walk dolorously to and fro under the glare of jerking electric lamps when they ought to be sitting in their shirtsleeves round little tables and treating their wives to iced lager beer my friendit was a muggy march nightwrapped himself in the prescribed garments and said graciously you can wear a round hat but you mustnt wear deckshoes and for goodness sake my dear fellow dont smoke on the red roadall the people one knows go there most of the people who were people sat in their carriages in an atmosphere of hot horse harness and panellacquer outside the gardens and the remnant tramped up and down by twos and threes upon squashy green grass until they were wearied while a band played at them and is this all you do i asked it is said my friend isnt it good enough we meet every one we know here and walk with him or her unless he or she is among the carriages  overhead was a woolly warm sky underfoot feverish soft grass and from all quarters the languorous breeze bore faint reminiscences of stale sewage upon its wings round the horizon were stacked lines of carriages and the electric flare bred aches in the strained eyebrow it was a strange sight and fascinating the doomed creatures walked up and down without cessation for when one fled away into the lampspangled gloom twenty came to take his place slophatted members of the mercantile marine armenian merchants bengal civilians shopgirls and shopmen jews parthians and mesopotamians were all there in the tepid heat and the fetid smell  this said my friend is how we enjoy ourselves there are the viceregal liveries lady lansdowne comes here he spoke as though reading to me the government house list of paradise i reflected that these people would continue to walk up and down until they died drinkless dusty sad and blanched  in saying this last thing i had made a mistake calcutta is no more angloindian than west brompton in common with bombay it has achieved a mental attitude several decades in advance of that of the raw and brutal india of fact an intelligent and responsible financier discussing the empire said but why do we want so large an army in india look at the country all about i think he meant as far as the circular road or perhaps raneegunge some of these days when the voice of the two uncomprehending cities carries to london and its advice is acted upon there will be trouble till this second journey to calcutta i was unable to account for the acid tone and limited range of the presidency journals i see now that they are ward papers and ought to be treated as such  in the fulness of timethere was no hurryimagine that o you toilers of the landi took ship and fled from calcutta by that which they call the muttonmail because it takes sheep and correspondence to rangoon half the punjab was going with us to serve the queen in the burma military police and it was grateful to catch once more the raw rasping upcountry speech amid the jabber of burmese and bengali  to rangoon then aboard the madura come with me down the hughli and try to understand what sort of life is led by the pilots those strange men who only seem to know the land by watching it from the river  and i fetched up under the north ridge with six inches o water under me with a souwest monsoon blowing an me not knowing any more than the dead where inparadisei was taking her says one deep voice  well what do you expect says another they ought not all to be occulting lights give me a red with two flashes for outlying danger anyhow the hughlis the worst river in the world why off the lower gasper only last year  and look at the way government treats you  the hughli pilot is human he may talk greek in the exercise of his profession but he can unite at swearing at the government as thoroughly as though he were an uncovenanted civilian his life is a hard one but he is full of strange stories and when treated with proper respect may condescend to tell some of them if he has served on the river for six years as a cub and is neither dead nor decrepit i believe he can earn as much as fifty rupees by sending two thousand tons of ship and a few hundred souls flying down the reaches at twelve miles an hour then he drops over the side with your last loveletters and wanders about the estuary in a tug until he finds another steamer and brings her up it does not take much to comfort him                                       somewhere in the open sea some days later i give it up i cannot write and to sleep i am not ashamed a glorious idleness has taken entire possession of me journalism is an imposture so is literature so is art all india dropped out of sight yesterday and the rocking pilotbrig at the sandheads bore my last message to the prison that i quit we have reached blue watercrushed sapphireand a little breeze is bellying the awning three flyingfish were sighted this morning the tea at chotahazri is not nice but the captain is excellent is this budget of news sufficiently exciting or must i in strict confidence tell you the story of the professor and the compass you will hear more about the professor later if indeed i ever touch pen again when he was in india he worked about nine hours a day at noon today he conceived an interest in cyclones and things of that kindwould go to his cabin to get a compass and a meteorological book he went but stopped to reflect by the brink of a drink the compass is in a box said he drowsily but the nuisance of it is that to get it i shall have to pull the box out from under my berth all things considered i dont think its worth while he loafed on deck and i think by this time is fast asleep there was no trace of shame in his voice for his mighty sloth i would have reproved him but the words died on my tongue i was guiltier than he  professor said i there is a foolish little paper in allahabad called the pioneer i am supposed to be writing it a lettera letter with my hands did you ever hear of anything so absurd  i wonder if angostura bitters really go with whisky said the professor toying with the neck of the bottle  there is no such place as india there never was a daily paper called the pioneer it was all a weary dream the only real things in the world are crystal seas cleanswept decks soft rugs warm sunshine the smell of salt in the air and fathomless futile indolence     no ii  the river of the lost footsteps and the golden mystery upon its banks the iniquity of jordan shows how a man may go to the shway dagon pagoda and see it not and to the pegu club and hear too much a dissertation on mixed drinks      i am a part of all that i have met     yet all experience is an arch where through     gleams that untravelled world whose margin fades     for ever and for ever when i move   there was a river and a bar a pilot and a great deal of nautical mystery and the captain said the journey from calcutta was ended and that we should be in rangoon in a few hours it is not an impressive stream being lowbanked scrubby and muddy but as we gave the staggering riceboats the goby i reflected that i was looking upon the river of the lost footstepsthe road that so many many men of my acquaintance had travelled never to return within the past three years such a one had gone up to open out upper burma and had himself been opened out by a burmese dah in the cruel scrub beyond minhla such another had gone to rule the land in the queens name but could not rule a hill stream and was carried down under his horse one had been shot by his servant another by a dacoit while he sat at dinner and a pitifully long list had found in junglefever their sole reward for the difficulties and privations inseparably connected with military service as the bengal army regulations put it i ran over half a score of namespolicemen subalterns young civilians employés of big trading firms and adventurers they had gone up the river and they had died at my elbow stood one of the workers in new burma going to report himself at rangoon and he told tales of interminable chases after evasive dacoits of marchings and countermarchings that came to nothing and of deaths in the wilderness as noble as they were sad  then a golden mystery upheaved itself on the horizona beautiful winking wonder that blazed in the sun of a shape that was neither muslim dome nor hindu temple spire it stood upon a green knoll and below it were lines of warehouses sheds and mills under what new god thought i are we irrepressible english sitting now  theres the old shway dagon pronounced dagone not like the god in the scriptures said my companion confound it but it was not a thing to be sworn at it explained in the first place why we took rangoon and in the second why we pushed on to see what more of rich or rare the land held up till that sight my uninstructed eyes could not see that the land differed much in appearance from the sunderbuns but the golden dome said this is burma and it will be quite unlike any land you know about its a famous old shrine o sorts said my companion and now the tounghoomandalay line is open pilgrims are flocking down by the thousand to see it it lost its big gold topthing that they call a hteein an earthquake thats why its all hidden by bamboowork for a third of its height you should see it when its all uncovered theyre regilding it now  why is it that when one views for the first time any of the wonders of the earth a bystander always strikes in with you should see it etc such men given twenty minutes from the tomb at the day of judgment would patronize the naked souls as they hurried up with the glare of tophet on their faces and say you should have seen this when gabriel first began to blow what the shway dagon really is and how many books may have been written upon its history and archæology is no part of my business as it stood overlooking everything it seemed to explain all about burmawhy the boys had gone north and died why the troopers bustled to and fro and why the steamers of the irrawaddy flotilla lay like blackbacked gulls upon the water  then we came to a new land and the first thing that one of the regular residents said was this place isnt india at all they ought to have made it a crown colony judging the empire as it ought to be judged by its most prominent pointsvidelicet its smellshe was right for though there is one stink in calcutta another in bombay and a third and most pungent one in the punjab yet they have a kinship of stinks whereas burma smells quite otherwise it is not exactly what china ought to smell like but it is not india what is it i asked and the man said napi which is fish pickled when it ought to have been buried long ago this food in guidebook language is inordinately consumed by  but everybody who has been within downwind range of rangoon knows what napi means and those who do not will not understand  yes it was a very new landa land where the people understood coloura delightfully lazy land full of pretty girls and very bad cheroots  the worst of it was that the angloindian was a foreigner a creature of no account he did not know burmanwhich was no great lossand the madrassi insisted upon addressing him in english the madrassi by the way is a great institution he takes the place of the burman who will not work and in a few years returns to his native coast with rings on his fingers and bells on his toes the consequences are obvious the madrassi demands and receives enormous wages and gets to know that he is indispensable the burman exists beautifully while his womenfolk marry the madrassi and the chinaman because these support them in affluence when the burman wishes to work he gets a madrassi to do it for him how he finds the money to pay the madrassi i was not informed but all men were agreed in saying that under no circumstances will the burman exert himself in the paths of honest industry now if a bountiful providence had clothed you in a purple green amber or puce petticoat had thrown a rosepink scarfturban over your head and had put you in a pleasant damp country where rice grew of itself and fish came up to be caught putrified and pickled would you work would you not rather take a cheroot and loaf about the streets seeing what was to be seen if twothirds of your girls were grinning goodhumoured little maidens and the remainder positively pretty would you not spend your time in making love  the burman does both these things and the englishman who after all worked himself to burma says hard things about him personally i love the burman with the blind favouritism born of first impression when i die i will be a burman with twenty yards of real kings silk that has been made in mandalay about my body and a succession of cigarettes between my lips i will wave the cigarette to emphasise my conversation which shall be full of jest and repartee and i will always walk about with a pretty almondcoloured girl who shall laugh and jest too as a young maiden ought she shall not pull a sari over her head when a man looks at her and glare suggestively from behind it nor shall she tramp behind me when i walk for these are the customs of india she shall look all the world between the eyes in honesty and good fellowship and i will teach her not to defile her pretty mouth with chopped tobacco in a cabbage leaf but to inhale good cigarettes of egypts best brand  seriously the burmese girls are very pretty and when i saw them i understood much that i had heard aboutabout our army in flanders let us say  providence really helps those who do not help themselves i went up a street name unknown attracted by the colour that was so wantonly flashed down its length there is colour in rajputana and in southern india and you can find a whole paletteful of raw tints at any downcountry durbar but the burmese way of colouring is different with the women the scarf petticoat and jacket are of three lively hues and with the men putso and headwrap are gorgeous thus you get your colours dashed down in dots against a background of dark timber houses set in green foliage there are no canons of art anywhere and every scheme of colouring depends on the power of the sun above that is why men in a london fog do still believe in pale greens and sad reds give me lilac pink vermilion lapis lazuli and blistering blood red under fierce sunlight that mellows and modifies all i had just made this discovery and was noting that the people treated their cattle kindly when the driver of an absurd little hired carriage built to the scale of a fat burma pony volunteered to take me for a drive and we drove in the direction of the english quarter of the town where the sahibs live in dainty little houses made out of the sides of cigar boxes they looked as if they could be kicked in at a blow and trust a globetrotter for evolving a theory at a minutes notice it is to avoid this fate that they are built for the most part on legs the houses are not cantonment bred in any waynor did the uneven ground and dusty reddish roads fit in with any part of the indian empire except it may be ootacamund  the pony wandered into a garden studded with lovely little lakes which again were studded with islands and there were sahibs in flannels in the boats outside the park were pleasant little monasteries full of cleanshaved gentlemen in gold amber robes learning to renounce the world the flesh and the devil by chatting furiously amongst themselves and at every corner stood the three little maids from school almost exactly as they had been dismissed from the side scenes of the savoy after the mikado was over and the strange part of it all was that every one laughedlaughed so it seemed at the sky above them because it was blue at the sun because it was sinking and at each other because they had nothing better to do a small fat child laughed loudest of all in spite of the fact that it was smoking a cheroot that ought to have made it deathly sick the pagoda was always close at handas brilliant a mystery as when first sighted far down the river but it changed its shape as we came nearer and showed in the middle of a nest of hundreds of smaller pagodas there appeared suddenly two colossal tigers after the burmese canons in plaster on a hillside and they were the guardians of burmas greatest pagoda round them rustled a great crowd of happy people in pretty dresses and the feet of all were turned towards a great stoneway that ran from between the tigers even to the brow of the mound but the nature of the stairs was peculiar they were covered in for the most part by a tunnel or it may have been a walledin colonnade for there were heavily gilt wooden pillars visible in the gloom the afternoon was drawing on as i came to this strange place and saw that i should have to climb up a long low hill of stairs to get to the pagoda  once or twice in my life i have seen a globetrotter literally gasping with jealous emotion because india was so much larger and more lovely than he had ever dreamed and because he had only set aside three months to explore it in my own sojourn in rangoon was countable by hours so i may be forgiven when i pranced with impatience at the bottom of the staircase because i could not at once secure a full complete and accurate idea of everything that was to be seen the meaning of the guardian tigers the inwardness of the main pagoda and the countless little ones was hidden from me i could not understand why the pretty girls with cheroots sold little sticks and coloured candles to be used before the image of buddha everything was incomprehensible to me and there was none to explain all that i could gather was that in a few days the great golden htee that has been defaced by the earthquake would be hoisted into position with feasting and song and that half upper burma was coming down to see the show  i went forward between the two great beasts across a whitewashed court till i came to a flatheaded arch guarded by the lame the blind the leper and the deformed these plucked at my clothes as i passed and moaned and whined but the stream that disappeared up the gentle slope of the stairway took no notice of them and i stepped into the semidarkness of a long long corridor flanked by booths and floored with stones worn very smooth by human feet  at the far end of the roofed corridor there was a breadth of evening sky and at this point rose a second and much steeper flight of stairs leading directly to the shwedagon this by the way is its real spelling down this staircase fell from gloom to deeper gloom a cascade of colour at this point i stayed because there was a beautiful archway of burmese build and adorned with a chinese inscription directly in front of me and i conceived foolishly that i should find nothing more pleasant to look at if i went farther also i wished to understand how such a people could produce the dacoit of the newspaper and i knew that a great deal of promiscuous knowledge comes to him who sits down by the wayside then i saw a facewhich explained a good deal the chin jowl lips and neck were modelled faithfully on the lines of the worst of the roman empressesthe lolloping walloping women that swinburne sings about and that we sometimes see pictures of above this gross perfection of form came the mongoloid nose narrow forehead and flaring pigs eyes i stared intently and the man stared back again with admirable insolence that puckered one corner of his mouth then he swaggered forward and i was richer by a new face and a little knowledge i must make further inquiries at the club said i but that man seems to be of the proper dacoit type he could crucify on occasion  then a brown baby came by in its mothers arms and laughed wherefore i much desired to shake hands with it and grinned to that effect the mother held out the tiny soft pud and laughed and the baby laughed and we all laughed together because that seemed to be the custom of the country and returned down the now dark corridor where the lamps of the stallkeepers were twinkling and scores of people were helping us to laugh they must be a mildmannered nation the burmese for they leave little threeyearolds in charge of a whole wilderness of clay dolls or a menagerie of jointed tigers  i had not actually entered the shwedagon but i felt just as happy as though i had  in the pegu club i found a frienda punjabiupon whose broad bosom i threw myself and demanded food and entertainment he had not long since received a visit from the commissioner of peshawar of all places in the world and was not to be upset by sudden arrivals but he had come down in the world hideously years ago in the black north he used to speak the vernacular as it should be spoken and was one of us  daniel how many socks master got  the unfinished peg fell from my fist good heavens said i is it possible that youyouspeak that disgusting pidgintalk to your nauker its enough to make one cry youre no better than a bombaywallah  im a madrassi said he calmly we all talk english to our boys here isnt it beautiful now come along to the gymkhana and then well dine here daniel masters hat and stick get  there must be a few hundred men who are fairly behind the scenes of the burma warone of the least known and appreciated of any of our little affairs the pegu club seemed to be full of men on their way up or down and the conversation was but an echo of the murmur of conquest far away to the north  see that man over there he was cut over the head the other day at zounglounggoo awfully tough man that chap next him has been on the dacoithunt for about a year he broke up boh mangos gang caught the boh in a paddy field yknow the other mans going home on sick leavegot a lump of iron somewhere in his system try our mutton i assure you the club is the only place in rangoon where you get mutton look here you must not speak vernacular to our boys hi boy get master some more ice theyre all bombay men or madrassis up at the front there are some burman servants but a real burman will never work he prefers being a simple little daku  how much  dear little dacoit we call em dakus for shortsort o pet name thats the butterfish i forgot you didnt get much fish upcountry yes i spose rangoon has its advantages you pay like a prince take an ordinary married establishment little furnished houseone hundred and fifty rupees servants wages two twenty or two fifty thats four hundred at once my dear fellow a sweeper wont take less than twelve or sixteen rupees a month here and even then hell work for other houses its worse than quetta any man who comes to lower burma in the hope of living on his pay is a fool  voice from lower end of table dee fool its different in upper burma where you get command and travelling allowances  another voice in the middle of a conversation they never got that story into the papers but i can tell you we werent quite as quick in rushing the fort as they made believe you see boh gwee had us in a regular trap and by the time we had closed the line our men were being peppered front and rear that junglefighting is the deuce and all more ice please  then they told me of the death of an old schoolfellow under the ramp of the minhla redoubtdoes any one remember the affair at minhla that opened the third burmese ball  i was close to him said a voice he died in as arms i fancy but im not quite sure anyhow i know he died easily he was a good fellow  thank you said i and now i think ill go and i went out into the steamy night my head ringing with stories of battle murder and sudden death i had reached the fringe of the veil that hides upper burma and i would have given much to have gone up the river and seen a score of old friends now jungleworn men of war all that night i dreamed of interminable staircases down which swept thousands of pretty girls so brilliantly robed that my eyes ached at the sight there was a great golden bell at the top of the stairs and at the bottom his face turned to the sky lay poor old ddead at minhla and a host of unshaven ragamuffins in khaki were keeping guard over him     no iii  the city of elephants which is governed by the great god of idleness who lives on the top of a hill the history of three great discoveries and the naughty children of iquique      i built my soul a lordly pleasurehouse       wherein at ease for aye to dwell     i said oh soul make merry and carouse       dear soul for all is well   so much for making definite programmes of travel beforehand in my first letter i told you that i would go from rangoon to penang direct now we are lying off moulmein in a new steamer which does not seem to run anywhere in particular why she should go to moulmein is a mystery but as every soul on the ship is a loafer like myself no one is discontented imagine a shipload of people to whom time is no object who have no desires beyond three meals a day and no emotions save those caused by a casual cockroach  moulmein is situated up the mouth of a river which ought to flow through south america and all manner of dissolute native craft appear to make the place their home ugly cargosteamers that the initiated call geordie tramps grunt and bellow at the beautiful hills all round and the potbellied british india liners wallow down the reaches visitors are rare in moulmeinso rare that few but cargoboats think it worth their while to come off from the shore  strictly in confidence i will tell you that moulmein is not a city of this earth at all sindbad the sailor visited it if you recollect on that memorable voyage when he discovered the burialground of the elephants  as the steamer came up the river we were aware of first one elephant and then another hard at work in timberyards that faced the shore a few narrowminded folk with binoculars said that there were mahouts upon their backs but this was never clearly proven i prefer to believe in what i sawa sleepy town just one house thick scattered along a lovely stream and inhabited by slow solemn elephants building stockades for their own diversion there was a strong scent of freshly sawn teak in the airwe could not see any elephants sawingand occasionally the warm stillness was broken by the crash of the log when the elephants had got an appetite for luncheon they loafed off in couples to their club and did not take the trouble to give us greeting and the latest mail papers at which we were much disappointed but took heart when we saw upon a hill a large white pagoda surrounded by scores of little pagodas this we said with one voice is the place to make an excursion to and then shuddered at our own profanity for above all things we did not wish to behave like mere vulgar tourists  the ticcagharies at moulmein are three sizes smaller than those of rangoon as the ponies are no bigger than decent sheep their drivers trot them uphill and down and as the ghari is extremely narrow and the roads are anything but good the exercise is refreshing here again all the drivers are madrassis  i should better remember what that pagoda was like had i not fallen deeply and irrevocably in love with a burmese girl at the foot of the first flight of steps only the fact of the steamer starting next noon prevented me from staying at moulmein forever and owning a pair of elephants these are so common that they wander about the streets and i make no doubt could be obtained for a piece of sugarcane  leaving this far too lovely maiden i went up the steps only a few yards and turning me round looked upon a view of water island broad river fair grazing ground and belted wood that made me rejoice that i was alive the hillside below me and above me was ablaze with pagodasfrom a gorgeous golden and vermilion beauty to a delicate grey stone one just completed in honour of an eminent priest lately deceased at mandalay far above my head there was a faint tinkle as of golden bells and a talking of the breezes in the tops of the toddypalms wherefore i climbed higher and higher up the steps till i reached a place of great peace dotted with burmese images spotlessly clean here women now and again paid reverence they bowed their heads and their lips moved because they were praying i had an umbrellaa black onein my hand deckshoes upon my feet and a helmet upon my head i did not prayi swore at myself for being a globetrotter and wished that i had enough burmese to explain to these ladies that i was sorry and would have taken off my hat but for the sun a globetrotter is a brute i had the grace to blush as i tramped round the pagoda that will be remembered to me for righteousness but i stared horriblyat a gold and red sidetemple with a beautifully gilt image of buddha in itat the grim figures in the niches at the base of the main pagodaat the little palms that grew out of the cracks in the tiled paving of the courtat the big palms above and at the low hung bronze bells that stood at each corner for the women to smite with staghorns upon one bell rang this amazing triplet in english evidently the composition of the caster who completed his workand now let us hope has reached nibbanthirtyfive years ago      he who destroyed this bell     they must be in the great hel     and unable to coming out  i respect a man who is not able to spell hell properly it shows that he has been brought up in an amiable creed you who come to moulmein treat this bell with respect and refrain from playing with it for that hurts the feelings of the worshippers  in the base of the pagoda were four rooms lined as to three sides with colossal plaster figures before each of whom burned one solitary dip whose rays fought with the flood of evening sunshine that came through the windows and the room was filled with a pale yellow lightunearthly to stand in occasionally a woman crept in to one of these rooms to pray but nearly all the company stayed in the courtyard but those that faced the figures prayed more zealously than the others so i judged that their troubles were the greater of the actual cult i knew less than nothing for the neatly bound english books that we read make no mention of pointing redtipped straws at a golden image or of the banging of bells after the custom of worshippers in a hindu temple it must be a genial one however to begin with it is quiet and carried on among the fairest possible surroundings that ever landscape offered  in this particular case the massive white pagoda shot into the blue from the west of a walled hill that commanded four separate and desirable views as you looked either at the steamer in the river below the polished silver reaches to the left the woods to the right or the roofs of moulmein to the landward between each pause of the rustling of dresses and the lowtoned talk of the women fell from far above the tinkle of innumerable metal leaves which were stirred by the breeze as they hung from the htee of the pagoda a golden image winked in the sun the painted ones stared straight in front of them over the heads of the worshippers and somewhere below a mallet and a plane were lazily helping to build yet another pagoda in honour of the lord of the earth  sitting in meditation while the professor went round with a sacrilegious camera to the vast terror of the burmese youth i made two notable discoveries and nearly went to sleep over them the first was that the lord of the earth is idlenessthick slab idleness with a little religion stirred in to keep it sweet and the second was that the shape of the pagoda came originally from a bulging toddypalm trunk there was one between me and the faroff sky line and it exactly duplicated the outlines of a small grey stone building  yet a third discovery and a much more important one came to me later on a dirty little imp of a boy ran by clothed more or less in a beautifully worked silk putso the like of which i had in vain attempted to secure at rangoon a bystander told me that such an article would cost one hundred and ten rupeesexactly ten rupees in excess of the price demanded at rangoon when i had been discourteous to a pretty burmese girl with diamonds in her ears and had treated her as though she were a delhi boxwallah  professor said i when the camera spidered round the corner there is something wrong with this people they wont work they arent all dacoits and their babies run about with hundredrupees putsoes on them while their parents speak the truth how in the world do they get a living  they exist beautifully said the professor and i only brought half a dozen plates with me i shall come again in the morning with some more did i ever dream of a place like this  no said i its perfect and for the life of me i cant quite see where the precise charm lies  in its beastly laziness said the professor as he packed the camera and we went away regretfully haunted by the voices of many windblown bells  not ten minutes from the pagoda we saw a real british bandstand a shanty labelled municipal office a collection of p w d bungalows that in vain strove to blast the landscape and a madras band i had never seen madrassi troops before they seem to dress just like tommies and have an air of much culture and refinement it is said that they read english books and know all about their rights and privileges for further details apply to the pegu club second table from the top on the right hand side as you enter  in an evil hour i attempted to revive the drooping trade of moulmein and to this end bound a native of the place to come on board the steamer next morn with a collection of burmese silks it was only a five minutes pull and he could have sat in the stern all the while morning came but not the man not a boat of watermelons pink fleshy watermelons neared the ship we might have been in quarantine as we slipped down the river on our way to penang i saw the elephants playing with the teak logs as solemnly and as mysteriously as ever they were the chief inhabitants and for aught i know the rulers of the place their lethargy had corrupted the town and when the professor wished to photograph them i believe they went away in scorn  we are now running down to penang with the thermometer 87° in the cabins and anything you please on deck we have exhausted all our literature drunk two hundred lemon squashes played forty different games of cards patience mostly organised a lottery on the run had it been a thousand rupees instead of ten i should not have won it and slept seventeen hours out of the twentyfour it is perfectly impossible to write but you may be morally the better for the story of the bad people of iquique which as you have not before heard i will now proceed to relate it has just been told me by a german orchidhunter fresh from nearly losing his head in the lushai hills who has been over most of the world  iquique is somewhere in south americaat the back of or beyond braziland once upon a time there came to it a tribe of aborigines from out of the woods so innocent that they wore nothing at allabsolutely nothing at all they had a grievance but no garments and the former they came to lay before his excellency the governor of iquique but the news of their coming and their exceeding nakedness had gone before them and good spanish ladies of the town agreed that the heathen should first of all be clothed so they organised a sewingbee and the result which was mainly aprons was served out to the bad people with hints as to its use nothing could have been better they appeared in their aprons before the governor and all the ladies of iquique ranged on the steps of the cathedral only to find that the governor could not grant their demands and do you know what these children of nature did in the twinkling of an eye they had off those aprons slung them round their necks and were dancing naked as the dawn before the scandalised ladies of iquique who fled with their fans before their eyes into the sanctuary of the cathedral and when the steps were deserted the bad people withdrew shouting and leaping their aprons still round their necks for good cloth is valuable property they encamped near the town knowing their own power twas impossible to send the military against them and equally impossible that donnas and señoritas should be exposed to the chance of being shocked whenever they went abroad no one knew at what hour the bad people would sweep through the streets their demands were therefore granted and iquique had rest nuda est veritas et prevalebit  but said i what is there so awful in a naked indianor two hundred naked indians for that matter  my friend said the german dey vas indians of sout america i dell you dey do not demselves shtrip vell  i put my hand on my mouth and went away     no iv  showing how i came to palmiste island and the place of paul and virginia and fell asleep in a garden a disquisition on the folly of sightseeing      some for the glories of this world and some     sigh for the prophets paradise to come     ah take the cash and let the credit go     nor heed the rumble of a distant drum   there is something very wrong in the anglosaxon character hardly had the africa dropped anchor in penang straits when two of our fellowpassengers were smitten with madness because they heard that another steamer was even then starting for singapur if they went by it they would gain several days heaven knows why time should have been so precious to them the news sent them flying into their cabins and packing their trunks as though their salvation depended upon it then they tumbled over the side and were rowed away in a sampan hot but happy they were on a pleasuretrip and they had gained perhaps three days that was their pleasure  do you recollect besants description of palmiste island in my little girl and so they were married penang is palmiste island i found this out from the ship looking at the wooded hills that dominate the town and at the regiments of palm trees three miles away that marked the coast of wellesley province the air was soft and heavy with laziness and at the ships side were boatloads of much jewelled madrassiseven those to whom besant has alluded a squall swept across the water and blotted out the rows of low redtiled houses that made up penang and the shadows of night followed the storm  i put my twelveinch rule in my pocket to measure all the world by and nearly wept with emotion when on landing at the jetty i fell against a sikha beautiful bearded sikh with white leggings and a rifle as is cold water in a thirsty land so is a face from the old country my friend had come from jandiala in the umritsar district did i know jandiala did i not i began to tell all the news i could recollect about crops and armies and the movements of big men in the far far north while the sikh beamed he belonged to the military police and it was a good service but of course it was far from the old country there was no hard work and the chinamen gave but little trouble they had fights among themselves but they do not care to give us any impudence and the big man swaggered off with the long roll and swing of a whole pioneer regiment while i cheered myself with the thought that indiathe india i pretend to hold in hatredwas not so far off after all  you know our ineradicable tendency to damn everything in the mofussil calcutta professes astonishment that allahabad has a good dancing floor allahabad wonders if it is true that lahore really has an icefactory and lahore pretends to believe that everybody in peshawar sleeps armed very much in the same way i was amused at seeing a steam tramway in rangoon and after we had quitted moulmein fully expected to find the outskirts of civilisation vanity and ignorance were severely shocked when they confronted a long street of businessa street of twostoried houses full of ticcagharies shop signs and above all jinrickshaws  you in india have never seen a proper rickshaw there are about two thousand of them in penang and no two seem alike they are lacquered with bold figures of dragons and horses and birds and butterflies their shafts are of black wood bound with white metal and so strong that the coolie sits upon them when he waits for his fare there is only one coolie but he is strong and he runs just as well as six bellmen he ties up his pigtailbeing a cantoneseand this is a disadvantage to sahibs who cannot speak tamil malay or cantonese otherwise he might be steered like a camel  the rickshaw men are patient and longsuffering the evilvisaged person who drove my carriage lashed at them when they came within whip range and did his best to drive over them as he headed for the waterfalls which are five miles away from penang town i expected that the buildings should stop choked out among the dense growth of cocoanut but they continued for many streets very like park and middleton streets in calcutta where shuttered houses which were halfbred between an indian bungalow and a rangoon rabbithutch fought with the greenery and crotons as big as small trees now and again there blazed the front of a chinese house all openwork vermilion lampblack and gold with sixfoot chinese lanterns over the doorways and glimpses of quaintly cut shrubs in the wellkept gardens beyond  we struck into roads fringed with native houses on piles shadowed by the everlasting cocoanut palms heavy with young nuts the heat was heavy with the smell of vegetation and it was not the smell of the earth after the rains some birdthing called out from the deeps of the foliage and there was a mutter of thunder in the hills which we were approaching but all the rest was very stilland the sweat ran down our faces in drops  now youve got to walk up that hill said the driver pointing to a small barrier outside a wellkept botanical garden all the carriages stop here ones limbs moved as though leaden and the breath came heavily drawing in each time the vapour of a turkish bath the soil was alive with wet and warmth and the unknown treesi was too sleepy to read the labels that some offensively energetic man has writtenwere wet and warm too up on the hillside the voice of the water was saying something but i was too sleepy to listen and on the top of the hill lay a fat cloud just like an eiderdown quilt tucking everything in safely      and in the afternoon they came unto a land     in which it seemed always afternoon  i sat down where i was for i saw that the upward path was very steep and was cut into rude steps and an exposition of sleep had come upon me i was at the mouth of a tiny gorge exactly where the lotuseaters had sat down when they began their song for i recognised the waterfall and the air round my ears breathing as one that has a weary dream  i looked and beheld that i could not give in words the genius of the place i cant play the flute but i have a cousin who plays the violin i knew a man who could some people said he was not a nice man and i might run the risk of contaminating morals but nothing mattered in such a climate see now go to the very worst of zolas novels and read there his description of a conservatory that was it several months passed away but there was neither chill nor burning heat to mark the passage of time only with a sense of acute pain i felt that i must do the waterfall and i climbed up the steps in the hillside though every boulder cried sit down until i found a small stream of water coursing down the face of a rock and a much bigger one down my own  then we went away to breakfast the stomach being always more worthy than any amount of sentiment a turn in the road hid the gardens and stopped the noise of the waters and that experience was over for all time experiences are very like cheroots they generally begin badly taste perfect half way through and at the buttend are things to be thrown away and never picked up again  his name was john and he had a pigtail five feet longall real hair and no silk braided and he kept an hotel by the way and fed us with a chicken into whose innocent flesh onions and strange vegetables had been forced till then we had feared chinamen especially when they brought food but now we will eat anything at their hands the conclusion of the meal was a halfguinea pineapple and a siesta this is a beautiful thing which we of indiabut i am of india no moredo not understand you lie down and wait for time to pass you are not in the least weariedand you would not go to sleep you are filled with a divine drowsinessquite different from the heavy sodden slumber of a hotweather sunday or the businesslike repose of a europe morning now i begin to despise novelists who write about siestas in cold climates i know what the real thing means                                       i have been trying to buy a few thingsa sarong which is a putso which is a dhoti a pipe and a damned malayan kris the sarongs come chiefly from germany the pipes from the pawnshops and there are no krises except little toothpick things that could not penetrate the hide of a malay in the native town i found a large army of chinesemore than i imagined existed in china itselfencamped in spacious streets and houses some of them sending blocktin to singapur some driving fine carriages others making shoes chairs clothes and every other thing that a large town desires they were the first army corps on the march of the mongol the scouts are at calcutta and a flying column at rangoon here begins the main body some hundred thousand strong so they say was it not de quincey that had a horror of the chineseof their inhumaneness and their inscrutability certainly the people in penang are not nice they are even terrible to behold they work hard which in this climate is manifestly wicked and their eyes are just like the eyes of their own pet dragons our hindu gods are passable some of them even jollywitness our potbellied ganesh but what can you do with a people who revel in d t monsters and crown their roofridges with flames of fire or the waves of the sea they swarmed everywhere and wherever three or four met there they eat things without namethe insides of ducks for choice our deck passengers i know fared sumptuously on offal begged from the steward and flavoured with insectpowder to keep the ants off this again is not natural for a man should eat like a man if he works like one i could quite understand after a couple of hours this has the true globetrotter twang to it spent in chinatown why the lowercaste anglosaxon hates the celestial he frightened me and so i could take no pleasure in looking at his houses at his wares or at himself  the smell of printers ink is marvellously penetrating it drew me up two pair of stairs into an office where the exchanges lay about in delightful disorder and a little handpress was clacking out proofs just in the old sweet way something like the gazette of india showed that the straits settlementseven theyhad a government of their own and i sighed for a dead past as my eye caught the beautiful official phraseology that never varies how alike we english are here is an extract from a report and the chinese form of decoration which formerly covered the office has been wisely obliterated with whitewash  that was just what i came to inquire about what were they going to do with the chinese decoration all over penang would they try to wisely obliterate that  the straits settlement council which lives at singapur had just passed a bill ordinance they call it putting down all chinese secret societies in the colony which measure only awaited the imperial assent a little business in singapur connected with some municipal measure for clearing away overhanging verandahs created a storm and for three days those who were in the place say the town was entirely at the mercy of the chinese who rose all together and made life unpleasant for the authorities this incident forced the government to take serious notice of the secret societies who could so control the actions of men and the result has been a measure which it will not be easy to enforce a chinaman must have a secret society of some kind he has been bred up in a country where they were necessary to his comfort his protection and the maintenance of his scale of wages from time immemorial and he will carry them with him as he will carry his opium and his coffin  do you expect then that the societies will collapse by proclamation i asked the editor  no there will be a row  what row what sort of a row  more troops perhaps and perhaps some gunboats you see we shall have sir charles warren then as our commanderinchief at singapur up till the present our military administration has been subordinate to that of hongkong when that is done away with and we have sir charles warren things will be different but there will be a row neither you nor i nor any one else will be able to put these things down every joss house will be the head of a secret society what can one do in the past the government made some use of them for the detection of crime now they are too big and too important to be treated in that way you will know before long whether we have been able to suppress them there will be a row  certainly the great grievance of penang is the chinese question she would not be human did she not revile her municipal commissioners and talk about the unsanitary condition of the island if nose and eyes and ears be any guide she is far cleaner even in her streets than many an indian cantonment and her watersupply seems perfection but i sat in that little newspaper office and listened to stories of municipal intrigue that might have suited serampore or calcutta only the names were a little different and in place of ghose and chuckerbutty one heard titles such as yih tat lo eng and the like the englishmans aggressive altruism always leads him to build towns for others and incite aliens to serve on municipal boards then he gets tired of his weakness and starts papers to condemn himself they had a chinaman on the municipality last year they have now got rid of him and the present body is constituted of two officials and four nonofficials therefore they complain of the influence of officialdom  having thoroughly settled all the differences of penang to my own great satisfaction i removed myself to a chinese theatre set in the open road and made of sticks and old gunnybags the orchestra alone convinced me that there was something radically wrong with the chinese mind once long ago in jummu i heard the infernal clang of the horns used by the devildancers who had come from far beyond ladakh to do honour to the prince that day set upon his throne that was about three thousand miles to the north but the character of the music was unchanged a thousand chinamen stood as close as possible to the horrid din and enjoyed it once more can anything be done to a people without nerves as without digestion and if reports speak truly without morals but it is not true that they are born with fullsized pigtails the thing grows and in its very earliest stages is the prettiest headdressing imaginable being soft brown very fluffy about three inches long and dressed as to the end with red silk an infant pigtail is just like the first tender sprout of a tulip bulb and would be lovable were not the chinese baby so very horrible of hue and shape he isnt as pretty as the pig that alice nursed in wonderland and he lies quite still and never cries this is because he is afraid of being boiled and eaten i saw cold boiled babies on a plate being carried through the heart of the town they said it was only suckingpig but i knew better dead suckingpigs dont grin with their eyes open  about this time the faces of the chinese frightened me more than ever so i ran away to the outskirts of the town and saw a windowless house that carried the square and compass in gold and teakwood above the door i took heart at meeting these familiar things again and knowing that where they were was good fellowship and much charity in spite of all the secret societies in the world penang is to be congratulated on one of the prettiest little lodges in the east     no v  of the threshold of the far east and the dwellers thereon a dissertation upon the use of the british lion      how the world is made for each of us     how all we perceive and know in it     tends to some moments productthus     when a soul declares itselfto wit     by its fruit the thing it does   i assure you sir weather as hot as this has not been felt in singapur for years and years march is always reckoned our hottest month but this is quite abnormal  and i made answer to the stranger wearily  yes of course they always told that lie in the other places leave me alone and let me drip  this is the heat of an orchidhousea clinging remorseless steamsweat that knows no variation between night and day singapur is another calcutta but much more so in the suburbs they are building rows of cheap houses in the city they run over you and jostle you into the kennel these are unfailing signs of commercial prosperity india ended so long ago that i cannot even talk about the natives of the place they are all chinese except where they are french or dutch or german england is by the uninformed supposed to own the island the rest belongs to china and the continent but chiefly china i knew i had touched the borders of the celestial empire when i was thoroughly impregnated with the reek of chinese tobacco a finecut greasy glossy weed to whose smoke the aroma of a huqa in the cookhouse is all rimmells shop  providence conducted me along a beach in full view of five miles of shippingfive solid miles of masts and funnelsto a place called raffles hotel where the food is as excellent as the rooms are bad let the traveller take note feed at raffles and sleep at the hotel de leurope i would have done this but for the apparition of two large ladies tastefully attired in bedgowns who sat with their feet propped on a chair this joseph ran but it turned out that they were dutch ladies from batavia and that that was their national costume till dinner time  if as you say they had on stockings and dressinggowns you have nothing to complain of they generally wear nothing but a nightgown till five oclock quoth a man versed in the habits of the land  i do not know whether he spoke the truth i am inclined to think that he did but now i know what batavian grace really means i dont approve of it a lady in a dressinggown disturbs the mind and prevents careful consideration of the political outlook in singapur which is now supplied with a set of very complete forts and is hopefully awaiting some nineinch breachloaders that are to adorn them there is something very pathetic in the trustful clinging attitude of the colonies who ought to have been soured and mistrustful long ago we hope the home government may do this it is possible that the home government may do that is the burden of the song and in every place where the englishman cannot breed successfully must continue to be imagine an india fit for permanent habitation by our kin and consider what a place it would be this day with the painter cut fifty years ago fifty thousand miles of railways laid down and ten thousand under survey and possibly an annual surplus is this sedition forgive me but i am looking at the shipping outside the verandah at the chinamen in the streets and at the lazy languid englishmen in banians and white jackets stretched on the cane chairs and these things are not nice the men are not really lazy as i will try to show later on but they lounge and loaf and seem to go to office at eleven which must be bad for work and they all talk about going home at indecently short intervals as though that were their right once more if we could only rear children that did not run to leg and nose in the second generation in this part of the world and one or two others what an amazing disruption of the empire there would be before half of a parnell commission sitting was accomplished and then later when the freed states had plunged into hot water fought their fights overborrowed overspeculated and otherwise conducted themselves like younger sons what a coming together and revision of tariffs ending in one great iron band girdling the earth within that limit free trade without rancorous protection it would be too vast a hornets nest for any combination of powers to disturb the dream will not come about for a long time but we shall accomplish something like it one of these days the birds of passage from canada from borneoborneo that will have to go through a general roughandtumble before she grips her possibilitiesfrom australia from a hundred scattered islands are saying the same thing we are not strong enough yet but some day we shall be  oh dear people stewing in india and swearing at all the governments it is a glorious thing to be an englishman our lot has fallen unto us in a fair ground yea we have a goodly heritage take a map and look at the long stretch of the malay peninsulaa thousand miles southerly it runs does it notwhereon penang malacca and singapur are so modestly underlined in red ink see now we have our residents at every one of the malay native states of any importance and right up the line to kedah and siam our influence regulates and controls all into this land god put first gold and tin and after these the englishman who floats companies obtains concessions and goes forward just at present one company alone holds a concession of two thousand square miles in the interior that means mining rights and that means a few thousand coolies and a settled administration such as obtains in the big indian collieries where the heads of the mines are responsible kings  with the companies will come the railroads so far the straits papers spend their space in talking about them for at present there are only twentythree or twentyfour miles of narrowgauge railway open near a civilised place called pirates creek in the peninsula the sultan of johore is or has been wavering over a concession for a railway through his country which will ultimately connect with this pirates creek line singapur is resolved ere long to bridge over the mile or mileandahalf straits between herself and the state of johore in this manner a beginning will be made of the southerly extension of colquhouns great line running let us say from singapur through the small states and siam without a break into the great indian railway systems so that a man will be able to book from here to calcutta direct anything like a business summary of the railway schemes that come up for discussion from time to time would fill a couple of these letters and would be uncommonly dry reading you know the sort of shop talk that rages among engineers when a new line is being run in india through perfectly known ground whose trafficpotentialities may be calculated to the last pie it is very much the same here with the difference that no one knows for a certainty what the country ahead of the surveys is like or where the development is likely to stop this gives breeziness to the conversation the audacity of the speakers is amazing to one who has been accustomed to see things through indian eyes they hint at running up the peninsula establishing communications here consolidating influence there and providence only knows what else but never a word do they breathe about the necessity for increased troops to stand by and back these little operations perhaps they assume that the home government will provide but it does seem strange to hear them coldbloodedly discussing notions that will inevitably demand doubled garrisons to keep the ventures out of alien hands however the merchantmen will do their work and i suppose we shall borrow three files and a sergeant from somewhere or other when the time comes and people begin to realise what sort of a gift our straits settlements are it is so cheap to prophesy they will in the near future grow into  the professor looked over my shoulder at this point bosh said he they will become just a supplementary chinaanother field for chinese cheap labour when the dutch settlements were returned in 1815all these islands hereabouts you knowwe should have handed over these places as well look he pointed at the swarming chinamen below  let me dream my dream fessor ill take my hat in a minute and settle the question of chinese immigration in five minutes but i confess it was mournful to look into the street which ought to have been full of beharis madrassis and men from the konkanfrom our india  then up and spake a sunburned man who had interests in north borneohe owned caves in the mountains some of them nine hundred feet high so please you and filled with the guano of ages and had been telling me leechstories till my flesh crawled north borneo said he calmly wants a million of labourers to do her any good one million coolies men are wanted everywherein the peninsula in sumatra for the tobacco planting in javaeverywhere but borneothe companys provinces that is to sayneeds a million coolies it is pleasant to oblige a stranger and i felt that i spoke with india at my back we could oblige you with two million or twenty for the matter of that said i generously  your men are no good said the north borneo man if one man goes away he must have a whole village to look after his wants india as a labour field is no good to us and the sumatra men say that your coolies either cant or wont tend tobacco properly we must have china coolies as the land develops  oh india oh my country this it is to have inherited a highly organised civilisation and an ancient precedence code that your children shall be scoffed at by the alien as useless outside their own potbound provinces here was a labour outlet a door to full dinners through which menyellow men with pigtailswere pouring by the ten thousand while in bengal the cultured native editor was shrieking over atrocities committed in moving a few hundred souls a few hundred miles into assam     no vi  of the welldressed islanders of singapur and their diversions proving that all stations are exactly alike shows how one chicago jew and an american child can poison the purest mind      we are not divided     all one body we     one in hope and doctrine     one in charity   when one comes to a new station the first thing to do is to call on the inhabitants this duty i had neglected preferring to consort with chinese till the sabbath when i learnt that singapur went to the botanical gardens and listened to secular music  all the englishmen in the island congregated there the botanical gardens would have been lovely at kew but here where one knew that they were the only place of recreation open to the inhabitants they were not pleasant all the plants of all the tropics grew there together and the orchidhouse was roofed with thin battens of woodjust enough to keep off the direct rays of the sun it held waxywhite splendours from manila the philippines and tropical africaplants that were halfslugs drawing nourishment apparently from their own wooden labels but there was no difference between the temperature of the orchidhouse and the open air both were heavy dank and steaming i would have given a months paybut i have no months payfor a clear breath of stifling hot wind from the sands of sirsa for the darkness of a punjab duststorm in exchange for the perspiring plants and the treefern that sweated audibly  just when i was most impressed with my measureless distance from india my carriage advanced to the sound of slow music and i found myself in the middle of an indian stationnot quite as big as allahabad and infinitely prettier than lucknow it overlooked the gardens that sloped in ridge and hollow below and the barracks were set in much greenery and there was a messhouse that suggested long and cooling drinks and there walked round about a british band it was just we our noble selves in the centre was the pretty memsahib with light hair and fascinating manners and the plump little memsahib that talks to everybody and is in everybodys confidence and the spinster fresh from home and the beanfed wellgroomed subaltern with the light coat and foxterrier on the benches sat the fat colonel and the large judge and the engineers wife and the merchantman and his family after their kindmale and female met i them and but for the little fact that they were entire strangers to me i would have saluted them all as old friends i knew what they were talking about could see them taking stock of one anothers dresses out of the corners of their eyes could see the young men backing and filling across the ground in order to walk with the young maidens and could hear the do you think sos and not reallys of our polite conversation it is an awful thing to sit in a hired carriage and watch ones own people and know that though you know their life you have neither part nor lot in it      i am a shadow now alas alas     upon the skirts of human nature dwelling  i said mournfully to the professor he was looking at mrs  or some one so like her that it came to the same thing am i travelling round the world to discover these people said he ive seen em all before theres captain suchanone and colonel suchanother and miss whatsitsname as large as life and twice as pale  the professor had hit it that was the difference people in singapur are deadwhiteas white as naamanand the veins on the backs of their hands are painted in indigo  it is as though the rains were just over and none of the womenfolk had been allowed to go to the hills yet no one talks about the unhealthiness of singapur a man lives well and happily until he begins to feel unwell then he feels worse because the climate allows him no chance of pulling himself togetherand then he dies typhoid fever appears to be one gate of death as it is in india also liver the nicest thing in the civil station which lies of course far from the native town and boasts pretty little bungalowsis thomasdear whiterobed swaggering smoking swearing thomas atkins the unchangeable who listens to the band and wanders down the bazaars and slings the unmentionable adjective about the palm trees exactly as though he were in mian mir the 58th northamptonshire live in these parts so singapur is quite safe you see  nobody would speak to me in the gardens though i felt that they ought to have invited me to drink and i crept back to my hotel to eat six different fresh chutnies with one curry                                       i want to go home i want to go back to india i am miserable the steamship nawab at this time of the year ought to have been empty instead of which we have one hundred firstclass passengers and sixtysix second all the pretty girls are in the latter class something must have happened at colombotwo steamers must have clashed we have the results of the collision and we are a menagerie the captain says that there ought to have been only ten or twelve passengers by rights and had the rush been anticipated a larger steamer would have been provided personally i consider that half our shipmates ought to be thrown overboard they are only travelling round the world for pleasure and that sort of dissipation leads to the forming of hasty and intemperate opinions anyhow give me freedom and the cockroaches of the british india where we dined on deck altered the hours of the meals by plebiscite and were lords of all we saw you know the chaingang regulations of the p and o how you must approach the captain standing on your head with your feet waving reverently how you must crawl into the presence of the chief steward on your belly and call him thricepuissant bottlewasher how you must not smoke abaft the sheeppens must not stand in the companion must put on a clean coat when the ships library is opened and crowning injustice must order your drinks for tiffin and dinner one meal in advance how can a man full of pilsener beer reach that keenset state of quiescence needful for ordering his dinner liquor this shows ignorance of human nature the p and o want healthy competition they call their captains commanders and act as though twere a favour to allow you to embark again freedom and the british india for ever and down with the comforts of a coolie ship and the prices of a palace  there are about thirty women on board and i have been watching with a certain amount of indignation their concerted attempt at killing the stewardessa delicate and sweetmannered lady i think they will accomplish their end the saloon is ninety feet long and the stewardess runs up and down it for nine hours a day in her intervals of relaxation she carries cups of beeftea to the frail sylphs who cannot exist without food between 9 am and 1 pm this morning she advanced to me and said as though it were the most natural thing in the world shall i take away your teacup sir she was a real white woman and the saloon was full of hulking halfbred portuguese one young englishman let her take his cup and actually did not turn round when he handed it this is awful and teaches me as nothing else has done how far i am from the blessed east she the stewardess talks standing up to men who sit down  we in india are currently supposed to be unkind to our servants i should very much like to see a sweeper doing onehalf of the work these strapping white matrons and maids exact from their sister they make her carry things about and dont even say thank you she has no name and if you bawl stewardess she is bound to come isnt it degrading  but the real reason of my wish to return is because i have met a lump of chicago jews and am afraid that i shall meet many more the ship is full of americans but the americangermanjew boy is the most awful of all one of them has money and wanders from bow to stern asking strangers to drink bossing lotteries on the run and committing other atrocities it is currently reported that he is dying unfortunately he does not die quickly enough  but the real monstrosity of the ship is an american who is not quite grown up i cannot call it a boy though officially it is only eight wears a striped jacket and eats with the children it has the wearied appearance of an infant monkeythere are lines round its mouth and under its eyebrows when it has nothing else to do it will answer to the name of albert it has been two years on the continuous travel has spent a month in india has seen constantinople tripoli spain has lived in tents and on horseback for thirty days and thirty nights as it was careful to inform me and has exhausted the round of this worlds delights there is no flesh on its bones and it lives in the smokingroom financing the arrangements of the daily lottery i was afraid of it but it followed me and in a level expressionless voice began to tell me how lotteries were constructed when i protested that i knew it continued without regarding the interruption and finally as a reward for my patience volunteered to give me the names and idiosyncracies of all on board then it vanished through the smokingroom window because the door was only eight feet high and therefore too narrow for that bulk of abnormal experiences on certain subjects it was partly better informed than i on others it displayed the infinite credulity of a twoyearold but the wearied eyes were ever the same they will be the same when it is fifty i was more sorry for it than i could say all its reminiscences had got jumbled and incidents of spain were baled into turkey and india some day a schoolmaster will get hold of it and try to educate it and i should dearly like to see at which end he will begin the head is too full already and thethe other part does not exist albert is i presume but an ordinary american child he was to me a revelation now i want to see a little american girlbut not nownot just now my nerves are shattered by the jews and albert and unless they recover their tone i shall turn back at yokohama     no vii  shows how i arrived in china and saw entirely through the great wall and out upon the other side                        where naked ignorance     delivers brawling judgments all day long     on all things unashamed   the past few days on the nawab have been spent amid a new people and a very strange one there were speculators from south africa financiers from home these never talked in anything under hundreds of thousands of pounds and i fear bluffed awfully there were consuls of faroff china ports and partners of china shipping houses talking a talk and thinking thoughts as different from ours as is our slang from the slang of london but it would not interest you to learn the story of our shiploadto hear about the hardheaded scotch merchant with a taste for spiritualism who begged me to tell him whether there was really anything in theosophy and whether tibet was full of levitating chelas as he believed or of the little london curate out for a holiday who had seen india and had faith in the progress of missionary work therewho believed that the c m s was shaking the thoughts and convictions of the masses and that the word of the lord would ere long prevail above all other councils he in the nightwatches tackled and disposed of the great mysteries of life and death and was looking forward to a lifetime of toil amid a parish without a single rich man in it  when you are in the china seas be careful to keep all your flannelwear to hand in an hour the steamer swung from tropical heat including prickly to a cold raw fog as wet as a scotch mist morning gave us a new worldsomewhere between heaven and earth the sea was smoked glass reddish grey islands lay upon it under fogbanks that hovered fifty feet above our heads the squat sails of junks danced for an instant like autumn leaves in the breeze and disappeared and there was no solidity in the islands against which the glassy levels splintered in snow the steamer groaned and grunted and howled because she was so damp and miserable and i groaned also because the guidebook said that hongkong had the finest harbour in the world and i could not see two hundred yards in any direction yet this ghostlike ingliding through the belted fog was livelily mysterious and became more so when the movement of the air vouchsafed us a glimpse of a warehouse and a derrick both apparently close aboard and behind them the shoulder of a mountain we made our way into a sea of flatnosed boats all manned by most muscular humans and the professor said that the time to study the chinese question was now we however were carrying a new general to these parts and nice new wellfitting uniforms came off to make him welcome and in the contemplation of things too long withheld from me i forgot about the pigtails gentlemen of the messroom who would wear linen coats on parade if you could wait till you have been a month without seeing a patroljacket or hearing a spur go lingaling and you will know why civilians want you always to wear uniform the general by the way was a nice general he did not know much about the indian army or the ways of a gentleman called roberts if i recollect aright but he said that lord wolseley was going to be commanderinchief one of these days on account of the pressing needs of our army he was a revelation because he talked about nothing but english military matters which are very very different from indian ones and are mixed up with politics  all hongkong is built on the sea face the rest is fog one muddy road runs for ever in front of a line of houses which are partly chowringhee and partly rotherhithe you live in the houses and when wearied of this walk across the road and drop into the sea if you can find a square foot of unencumbered water so vast is the accumulation of country shipping and such is its dirtiness as it rubs against the bund that the superior inhabitants are compelled to hang their boats from davits above the common craft who are greatly disturbed by a multitude of steamlaunches these ply for amusement and the pleasure of whistling and are held in such small esteem that every hotel owns one and the others are masterless beyond the launches lie more steamers than the eye can count and four out of five of these belong to us i was proud when i saw the shipping at singapur but i swell with patriotism as i watch the fleets of hongkong from the balcony of the victoria hotel i can almost spit into the water but many mariners stand below and they are a strong breed  how recklessly selfish does a traveller become we had dropped for more than ten days all the world outside our trunks and almost the first word in the hotel was john bright is dead and there has been an awful hurricane at samoa  ah indeed thats very sad but look here where do you say my rooms are at home the news would have given talk for half a day it was dismissed in half the length of a hotel corridor one cannot sit down to think with a new world humming outside the windowwith all china to enter upon and possess  a rattling of trunks in the hallsa click of heelsand the apparition of an enormous gaunt woman wrestling with a small madrassi servant yesi haf travelled everywhere and i shall travel everywhere else i go now to shanghai and pekin i have been in moldavia russia beyrout all persia colombo delhi dacca benares allahabad peshawar the ali musjid in that pass malabar singapur penang here in this place and canton i am austriancroat and i shall see the states of america and perhaps ireland i travel for ever i amhow you callveuvewidow my husband he was dead and so i am sadi am always sad und so i trafel i am alife of course but i do not live you onderstandt always sad vill you tell them the name of the ship to which they shall warf my trunks now you trafel for pleasure so i trafel because i am alone und sadalways sad  the trunks disappeared the door shut the heels clicked down the passage and i was left scratching my head in wonder how did that conversation beginwhy did it end and what is the use of meeting eccentricities who never explained themselves i shall never get an answer but that conversation is true every word of it i see now where the fragmentary school of novelists get their material from  when i went into the streets of hongkong i stepped into thick slushy london mud of the kind that strikes chilly through the boot and the rattle of innumerable wheels was as the rattle of hansoms a soaking rain fell and all the sahibs hailed rickshawsthey call them ricks hereand the wind was chillier than the rain it was the first touch of honest weather since calcutta no wonder with such a climate that hongkong was ten times livelier than singapur that there were signs of building everywhere and gasjets in all the houses that colonnades and domes were scattered broadcast and the englishmen walked as englishmen shouldhurriedly and looking forward all the length of the main street was verandahed and the europe shops squandered plate glass by the square yard nota beneas in simla so elsewhere mistrust the plate glass shops you pay for their fittings in each purchase  the same providence that runs big rivers so near to large cities puts main thoroughfares close to big hotels i went down queen street which is not very hilly all the other streets that i looked up were built in steps after the fashion of clovelly and under blue skies would have given the professor scores of good photographs the rain and the fog blotted the views each upwardclimbing street ran out in white mist that covered the sides of a hill and the downwardsloping ones were lost in the steam from the waters of the harbour and both were very strange to see hiyiyow said my rickshaw coolie and balanced me on one wheel i got out and met first a german with a beard then three jolly sailor boys from a manofwar then a sergeant of sappers then a parsee then two arabs then an american then a jew then a few thousand chinese all carrying something and then the professor  they make platesinstantaneous platesin tokio im told what dyou think of that he said why in india the survey department are the only people who make their own plates instantaneous plates in tokio think of it  i had owed the professor one for a long time after all i replied it strikes me that we have made the mistake of thinking too much of india we thought we were civilised for instance let us take a lower place this beats calcutta into a hamlet  and in good truth it did because it was clean beyond the ordinary because the houses were uniform three storied and verandahed and the pavements were of stone i met one horse very ashamed of himself who was looking after a cart on the sea road but upstairs there are no vehicles save rickshaws hongkong has killed the romance of the rickshaw in my mind they ought to be sacred to pretty ladies instead of which men go to office in them officers in full canonicals use them tars try to squeeze in two abreast and from what i have heard down at the barracks they do occasionally bring to the guardroom the drunken defaulter he falls asleep inside of it sir and saves trouble the chinese naturally have the town for their own and profit by all our building improvements and regulations their golden and red signs flame down the queens road but they are careful to supplement their own tongue by wellexecuted europe lettering i found only one exception thus          fussing garpenter       and gabinet naktr     has good gabi           nets tor sale  the shops are made to catch the sailor and the curio hunter and they succeed admirably when you come to these parts put all your money in a bank and tell the manager man not to give it you however much you ask so shall you be saved from bankruptcy  the professor and i made a pilgrimage from kee sing even unto yi king who sells the decomposed fowl and each shop was good though it sold shoes or sucking pigs there was some delicacy of carving or gilded tracery in front to hold the eye and each thing was quaint and striking of its kind a fragment of twisted roots helped by a few strokes into the likeness of huddled devils a running knop and flower cornice a dull red and gold halfdoor a split bamboo screenthey were all good and their joinings and splicings and mortisings were accurate the baskets of the coolies were good in shape and the rattan fastenings that clenched them to the polished bamboo yoke were whipped down so that there were no loose ends you could slide in and out the drawers in the slung chests of the man who sold dinners to the rickshaw coolies and the pistons of the little wooden handpumps in the shops worked accurately in their sockets  i was studying these things while the professor was roaming through carved ivories broidered silks panels of inlay tortoiseshell filigree jadetipped pipes and the god of art only knows what else  i dont think even as much of him meaning our indian craftsman as i used to do said the professor taking up a tiny ivory grotesque of a small baby trying to pull a waterbuffalo out of its wallowthe whole story of beast and baby written in the hard ivory the same thought was in both our minds we had gone near the subject once or twice before  they are a hundred times his superior in mere idealet alone execution said the professor his hand on a sketch in woods and gems of a woman caught in a gale of wind protecting her baby from its violence  yes and dont you see that they only introduce aniline dyes into things intended for us whereas he wears them on his body whenever he can what made this yellow image of a shopman here take delight in a dwarf orange tree in a turquoise blue pot i continued sorting a bundle of cheap china spoonsall good in form colour and use the bigbellied chinese lanterns above us swayed in the wind with a soft chafing of oiled paper but they made no sign and the shopkeeper in blue was equally useless  you wanchee buy heap plitty things here said he and he filled a tobaccopipe from a dull green leather pouch held at the mouth with a little bracelet of plasma or it might have been the very jade he was playing with a brownwood abacus and by his side was his daybook bound in oiled paper and the tray of indian ink with the brushes and the porcelain supports for the brushes he made an entry in his book and daintily painted in his latest transaction the chinese of course have been doing this for a few thousand years but life and its experiences is as new to me as it was to adam and i marvelled  wanchee buy reiterated the shopman after he had made his last flourish  you said i in the new tongue which i am acquiring wanchee know one piecee information blong my pidgin savvy these things have got soul you  have got how  have got one piecee soulallee same spilit no savvy this way thenyour people lookee allee same devil but makee culio allee same pocketjoss and not giving any explanation whyfor are you such a horrible contradiction  no savvy two dollar an half he said balancing a cabinet in his hand the professor had not heard his mind was oppressed with the fate of the hindu  there are three races who can work said the professor looking down the seething street where the rickshaws tore up the slush and the babel of cantonese and pidgin went up to the yellow fog in a jumbled snarl  but there is only one that can swarm i answered the hindu cuts his own throat and dies and there are too few of the sahiblog to last for ever these people work and spread they must have souls or they couldnt understand pretty things  i cant make it out said the professor they are better artists than the hinduthat carving you are looking at is japanese by the waybetter artists and stronger workmen man for man they pack close and eat everything and they can live on nothing  and ive been praising the beauties of indian art all my days it was a little disappointing when you come to think of it but i tried to console myself by the thought that the two lay so far apart there was no comparison possible and yet accuracy is surely the touchstone of all art  they will overwhelm the world said the professor calmly and he went out to buy tea  neither at penang singapur nor this place have i seen a single chinaman asleep while daylight lasted nor have i seen twenty men who were obviously loafing all were going to some definite endif it were only like the coolie on the wharf to steal wood from the scaffolding of a halfbuilt house in his own land i believe the chinaman is treated with a certain amount of carelessness not to say ferocity where he hides his love of art the heaven that made him out of the yellow earth that holds so much iron only knows his love is for little things or else why should he get quaint pendants for his pipe and at the backmost back of his shop build up for himself a bowerbirds collection of odds and ends every one of which has beauty if you hold it sufficiently close to the eye it grieves me that i cannot account for the ideas of a few hundred million men in a few hours this much however seems certain if we had control over as many chinamen as we have natives of india and had given them one tithe of the cossetting the painful pushing forward and studious even nervous regard of their interests and aspirations that we have given to india we should long ago have been expelled from or have reaped the reward of the richest land on the face of the earth a pair of my shoes have been oddly enough wrapped in a newspaper which carries for its motto the words there is no indian nation though there exists the germs of an indian nationality or something very like that this thing has been moving me to unholy laughter the great big lazy land that we nurse and wrap in cottonwool and ask every morning whether it is strong enough to get out of bed seems like a heavy soft cloud on the faraway horizon and the babble that we were wont to raise about its precious future and its possibilities no more than the talk of children in the streets who have made a horse out of a peapod and matchsticks and wonder if it will ever walk i am sadly out of conceit of mine own othernot mothercountry now that i have had my boots blacked at once every time i happened to take them off the blacker did not do it for the sake of a gratuity but because it was his work like the beaver of old he had to climb that tree the dogs were after him there was competition                                       is there really such a place as hongkong people say so but i have not yet seen it once indeed the clouds lifted and i saw a granite house perched like a cherub on nothing a thousand feet above the town it looked as if it might be the beginning of a civil station but a man came up the street and said see this fog it will be like this till september youd better go away i shall not go i shall encamp in front of the place until the fog lifts and the rain ceases at present and it is the third day of april i am sitting in front of a large coal fire and thinking of the frosty caucasusyou poor creatures in torment afar and you think as you go to office and orderlyroom that you are helping forward englands mission in the east tis a pretty delusion and i am sorry to destroy it but you have conquered the wrong country  let us annex china     no viii  of jenny and her friends showing how a man may go to see life and meet death there of the felicity of life and the happiness of corinthian kate the woman and the cholera      love and let love and so will i     but sweet for me no more with you     not while i live not though i die     good night goodby   i am entirely the man about town and sickness is no word for my sentiments it began with an idle word in a barroom it ended goodness knows where that the world should hold french german and italian ladies of the ancient profession is no great marvel but it is to one who has lived in india something shocking to meet again englishwomen in the same sisterhood when an opulent papa sends his son and heir round the world to enlarge his mind does he reflect i wonder on the places into which the innocent strolls under the guidance of equally inexperienced friends i am disposed to think that he does not in the interest of the opulent papa and from a genuine desire to see what they call life with a capital hell i went through hongkong for the space of a night i am glad that i am not a happy father with a stray son who thinks that he knows all the ropes vice must be pretty much the same all the round world over but if a man wishes to get out of pleasure with it let him go to hongkong  of course things are out and away better at frisco said my guide but we consider this very fair for the island it was not till a fat person in a black dressinggown began to squeal demands for horrible stuff called a bottle of wine that i began to understand the glory of the situation i was seeing life life is a great thing it consists in swigging sweet champagne that was stolen from a steward of the p and o and exchanging bad words with palefaced baggages who laugh demnibly without effort and without emotion the argot of the real chippy this means man of the worldanglice a halfdrunk youth with his hat on the back of his head is not easy to come at it requires an apprenticeship in america i stood appalled at the depth and richness of the american language of which i was privileged to hear a special dialect there were girls who had been to leadville and denver and the wilds of the wilder west who had acted in minor companies and who had generally misconducted themselves in a hundred weary ways they chattered like daws and shovelled down the sickly liquor that made the rooms reek as long as they talked sensibly things were amusing but a sufficiency of liquor made the mask drop and verily they swore by all their gods chief of whom is obidicut very many men have heard a white woman swear but some few and among these i have been are denied the experience it is quite a revelation and if nobody tilts you backwards out of your chair you can reflect on heaps of things connected with it so they cursed and they drank and they told tales sitting in a circle till i felt that this was really life and a thing to be quitted if i wished to like it the young man who knew a thing or two and gave the girls leave to sell him if they could was there of course and the hussies sold him as he stood for all he considered himself worth and i saw the byplay surely the safest way to be fooled is to know everything then there was an interlude and some more shrieks and howls which the generous public took as indicating immense mirth and enjoyment of life and i came to yet another establishment where the landlady lacked the half of her left lung as a cough betrayed but was none the less amusing in a dreary way until she also dropped the mask and the playful jesting began all the jokes i had heard before at the other place it is a poor sort of life that cannot spring one new jest a day more than ever did the youth cock his hat and explain that he was a real chippy and that there were no flies on him any one without a castiron head would be real chippy next morning after one glass of that sirupy champagne i understand now why men feel insulted when sweet fizz is offered to them the second interview closed as the landlady gracefully coughed us into the passage and so into the healthy silent streets she was very ill indeed and announced that she had but four months more to live  are we going to hold these dismal levees all through the night i demanded at the fourth house where i dreaded the repetition of the thricetold tales  its better in frisco must amuse the girls a little bit yknow walk round and wake em up thats life you never saw it in india was the reply  no thank god i didnt a week of this would make me hang myself i returned leaning wearily against a doorpost there were very loud sounds of revelry by night here and the inmates needed no waking up one of them was recovering from a debauch of three days and the other was just entering upon the same course providence protected me all through a certain austere beauty of countenance had made every one take me for a doctor or a parsona qualified parson i think and so i was spared many of the more pronounced jokes and could sit and contemplate the life that was so sweet i thought of the oxonian in tom and jerry playing jigs at the spinetyou seen the oldfashioned platewhile corinthian tom and corinthian kate danced a stately saraband in a little carpeted room the worst of it was the women were real women and pretty and like some people i knew and when they stopped the insensate racket for a while they were well behaved  pass for real ladies anywhere said my friend arent these things well managed  then corinthian kate began to bellow for more drinksit was three in the morningand the current of hideous talk recommenced  they spoke about themselves as gay this does not look much on paper to appreciate the full grimness of the sarcasm hear it from their lips amid their own surroundings i winked with vigour to show that i appreciated life and was a real chippy and that upon me too there were no flies there is an intoxication in company that carries a man to excess of mirth but when a party of four deliberately sit down to drink and swear the bottom tumbles out of the amusement somehow and loathing and boredom follow a nights reflection has convinced me that there is no hell for these women in another world they have their own in this life and i have been through it a little way still carrying the brevet rank of doctor it was my duty to watch through the night to the dawn a patientgay toujours gay rememberquivering on the verge of a complaint called the jumps corinthian kate will get hers later on her companion emerging from a heavy drink was more than enough for me she was an unmitigated horror until i lost detestation in genuine pity the fear of death was upon her for a reason that you shall hear  i say you say you come from india do you know anything about cholera  a little i answered the voice of the questioner was cracked and quavering a long pause  i say doctor what are the symptoms of cholera a woman died just over the street there last week  this is pleasant i thought but i must remember that it is life  she died last weekcholera my god i tell you she was dead in six hours i guess ill get cholera too i cant though can i i thought i had it two days ago it hurt me terribly i cant get it can i it never attacks people twice does it oh say it doesnt and be damned to you doctor what are the symptoms of cholera  i waited till she had detailed her own attack assured her that these and no others were the symptoms andmay this be set to my creditthat cholera never attacked twice this soothed her for ten minutes then she sprang up with an oath and shrieked  i wont be buried in hongkong that frightens me when i dieof choleratake me to frisco and bury me there in friscolone mountain friscoyou hear doctor  i heard and promised outside the birds were beginning to twitter and the dawn was pencilling the shutters  i say doctor did you ever know cora pearl  knew of her i wondered whether she was going to walk round the room to all eternity with her eyes glaring at the ceiling and her hands twisting and untwisting one within the other  well she began in an impressive whisper it was young duval shot himself on her mat and made a bloody mess there i mean real bloody you dont carry a pistol doctor savile did you didnt know savile he was my husband in the states but im english pure english thats what i am lets have a bottle of wine im so nervous not good for me what theno youre a doctor you know whats good against cholera tell me tell me  she crossed to the shutters and stared out her hand upon the bolt and the bolt clacked against the wood because of the tremulous hand  i tell you corinthian kates drunkfull as she can hold shes always drinking did you ever see my shoulderthese two marks on it they were given me by a mana gentlemanthe night before last i didnt fall against any furniture he struck me with his cane twice the beast the beast the beast if i had been full id have knocked the dust out of him the beast but i only went into the verandah and cried fit to break my heart oh the beast  she paced the room chafing her shoulder and crooning over it as though it were an animal then she swore at the man then she fell into a sort of stupor but moaned and swore at the man in her sleep and wailed for her amah to come and dress her shoulder  asleep she was not unlovely but the mouth twitched and the body was shaken with shiverings and there was no peace in her at all daylight showed her purpleeyed slackcheeked and staring racked with a headache and the nervous twitches indeed i was seeing life but it did not amuse me for i felt that i though i only made capital of her extreme woe was guilty equally with the rest of my kind that had brought her here  then she told lies at least i was informed that they were lies later on by the real man of the world they related to herself and her people and if untrue must have been motiveless for all was sordid and sorrowful though she tried to gild the page with a book of photos which linked her to her past not being a man of the world i prefer to believe that the tales were true and thank her for the honour she did me in the telling  i had fancied that the house had nothing sadder to show me than her face here was i wrong corinthian kate had really been drinking and rose up reeling drunk which is an awful thing to witness and makes ones head ache sympathetically something had gone wrong in the slatternly menage where the plated teaservices were mixed with cheap china and the household was being called to account i watched her clutching the mosquito net for support a horror and an offence in the eye of the guiltless day i heard her swear in a thick sodden voice as i have never yet heard a man swear and i marvelled that the house did not thunder in on our heads her companion interposed but was borne down by a torrent of blasphemy and the half a dozen little dogs that infested the room removed themselves beyond reach of corinthian kates hand or foot that she was a handsome woman only made the matter worse the companion collapsed shivering on one of the couches and kate swayed to and fro and cursed god and man and earth and heaven with puffed lips if alma tadema could have painted heran arrangement in white black hair flashing eyes and bare feetwe should have seen the true likeness of the eternal priestess of humanity or she would have been better drawn when the passion was over tottering across the room a champagne glass held high above her head shouting at ten oclock in the morning for some more of the infamous brewage that was even then poisoning the air of the whole house she got her liquor and the two women sat down to share it together that was their breakfast  i went away very sick and miserable and as the door closed i saw the two drinking  out and away better in frisco said the real chippy one but you see they are awfully nicecould pass for ladies any time they like i tell you a man has to go round and keep his eyes open among them when hes seeing a little sporting life  i have seen all that i wish to see and henceforward i will pass there may be better champagne and better drinkers in frisco and elsewhere but the talk will be the same and the mouldiness and staleness of it all will be the same till the end of time if this be life give me a little honest death without drinks and without foul jesting anyway you look at it tis a poor performance badly played and too near to a tragedy to be pleasant but it seems to amuse the young man wandering about the world and i cannot believe that it is altogether good for himunless indeed it makes him fonder of his home  and mine was the greater sin i was driven by no gust of passion but went in cold blood to make my account of this inferno and to measure the measureless miseries of life for the wholly insignificant sum of thirty dollars i had purchased information and disgust more than i required and the right to look after a woman half crazed with drink and fear the third part of a terrible night mine was the greater sin  when we stepped back into the world i was glad that the fog stood between myself and the heaven above     no ix  some talk with a taipan and a general proves in what manner a sea picnic may be a success      i should like to rise and go     where the golden apples grow     where beneath another sky     parrotislands anchored lie      r l stevenson   hongkong was so much alive so built so lighted and so bloatedly rich to all outward appearance that i wanted to know how these things came about you cant lavish granite by the cubic ton for nothing or rivet your cliffs with portland cement or build a fivemile bund or establish a club like a small palace i sought a taipan which means the head of an english trading firm he was the biggest taipan on the island and quite the nicest he owned ships and wharves and houses and mines and a hundred other things to him said i  o taipan i am a poor person from calcutta and the liveliness of your place astounds me how is it that every one smells of money whence come your municipal improvements and why are the white men so restless  said the taipan it is because the island is going ahead mightily because everything pays observe this sharelist  he took me down a list of thirty or less companiessteamlaunch companies mining ropeweaving dock trading agency and general companiesand with five exceptions all the shares were at premiumsome a hundred some five hundred and others only fifty  it is not a boom said the taipan it is genuine nearly every man you meet in these parts is a broker and he floats companies  i looked out of the window and beheld how companies were floated three men with their hats on the back of their heads converse for ten minutes to these enters a fourth with a pocketbook then all four dive into the hongkong hotel for material wherewith to float themselves andthere is your company  from these things said the taipan comes the wealth of hongkong every notion here pays from the dairyfarm upwards we have passed through our bad times and come to the fat years  he told me tales of the old timespityingly because he knew i could not understand all i could tell was that the place dressed by americafrom the haircutters saloons to the liquorbars the faces of men were turned to the golden gate even while they floated most of the singapur companies there is not sufficient push in singapur alone so hongkong helps circulars of new companies lay on the bank counters i moved amid a maze of interests that i could not comprehend and spoke to men whose minds were at hankow foochoo amoy or even furtherbeyond the yangtze gorges where the englishman trades  after a while i escaped from the companyfloaters because i knew i could not understand them and ran up a hill hongkong is all hill except when the fog shuts out everything except the sea tree ferns sprouted on the ground and azaleas mixed with the ferns and there were bamboos over all consequently it was only natural that i should find a tramway that stood on its head and waved its feet in the mist they called it the victoria gap tramway and hauled it up with a rope it ran up a hill into space at an angle of 65° and to those who have seen the rigi mount washington a switchback railway and the like would not have been impressive but neither you nor i have ever been hauled from annandale to the chaura maidàn in a beeline with a fivehundredfoot drop on the offside and we are at liberty to marvel it is not proper to run up inclined ways at the tail of a string more especially when you cannot see two yards in front of you and all earth below is a swirling cauldron of mist nor unless you are warned of the opticalness of the delusion is it nice to see from your seat houses and trees at magiclantern angles such things before tiffin are worse than the long roll of the china seas  they turned me out twelve hundred feet above the city on the military road to dalhousie as it will be when india has a surplus then they brought me a glorified dandy which not knowing any better they called a chair except that it is too long to run corners easily a chair is vastly superior to a dandy it is more like a bombay side tonjonthe kind we use at mahableshwar you sit in a wicker chair slung low on ten feet of elastic wooden shafting and there are light blinds against the rain  we are now said the professor as he wrung out his hat gemmed with the dews of the driving mist we are now on a pleasure trip this is the road to chakrata in the rains  nay said i it is from solon to kasauli that we are going look at the black rocks  bosh said the professor this is a civilised country look at the road look at the railingslook at the gutters  and as i hope never to go to solon again the road was cemented the railings were of iron mortised into granite blocks and the gutters were paved twas no wider than a hillpath but if it had been the viceroys pet promenade it could not have been better kept there was no view that was why the professor had taken his camera we passed coolies widening the road and houses shut up and deserted solid squat little houses made of stone with pretty names after our hillstation customtownend craggylands and the likeand at these things my heart burned within me hongkong has no right to mix itself up with mussoorie in this fashion we came to the meetingplace of the winds eighteen hundred feet above all the world and saw forty miles of clouds that was the peakthe great viewplace of the island a laundry on a washing day would have been more interesting  let us go down professor said i and well get our money back this isnt a view  we descended by the marvellous tramway each pretending to be as little upset as the other and started in pursuit of a chinese buryingground  go to the happy valley said an expert the happy valley where the racecourse and the cemeteries are  its mussoorie said the professor i knew it all along  it was mussoorie though we had to go through a halfmile of portsmouth hard first soldiers grinned at us from the verandahs of their most solid threestoried barracks all the bluejackets of all the china squadron were congregated in the royal navy seamans club and they beamed upon us the bluejacket is a beautiful creature and very healthy but  i gave my heart to thomas atkins long ago and him i love  by the way how is it that a highland regimentthe argyll and southerlandshire for instanceget such good recruits do the kilt and sporran bring in brawny youngsters of fivefoot nine and thirtynine inch round the chest the navy draws wellbuilt men also how is it that our infantry regiments fare so badly  we came to the happy valley by way of a monument to certain dead englishmen such things cease to move emotion after a little while they are but the seed of the great harvest whereof our childrens children shall assuredly reap the fruits the men were killed in a fight or by disease we hold hongkong and by our strength and wisdom it is a great city built upon a rock and furnished with a dear little sevenfurlong racecourse set in the hills and fringed as to one side with the homes of the deadmahometan christian and parsee a wall of bamboos shuts off the course and the grandstand from the cemeteries it may be good enough for hongkong but would you care to watch your pony running with a grim reminder of gone to the drawer not fifty feet behind you very beautiful are the cemeteries and very carefully tended the rocky hillside rises so near to them that the more recent dead can almost command a view of the racing as they lie even this far from the strife of the churches they bury the different sects of christians apart one creed paints its wall white and the other blue the latter as close to the racestand as may be writes in straggling letters hodie mihi cras tibi no i should not care to race in hongkong the scornful assemblage behind the grandstand would be enough to ruin any luck  chinamen do not approve of showing their cemeteries we hunted ours from ledge to ledge of the hillsides through crops and woods and crops again till we came to a village of black and white pigs and riven red rocks beyond which the dead lay it was a thirdrate place but was pretty i have studied that oilskin mystery the chinaman for at least five days and why he should elect to be buried in good scenery and by what means he knows good scenery when he sees it i cannot fathom but he gets it when the sight is taken from him and his friends fire crackers above him in token of the triumph  that night i dined with the taipan in a palace they say the merchant prince of calcutta is deadkilled by exchange hongkong ought to be able to supply one or two samples the funny thing in the midst of all this wealthwealth such as one reads about in novelsis to hear the curious deference that is paid to calcutta console yourselves with that gentlemen of the ditch for by my faith it is the one thing that you can boast of at this dinner i learned that hongkong was impregnable and that china was rapidly importing twelve and forty ton guns for the defence of her coasts the one statement i doubted but the other was truth those who have occasion to speak of china in these parts do so deferentially as who should say germany intends such and such or these are the views of russia the very men who talk thus are doing their best to force upon the great empire all the stimulants of the westrailways tram lines and so forth what will happen when china really wakes up runs a line from shanghai to lhassa starts another line of imperial yellow flag immigrant steamers and really works and controls her own gunfactories and arsenals the energetic englishmen who ship the fortytonners are helping to this end but all they say is were well paid for what we do theres no sentiment in business and anyhow china will never go to war with england indeed there is no sentiment in business the taipans palace full of all things beautiful and flowers more lovely than the gemlike cabinets they adorned would have made happy half a hundred young men craving for luxury and might have made them writers singers and poets it was inhabited by men with big heads and straight eyes who sat among the splendours and talked business  if i were not going to be a burman when i die i would be a taipan at hongkong he knows so much and he deals so largely with princes and powers and he has a flag of his very own which he pins on to all his steamers  the blessed chance that looks after travellers sent me next day on a picnic and all because i happened to wander into the wrong house this is quite true and very like our angloindian ways of doing things  perhaps said the hostess this will be our only fine day let us spend it in a steamlaunch  forthwith we embarked upon a new worldthat of hongkong harbourand with a dramatic regard for the fitness of things our little ship was the pioneer the picnic included the new generalhe that came from england in the nawab and told me about lord wolseleyand his aidedecamp who was quite english and altogether different from an indian officer he never once talked shop and if he had a grievance hid it behind his mustache  the harbour is a great world in itself photographs say that it is lovely and this i can believe from the glimpses caught through the mist as the pioneer worked her way between the lines of junks the tethered liners the wallowing coal hulks the trim lowlying american corvette the orontes huge and ugly the cockchafer almost as small as its namesake the ancient threedecker converted into a military hospitalthomas gets change of air thusand a few hundred thousand sampans manned by women with babies tied on to their backs then we swept down the sea face of the city and saw that it was great till we came to an unfinished fort high up on the side of a green hill and i watched the new general as men watch an oracle have i told you that he is an engineer general specially sent out to attend to the fortifications he looked at the raw earth and the granite masonry and there was keen professional interest in his eye perhaps he would say something i edged nearer in that hope he did  sherry and sandwiches thanks i will stonishing how hungry the seaair makes a man feel quoth the general and we went along under the greygreen coast looking at stately country houses made of granite where jesuit fathers and opulent merchants dwell it was the mashobra of this simla it was also the highlands it was also devonshire and it was specially grey and chilly  never did pioneer circulate in stranger waters on the one side was a bewildering multiplicity of islets on the other the deeply indented shores of the main island sometimes running down to the sea in little sandy coves at others falling sheer in cliff and seaworn cave full of the boom of the breakers behind rose the hills into the mist the everlasting mist  we are going to aberdeen said the hostess then to stanley and then across the island on foot by way of the titam reservoir that will show you a lot of the country  we shot into a fiord and discovered a brown fishing village which kept sentry over two docks and a sikh policeman all the inhabitants were rosycheeked women each owning onethird of a boat and a whole baby wrapped up in red cloth and tied to the back the mother was dressed in blue for a reasonif her husband whacked her over the shoulders he would run a fair chance of crushing the babys head unless the infant were of a distinct colour  then we left china altogether and steamed into far lochaber with a climate to correspond good people under the punkah think for a moment of cloudveiled headlands running out into a steelgrey sea crisped with a cheekrasping breeze that makes you sit down under the bulwarks and gasp for breath think of the merry pitch and roll of a small craft as it buzzes from island to island or venturously cuts across the mouth of a milewide bay while you mature amid fresh scenery fresh talk and fresh faces an appetite that shall uphold the credit of the great empire in a strange land once more we found a village which they called stanley but it was different from aberdeen tenantless buildings of brownstone stared seaward from the low downs and there lay behind them a stretch of weatherbeaten wall no need to ask what these things meant they cried aloud it is a deserted cantonment and the population is in the cemetery  i asked what regiment  the ninetysecond i think said the general but that was in the old timesin the sixties i believe they quartered a lot of troops here and built the barracks on the ground and the fever carried all the men off like flies isnt it a desolate place  my mind went back to a neglected graveyard a stones throw from jehangirs tomb in the gardens of shalimar where the cattle and the cowherd look after the last restingplaces of the troops who first occupied lahore we are a great people and very strong but we build our empire in a wasteful manneron the bones of the dead that have died of disease  but about the fortifications general is it true that etc etc  the fortifications are right enough as things go what we want is men  how many  say about three thousand for the islandenough to stop any expedition that might come look at all these little bays and coves there are twenty places at the back of the island where you could land men and make things unpleasant for hongkong  but i ventured isnt it the theory that any organised expedition ought to be stopped by our fleet before it got here whereas the forts are supposed to prevent cutting out shelling and ransoming by a disconnected manofwar or two  if you go on that theory said the general the menofwar ought to be stopped by our fleets too thats all nonsense if any power can throw troops here you want troops to turn em out anddont we wish we may get them  and you your command here is for five years isnt it  oh no eighteen months ought to see me out i dont want to stick here for ever ive other notions for myself said the general scrambling over the boulders to get at his tiffin  and that is just the worst of it here was a nice general helping to lay out fortifications with one eye on hongkong and the other his right one on england he would be more than human not to sell himself and his orders for the command of a brigade in the next english affair he would be afraid of being too long away from home lest he should drop out of the running and  well we are just the same in india and there is not the least hope of raising a legion of the lost for colonial serviceof men who would do their work in one place for ever and look for nothing beyond it but remember that hongkongwith five million tons of coal five miles of shipping docks wharves huge civil station forty million pounds of trade and the nicest picnic parties that you ever did seewants three thousand men andshe wont get them she has two batteries of garrison artillery a regiment and a lot of gun lascarsabout enough to prevent the guns from rusting on their carriages there are three forts on an islandstonecutters islandbetween hongkong and the mainland three on hongkong itself and three or four scattered about elsewhere naturally the full complement of guns has not arrived even in india you cannot man forts without trained gunners but tiffin under the lee of a rock was more interesting than colonial defence a man cannot talk politics if he be empty  our one fine day shut in upon the empty plates in wind and rain and the march across the island began  as the launch was blotted out in the haze we squelched past sugarcane crops and fat pigs past the bleak cemetery of dead soldiers on the hill across a section of moor till we struck a hillroad above the sea the views shifted and changed like a kaleidoscope first a shaggy shoulder of land tufted with dripping rushes and naught above beneath or around but mist and the straight spikes of the rain then red road swept by water that fell into the unknown then a combe straight walled almost as a house at the bottom of which crawled the jadegreen sea then a vista of a bay a bank of white sand and a redsailed junk beating out before the squall then only wet rock and fern and the voice of thunder calling from peak to peak  a landward turn in the road brought us to the pine woods of theog and the rhododendronsbut they called them azaleasof simla and ever the rain fell as though it had been july in the hills instead of april at hongkong an invading army marching upon victoria would have a sad time of it even if the rain did not fall there are but one or two gaps in the hills through which it could travel and there is a scheme in preparation whereby they shall be cut off and annihilated when they come when i had to climb a clay hill backwards digging my heels into the dirt i very much pitied that invading army  whether the granitefaced reservoir and twomile tunnel that supplies hongkong with water be worth seeing i cannot tell there was too much water in the air for comfort even when one tried to think of home  but go you and take the same walkten miles and only two of em on level ground steam to the forsaken cantonment of stanley and cross the island and tell me whether you have seen anything so wild and wonderful in its way as the scenery i am going up the river to canton and cannot stay for wordpaintings     no x  shows how i came to goblin market and took a scunner at it and cursed the chinese people shows further how i initiated all hongkong into our fraternity   providence is pleased to be sarcastic it sent rain and a raw wind from the beginning till the end that is one of the disadvantages of leaving india you cut yourself adrift from the only trustworthy climate in the world i despise a land that has to waste half its time in watching the clouds the canton trip i have been that way introduces you to the american river steamer which is not in the least like one of the irrawaddy flotilla or an omnibus as many people believe it is composed almost entirely of white paint sheetlead a cowhorn and a walkingbeam and holds about as much cargo as a p and o the trade between canton and hongkong seems to be immense and a steamer covers the ninety miles between port and port daily none the less are the chinese passengers daily put under hatches or its equivalent after they leave port and daily is the stand of loaded sniders in the cabin inspected and cleaned up daily too i should imagine the captain of each boat tells his globetrotting passengers the venerable story of the looting of a river steamerhow two junks fouled her at a convenient bend in the river while the native passengers on her rose and made things very lively for the crew and ended by clearing out that steamer the chinese are a strange people they had a difficulty at hongkong not very long ago about photographing labour coolies and in the excitement which was considerable a rickety old war junk got into position off the bund with the avowed intention of putting a threepound shot through the windows of the firm who had suggested the photographing and this though vessel and crew could have been blown in cigaretteash in ten minutes  but no one pirated the honam though the passengers did their best to set her on fire by upsetting the lamps of their opium pipes she blared her unwieldy way across the packed shipping of the harbour and ran into grey mist and driving rain when i say that the scenery was like the west highlands you will by this time understand what i mean large screw steamers china pigboats very low in the water and choked with livestock wallowing junks and ducking sampans filled the waterways of a stream as broad as the hughli and much better defended so far as the art of man was concerned their little difficulty with the french a few years ago has taught the chinese a great many things which perhaps it were better for us that they had left alone  the first striking object of canton city is the double tower of the big catholic church take off your hat to this because it means a great deal and stands as the visible standard of a battle that has yet to be fought never have the missionaries of the mother of the churches wrestled so mightily with any land as with china and never has nation so scientifically tortured the missionary as has china perhaps when the books are audited somewhere else each race the white and the yellow will be found to have been right according to their lights  i had taken one fair look at the city from the steamer and threw up my cards i cant describe this place and besides i hate chinamen  bosh it is only benares magnified about eight times come along  it was benares without any wide streets or chauks and yet darker than benares in that the little skyline was entirely blocked by tier on tier of hanging signsred gold black and white the shops stood on granite plinths pukka brick above and tileroofed their fronts were carved wood gilt and coloured savagely john knows how to dress a shop though he may sell nothing more lovely than smashed fowl and chitterlings every other shop was a restaurant and the space between them crammed with humanity do you know those horrible sponges full of worms that grow in warm seas you break off a piece of it and the worms break too canton was that sponge hi low yah to hoh wang yelled the chairbearers to the crowd but i was afraid that if the poles chipped the corner of a house the very bricks would begin to bleed hongkong showed me how the chinaman could work canton explained why he set no value on life the article was cheaper than in india i hated the chinaman before i hated him doubly as i choked for breath in his seething streets where nothing short of the pestilence could clear a way there was of course no incivility from the people but the mere mob was terrifying there are three or four places in the world where it is best for an englishman to agree with his adversary swiftly whatever the latters nationality may be canton heads the list never argue with anybody in canton let the guide do it for you then the stinks rose up and overwhelmed us in this respect canton was benares twenty times magnified the hindu is a sanitating saint compared to the chinaman he is a rigid malthusian in the same regard  very bad stink this place you come right along said ah cum who had learned his english from americans he was very kind he showed me featherjewellery shops where men sat pinching from the gorgeous wings of jays tiny squares of blue and lilac feathers and pasting them into gold settings so that the whole looked like jeypore enamel of the rarest but we went into a shop ah cum drew us inside the big door and bolted it while the crowd blocked up the windows and shutterbars i thought more of the crowd than the jewellery the city was so dark and the people were so very many and so unhuman  the march of the mongol is a pretty thing to write about in magazines hear it once in the gloom of an ancient curio shop where nameless devils of the chinese creed make mouths at you from backshelves where brazen dragons revelations of uncleanliness all catch your feet as you stumble across the floorhear the tramp of the feet on the granite blocks of the road and the breaking wave of human speech that is not human watch the yellow faces that glare at you between the bars and you will be afraid as i was afraid  its beautiful work said the professor bending over a cantonese petticoata wonder of pale green blue and silver now i understand why the civilised european of irish extraction kills the chinaman in america it is justifiable to kill him it would be quite right to wipe the city of canton off the face of the earth and to exterminate all the people who ran away from the shelling the chinaman ought not to count  i had gone off on my own train of thought and it was a black and bitter one  why on earth cant you look at the lions and enjoy yourself and leave politics to the men who pretend to understand em said the professor  its no question of politics i replied this people ought to be killed off because they are unlike any people i ever met before look at their faces they despise us you can see it and they arent a bit afraid of us either  then ah cum took us by ways that were dark to the temple of the five hundred genii which was one of the sights of the rabbitwarren this was a buddhist temple with the usual accessories of altars and altar lights and colossal figures of doorkeepers at the gates round the inner court runs a corridor lined on both sides with figures about half lifesize representing most of the races of asia several of the jesuit fathers are said to be in that galleryyou can find it all in the guidebooksand there is one image of a jollylooking soul in a hat and full beard but like the others naked to the waist that european gentleman said ah cum that marco polo make the most of him i said the time is coming when there will be no european gentlemennothing but yellow people with black heartsblack hearts ah cumand a devilborn capacity for doing more work than they ought  come and see a clock said he old clock it runs by water come on right along he took us to another temple and showed us an old waterclock of four gurrahs just the same sort of thing as they have in outoftheway parts of india for the use of the watchmen the professor vows that the machine which is supposed to give the time to the city is regulated by the bells of the steamers in the river canton water being too thick to run through anything smaller than a halfinch pipe from the pagoda of this temple we could see that the roofs of all the houses below were covered with filled waterjars there is no sort of fire organisation in the city when lighted it burns till it stops  ah cum led us to the potters field where the executions take place the chinese slay by the hundred and far be it from me to say that such generosity of bloodshed is cruel they could afford to execute in canton alone at the rate of ten thousand a year without disturbing the steady flow of population an executioner who happened to be wandering aboutperhaps in search of employmentoffered us a sword under guarantee that it had cut off many heads keep it i said keep it and let the good work go on my friend you cannot execute too freely in this land you are blessed i apprehend with a purely literary bureaucracy recruitedcorrect me if i am wrongfrom all social strata more especially those in which the idea of coldblooded cruelty has as it were become embedded now when to inherited devildom is superadded a purely literary education of grim and formal tendencies the result my evillooking friendthe result i repeatis a state of affairs which is faintly indicated in the little pilgrims account of the hell of selfishness you i presume have not yet read the works of the little pilgrim  he looks as if he was going to cut at you with that sword said the professor come away and see the temple of horrors  that was a sort of chinese madame tussaudslifelike models of men being brayed in mortars sliced fried toasted stuffed and variously bedevilledthat made me sick and unhappy but the chinese are merciful even in their tortures when a man is ground in a mill he is according to the models popped in head first this is hard on the crowd who are waiting to see the fun but it saves trouble to the executioners a halfground man has to be carefully watched or else he wriggles out of his place to crown all we went to the prison which was a pesthouse in a back street the professor shuddered its all right i said the people who sent the prisoners here dont care the men themselves look hideously miserable but i suppose they dont care and goodness knows i dont care they are only chinamen if they treat each other like dogs why should we regard em as human beings let em rot i want to get back to the steamer i want to get under the guns of hongkong phew  then we ran through a succession of secondrate streets and houses till we reached the city wall on the west by a long flight of steps it was clean here the wall had a drop of thirty or forty feet to paddy fields beyond these were a semicircle of hills every square yard of which is planted out with graves her dead watch canton the abominable and the dead are more than the myriads living on the grassgrown top of the wall were rusty english guns spiked and abandoned after the war they ought not to be there a fivestoried pagoda gave us a view of the city but i was wearied of these rats in their pitwearied and scared and sullen the excellent ah cum led us to the viceroys summer gardenhouse on the cityward slope of an azaleacovered hill surrounded by cotton trees the basement was a handsome joss house upstairs was a durbarhall with glazed verandahs and ebony furniture ranged across the room in four straight lines it was only an oasis of cleanliness ten minutes later we were back in the swarming city cut off from light and sweet air once or twice we met a mandarin with thin official mustache and little red button atop ah cum was explaining the nature and properties of a mandarin when we came to a canal spanned by an english bridge and closed by an iron gate which was in charge of a hongkong policeman we were in an indian station with europe shops and parsee shops and everything else to match this was english canton with two hundred and fifty sahibs in it twould have been better for a gatling behind the bridge gate the guidebooks tell you that it was taken from the chinese by the treaty of 1860 the french getting a similar slice of territory owing to the binding power of french officialism la concession française has never been let or sold to private individuals and now a chinese regiment squats on it the men who travel tell you somewhat similar tales about land in saigon and cambodia something seems to attack a frenchman as soon as he dons a colonial uniform let us call it the redtapeworm  now where did you go and what did you see said the professor in the style of the pedagogue when we were once more on the honam and returning as fast as steam could carry us to hongkong  a big blue sink of a city full of tunnels all dark and inhabited by yellow devils a city that doré ought to have seen im devoutly thankful that im never going back there the mongol will begin to march in his own good time i intend to wait until he marches up to me let us go away to japan by the next boat  the professor says that i have completely spoiled the foregoing account by what he calls intemperate libels on a hardworking nation he did not see canton as i saw itthrough the medium of a fevered imagination  once before i got away i climbed to the civil station of hongkong which overlooks the town there in sumptuous stone villas built on the edge of the cliff and facing shaded roads in a wilderness of beautiful flowers and a hushed calm unvexed even by the roar of the traffic below the residents do their best to imitate the life of an india upcountry station they are better off than we are at the bandstand the ladies dress all in one pieceshoes gloves and umbrellas come out from england with the dress and every memsahib knows what that meansbut the mechanism of their life is much the same in one point they are superior the ladies have a club of their very own to which i believe men are only allowed to come on sufferance at a dance there are about twenty men to one lady and there are practically no spinsters in the island the inhabitants complain of being cooped in and shut up they look at the sea below them and they long to get away they have their at homes on regular days of the week and everybody meets everybody else again and again they have amateur theatricals and they quarrel and all the men and women take sides and the station is cleaved asunder from the top to the bottom then they become reconciled and write to the local papers condemning the local critics criticism isnt it touching a lady told me these things one afternoon and i nearly wept from sheer homesickness  and then you know after she had said that he was obliged to give the part to the other and that made them furious and the races were so near that nothing could be done and mrs  said that it was altogether impossible you understand how very unpleasant it must have been do you not  madam said i i do i have been there before my heart goes out to hongkong in the name of the great indian mofussil i salute you henceforward hongkong is one of us ranking before meerut but after allahabad at all public ceremonies and parades  i think she fancied i had sunstroke but you at any rate will know what i mean  we do not laugh any more on the p and o s s ancona on the way to japan we are deathly sick because there is a crosssea beneath us and a wet sail above the sail is to steady the ship who refuses to be steadied she is full of globetrotters who also refuse to be steadied a globetrotter is extreme cosmopolitan he will be sick anywhere     no xi  of japan at ten hours sight containing a complete account of the manners and customs of its people a history of its constitution products art and civilisation and omitting a meal in a teahouse with otoyo      thou canst not wave thy staff in air     or dip thy paddle in the lake     but it carves the bow of beauty there     and ripples in rhyme the oar forsakeemerson   this morning after the sorrows of the rolling night my cabin porthole showed me two great grey rocks studded and streaked with green and crowned by two stunted blueblack pines below the rocks a boat that might have been carved sandal wood for colour and delicacy was shaking out an ivorywhite frilled sail to the wind of the morning an indigoblue boy with an old ivory face hauled on a rope rock and tree and boat made a panel from a japanese screen and i saw that the land was not a lie this good brown earth of ours has many pleasures to offer her children but there be few in her gift comparable to the joy of touching a new country a completely strange race and manners contrary though libraries may have been written aforetime each new beholder is to himself another cortez and i was in japanthe japan of cabinets and joinery gracious folk and fair manners japan whence the camphor and the lacquer and the sharkskin swords come among what was it the books saida nation of artists to be sure we should only stop at nagasaki for twelve hours ere going on to kobé but in twelve hours one can pack away a very fair collection of new experiences  an execrable man met me on the deck with a paleblue pamphlet fifty pages thick have you said he seen the constitution of japan the emperor made it himself only the other day it is on entirely european lines  i took the pamphlet and found a complete paper constitution stamped with the imperial chrysanthemuman excellent little scheme of representation reforms payment of members budget estimates and legislation it is a terrible thing to study at close quarters because it is so pitifully english  there was a yellowshot greenness upon the hills round nagasaki different so my willing mind was disposed to believe from the green of other lands it was the green of a japanese screen and the pines were screen pines the city itself hardly showed from the crowded harbour it lay low among the hills and its business facea grimy bundwas sloppy and deserted business i was rejoiced to learn was at a low ebb in nagasaki the japanese should have no concern with business close to one of the still wharves lay a ship of the bad people a russian steamer down from vladivostok her decks were cumbered with raffle of all kinds her rigging was as frowsy and draggled as the hair of a lodginghouse slavey and her sides were filthy  that said a man of my people is a very fair specimen of a russian you should see their menofwar they are just as filthy some of em come into nagasaki to clean  it was a small piece of information and perhaps untrue but it put the roof to my good humour as i stepped on to the bund and was told in faultless english by a young gentleman with a plated chrysanthemum in his forage cap and badly fitting german uniform on his limbs that he did not understand my language he was a japanese customs official had our stay been longer i would have wept over him because he was a hybridpartly french partly german and partly americana tribute to civilisation all the japanese officials from police upwards seem to be clad in europe clothes and never do those clothes fit i think the mikado made them at the same time as the constitution they will come right in time  when the rickshaw drawn by a beautiful applecheeked young man with a basque face shot me into the mikado first act i did not stop and shout with delight because the dignity of india was in my keeping i lay back on the velvet cushions and grinned luxuriously at pittising with her sash and three giant hairpins in her blueblack hair and threeinch clogs on her feet she laughedeven as did the burmese girl in the old pagoda at moulmein and her laugh the laugh of a lady was my welcome to japan can the people help laughing i think not you see they have such thousands of children in their streets that the elders must perforce be young lest the babes should grieve nagasaki is inhabited entirely by children the grownups exist on sufferance a fourfoot child walks with a threefoot child who is holding the hand of a twofoot child who carries on her back a onefoot child whobut you will not believe me if i say that the scale runs down to sixinch little jap dolls such as they used to sell in the burlington arcade these dolls wriggle and laugh they are tied up in a blue bedgown which is tied by a sash which again ties up the bedgown of the carrier thus if you untie that sash baby and but little bigger brother are at once perfectly naked i saw a mother do this and it was for all the world like the peeling of hardboiled eggs  if you look for extravagance of colour for flaming shop fronts and glaring lanterns you shall find none of these things in the narrow stonepaved streets of nagasaki but if you desire details of house construction glimpses of perfect cleanliness rare taste and perfect subordination of the thing made to the needs of the maker you shall find all you seek and more all the roofs are dull lead colour being shingled or tiled and all the house fronts are of the colour of the wood as god made it there is neither smoke nor haze and in the clear light of a clouded sky i could see down the narrowest alleyway as into the interior of a cabinet  the books have long ago told you how a japanese house is constructed chiefly of sliding screens and paper partitions and everybody knows the story of the burglar of tokio who burgled with a pair of scissors for jimmy and centrebit and stole the consuls trousers but all the telling in print will never make you understand the exquisite finish of a tenement that you could kick in with your foot and pound to matchwood with your fists behold a bunnias9 shop he sells rice and chillies and dried fish and wooden scoops made of bamboo the front of his shop is very solid it is made of halfinch battens nailed side by side not one of the battens is broken and each one is foursquare perfectly feeling ashamed of himself for this surly barring up of his house he fills onehalf the frontage with oiled paper stretched upon quarterinch framing not a single square of oil paper has a hole in it and not one of the squares which in more uncivilised countries would hold a pane of glass if strong enough is out of line and the bunnia clothed in a blue dressinggown with thick white stockings on his feet sits behind not among his wares on a pale goldcoloured mat of soft rice straw bound with black list at the edges this mat is two inches thick three feet wide and six long you might if you were a sufficient pig eat your dinner off any portion of it the bunnia lies with one wadded blue arm round a big brazier of hammered brass on which is faintly delineated in incised lines a very terrible dragon the brazier is full of charcoal ash but there is no ash on the mat by the bunnias side is a pouch of green leather tied with a red silk cord holding tobacco cut fine as cotton he fills a long black and red lacquered pipe lights it at the charcoal in the brazier takes two whiffs and the pipe is empty still there is no speck on the mat behind the bunnia is a shadowscreen of bead and bamboo this veils a room floored with pale gold and roofed with panels of grained cedar there is nothing in the room save a bloodred blanket laid out smoothly as a sheet of paper beyond the room is a passage of polished wood so polished that it gives back the reflections of the white paper wall at the end of the passage and clearly visible to this unique bunnia is a dwarfed pine two feet high in a green glazed pot and by its side is a branch of azalea blood red as the blanket set in a pale grey cracklepot the bunnia has put it there for his own pleasure for the delight of his eyes because he loves it the white man has nothing whatever to do with his tastes and he keeps his house specklessly pure because he likes cleanliness and knows it is artistic what shall we say to such a bunnia  9 graindealers  his brother in northern india may live behind a front of timeblackened openwork wood but  i do not think he would grow anything save tulsi10 in a pot and that only to please the gods and his womenfolk  10 a sacred herb of the hindus  let us not compare the two men but go on through nagasaki  except for the horrible policemen who insist on being continental the peoplethe common people that isdo not run after unseemly costumes of the west the young men wear round felt hats occasionally coats and trousers and semioccasionally boots all these are vile in the more metropolitan towns men say western dress is rather the rule than the exception if this be so i am disposed to conclude that the sins of their forefathers in making enterprising jesuit missionaries into beefsteak have been visited on the japanese in the shape of a partial obscuration of their artistic instincts yet the punishment seems rather too heavy for the offence  then i fell admiring the bloom on the peoples cheeks the threecornered smiles of the fat babes and the surpassing otherness of everything round me it is so strange to be in a clean land and stranger to walk among dolls houses japan is a soothing place for a small man nobody comes to tower over him and he looks down upon all the women as is right and proper a dealer in curiosities bent himself double on his own doormat and i passed in feeling for the first time that i was a barbarian and no true sahib the slush of the streets was thick on my boots and he the immaculate owner asked me to walk across a polished floor and white mats to an inner chamber he brought me a footmat which only made matters worse for a pretty girl giggled round the corner as i toiled at it japanese shopkeepers ought not to be so clean i went into a boarded passage about two feet wide found a gem of a garden of dwarfed trees in the space of half a tennis court whacked my head on a fragile lintel and arrived at a fourwalled daintiness where i involuntarily lowered my voice do you recollect mrs molesworths cuckoo clock and the big cabinet that griselda entered with the cuckoo i was not griselda but my lowvoiced friend in his long soft wraps was the cuckoo and the room was the cabinet again i tried to console myself with the thought that i could kick the place to pieces but this only made me feel large and coarse and dirtya most unfavourable mood for bargaining the cuckooman caused pale tea to be broughtjust such tea as you read of in books of traveland the tea completed my embarrassment what i wanted to say was look here you person youre much too clean and refined for this life here below and your house is unfit for a man to live in until he has been taught a lot of things which i have never learned consequently i hate you because i feel myself your inferior and you despise me and my boots because you know me for a savage let me go or ill pull your house of cedarwood over your ears what i really said was oh ah yes awfly pretty awful queer way of doing business  the cuckooman proved to be a horrid extortioner but i was hot and uncomfortable till i got outside and was a bogtrotting briton once more you have never blundered into the inside of a threehundreddollar cabinet therefore you will not understand me  we came to the foot of a hill as it might have been the hill on which the shway dagon stands and up that hill ran a mighty flight of grey weatherdarkened steps spanned here and there by monolithic torii every one knows what a torii is they have them in southern india a great king makes a note of the place where he intends to build a huge arch but being a king does so in stone not inksketches in the air two beams and a crossbar forty or sixty feet high and twenty or thirty wide in southern india the crossbar is humped in the middle in the further east it flares up at the ends this description is hardly according to the books but if a man begins by consulting books in a new country he is lost over the steps hung heavy bluegreen or greenblack pines old gnarled and bossed the foliage of the hillside was a lighter green but the pines set the keynote of colour and the blue dresses of the few folk on the steps answered it there was no sunshine in the air but i vow that sunshine would have spoilt all we climb for five minutesi and the professor and the cameraand then we turned and saw the roofs of nagasaki lying at our feeta sea of lead and dullbrown with here and there a smudge of creamy pink to mark the bloom of the cherry trees the hills round the town were speckled with the restingplaces of the dead with clumps of pine and feathery bamboo  what a country said the professor unstrapping his camera and have you noticed wherever we go theres always some man who knows how to carry my kit the gharri driver at moulmein handed me my stops the fellow at penang knew all about it too and the rickshaw coolie has seen a camera before curious isnt it  professor said i its due to the extraordinary fact that we are not the only people in the world i began to realise it at hongkong its getting plainer now i shouldnt be surprised if we turned out to be ordinary human beings after all  we entered a courtyard where an evillooking bronze horse stared at two stone lions and a company of children babbled among themselves there is a legend connected with the bronze horse which may be found in the guidebooks but the real true story of the creature is that he was made long ago out of the fossil ivory of siberia by a japanese prometheus and got life and many foals whose descendants closely resemble their father long years have almost eliminated the ivory in the blood but it crops out in creamy mane and tail and the potbelly and marvellous feet of the bronze horse may be found to this day among the packponies of nagasaki who carry packsaddles adorned with velvet and red cloth who wear grass shoes on their hind feet and who are made like to horses in a pantomime  we could not go beyond this courtyard because a label said no admittance and thus all we saw of the temple was richbrown high roofs of blackened thatch breaking back and back in wave and undulation till they were lost in the foliage the japanese can play with thatch as men play with modelling clay but how their light underpinnings can carry the weight of the roof is a mystery to the lay eye  we went down the steps to tiffin and a halfformed resolve was shaping itself in my heart the while burma was a very nice place but they eat gnapi there and there were smells and after all the girls werent so pretty as some others  you must take off your boots said ytokai  i assure you there is no dignity in sitting down on the steps of a teahouse and struggling with muddy boots and it is impossible to be polite in your stockinged feet when the floor under you is as smooth as glass and a pretty girl wants to know where you would like tiffin take at least one pair of beautiful socks with you when you come this way get them made of embroidered sambhur skin of silk if you like but do not stand as i did in cheap striped brown things with a darn at the heel and try to talk to a teagirl  they led usthree of them and all fresh and prettyinto a room furnished with a goldenbrown bearskin the tokonoma recess aforementioned held one scrollpicture of bats wheeling in the twilight a bamboo flowerholder and yellow flowers the ceiling was of panelled wood with the exception of one strip at the side nearest the window and this was made of plaited shavings of cedarwood marked off from the rest of the ceiling by a winebrown bamboo so polished that it might have been lacquered a touch of the hand sent one side of the room flying back and we entered a really large room with another tokonoma framed on one side by eight or ten feet of an unknown wood bearing the same grain as a penang lawyer and above by a stick of unbarked tree set there purely because it was curiously mottled in this second tokonoma was a pearlgrey vase and that was all two sides of the room were of oiled paper and the joints of the beams were covered by the brazen images of crabs half lifesize save for the sill of the tokonoma which was black lacquer every inch of wood in the place was natural grain without flaw outside was the garden fringed with a hedge of dwarfpines and adorned with a tiny pond watersmoothed stones sunk in the soil and a blossoming cherry tree  they left us alone in this paradise of cleanliness and beauty and being only a shameless englishman without his bootsa white man is always degraded when he goes barefooti wandered round the wall trying all the screens it was only when i stooped to examine the sunk catch of a screen that i saw it was a plaque of inlay work representing two white cranes feeding on fish the whole was about three inches square and in the ordinary course of events would never be looked at the screens hid a cupboard in which all the lamps and candlesticks and pillows and sleepingbags of the household seemed to be stored an oriental nation that can fill a cupboard tidily is a nation to bow down to upstairs i went by a staircase of grained wood and lacquer into rooms of rarest device with circular windows that opened on nothing and so were filled with bamboo tracery for the delight of the eye the passages floored with dark wood shone like ice and i was ashamed  professor said i they dont spit they dont eat like pigs they cant quarrel and a drunken man would reel straight through every portion in the house and roll down the hill into nagasaki they cant have any children here i stopped downstairs was full of babies  the maidens came in with tea in blue china and cake in a red lacquered bowlsuch cake as one gets at one or two houses in simla we sprawled ungracefully on red rugs over the mats and they gave us chopsticks to separate the cake with it was a long task  is that all growled the professor im hungry and cake and tea oughtnt to come till four oclock here he took a wedge of cake furtively with his hands  they returnedfive of them this timewith black lacquer stands a foot square and four inches high those were our tables they bore a red lacquered bowlful of fish boiled in brine and seaanemones at least they were not mushrooms a paper napkin tied with gold thread enclosed our chopsticks and in a little flat saucer lay a smoked crayfish a slice of a compromise that looked like yorkshire pudding and tasted like sweet omelette and a twisted fragment of some translucent thing that had once been alive but was now pickled they went away but not empty handed for thou oh otoyo didst take away my heartsame which i gave to the burmese girl in the shway dagon pagoda  the professor opened his eyes a little but said no word the chopsticks demanded all his attention and the return of the girls took up the rest otoyo ebonhaired rosycheeked and made throughout of delicate porcelain laughed at me because i devoured all the mustard sauce that had been served with my raw fish and wept copiously till she gave me saki from a lordly bottle about four inches high if you took some very thin hock and tried to mull it and forgot all about the brew till it was half cold you would get saki i had mine in a saucer so tiny that i was bold to have it filled eight or ten times and loved otoyo none the less at the end  after raw fish and mustard sauce came some other sort of fish cooked with pickled radishes and very slippery on the chopsticks the girls knelt in a semicircle and shrieked with delight at the professors clumsiness for indeed it was not i that nearly upset the dinner table in a vain attempt to recline gracefully after the bambooshoots came a basin of white beans in sweet saucevery tasty indeed try to convey beans to your mouth with a pair of wooden knittingneedles and see what happens some chicken cunningly boiled with turnips and a bowlful of snowwhite boneless fish and a pile of rice concluded the meal i have forgotten one or two of the courses but when otoyo handed me the tiny lacquered japanese pipe full of haylike tobacco i counted nine dishes in the lacquer standeach dish representing a course then otoyo and i smoked by alternate pipefuls  my very respectable friends at all the clubs and messes have you ever after a good tiffin lolled on cushions and smoked with one pretty girl to fill your pipe and four to admire you in an unknown tongue you do not know what life is i looked round me at that faultless room at the dwarf pines and creamy cherry blossoms without at otoyo bubbling with laughter because i blew smoke through my nose and at the ring of mikado maidens over against the goldenbrown bearskin rug here was colour form food comfort and beauty enough for half a years contemplation i would not be a burman any more i would be a japanesealways with otoyoin a cabinet workhouse on a camphorscented hillside  heigho said the professor there are worse places than this to live and die in dyou know our steamer goes at four lets ask for the bill and get away  now i have left my heart with otoyo under the pines perhaps i shall get it back at kobé     no xii  a further consideration of japan the inland sea and good cookery the mystery of passports and consulates and certain other matters      rome rome wasnt that the place where i got the good cigars      memoirs of a traveller   alas for the incompleteness of the written word there was so much more that i meant to tell you about nagasaki and the funeral procession that i found in her streets you ought to have read about the wailing women in white who followed the dead man shut up in a wooden sedan chair that rocked on the shoulders of the bearers while the bronzehued buddhist priest tramped on ahead and the little boys ran alongside  i had prepared in my mind moral reflections purviews of political situations and a complete essay on the future of japan now i have forgotten everything except otoyo in the teagarden  from nagasaki wethe p and o steamerare going to kobé by way of the inland sea that is to say we have for the last twenty hours been steaming through a huge lake studded as far as the eye can reach with islands of every size from four miles long and two wide to little cockedhat hummocks no bigger than a decent hayrick messrs cook and son charge about one hundred rupees extra for the run through this part of the world but they do not know how to farm the beauties of nature under any skies the islandspurple amber grey green and blackare worth five times the money asked i have been sitting for the last halfhour among a knot of whooping tourists wondering how i could give you a notion of them the tourists of course are indescribable they say oh my at thirtysecond intervals and at the end of five minutes call one to another saay dont you think its vurry much the same all along then they play cricket with a broomstick till an unusually fair prospect makes them stop and shout oh my again if there were a few more oaks and pines on the islands the run would be three hundred miles of naini tal lake but we are not near naini tal for as the big ship drives down the alleys of water i can see the heads of the breakers flying ten feet up the side of the echoing cliffs albeit the sea is deadstill  now we have come to a stretch so densely populated with islands that all looks solid ground we are running through broken water thrown up by the race of the tide round an outlying reef and apparently are going to hit an acre of solid rock somebody on the bridge saves us and we head out for another island and so on and so on till the eye wearies of watching the nose of the ship swinging right and left and the finite human soul which after all cannot repeat oh my through a chilly evening goes below when you come to japanit can be done comfortably in three months or even ten weekssail through this marvellous sea and see how quickly wonder sinks to interest and interest to apathy we brought oysters with us from nagasaki i am much more interested in their appearance at dinner tonight than in the shagbacked starfish of an islet that has just slidden by like a ghost upon the silvergrey waters awakening under the touch of the ripe moon yes it is a sea of mystery and romance and the white sails of the junks are silver in the moonlight but if the steward curries those oysters instead of serving them on the shell all the veiled beauties of cliff and watercarven rock will not console me today being the seventeenth of april i am sitting in an ulster under a thick rug with fingers so cold i can barely hold the pen this emboldens me to ask how your thermantidotes are working a mixture of steatite and kerosene is very good for creaking cranks i believe and if the coolie falls asleep and you wake up in hades try not to lose your temper i go to my oysters  two days later this comes from kobé thirty hours from nagasaki the european portion of which is a raw american town we walked down the wide naked streets between houses of sham stucco with corinthian pillars of wood wooden verandahs and piazzas all stony grey beneath stony grey skies and keeping guard over raw green saplings miscalled shade trees in truth kobé is hideously american in externals even i who have only seen pictures of america recognised at once that it was portland maine it lives among hills but the hills are all scalped and the general impression is of outofthewayness yet ere i go further let me sing the praises of the excellent m begeux proprietor of the oriental hotel upon whom be peace his is a house where you can dine he does not merely feed you his coffee is the coffee of the beautiful france for tea he gives you peliti cakes but better and the vin ordinaire which is compris is good excellent monsieur and madame begeux if the pioneer were a medium for puffs i would write a leading article upon your potato salad your beefsteaks your fried fish and your staff of highly trained japanese servants in blue tights who looked like so many small hamlets without the velvet cloak and who obeyed the unspoken wish no it should be a poema ballad of good living i have eaten curries of the rarest at the oriental at penang the turtle steaks of raffless at singapur still live in my regretful memory and they gave me chicken liver and suckingpig in the victoria at hongkong which i will always extol but the oriental at kobé was better than all three remember this and so shall you who come after slide round a quarter of the world upon a sleek and contented stomach  we are going from kobé to yokohama by various roads this necessitates a passport because we travel in the interior and do not run round the coast on shipboard we take a railroad which may or may not be complete as to the middle and we branch off from that railroad complete or not as the notion may prompt this will be an affair of some twenty days and ought to include forty or fifty miles by rickshaw a voyage on a lake and i believe bedbugs nota benewhen you come to japan stop at hongkong and send on a letter to the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at tokio if you want to travel in the interior of this fairyland indicate your route as roughly as ever you choose but for your own comfort give the two extreme towns you intend to touch throw in any details about your age profession colour of hair and the like that may occur to you and ask to have a passport sent to the british consulate at kobé to meet you allow the man with a long title a weeks time to prepare the passport and you will find it at your service when you land only write distinctly to save your vanity my papers are addressed to a mister kyshrigradjerd kyshrig  as in nagasaki the town was full of babies and as in nagasaki every one smiled except the chinamen i do not like chinamen there was something in their faces which i could not understand though it was familiar enough  the chinamans a native i said thats the look on a natives face but the jap isnt a native and he isnt a sahib either what is it the professor considered the surging street for a while  the chinamans an old man when hes young just as a native is but the jap is a child all his life think how grownup people look among children thats the look thats puzzling you  i dare not say that the professor is right but to my eyes it seemed he spoke sooth as the knowledge of good and evil sets its mark upon the face of a grown man of our people so something i did not understand had marked the faces of the chinamen they had no kinship with the crowd beyond that which a man has to children  they are the superior race said the professor ethnologically  they cant be they dont know how to enjoy life i answered immorally and anyway their art isnt human  what does it matter said the professor heres a shop full of the wrecks of old japan lets go in and look we went in but i want somebody to solve the chinese question for me its too large to handle alone  we entered the curioshop aforementioned with our hats in our hands through a small avenue of carved stone lanterns and wooden sculptures of devils unspeakably hideous to be received by a smiling image who had grown grey among netsukes and lacquer he showed us the banners and insignia of daimios long since dead while our jaws drooped in ignorant wonder he showed us a sacred turtle of mammoth size carven in wood down to minutest detail through room after room he led us the light fading as we went till we reached a tiny garden and a woodwork cloister that ran round it suits of oldtime armour made faces at us in the gloom ancient swords clicked at our feet quaint tobacco pouches as old as the swords swayed to and fro from some invisible support and the eyes of a score of battered buddhas red dragons jain tirthankars and burmese beloos glared at us from over the fence of tattered gold brocade robes of state the joy of possession lives in the eye the old man showed us his treasures from crystal spheres mounted in seaworn wood to cabinet on cabinet full of ivory and wood carvings and we were as rich as though we owned all that lay before us unfortunately the merest scratch of japanese characters is the only clew to the artists name so i am unable to say who conceived and in creamy ivory executed the old man horribly embarrassed by a cuttlefish the priest who made the soldier pick up a deer for him and laughed to think that the brisket would be his and the burden his companions or the dry lean snake coiled in derision on a jawless skull mottled with the memories of corruption or the rabelaisan badger who stood on his head and made you blush though he was not half an inch long or the little fat boy pounding his smaller brother or the rabbit that had just made a joke orbut there were scores of these notes born of every mood of mirth scorn and experience that sways the heart of man and by this hand that has held half a dozen of them in its palm i winked at the shade of the dead carver he had gone to his rest but he had worked out in ivory three or four impressions that i had been hunting after in cold print  the englishman is a wonderful animal he buys a dozen of these things and puts them on the top of an overcrowded cabinet where they look like blobs of ivory and forgets them in a week the japanese hides them in a beautiful brocaded bag or a quiet lacquer box till three congenial friends come to tea then he takes them out slowly and they are looked over with appreciation amid quiet chuckles to the deliberative clink of cups and put back again till the mood for inspection returns that is the way to enjoy what we call curios every man with money is a collector in japan but you shall find no crowds of things outside the best shops  we stayed long in the halflight of that quaint place and when we went away we grieved afresh that such a people should have a constitution or should dress every tenth young man in european clothes put a white ironclad in kobé harbour and send a dozen myoptic lieutenants in baggy uniforms about the streets  it would pay us said the professor his head in a clogshop it would pay us to establish an international suzerainty over japan to take away any fear of invasion or annexation and pay the country as much as ever it chose on condition that it simply sat still and went on making beautiful things while our men learned it would pay us to put the whole empire in a glass case and mark it hors concours exhibit a  hmm said i whos us  oh we generallythe sahib log all the world over our workmena few of themcan do as good work in certain lines but you dont find whole towns full of clean capable dainty designful people in europe  lets go to tokio and speak to the emperor about it i said  lets go to a japanese theatre first said the professor its too early in the tour to start serious politics     no xiii  the japanese theatre and the story of the thunder cat treating also of the quiet places and the dead man in the street   to the theatre we went through the mud and much rain internally it was nearly dark for the deep blue of the audiences dress soaked up the scanty light of the kerosene lamps there was no standing room anywhere except next to the japanese policeman who in the cause of morals and the lord chamberlain had a corner in the gallery and four chairs all to himself he was quite four feet eight inches high and napoleon at st helena could not have folded his arms more dramatically after some gruntingi fear we were upsetting the principles of the constitutionhe consented to give us one chair receiving in return a burma cheroot which i have every reason to believe blew his little head off a pit containing fifty rows of fifty people and a bonding layer of babies with a gallery which might have held twelve hundred made up the house the building was as delicate a piece of cabinet work as any of the houses roof floor beams props verandahs and partitions were of naked wood and every other person in the house was smoking a tiny pipe and knocking out the ashes every two minutes then i wished to fly death by the auto da fe not being anywhere paid for in the tour but there was no escape by the one little door where pickled fish was being sold between the acts  yes its not exactly safe said the professor as the matches winked and sputtered all round and below but if that curtain catches that naked light on the stage or you see this matchwood gallery begin to blaze ill kick out the back of the refreshment buffet and we can walk away  with this warm comfort the drama began the green curtain dropped from above and was whisked away and three gentlemen and a lady opened the ball by a dialogue conducted in tones between a burble and a falsetto whisper if you wish to know their costumes look at the nearest japanese fan real japs of course are like men and women but stage japs in their stiff brocades are line for line as japs are drawn when the four sat down a little boy ran among them and settled their draperies pulling out a sash bow here displaying a skirtfold there the costumes were as gorgeous as the plot was incomprehensible but we will call the play the thunder cat or harlequin bag o bones and the amazing old woman or the mammoth radish or the superfluous badger and the swinging lights  a twosworded man in the black and gold brocade rose up and imitated the gait of an obscure actor called henry irving whereat not knowing that he was serious i cackled aloud till the japanese policeman looked at me austerely then the twosworded man wooed the japanesefan lady the other characters commenting on his proceedings like a greek chorus till somethingperhaps a misplaced accentprovoked trouble and the twosworded man and a vermilion splendour enjoyed a vincent crummles fight to the music of all the orchestraone guitar and something that clickednot castanets the small boy removed their weapons when the men had sufficiently warred and conceiving that the piece wanted light fetched a tenfoot bamboo with a naked candle at the end and held this implement about a foot from the face of the twosworded man following his every movement with the anxious eye of a child intrusted with a typewriter then the japanesefan girl consented to the wooing of the twosworded man and with a scream of eldritch laughter turned into a hideous old womana boy took off her hair but she did the rest herself at this terrible moment a gilded thunder cat which is a cat issuing from a cloud ran on wires from the flies to the centre of the gallery and a boy with a badgers tail mocked at the twosworded man then i knew that the twosworded man had offended a cat and a badger and would have a very bad time of it for these two animals and the fox are to this day black sorcerers fearful things followed and the scenery was changed once every five minutes the prettiest effect was secured by a double row of candles hung on strings behind a green gauze far up the stage and set swinging with opposite motions this besides giving a fine idea of uncanniness made one member of the audience seasick  but the twosworded man was far more miserable than i the bad thunder cat cast such spells upon him that i gave up trying to find out what he meant to be he was a fatfaced low comedian king of the rats assisted by other rats and he ate a magic radish with sidesplitting pantomime till he became a man once more then all his bones were taken awaystill by the thunder catand he fell into a horrid heap illuminated by the small boy with the candleand would not recover himself till somebody spoke to a magic parrot and a huge hairy villain and several coolies had walked over him then he was a girl but hiding behind a parasol resumed his shape and then the curtain came down and the audience ran about the stage and circulated generally one small boy took it into his head that he could turn headoverheels from the prompt side across with great gravity before the unregarding house he set to work but rolled over sideways with a flourish of chubby legs nobody cared and the polite people in the gallery could not understand why the professor and i were helpless with laughter when the child with a clog for a sword imitated the strut of the twosworded man the actors changed in public and any one who liked might help shift scenes why should not a baby enjoy himself if he liked  a little later we left the thunder cat was still working her wicked will on the twosworded man but all would be set right next day there was a good deal to be done but justice was at the end of it the man who sold pickled fish and tickets said so  good school for a young actor said the professor hed see what unpruned eccentricities naturally develop into theres every trick and mannerism of the english stage in that place magnified thirty diameters but perfectly recognisable how do you intend to describe it  the japanese comic opera of the future has yet to be written i responded grandiloquently yet to be written in spite of the mikado the badger has not yet appeared on an english stage and the artistic mask as an accessory to the legitimate drama has never been utilised just imagine the thunder cat as a title for a seriocomic opera begin with a domestic cat possessed of magic powers living in the house of a london teamerchant who kicks her consider  the lateness of the hour was the icy answer tomorrow we will go and write operas in the temple close to this place                                       tomorrow brought fine drizzling rain the sun by the way has been hidden now for more than three weeks they took us to what must be the chief temple of kobé and gave it a name which i do not remember it is an exasperating thing to stand at the altars of a faith that you know nothing about there be rites and ceremonies of the hindu creed that all have read of and must have witnessed but in what manner do they pray here who look to buddha and what worship is paid at the shinto shrines the books say one thing the eyes another  the temple would seem to be also a monastery and a place of great peace disturbed only by the babble of scores of little children it stood back from the road behind a sturdy wall an irregular mass of steep pitched roofs bound fantastically at the crown coppergreen where the thatch had ripened under the touch of time and dull greyblack where the tiles ran under the eaves a man who believed in his god and so could do good work had carved his heart into wood till it blossomed and broke into waves or curled with the ripple of live flames somewhere on the outskirts of lahore city stands a mazy gathering of tombs and cloister walks called chajju bhagats chubara built no one knows when and decaying no one cares how soon though this temple was large and spotlessly clean within and without the silence and rest of the place were those of the courtyards in the faroff punjab the priests had made many gardens in corners of the wallgardens perhaps forty feet long by twenty wide and each though different from its neighbour containing a little pond with goldfish a stone lantern or two hummocks of rock flat stones carved with inscriptions and a cherry or peach tree all blossom  stonepaved paths ran across the courtyard and connected building with building in an inner enclosure where lay the prettiest garden of all was a golden tablet ten or twelve feet high against which stood in high relief of hammered bronze the figure of a goddess in flowing robes the space between the paved paths here was strewn with snowywhite pebbles and in white pebbles on red they had written on the ground how happy you might take them as you pleasedfor the sigh of contentment or the question of despair  the temple itself reached by a wooden bridge was nearly dark but there was light enough to show a hundred subdued splendours of brown and gold of silk and faithfully painted screen if you have once seen a buddhist altar where the master of the law sits among golden bells ancient bronzes flowers in vases and banners of tapestry you will begin to understand why the roman catholic church once prospered so mightily in this country and will prosper in all lands where it finds an elaborate ritual already existing an artloving folk will have a god who is to be propitiated with pretty things as surely as a race bred among rocks and moors and driving clouds will enshrine their deity in the storm and make him the austere recipient of the sacrifice of the rebellious human spirit do you remember the story of the bad people of iquique the man who told me that yarn told me anotherof the good people of somewhere else they also were simple south americans with nothing to wear and had been conducting a service of their own in honour of their god before a blackjowled jesuit father at a critical moment some one forgot the ritual or a monkey invaded the sanctity of that forest shrine and stole the priests only garment anyhow an absurdity happened and the good people burst into shouts of laughter and broke off to play for a while  but what will your god say asked the jesuit scandalised at the levity  oh he knows everything he knows that we forget and cant attend and do it all wrong but he is very wise and very strong was the reply  well that doesnt excuse you  of course it does he just lies back and laughs said the good people of somewhere else and fell to pelting each other with blossoms  i forget what is the precise bearing of this anecdote but to return to the temple hidden away behind a mass of variegated gorgeousness was a row of very familiar figures with gold crowns on their heads one does not expect to meet krishna the butter thief and kali the husband beater so far east as japan  what are these  they are other gods said a young priest who giggled deprecatingly at his own creed every time he was questioned about it they are very old they came from india in the past i think they are indian gods but i do not know why they are here  i hate a man who is ashamed of his faith there was a story connected with those gods and the priest would not tell it to me so i sniffed at him scornfully and went my way it led me from the temple straight into the monastery which was all made of delicate screens polished floors and brown wood ceilings except for my tread on the boards there was no sound in the place till i heard some one breathing heavily behind a screen the priest slid back what had appeared to me a dead wall and we found a very old priest halfasleep over his charcoal handwarmer this was the picture the priest in olivegreen his bald head pure silver bowed down before a sliding screen of white oiled paper which let in dull silver light to his right a battered black lacquer stand containing the indian ink and brushes with which he feigned to work to the right of these again a pale yellow bamboo table holding a vase of olivegreen crackle and a sprig of almost black pine there were no blossoms in this place the priest was too old behind the sombre picture stood a gorgeous little buddhist shrinegold and vermilion  he makes a fresh picture for the little screen here every day said the young priest pointing first to his senior and then to a blank little tablet on the wall the old man laughed pitifully rubbed his head and handed me his picture for the day it represented a flood over rocky ground two men in a boat were helping two others on a tree halfsubmerged by the water even i could tell that the power had gone from him he must have drawn well in his manhood for one figure in the boat had action and purpose as it leaned over the gunwale but the rest was blurred and the lines had wandered astray as the poor old hand had quavered across the paper i had no time to wish the artist a pleasant old age and an easy death in the great peace that surrounded him before the young man drew me away to the back of the shrine and showed me a second smaller altar facing shelves on shelves of little gold and lacquer tablets covered with japanese characters  these are memorial tablets of the dead he giggled once and again the priest he prays herefor those who are dead you understand  perfectly they call em masses where i come from i want to go away and think about things you shouldnt laugh though when you show off your creed  ha ha said the young priest and i ran away down the dark polished passages with the faded screens on either hand and got into the main courtyard facing the street while the professor was trying to catch temple fronts with his camera  a procession passed four abreast tramping through the sloshy mud they did not laugh which was strange till i saw and heard a company of women in white walking in front of a little wooden palanquin carried on the shoulders of four bearers and suspiciously light they sang a song half under their breathsa wailing moaning song that i had only heard once before from the lips of a native far away in the north of india who had been clawed past hope of cure by a bear and was singing his own deathsong as his friends bore him along  have makee die said my rickshaw coolie fewyuneral  i was aware of the fact men women and little children poured along the streets and when the deathsong died down helped it forward the halfmourners wore only pieces of white cloth about their shoulders the immediate relatives of the dead were in white from head to foot aho ahaa aho they wailed very softly for fear of breaking the cadence of the falling rain and they disappeared all except one old woman who could not keep pace with the procession and so came along alone crooning softly to herself aho ahaa aho she whispered  the little children in the courtyard were clustered round the professors camera but one child had a very bad skin disease on his innocent headso bad that none of the others would play with himand he stood in a corner and sobbed and sobbed as though his heart would break poor little gehazi     no xiv  explains in what manner i was taken to venice in the rain and climbed into a devil fort a tinpot exhibition and a bath of the maiden and the boltless door the cultivator and his fields and the manufacture of ethnological theories at railroad speed ends with kioto      theres a deal o fine confused feedin about sheeps head      christopher north   come along to osaka said the professor  why im quite comfy here and we shall have lobster cutlets for tiffin and anyhow it is raining heavily and we shall get wet  sorely against my willfor it was in my mind to fudge japan from a guidebook while i enjoyed the cookery of the oriental at kobéi was dragged into a rickshaw and the rain and conveyed to a railway station even the japanese cannot make their railway stations lovely though they do their best their system of baggagebooking is borrowed from the americans their narrowgauge lines locos and rolling stock are english their passengertraffic is regulated with the precision of the gaul and the uniforms of their officials come from the nearest ragbag the passengers themselves were altogether delightful a large number of them were modified europeans and resembled nothing more than tenniels picture of the white rabbit on the first page of alice in wonderland they were dressed in neat little tweed suits with fawncoloured overcoats and they carried ladies reticules of black leather and nickel platings they wore paper and celluloid stuckup collars which must have been quite thirteen inches round the neck and their boots were number fours on their handstheir weewee handsthey had white cotton gloves and they smoked cigarettes from fairy little cigarette cases that was young japanthe japan of the present day  wah wah god is great said the professor but it isnt in human nature for a man who sprawls about on soft mats by instinct to wear europe clothes as though they belonged to him if you notice the last thing that they take to is shoes  a lapislazuli coloured locomotive which by accident had a mixed train attached to it happened to loaf up to the platform just then and we entered a firstclass english compartment there was no stupid double roof window shade or abortive thermantidote it was a london and southwestern carriage osaka is about eighteen miles from kobé and stands at the head of the bay of osaka the train is allowed to go as fast as fifteen miles an hour and to play at the stations all along the line you must know that the line runs between the hills and the shore and the drainagefall is a great deal steeper than anything we have between saharunpur and umballa the rivers and the hill torrents come down straight from the hills on raised beds of their own formation which beds again have to be bunded and spanned with girder bridges orhere perhaps i may be wrongtunnelled  the stations are blacktiled redwalled and concretefloored and all the plant from signal levers to goodstruck is english the official colour of the bridges is a yellowbrown most like unto a faded chrysanthemum the uniform of the ticketcollectors is a peaked forage cap with gold lines black frockcoat with brass buttons very long in the skirt trousers with black mohair braid and buttoned kid boots you cannot be rude to a man in such raiment  but the countryside was the thing that made us open our eyes imagine a land of rich black soil very heavily manured and worked by the spade and hoe almost exclusively and if you split your field of vision into halfacre plots you will get a notion of the raw material the cultivator works on but all i can write will give you no notion of the wantonness of neatness visible in the fields of the elaborate system of irrigation and the mathematical precision of the planting there was no mixing of crops no waste of boundary in footpath and no difference of value in the land the water stood everywhere within ten feet of the surface as the wellsweeps attested on the slopes of the foothills each drop between the levels was neatly riveted with unmortared stones and the edges of the watercuts were faced in like manner the young rice was transplanted very much as draughts are laid on the board the tea might have been cropped garden box and between the lines of the mustard the water lay in the drills as in a wooden trough while the purple of the beans ran up to the mustard and stopped as though cut with a rule  on the seaboard we saw an almost continuous line of towns variegated with factory chimneys inland the crazyquilt of green darkgreen and gold even in the rain the view was lovely and exactly as japanese pictures had led me to hope for only one drawback occurred to the professor and myself at the same time crops dont grow to the full limit of the seed on heavily worked ground dotted with villages except at a price  cholera said i watching a stretch of wellsweeps  cholera said the professor must be yknow its all sewage irrigation  i felt that i was friends with the cultivators at once these broadhatted blueclad gentlemen who tilled their fields by handexcept when they borrowed the village buffalo to drive the share through the ricesloughknew what the scourge meant  how much do you think the government takes in revenue from vegetable gardens of that kind i demanded  bosh said he quietly you arent going to describe the landtenure of japan look at the yellow of the mustard  it lay in sheets round the line it ran up the hills to the dark pines it rioted over the brown sandbars of the swollen rivers and faded away by mile after mile to the shores of the leaden sea the highpeaked houses of brown thatch stood kneedeep in it and it surged up to the factory chimneys of osaka  great place osaka said the guide all sorts of manufactures there  osaka is built into and over and among one thousand eight hundred and ninetyfour canals rivers dams and watercuts what the multitudinous chimneys mean i cannot tell they have something to do with rice and cotton but it is not good that the japs should indulge in trade and i will not call osaka a great commercial entrepot people who live in paper houses should never sell goods as the proverb says  because of his many wants there is but one hotel for the englishman in osaka and they call it juters here the views of two civilisations collide and the result is awful the building is altogether japanese wood and tile and sliding screen from top to bottom but the fitments are mixed my room for instance held a tokonoma made of the polished black stem of a palm and delicate woodwork framing a scroll picture representing storks but on the floor over the white mats lay a brussels carpet that made the indignant toes tingle from the back verandah one overhung the river which ran straight as an arrow between two lines of houses they have cabinetmakers in japan to fit the rivers to the towns from my verandah i could see three bridgesone a hideous latticegirder arrangementand part of a fourth we were on an island and owned a watergate if we wanted to take a boat  apropos of water be pleased to listen to a shocking story it is written in all the books that the japanese though cleanly are somewhat casual in their customs they bathe often with nothing on and together this notion my experience of the country gathered in the seclusion of the oriental at kobé made me scoff at i demanded a tub at juters the infinitesimal man led me down verandahs and upstairs to a beautiful bathhouse full of hot and cold water and fitted with cabinetwork somewhere in a lonely outgallery there was naturally no bolt to the door any more than there would be a bolt to a diningroom had i been sheltered by the walls of a big europe bath i should not have cared but i was preparing to wash when a pretty maiden opened the door and indicated that she also would tub in the deep sunken japanese bath at my side when one is dressed only in ones virtue and a pair of spectacles it is difficult to shut the door in the face of a girl she gathered that i was not happy and withdrew giggling while i thanked heaven blushing profusely the while that i had been brought up in a society which unfits a man to bathe à deux even an experience of the paddington swimming baths would have helped me but coming straight from india lady godiva was a balletgirl in sentiment compared to this actæon  it rained monsoonishly and the professor discovered a castle which he needs must see its osaka castle he said and it has been fought over for hundreds of years come along  ive seen castles in india raighur jodhpurall sorts of places lets have some more boiled salmon its good in this station  pig said the professor  we threaded our way over the four thousand and fiftytwo canals etc where the little children played with the swiftly running water and never a mother said dont till our rickshaw stopped outside a fort ditch thirty feet deep and faced with gigantic granite slabs on the far side uprose the walls of a fort but such a fort fifty feet was the height of the wall and never a pinch of mortar in the whole nor was the face perpendicular but curved like the ram of a manofwar they know the curve in china and i have seen french artists introduce it into books describing a devilbesieged city of tartary possibly everybody else knows it too but that is not my affair life as i have said being altogether new to me the stone was granite and the men of old time had used it like mud the dressed blocks that made the profile of the angles were from twenty feet long ten or twelve feet high and as many in thickness there was no attempt at binding but there was no fault in the jointing  and the little japs built this i cried awestricken at the quarries that rose round me  cyclopean masonry grunted the professor punching with a stick a monolith of seventeen feet cube not only did they build it but they took it look at this fire  the stones had been split and bronzed in places and the cleavage was the cleavage of fire evil must it have been for the armies that led the assault on these monstrous walls castles in india i know and the forts of great emperors i had seen but neither akbar in the north nor scindia in the south had built after this fashionwithout ornament without colour but with a single eye to savage strength and the utmost purity of line perhaps the fort would have looked less forbidding in sunlight the grey rainladen atmosphere through which i saw it suited its spirit the barracks of the garrison the commandants very dainty house a peachgarden and two deer were foreign to the place they should have peopled it with giants from the mountains instead ofgurkhas a jap infantryman is not a gurkha though he might be mistaken for one as long as he stood still the sentry at the quarterguard belonged i fancy to the 4th regiment his uniform was black or blue with red facings and shoulderstraps carrying the number of the regiment in cloth the rain necessitated an overcoat but why he should have carried knapsack blanket boots and binoculars i could not fathom the knapsack was of cowskin with the hair on the boots were strapped soles cut on each side while a heavy country blanket was rolled ushape over the head of the knapsack fitting close to the back in the place usually occupied by the messtin was a black leather case shaped like a fieldglass this must be a mistake of mine but i can only record as i see the rifle was a sidebolt weapon of some kind and the bayonet an uncommonly good sword one locked to the muzzle english fashion the ammunition pouches as far as i could see under the greatcoat ran on the belt in front and were doublestrapped down white spatterdashesvery dirtyand peaked cap completed the outfit i surveyed the man with interest and would have made further examination of him but for fear of the big bayonet his arms were well keptnot speckless by any meansbut his uniform would have made an english colonel swear there was no portion of his body except the neck that it pretended to fit i peeped into the quarterguard fans and dainty teasets do not go with ones notions of a barrack one drunken defaulter of certain faraway regiments that i could name would not only have cleared out that quarterguard but brought away all its fittings except the rifleracks yet the little men who were always gentle and never got drunk were mounting guard over a pile that with a blue fire on the bastions might have served for the guardgates of hell  i climbed to the top of the fort and was rewarded by a view of thirty miles of country chiefly pale yellow mustard and bluegreen pine and the sight of the very large city of osaka fading away into mist the guide took most pleasure in the factory chimneys there is an exposition herean exposition of industrialities come and see said he he took us down from that high place and showed us the glory of the land in the shape of corkscrews tin mugs eggwhisks dippers silks buttons and all the trumpery that can be stitched on a card and sold for fivepence three farthings the japanese unfortunately make all these things for themselves and are proud of it they have nothing to learn from the west as far as finish is concerned and by intuition know how to case and mount wares tastefully the exposition was in four large sheds running round a central building which held only screens pottery and cabinetware loaned for the occasion i rejoiced to see that the common people did not care for the penknives and the pencils and the mock jewellery they left those sheds alone and discussed the screens first taking off their clogs that the inlaid floor of the room might not suffer of all the gracious things i beheld two only remain in my memoryone a screen in grey representing the heads of six devils instinct with malice and hate the other a bold sketch in monochrome of an old woodcutter wrestling with the downbent branch of a tree two hundred years have passed since the artist dropped his pencil but you may almost hear the tough wood jar under the stroke of the chopper as the old man puts his back into the task and draws in the labouring breath there is a picture by legros of a beggar dying in a ditch which might have been suggested by that screen  next morning after a nights rain which sent the river racing under the frail balconies at eight miles an hour the sun broke through the clouds is this a little matter to you who can count upon him daily i had not seen him since march and was beginning to feel anxious then the land of peach blossom spread its draggled wings abroad and rejoiced all the pretty maidens put on their loveliest crêpe sashesfawn colour pink blue orange and lilacall the little children picked up a baby each and went out to be happy in a temple garden full of blossom i performed the miracle of deucalion with two cents worth of sweets the babies swarmed on the instant till for fear of raising all the mothers too i forbore to give them any more they smiled and nodded prettily and trotted after me forty strong the big ones helping the little and the little ones skipping in the puddles a jap child never cries never scuffles never fights and never makes mud pies except when it lives on the banks of a canal yet lest it should spread its sashbow and become a baldheaded angel ere its time providence has decreed that it should never never blow its little nose notwithstanding the defect i love it  there was no business in osaka that day because of the sunshine and the budding of the trees everybody went to a teahouse with his friends i went also but first ran along a boulevard by the side of the river pretending to look at the mint this was only a common place of solid granite where they turn out dollars and rubbish of that kind all along the boulevard the cherry peach and plum trees pink white and red touched branches and made a belt of velvety soft colour as far as the eye could reach weeping willows were the normal ornaments of the waterside this revel of bloom being only part of the prodigality of spring the mint may make a hundred thousand dollars a day but all the silver in its keeping will not bring again the three weeks of the peach blossom which even beyond the chrysanthemum is the crown and glory of japan for some act of surpassing merit performed in a past life i have been enabled to hit those three weeks in the middle  now is the japanese festival of the cherry blossom said the guide all the people will be festive they will pray too and go to the teagardens  now you might wall an englishman about with cherry trees in bloom from head to heel and after the first day he would begin to complain of the smell as you know the japanese arrange a good many of their festivals in honour of flowers and this is surely commendable for blossoms are the most tolerant of gods  the teahouse system of the japanese filled me with pleasure at a pleasure that i could not fully comprehend it pays a company in osaka to build on the outskirts of the town a ninestoried pagoda of wood and iron to lay out elaborate gardens round it and to hang the whole with strings of bloodred lanterns because the japanese will come wherever there is a good view to sit on a mat and discuss tea and sweetmeats and saki this eiffel tower is to tell the truth anything but pretty yet the surroundings redeem it although it was not quite completed the lower storeys were full of teastalls and teadrinkers the men and women were obviously admiring the view it is an astounding thing to see an oriental so engaged it is as though he had stolen something from a sahib  from osakacanalcut muddy and fascinating osakathe professor mister yamagutchithe guideand i took train to kioto an hour from osaka on the road i saw four buffaloes at as many riceploughswhich was noticeable as well as wasteful a buffalo at rest must cover the half of a japanese field but perhaps they are kept on the mountain ledges and only pulled down when wanted the professor says that what i call buffalo is really bullock the worst of travelling with an accurate man is his accuracy we argued about the japanese in the train about his present and his future and the manner in which he has ranged himself on the side of the grosser nations of the earth  did it hurt his feelings very much to wear our clothes didnt he rebel when he put on a pair of trousers for the first time wont he grow sensible some day and drop foreign habits these were some of the questions i put to the landscape and the professor  he was a baby said the latter a big baby i think his sense of humour was at the bottom of the change but he didnt know that a nation which once wears trousers never takes em off you see enlightened japan is only oneandtwenty years old and people are not very wise at oneandtwenty read reeds japan and learn how the change came about there was a mikado and a shogun who was sir frederick roberts but he tried to be the viceroy and  bother the shogun ive seen something like the babu class and something like the farmer class what i want to see is the rajput classthe man who used to wear the thousands and thousands of swords in the curioshops those swords were as much made for use as a rajputana sabre where are the men who used em show me a samurai  the professor answered not a word but scrutinised heads on the wayside platforms i take it that the higharched forehead club nose and eyes close togetherthe spanish typeare from rajput stock while the germanfaced jap is the khattrithe lower class  thus we talked of the natures and dispositions of men we knew nothing about till we had decided 1 that the painful politeness of the japanese nation rose from the habit dropped only twenty years ago of extended and emphatic swordwearing even as the rajput is the pink of courtesy because his friend goes armed 2 that this politeness will disappear in another generation or will at least be seriously impaired 3 that the cultured japanese of the english pattern will corrupt and defile the tastes of his neighbours till 4 japan altogether ceases to exist as a separate nation and becomes a buttonhook manufacturing appanage of america 5 that these things being so and sure to happen in two or three hundred years the professor and i were lucky to reach japan betimes and 6 that it was foolish to form theories about the country until we had seen a little of it  so we came to the city of kioto in regal sunshine tempered by a breeze that drove the cherry blossoms in drifts about the streets one japanese town in the southern provinces at least is very like another to look ata greyblack sea of house roofs speckled with the white walls of the fireproof godowns where merchants and rich men keep their chief treasures the general level is broken by the temple roofs which are turned up at the edges and remotely resemble so many teraihats kioto fills a plain almost entirely surrounded by wooded hills very familiar in their aspect to those who have seen the siwaliks once upon a time it was the capital of japan and today numbers two hundred and fifty thousand people it is laid out like an american town all the streets run at right angles to each other that by the way is exactly what the professor and i are doing we are elaborating the theory of the japanese people and we cant agree     no xv  kioto and how i fell in love with the chief belle there after i had conferred with certain china merchants who trafficked in tea shows further how in a great temple i broke the tenth commandment in fiftythree places and bowed down before kano and a carpenter takes me to arashima      could i but write the things i see     my world would haste to gaze with me     but since the traitor pen hath failed     to paint earths loveliness unveiled     i can but pray my folk who read     for lavish will take starveling deed   we are consorting with sixty of the sahiblog in the quaintest hotel that ever you saw it stands on the hillside overlooking the whole town of kioto and its garden is veritable japanese fantastically trimmed tea trees junipers dwarfed pine and cherry are mixed up with ponds of goldfish stone lanterns quaint rockwork and velvety turf all at an angle of thirtyfive degrees behind us the pines red and black cover the hill and run down in a long spur to the town but an auctioneers catalogue cannot describe the charms of the place or deal justly with the teagarden full of cherry trees that lies a hundred yards below the hotel we were solemnly assured that hardly any one came to kioto that is why we meet every soul in the ship that had brought us to nagasaki and that is why our ears are constantly assailed with the clamour of people who are discussing places which must be done an englishman is a very horrible person when he is on the warpath so is an american a frenchman or a german  i had been watching the afternoon sunlight upon the trees and the town the shift and play of colour in the crowded street of the cherry and crooning to myself because the sky was blue and i was alive beneath it with a pair of eyes in my head  immediately the sun went down behind the hills the air became bitterly cold but the people in crêpe sashes and silk coats never ceased their sober frolicking there was to be a great service in honour of the cherry blossom the next day at the chief temple of kioto and they were getting ready for it as the light died in a wash of crimson the last thing i saw was a frieze of three little japanese babies with fuzzy topknots and huge sashes trying to hang head downwards from a bamboo rail they did it and the closing eye of day regarded them solemnly as it shut the effect in silhouette was immense  a company of china teamerchants were gathered in the smokingroom after dinner and by consequence talked their own shop which was interesting their language is not our language for they know nothing of the teagardens of drying and withering and rolling of the assistant who breaks his collarbone in the middle of the busiest season or of the sickness that smites the coolie lines at about the same time they are happy men who get their tea by the break of a thousand chests from the interior of the country and play with it upon the london markets none the less they have a very wholesome respect for indian tea which they cordially detest here is the sort of argument that a foochow man himself a very heavy buyer flung at me across the table  you may talk about your indian teasassam and kangra or whatever you call thembut i tell you that if ever they get a strong hold in england the doctors will be down on them sir theyll be medically forbidden see if they arent they shatter your nerves to pieces unfit for human consumptionthats what they are though i dont deny they are selling at home they dont keep though after three months the sorts that ive seen in london turn to hay  i think you are wrong there said a hankow man my experience is that the indian teas keep better than ours by a long way butturning to meif we could only get the china government to take off the duties we could smash indian tea and every one connected with it we could lay down tea in mincing lane at threepence a pound no we do not adulterate our teas thats one of your tricks in india we get it as pure as yoursevery chest in the break equal to sample  you can trust your native buyers then i interrupted  trust em of course we can cut in the foochow merchant there are no teagardens in china as you understand them the peasantry cultivate the tea and the buyers buy from them for cash each season you can give a chinaman a hundred thousand dollars and tell him to turn it into tea of your own particular chopup to sample of course the man may be a thoroughpaced rogue in many ways but he knows better than to play the fool with an english house back comes your teaa thousand halfchests well say you open perhaps five and the balance go home untried but they are all equal to sample thats business that is the chinamans a born merchant and full of backbone i like him for business purposes the japs no use he isnt man enough to handle a hundred thousand dollars very possibly hed run off with itor try to  the jap has no business savvy god knows i hate the chinamen said a bass voice behind the tobacco smoke but you can do business with him the japs a little huckster who cant see beyond his nose  they called for drinks and told tales these merchants of chinatales of money and bales and boxesbut through all their stories there was an implied leaning upon native help which even allowing for the peculiarities of china was rather startling the compradore did this ho whang did that a syndicate of pekin bankers did the other thingand so on i wondered whether a certain lordly indifference as to details had anything to do with eccentricities in the china teabreaks and fluctuations of quality which do occur in spite of all the men said to the contrary again the merchants spoke of china as a place where fortunes are madea land only waiting to be opened up to pay a hundredfold they told me of the home government helping private trade in kind and unobtrusive ways to get a firmer hold on the public works department contracts that are now flying abroad this was pleasant hearing but the strangest thing of all was the tone of hope and almost contentment that pervaded their speech they were welltodo men making money and they liked their lives you know how when two or three of us are gathered together in our own barren pauper land we groan in chorus and are disconsolate the civilian the military man and the merchant they are all alike the one overworked and broken by exchange the second a highly organised beggar and the third a nobody in particular always at loggerheads with what he considers an academical government i knew in a way that we were a grim and miserable community in india but i did not know the measure of our fall till i heard men talking about fortunes success money and the pleasure good living and frequent trips to england that money brings their friends did not seem to die with unnatural swiftness and their wealth enabled them to endure the calamity of exchange with calm yes we of india are a wretched folk  very early in the dawn before the nesting sparrows were awake there was a sound in the air which frightened me out of my virtuous sleep it was a lisping muttervery deep and entirely strange thats an earthquake and the hillside is beginning to slide quoth i taking measures of defence the sound repeated itself again and again till i argued that if it were the precursor of an earthquake the affair had stuck halfway at breakfast men said that was the great bell of kioto just next door to the hotel a little way up the hillside as a bell yknow its rather a failure from an english point of view they dont ring it properly and the volume of sound is comparatively insignificant  so i fancied when i first heard it i said casually and went out up the hill under sunshine that filled the heart and trees that filled the eye with joy you know the unadulterated pleasure of that first clear morning in the hills when a months solid idleness lies before the loafer and the scent of the deodars mixes with the scent of the meditative cigar that was my portion when i stepped through the violetstudded long grass into forgotten little japanese cemeteriesall broken pillars and lichened tabletstill i found under a cut in the hillside the big bell of kiototwenty feet of green bronze hung inside a fantastically roofed shed of wooden beams a beam by the way is a beam in japan anything under a foot thick is a stick these beams were the best parts of big trees clamped with bronze and iron a knuckle rapped lightly on the lip of the bellit was not more than five feet from the groundmade the great monster breathe heavily and the blow of a stick started a hundred shrillvoiced echoes round the darkness of its dome at one side guyed by half a dozen small hawsers hung a batteringram a twelvefoot spar bound with iron its nose pointing fullbutt at a chrysanthemum in high relief on the belly of the bell then by special favour of providence which always looks after the idle they began to sound sixty strokes half a dozen men swung the ram back and forth with shoutings and outcries till it had gathered sufficient way and the loosened ropes let it hurl itself against the chrysanthemum the boom of the smitten bronze was swallowed up by the earth below and the hillside behind so that its volume was not proportionate to the size of the bell exactly as the men had said an english ringer would have made thrice as much of it but then he would have lost the crawling jar that ran through rockstone and pine for twenty yards round that beat through the body of the listener and died away under his feet like the shock of a distant blasting i endured twenty strokes and removed myself not in the least ashamed of mistaking the sound for an earthquake many times since i have heard the bell speak when i was far off it says brrr very deep down in its throat but when you have once caught the noise you will never forget it and so much for the big bell of kioto  from its house a staircase of cut stone takes you down to the temple of chionin where i arrived on easter sunday just before service and in time to see the procession of the cherry blossom they had a special service at a place called st peters at rome about the same time but the priests of buddha excelled the priests of the pope thus it happened the main front of the temple was three hundred feet long a hundred feet deep and sixty feet high one roof covered it all and saving for the tiles there was no stone in the structure nothing but wood three hundred years old as hard as iron the pillars that upheld the roof were three feet four feet and five feet in diameter and guiltless of any paint they showed the natural grain of the wood till they were lost in the rich brown darkness far overhead the crossbeams were of grained wood of great richness cedarwood and camphorwood and the hearts of gigantic pine had been put under requisition for the great work one carpenterthey call him only a carpenterhad designed the whole and his name is remembered to this day a half of the temple was railed off for the congregation by a twofoot railing over which silks of ancient device had been thrown within the railing were all the religious fittings but these i cannot describe all i remember was row upon row of little lacquered stands each holding a rolled volume of sacred writings an altar as tall as a cathedral organ where gold strove with colour colour with lacquer and lacquer with inlay and candles such as holy mother church uses only on her greatest days shed a yellow light that softened all bronze incenseburners in the likeness of dragons and devils fumed under the shadow of silken banners behind which wood tracery as delicate as frost on a windowpane climbed to the ridgepole only there was no visible roof to this temple the light faded away under the monstrous beams and we might have been in a cave a hundred fathoms below the earth but for the sunshine and blue sky at the portals where the little children squabbled and shouted  on my word i tried to note down soberly what lay before me but the eye tired and the pencil ran off into fragmentary ejaculations but what would you have done if you had seen what i saw when i went round the temple verandah to what we must call a vestry at the back it was a big building connected with the main one by a wooden bridge of deepest timeworn brown down the bridge ran a line of saffroncoloured matting and down the matting very slowly and solemnly as befitted their high office filed three and fifty priests each one clad in at least four garments of brocade crêpe and silk there were silks that do not see the light of the markets and brocades that only temple wardrobes know  there was seagreen watered silk with golden dragons terracotta crêpe with ivorywhite chrysanthemums clustering upon it blackbarred silk shot with yellow flames lapislazuli silk and silver fishes avanturine silk with plaques of greygreen let in cloth of gold over dragons blood and saffron and brown silk stiff as a board with embroidery we returned to the temple now filled with the gorgeous robes the little lacquer stands were the priests bookracks some lay down among them while others moved very softly about the golden altars and the incenseburners and the high priest disposed himself with his back to the congregation in a golden chair through which his robe winked like the shards of a tigerbeetle  in solemn calm the books were unrolled and the priests began chanting pali texts in honour of the apostle of unworldliness who had written that they were not to wear gold or mixed colours or touch the precious metals but for a few unimportant accessories in the way of halfseen images of great menbut these could have been called saintsthe scene before me might have been unrolled in a roman catholic cathedral say the rich one at arundel the same thought was in other minds for in a pause of the slow chant a voice behind me whispered      to hear the blessed mutter of the mass     and see god made and eaten all day long  it was a man from hongkong very angry that he too had not been permitted to photograph an interior he called all this splendour of ritual and paraphernalia just an interior and revenged himself by spitting browning at it  the chant quickened as the service drew to an end and the candles burned low  we went away to other parts of the temple pursued by the chorus of the devout till we were out of earshot in a paradise of screens two or three hundred years ago there lived a painterman of the name of kano him the temple of chionin brought to beautify the walls of the rooms since a wall is a screen and a screen is a wall kano r a had rather a large job but he was helped by pupils and imitators and in the end left a few hundred screens which are all finished pictures as you already know the interior of a temple is very simple in its arrangements the priests live on white mats in little rooms with brown ceilings that can at pleasure be thrown into one large room this also was the arrangement at chionin though the rooms were comparatively large and gave on to sumptuous verandahs and passages since the emperor occasionally visited the place there was a room set apart for him of more than ordinary splendour twisted silk tassels of intricate design served in lieu of catches to pull back the sliding screens and the woodwork was lacquered these be only feeble words but it is not in my grip to express the restfulness of it all or the power that knew how to secure the desired effect with a turn of the wrist the great kano drew numbed pheasants huddled together on the snowcovered bough of a pine or a peacock in his pride spreading his tail to delight his womenfolk or a riot of chrysanthemums poured out of a vase or the figures of toilworn countryfolk coming home from market or a hunting scene at the foot of fujiyama the equally great carpenter who built the temple framed each picture with absolute precision under a ceiling that was a miracle of device and time the greatest artist of the three touched the gold so that it became amber and the woodwork so that it grew dark honeycolour and the shining surface of the lacquer so that it became deep and rich and semitransparent as in one room so in all the others sometimes we slid back the screens and discovered a tiny baldpated acolyte praying over an incenseburner and sometimes a lean priest eating his rice but generally the rooms were empty swept and garnished  minor artists had worked with kano the magnificent these had been allowed to lay brush upon panels of wood in the outer verandahs and very faithfully had they toiled it was not till the guide called my attention to them that i discovered scores of sketches in monochrome low down on the verandah doors an iris broken by the fall of a branch torn off by a surly ape a bamboo spray bowed before the wind that was ruffling a lake a warrior of the past ambushing his enemy in a thicket hand on sword and mouth gathered into puckers of intensest concentration were among the many notes that met my eye how long think you would a sepiadrawing stand without defacement in the midst of our civilisation were it put on the bottom panel of a door or the scantling of a kitchen passage yet in this gentle country a man may stoop down and write his name in the very dust certain that if the writing be craftily done his childrens children will reverently let it stand  of course there are no such temples made nowadays i said when we regained the sunshine and the professor was trying to find out how panel pictures and paper screens went so well with the dark dignity of massive woodwork  they are building a temple on the other side of the city said mister yamagutchi come along and see the hairropes which hang there  we came flying in our rickshaws across kioto till we saw netted in a hundred cobwebs of scaffolding a temple even larger than the great chionin  that was burned down long agothe old temple that was here you know then the people made a penny subscription from all parts of japan and those who could not send money sent their hair to be made into rope they have been ten years building this new temple it is all wood said the guide  the place was alive with men who were putting the finishing touches to the great tiled roof and laying down the floors wooden pillars as gigantic carving as wantonly elaborate eaves as intricate in their mouldings and joinery as perfect as anything in the chionin temple met me at every turn but the freshcut wood was creamy white and lemon where in the older building it had been ironhard and brown only the raw ends of the joists were stopped with white lacquer to prevent the incursions of insects and the deeper tracery was protected against birds by fine wire netting everything else was woodwood down to the massive clamped and bolted beams of the foundation which i investigated through gaps in the flooring  japan is a great people her masons play with stone her carpenters with wood her smiths with iron and her artists with life death and all the eye can take in mercifully she has been denied the last touch of firmness in her character which would enable her to play with the whole round world we possess thatwe the nation of the glass flowershade the pink worsted mat the red and green china puppydog and the poisonous brussels carpet it is our compensation  temples said a man from calcutta some hours later as i raved about what i had seen temples im sick of temples if ive seen one ive seen fifty thousand of emall exactly alike but i tell you what is exciting go down the rapids at arashimaeight miles from here its better fun than any temple with a fatfaced buddha in the middle  but i took my friends advice have i managed to convey the impression that april is fine in japan then i apologise it is generally rainy and the rain is cold but the sunshine when it comes is worth it all we shouted with joy of living when our fiery untamed rickshaws bounded from stone to stone of the vilely paved streets of the suburbs and brought us into what ought to have been vegetable gardens but were called fields the face of the flat lands was cut up in every direction by bunds and all the roads seem to run on the top of them  never said the professor driving his stick into the black soil never have i imagined irrigation so perfectly controlled as this is look at the rajbahars faced with stone and fitted with sluices look at the waterwheels andphew but they manure their fields too well  the first circle of fields round any town is always pretty rank but this superfluity of scent continued throughout the country saving a few parts near dacca and patna the face of the land was more thickly populated than bengal and was worked five times better there was no single patch untilled and no cultivation that was not up to the full limit of the soils productiveness onions barley in little ridges between the ridges of tea beans rice and a half a dozen other things that we did not know the names of crowded the eye already wearied with the glare of the golden mustard manure is a good thing but manual labour is better we saw both even to excess when a japanese ryot has done everything to his field that he can possibly think of he weeds the barley stalk by stalk with his finger and thumb this is true i saw a man doing it  we headed through the marvellous country straight across the plain on which kioto stands till we reached the range of hills on the far side and found ourselves mixed up with half a mile of lumberyard  cultivation and watercuts were gone and our tireless rickshaws were running by the side of a broad shallow river choked with logs of every size i am prepared to believe anything of the japanese but i do not see why nature which they say is the same pitiless power all the world over should send them their logs unsplintered by rocks neatly barked and with a slot neatly cut at the end of each pole for the reception of a rope i have seen timber fly down the ravi in spate and it was hooked out as ragged as a toothbrush this material comes down clean consequently the slot is another miracle  when the day is fine said the guide softly all the people of kioto come to arashima to have picnics  but they are always having picnics in the cherrytree gardens they picnic in the teahouses theythey  yes when it is a fine day they always go somewhere and picnic  but why man isnt made to picnic  but why because it is a fine day englishmen say that the money of the japanese comes from heaven because they always do nothingso you think but look now here is a pretty place  the river charged down a turn in the pinegrown hills and broke in silver upon the timber and the remains of a light bridge washed away some days before on our side and arranged so as to face the fairest view of the young maples stood a row of teahouses and booths built over the stream the sunlight that could not soften the gloom of the pines dwelt tenderly among the green of the maples and touched the reaches below where the cherry blossom broke in pink foam against the blackroofed houses of a village across the water  there i stopped     no xvi  the party in the parlour who played games a complete history of all modern japanese art a survey of the past and a prophecy of the future arranged and composed in the kioto factories      oh brave new world that has such creatures in it     how beautiful mankind is   how i got to the teahouse i cannot tell perhaps a pretty girl waved a bough of cherry blossom at me and i followed the invitation i know that i sprawled upon the mats and watched the clouds scudding across the hills and the logs flying down the rapids and smelt the smell of the raw peeled timber and listened to the grunts of the boatmen as they wrestled with that and the rush of the river and was altogether happier than it is lawful for a man to be  the lady of the teahouse insisted upon screening us off from the other pleasureparties who were tiffining in the same verandah she brought beautiful blue screens with storks on them and slid them into grooves i stood it as long as i could there were peals of laughter in the next compartment the pattering of soft feet the clinking of little dishes and at the chinks of the screens the twinkle of diamond eyes a whole family had come in from kioto for the days pleasuring mamma looked after grandmamma and the young aunt looked after a guitar and the two girls of fourteen and fifteen looked after a merry little tomboy of eight who when she thought of it looked after the baby who had the air of looking after the whole party grandmamma was dressed in dark blue mamma in blue and grey the girls had gorgeous dresses of lilac fawn and primrose crêpe with silk sashes the colour of apple blossom and the inside of a newly cut melon the tomboy was in old gold and russet brown but the baby tumbled his fat little body across the floor among the dishes in the colours of the japanese rainbow which owns no crude tints they were all pretty all except grandmamma who was merely goodhumoured and very bald and when they had finished their dainty dinner and the brown lanquer stands the blue and white crockery and the jadegreen drinkingcups had been taken away the aunt played a little piece on the samisen and the girls played blindmansbuff all round the tiny room  flesh and blood could not have stayed on the other side of the screens i wanted to play too but i was too big and too rough and so could only sit in the verandah watching these dainty bits of dresden at their game they shrieked and giggled and chattered and sat down on the floor with the innocent abandon of maidenhood and broke off to kiss the baby when he showed signs of being overlooked they played pussinthecorner their feet tied with blue and white handkerchiefs because the room did not allow unfettered freedom of limb and when they could play no more for laughing they fanned themselves as they lay propped up against the blue screenseach girl a picture no painter could reproduceand i shrieked with the best of them till i rolled off the verandah and nearly dropped into the laughing street was i a fool then i fooled in good company for an austere man from indiaa person who puts his faith in racehorses and believes nothing except the civil codewas also at arashima that day i met him flushed and excited  had a lively time he panted with a hundred children at his heels theres a sort of roulette table here where you can gamble for cakes i bought the owners stockintrade for three dollars and ran the monte carlo for the benefit of the kidsabout five thousand of em never had such fun in my life it beats the simla lotteries hollow they were perfectly orderly till they had cleared the tables of everything except a big sugartortoise then they rushed the bank and i ran away  and he was a hard man who had not played with anything as innocent as sweetmeats for many years  when we were all weak with laughing and the professors camera was mixed up in a tangle of laughing maidens to the confusion of his pictures we too ran away from the teahouse and wandered down the river bank till we found a boat of sewn planks which poled us across the swollen river and landed us on a little rocky path overhanging the water where the iris and the violet ran riot together and jubilant waterfalls raced through the undergrowth of pine and maple we were at the foot of the arashima rapids and all the pretty girls of kioto were with us looking at the view upstream a lonely black pine stood out from all its fellows to peer up the bend where the racing water ran deep in oily swirls downstream the river threshed across the rocks and troubled the fields of fresh logs on its bosom while men in blue drove silverwhite boats gunwaledeep into the foam of its onset and hooked the logs away underfoot the rich earth of the hillside sent up the breath of the turn of the year to the maples that had already caught the message from the firewinds of april oh it was good to be alive to trample the stalks of the iris to drag down the cherrybloom spray in a wash of dew across the face and to gather the violets for the mere pleasure of heaving them into the torrent and reaching out for fairer flowers  what a nuisance it is to be a slave to the camera said the professor upon whom the dumb influences of the season were working though he knew it not  what a nuisance it is to be a slave to the pen i answered for the spring had come to the land i had hated the spring for seven years because to me it meant discomfort  let us go straight home and see the flowers come out in the parks  let us enjoy what lies to our hand you philistine and we did till a cloud darkened and a wind ruffled the river reaches and we returned to our rickshaws sighing with contentment  how many people do you suppose the land supports to the square mile said the professor at a turn in the homeward road he had been reading statistics  nine hundred i said at a venture its thicker set with humans than sarun or behar say one thousand  two thousand two hundred and fifty odd can you believe it  looking at the landscape i can but i dont suppose india will believe it spose i write fifteen hundred  theyll say you exaggerate just the same better stick to the true total two thousand two hundred and fiftysix to the square mile and not a sign of poverty in the houses how do they do it  i should like to know the answer to that question japan of my limited view is inhabited almost entirely by little children whose duty is to prevent their elders from becoming too frivolous the babies do a little work occasionally but their parents interfere by petting them at yamis hotel the attendance is in the hands of tenyearolds because everybody else has gone out picnicing among the cherry trees the little imps find time to do a mans work and to scuffle on the staircase between whiles my special servitor called the bishop on account of the gravity of his appearance his blue apron and gaiters is the liveliest of the lot but even his energy cannot account for the professors statistics of population  i have seen one sort of work among the japanese but it was not the kind that makes crops it was purely artistic a ward of the city of kioto is devoted to manufactures a manufacturer in this part of the world does not hang out a sign he may be known in paris and new york that is the concern of the two cities the englishman who wishes to find his establishment in kioto has to hunt for him up and down slums with the aid of a guide i have seen three manufactories the first was of porcelainware the second of cloissonnée and the third of lacquer inlay and bronzes the first was behind black wooden palings and for external appearance might just as well have been a tripeshop inside sat the manager opposite a tiny garden four feet square in which a paperylooking palm grew out of a coarse stoneware pot and overshadowed a dwarfed pine the rest of the room was filled with pottery waiting to be packedmodern satsuma for the most part the sort of thing you get at an auction  this made send europeindiaamerica said the manager calmly you come to see  he took us along a verandah of polished wood to the kilns to the clay vats and the yards where the tiny saggers were awaiting their complement of pottery there are differences many and technical between japanese and burslem pottery in the making but these are of no consequence in the moulding house where they were making the bodies of satsuma vases the wheels all worked by hand ran true as a hair the potter sat on a clean mat with his teathings at his side when he had turned out a vasebody he saw that it was good nodded appreciatively to himself and poured out some tea ere starting the next one the potters lived close to the kilns and had nothing pretty to look at it was different in the painting rooms here in a cabinetlike house sat the men women and boys who painted the designs on the vases after the first firing that all their arrangements were scrupulously neat is only saying that they were japanese that their surroundings were fair and proper is only saying that they were artists a sprig of a cherry blossom stood out defiantly against the black of the garden paling a gnarled pine cut the blue of the sky with its spiky splinters as it lifted itself above the paling and in a little pond the iris and the horsetail nodded to the wind the workers when at fault had only to lift their eyes and nature herself would graciously supply the missing link of a design somewhere in dirty england men dream of craftsmen working under conditions which shall help and not stifle the halfformed thought they even form guilds and write semirhythmical prayers to time and chance and all the other gods that they worship to bring about the desired end would they have their dream realised let them see how they make pottery in japan each man sitting on a snowy mat with loveliness of line and colour within arms length of him while with downcast eyes hesplashes in the conventional diaper of a satsuma vase as fast as he can the barbarians want satsuma and they shall have it if it has to be made in kioto one piece per twenty minutes so much for the baser forms of the craft  the owner of the second establishment lived in a blackwood cabinetit was profanation to call it a housealone with a bronze of priceless workmanship a set of blackwood furniture and all the medals that his work had won for him in england france germany and america he was a very quiet and catlike man and spoke almost in a whisper would we be pleased to inspect the manufactory he led us through a gardenit was nothing in his eyes but we stopped to admire long stone lanterns green with moss peeped through clumps of papery bamboos where bronze storks were pretending to feed a dwarfed pine its foliage trimmed to dishlike plaques threw its arms far across a fairy pond where the fat lazy carp grubbed and rooted and a couple of eared grebes squawked at us from the protection of thewaterbutt so perfect was the silence of the place that we heard the cherry blossoms falling into the water and the lisping of the fish against the stones we were in the very heart of the willowpattern plate and loath to move for fear of breaking it the japanese are born bowerbirds they collect waterworn stones quaintly shaped rocks and veined pebbles for the ornamentation of their homes when they shift house they take the garden away with thempine trees and alland the incoming tenant has a free hand  half a dozen steps took us over the path of mossy stones to a house where the whole manufactory was at work one room held the enamel powders all neatly arranged in jars of scrupulous cleanliness a few blank copper vases ready to be operated on an invisible bird who whistled and whooped in his cage and a case of gaily painted butterflies ready for reference when patterns were wanted in the next room sat the manufactorythree men five women and two boysall as silent as sleep it is one thing to read of cloissonnée making but quite another to watch it being made i began to understand the cost of the ware when i saw a man working out a pattern of sprigs and butterflies on a plate about ten inches in diameter with finest silver ribbon wire set on edge less than the sixteenth of an inch high he followed the curves of the drawing at his side pinching the wire into tendrils and the serrated outlines of leaves with infinite patience a rough touch on the raw copperplate would have sent the pattern flying into a thousand disconnected threads when all was put down on the copper the plate would be warmed just sufficiently to allow the wires to stick firmly to the copper the pattern then showing in raised lines followed the colouring which was done by little boys in spectacles with a pair of tiniest steel chopsticks they filled from bowls at their sides each compartment of the pattern with its proper hue of paste there is not much room allowed for error in filling the spots on a butterflys wing with avanturine enamel when the said wings are less than an inch across i watched the delicate play of wrist and hand till i was wearied and the manager showed me his patternsterrible dragons clustered chrysanthemums butterflies and diapers as fine as frost on a windowpaneall drawn in unerring line those things are our subjects i compile from them and when i want some new colours i go and look at those dead butterflies said he after the enamel has been filled in the pot or plate goes to be fired and the enamel bubbles all over the boundary lines of wires and the whole comes from the furnace looking like delicate majolica it may take a month to put a pattern on the plate in outline another month to fill in the enamel but the real expenditure of time does not commence till the polishing a man sits down with the rough article all his teathings a tub of water a flannel and two or three saucers full of assorted pebbles from the brook he does not get a wheel with tripoli or emery or buff he sits down and rubs he rubs for a month three months or a year he rubs lovingly with his soul in his finger ends and little by little the efflorescence of the fired enamel gives way and he comes down to the lines of silver and the pattern in all its glory is there waiting for him i saw a man who had only been a month over the polishing of one little vase five inches high he would go on for two months when i am in america he will be rubbing still and the rubycoloured dragon that romped on a field of lazuli each tiny scale and whisker a separate compartment of enamel will be growing more lovely  there is also cheap cloissonnée to be bought said the manager with a smile we cannot make that the vase will be seventy dollars  i respected him for saying cannot instead of do not there spoke the artist  our last visit was paid to the largest establishment in kioto where boys made gold inlay on iron sitting in camphorwood verandahs overlooking a garden lovelier than any that had gone before they had been caught young even as is the custom in india a real grownup man was employed on the horrible story in iron gold and silver of two priests who waked up a raindragon and had to run for it all round the edge of a big shield but the liveliest worker of the batch was a small fat baby who had been given a tenpenny nail a hammer and a block of metal to play with that he might soak in the art by which he would live through the pores of his skin he crowed and chuckled as he whacked there are not many fiveyearolds in england who could hammer anything without pulping their little pink fingers the baby had learned how to hit straight on the wall of the room hung a japanese painting of the apotheosis of art it represented with fidelity all the processes of pottery from the digging of the clay to the last firing but all the pencilled scorn of the artist was reserved for the closing scene where an englishman his arm round his wifes waist was inspecting a shop full of curios the japanese are not impressed with the grace of our clothing or the beauty of our countenances later we beheld the manufacture of gold lacquer which is laid on speck by speck from an agate palette fitted on the artists thumb and the carving of ivory which is exciting until you begin to realise that the graver never slips  a lot of their art is purely mechanical said the professor when he was safe back in the hotel  sos a lot of oursspecially our pictures only we cant be spiritedly mechanical i answered fancy a people like the japanese solemnly going in for a constitution observe the only two nations with constitution worth having are the english and the americans the english can only be artistic in spots and by way of the art of other nationssicilian tapestries persian saddlebags khoten carpets and the sweepings of pawnbrokers shops the americans are artistic so long as a few of em can buy their art to keep abreast of the times with spain is artistic but she is also disturbed at intervals france is artistic but she must have her revolution every twenty years for the sake of fresh material russia is artistic but she occasionally wishes to kill her czar and has no sort of government germany is not artistic because she experienced religion and italy is artistic because she did very badly india  when you have finished your verdict on the world perhaps youll go to bed  consequently i continued with scorn i am of opinion that a constitution is the worst thing in the world for a people who are blessed with souls above the average now the first demand of the artistic temperament is mundane uncertainty the second is  sleep said the professor and left the room     no xvii  of the nature of the tokaido and japanese railway construction one traveller explains the life of the sahiblog and another the origin of dice of the babies in the bath tub and the man in d t      when i went to hell i spoke to the man on the road      old saw   you know the story of the miner who borrowed a dictionary and returned it with the remark that the stories though interesting in the main were too various i have the same complaint to make against japanese scenerytwelve hours of it by train from nagoya to yokohama about seven hundred years ago the king of those days built a searoad which he called the tokaido or else all the seacoast was called the tokaido but its of no importance which road endures to the present later on when the english engineer appeared he followed the grand trunk more or less closely and the result has been a railway that any nation might take off their hat to the last section of the through line from kioto to yokohama was only opened five days before the professor and i honoured it with an unofficial inspection  the accommodation of all kinds is arranged for the benefit of the japanese and this is distressing to the foreigner who expects in a carriage remotely resembling e i r rollingstock the conveniences of that peagreen and very dusty old line but it suits the japanese admirably they hop out at every other stationpro re nataand occasionally get left behind two days ago they managed to kill a government official of high standing between a footboard and a platform and today the japanese papers are seriously discussing the advantages of lavatories far be it from me to interfere with the arrangements of an artistic empire but for a twelve hours run there might at least be arrangements  we had left the closepacked cultivation at the foot of the hills and were running along the shores of a great lake all steelblue from one end to the other except where it was dotted with little islands then the lake turned into an arm of the sea and we ran across it on a cutstone causeway and the profligacy of the pines ceased as the trees had to come down from clothing dank hills and fight with bowed head outstretched arms and firmly planted feet against the sands of the pacific whose breakers were spouting and blowing not a quarter of a mile away from the causeway the japs know all about forestry they stake down wandering sandtorrents which are still allowed to ruin our crops in the hoshiarpur district and they plug a shifting sanddune with wattle dams and pine seedlings as cleverly as they would pin plank to plank were their forest officers trained at nancy or are they local products the stakebinding used to hold the sand is of french pattern and the diagonal planting out of the trees is also french  half a minute after the train dropped this desolate hardly controlled beach it raced through four or five miles of the suburbs of patna but a clean and glorified patna bowered in bamboo plantations then it hit a tunnel and sailed forth into a section of the london brighton and south coast or whatever the line is that wants to make the channel tunnel at any rate the embankment was on the beach and the waves lapped the foot of it and there was a wall of cut rock to landward then we disturbed many villages of fishermen whose verandahs gave on to the track and whose nets lay almost under our wheels the railway was still a new thing in that particular part of the world for mothers held up their babes to see it  any one can keep pace with indian scenery arranged as it is in reaches of five hundred miles this blinding alternation of field mountain seabeach forest bamboo grove and rolling moor covered with azalea blossoms was too much for me so i sought the society of a man who had lived in japan for twenty years  yes japans an excellent country as regards climate the rains begin in may or latter april june july and august are hot months ive known the thermometer as high as 86° at night but id defy the world to produce anything more perfect than the weather between september and may when one gets seedy one goes to the hot springs in the hakone mountains close to yokohama there are heaps of places to recruit in but we english are a healthy lot of course we dont have half as much fun as you do in india we are a small community and all our amusements are organised by ourselves for our own benefitconcerts races and amateur theatricals and the like you have heaps of em in india havent you  oh yes i said we enjoy ourselves awfully specially about this time of the year i quite understand though that small communities dependent on themselves for enjoyment are apt to feel a little slow and isolatedalmost bored in fact but you were saying  well living is not very dear and house rent is a hundred dollars a month gets you a decent house and you can get one for sixty but house property is down just now in yokohama the races are on in yokohama today and monday are you going no you ought to go and see all the foreigners enjoying themselves but i suppose youve seen much better things in india havent you you havent anything better than old fujifujiyama there he is now to the left of the line what do you think of him  i turned and beheld fujiyama across a sea of upwardsloping fields and woods it is about fourteen thousand feet highnot very much according to our ideas but fourteen thousand feet above the sea when one stands in the midst of sixteenthousandfoot peaks is quite another thing from the same height noted at sealevel in a comparatively flat country the labouring eye crawls up every foot of the dead craters smooth flank and at the summit confesses that it has seen nothing in all the himalayas to match the monster i was satisfied fujiyama was exactly as i had seen it on fans and lacquer boxes i would not have sold my sight of it for the crest of kinchinjunga flushed with the morning fujiyama is the keynote of japan when you understand the one you are in a position to learn something about the other i tried to get information from my fellowtraveller  yes the japanese are building railways all over the island what i mean to say is that the companies are started and financed by japs and they make em pay i cant quite tell you where the money comes from but its all to be found in the country japans neither rich nor poor but just comfortable im a merchant myself cant say that i altogether like the jap way o doing business you can never be certain whether the little beggar means what he says give me a chinaman to deal with other men have told you that have they youll find that opinion at most of the treaty ports but what i will say is that the japanese government is about as enterprising a government as you could wish and a good one to have dealings with when japan has finished reconstructing herself on the new lines shell be quite a respectable little power see if she isnt now we are coming into the hakone mountains watch the railway its rather a curiosity  we came into the hakone mountains by way of some irish scenery a scotch troutstream a devonshire combe and an indian river running masterless over half a mile of pebbles this was only the prelude to a set of geological illustrations including the terraces formed by ancient riverbeds denudation and half a dozen other ations i was so busy telling the man from yokohama lies about the height of the himalayas that i did not watch things closely till we got to yokohama at eight in the evening and went to the grand hotel where all the clean and nicely dressed people who were just going in to dinner regarded us with scorn and men whom we had met on steamers aforetime dived into photograph books and pretended not to see us theres a deal of human nature in a mangot up for dinnerwhen a woman is watching himand you look like a bricklayereven in yokohama  the grand is the semi or cottage grand really but you had better go there unless a friend tells you of a better a long course of good luck has spoiled me for even average hotels they are too fine and large at the grand and they dont always live up to their grandeur unlimited electric bells but no one in particular to answer em printed menu but the first comers eat all the nice things and so forth none the less there are points about the grand not to be despised it is modelled on the american fashion and is but an open door through which you may catch the first gust from the pacific slope officially there are twice as many english as americans in the port actually you hear no languages but french german or american in the street my experience is sadly limited but the american i have heard up to the present is a tongue as distinct from english as patagonian  a gentleman from boston was kind enough to tell me something about it he defended the use of i guess as a shakespearian expression to be found in richard the third i have learned enough never to argue with a bostonian  all right i said ive never heard a real american say i guess but what about the balance of your extraordinary tongue do you mean to say that it has anything in common with ours except the auxiliary verbs the name of the creator and damn listen to the men at the next table  they are westerners said the man from boston as who should say observe this cassowary they are westerners and if you want to make a westerner mad tell him he is not like an englishman they think they are like the english they are awfully thinskinned in the west now in boston its different we dont care what the english people think of us  the idea of the english people sitting down to think about boston while boston on the other side of the water ostentatiously didnt care made me snigger the man told me stories he belonged to a republic that was why every man of his acquaintance belonged either to one of the first families in boston or else was of good salem stock and his fathers had come over in the mayflower i felt as though i were moving in the midst of a novel fancy having to explain to the casual stranger the blood and breeding of the hero of every anecdote i wonder whether many people in boston are like my friend with the salem families i am going there to see  theres no romance in americaits all hard business facts said a man from the pacific slope after i had expressed my opinion about some rather curious murder cases which might have been called miscarriages of justice ten minutes later i heard him say slowly apropos of a game called round the horn this is a bad game dont play it with a stranger well its a good thing for this game that omaha came up dice were invented in omaha and the man who invented em he made a colossal fortune  i said nothing i began to feel faint the man must have noticed it sixandtwenty years ago omaha came up he repeated looking me in the eye and the number of dice that have been made in omaha since that time is incalculable  there is no romance in america i moaned like a stricken ringdove in the professors ear nothing but hard business facts and the first families of boston massachusetts invented dice at omaha when it first came up twentysix years ago and thats the solid truth what am i to do with a people like this  are you describing japan or america for goodness sake stick to one or the other said the professor  it wasnt my fault theres a bit of america in the barroom and on my word its rather more interesting than japan lets go across to frisco and hear some more lies  lets go and look at photographs and refrain from mixing our countries or our drinks  by the way wherever you go in the further east be humble to the white trader recollect that you are only a poor beast of a buyer with a few dirty dollars in your pockets and you cant expect a man to demean himself by taking them and observe humility not only in the shops but elsewhere i was anxious to know how i should cross the pacific to frisco and very foolishly went to an office where they might under certain circumstances be supposed to attend to these things but no anxiety troubled the sprightly soul who happened to be in the officechair theres heaps of time for finding out later on he said and anyhow im going to the races this afternoon come later on i put my head in the spittoon and crawled out under the door  when i am left behind by the steamer it will console me to know that that young man had a good time and won heavily everybody keeps horses in yokohama and the horses are nice little fat little tubs of the circus persuasion i didnt go to the races but a calcutta man did and returned saying that they ran 132 carthorses and even time for a mile was four minutes and twentyseven seconds perhaps he had lost heavily but i can vouch for the riding of the few gentlemen i saw outside the animals it is very impartial and remarkably all round  just when the man from boston was beginning to tell me some more stories about first families the professor developed an unholy taste for hot springs and bore me off to a place called myanoshita to wash myself well come back and look at yokohama later on but we must go to this because its so beautiful  im getting tired of scenery its all beautiful and it cant be described but these men here tell you stories about america did you ever hear how the people of carmel lynched edward m petree for preaching the gospel without making a collection at the end of the service theres no romance in americaits all hard business facts edward m petree was  are you going to see japan or are you not  i went to see first in a train for one hour in the company of a carriageful of howling globetrotters then in a rickshaw for four you cannot appreciate scenery unless you sit in a rickshaw we struck after seven miles of modified flatthe flattery of nature that lures you to her more rugged hearta mountain river all black pools and boiling foam him we followed into the hills along a road cut into the crumbling volcanic rock and entirely unmetalled it was as hard as the simla cartroad but those far hills behind kalka have no such pine and maple ash and willow it was a land of greenclothed cliff and silver waterfall lovely beyond the defilement of the pen at every turn in the road whence a view could be commanded stood a little teahouse full of admiring japanese the jap dresses in blue because he knows that it contrasts well with the colour of the pines when he dies he goes to a heaven of his own because the colouring of ours is too crude to suit him  we kept the valley of the glorified stream till the waters sank out of sight down the cliff side and we could but hear them calling to one another through the tangle of the trees where the woodlands were lovelier the gorge deepest and the colours of the young hornbeam most tender they had clapped down two vile hostelries of wood and glass and a village that lived by selling turned wood and glass inlay things to the tourist  australians angloindians dwellers in london and the parts beyond the channel were running up and down the slopes of the hotel garden and by their strange dresses doing all they knew to deface the landscape the professor and i slid down the cliff at the back and found ourselves back in japan once more rough steps took us five or six hundred feet down through dense jungle to the bed of that stream we had followed all the day the air vibrated with the rush of a hundred torrents and whenever the eye could pierce the undergrowth it saw a headlong stream breaking itself on a boulder up at the hotel we had left the gray chill of a november day and cold that numbed the fingers down in the gorge we found the climate of bengal with real steam thrown in green bamboo pipes led the hot water to a score of bathinghouses in whose verandahs japanese in blue and white dressinggowns lounged and smoked from unseen thickets came the shouts of those who bathed andoh shame round the corner strolled a venerable old lady chastely robed in a white bathing towel and not too much of that then we went up the gorge mopping our brows and staring to the sky through arches of rampant foliage  japanese maids of fourteen or fifteen are not altogether displeasing to behold i have not seen more than twenty or thirty of them of these none were in the least disconcerted at the sight of the stranger after all twas but brighton beach without the bathinggowns at the head of the gorge the heat became greater and the hot water more abundant the joints of the waterpipes on the ground gave off jets of steam there was vapour rising from boulders on the riverbed and the stab of a stick into the warm moist soil was followed by a little pool of warm water the existing supply was not enough for the inhabitants they were mining for more in a casual and disconnected fashion i tried to crawl down a shaft eighteen inches by two feet in the hillside but the steam which had no effect on the japanese hide drove me out what happens i wonder when the pick strikes the liquid and the miner has to run or be parboiled  in the twilight when we had reached upper earth once more and were passing through the one street of myanoshita we saw two small fat cherubs about three years old taking their evening tub in a barrel sunk under the eaves of a shop they feigned great fear peeping at us behind outspread fingers attempting futile dives and trying to hide one behind the other in a hundred poses of spankable chubbiness while their father urged them to splash us it was the prettiest picture of the day and one worth coming even to the sticky paintreeking hotel to see                                       he was dressed in a black frockcoat and at first i took him for a missionary as he mooned up and down the empty corridor  i have been under a ban for three days he whispered in a husky voice through no fault of mineno fault of mine they told me to take the third watch but they didnt give me a printed notification which i always require and the manager of this place says that whisky would hurt me through no fault of mine god knows no fault of mine  i do not like being shut up in an echoing wooden hotel next door to a gentleman of the marine persuasion who is just recovering from d t and who talks to himself all through the dark hours     no xviii  concerning a hotwater tap and some general conversation      always speak to the stranger if he doesnt shoot the chances     are hell answer youwestern proverb   it is a far cry from myanoshita to michni and mandalay that is why we have met men from both those stations and have spent a cheerful time talking about dacoits and the black mountain expedition one of the advantages of foreign travel is that one takes such a keen interest in and hears so much about home truly they change their trains but not their train of thought who run across the sea  this is a most extraordinary place said the professor red as a boiled lobster you sit in your bath and turn on the hot or cold spring as you choose and the temperature is phenomenal lets go and see where it all comes from and then lets go away  there is a place called the burning mountain five miles in the hills there went we through unbroken loveliness of bamboocopse pine wood grass downs and pine wood again while the river growled below in the end we found an impoverished and secondhand hell set out orderly on the side of a raw and bleeding hillside it looked as though a matchfactory had been whelmed by a landslip water in which bad eggs had been boiled stood in blisterlipped pools and puffs of thin white smoke went up from the labouring underearth despite the smell and the sulphur incrustations on the black rocks i was disappointed till i felt the heat of the ground which was the heat of a boilersheathing they call the mountain extinct if untold tons of power cased in a few feet of dirt be the japanese notion of extinction glad i am that i have not been introduced to a lively volcano indeed it was not an overweening notion of my own importance but a tender regard for the firecrust below and a dread of starting the machinery by accident that made me step so delicately and urge return upon the professor  huh its only the boiler of your morning bath all the sources of the springs are here said he  i dont care let em alone did you never hear of a boiler bursting dont prod about with your stick in that amateur way youll turn on the tap  when you have seen a burning mountain you begin to appreciate japanese architecture it is not solid every one is burned out once or twice casually a business isnt respectable until it has received its baptism of fire but fire is of no importance the one thing that inconveniences a jap is an earthquake consequently he arranges his house that it shall fall lightly as a bundle of broom upon his head still further safeguarding himself he has no foundations but the cornerposts rest on the crowns of round stones sunk in the earth the cornerposts take the wave of the shock and though the building may give way like an eeltrap nothing very serious happens this is what epicures of earthquakes aver i wait for mine own experiences but not near a suspected district such as the burning mountain  it was only to escape from one terror to another that i fled myanoshita a bluebreeched dwarf thrust me into a dwarf rickshaw on spidery wheels and down the rough road that we had taken four hours to climb ran me clamorously in half an hour take all the parapets off the simla road and leave it alone for ten years then run down the steepest four miles of any sectionnot steeper than the drop to the old gaiety theatrebehind one man  we couldnt get six hillmen to take us in this style shouted the professor as he spun by his wheels kicking like a ducks foot and the whole contraption at an angle of thirty i am proud to think that not even sixty hillmen would have gambolled with a sahib in that disgraceful manner nor would any tramway company in the real east have run its cars to catch a train that used to start last year but nowrest its soulis as dead as queen anne this thing a queer little sevenmile tramway accomplished with much dignity it owned a firstclass car and a secondclass cartwo horses to eachand it ran them with a hundred yards headwaythe one all but empty and the other half full when the very small driver could not control his horses which happened on the average once every two minutes he did not waste time by pulling them in he screwed down the brake and laughedpossibly at the company who had paid for the very elaborate car yet he was an artistic driver he wore no philistine brass badge between the shoulders of his blue jerkin were done in white three railheads in a circle and on the skirts as many tramwheels conventionalised only the japanese know how to conventionalise a tramwheel or make a keypattern of railheads though we took twelve hours to cover the thirty miles that separated us from yokohama we admitted this much while we waited for our train in a village by the sea a village of any size is about three miles long in the main street villages with a population of more than ten thousand souls take rank as towns  and yet said a man at yokohama that night you have not seen the densest population thats away in the western kensdistricts as you call them the folk really are crowded thereabouts but virtually poverty does not exist in the country you see an agricultural labourer can maintain himself and his family as far as rice goes for four cents a day and the price of fish is nominal rice now costs a hundred pounds to the dollar what do you make it by indian standards from twenty to twentyfive seers the rupee yes thats about it well he gets perhaps three dollars and ahalf a month the people spend a good deal in pleasuring they must enjoy themselves i dont think they save much how do they invest their savings in jewellery no not exactly though youll find that the womens hairpins which are about the only jewellery they wear cost a good deal seven and eight dollars are paid for a good hairpin and of course jade may cost anything what the women really lock their money up in is in their obisthe things you call sashes an obi is ten or twelve yards long and ive known them sold wholesale for fifty dollars each every woman above the poorest class has at least one good dress of silk and an obi yes all their savings go in dress and a handsome dress is always worth having the western kens are the richest taken all round a skilled mechanic there gets a dollar or dollar and ahalf a day and as you know lacquerworkers and inlayersartistsget two theres enough money in japan for all current expenses they wont borrow any for railroads they raise it emselves most progressive people the japanese are as regards railways they make them very cheaply much more cheaply than any european lines ive some experience and i take it that two thousand pounds a mile is the average cost of construction not on the tokaido of coursethe line that you came up by thats a government line state built and a very expensive one im speaking of the japanese railway company with a mileage of three hundred and the line from kobé south and the kinshin line in the southern island there are lots of little companies with a few score miles of line but all the companies are extending the reason why the construction is so cheap is the nature of the land theres no long haulage of rails because you can nearly always find a creek running far up into the country and dump out your rails within a few miles of the place where they are wanted then again all your timber lies to your hand and your staff are japs there are a few european engineers but they are quite the heads of the departments and i believe if they were cleared out tomorrow the japs would go on building their lines they know how to make em pay one line started on a state guarantee of eight per cent it hasnt called for the guarantee yet its making twelve per cent on its own hook theres a very heavy freight traffic in wood and provisions for the big towns and theres a local traffic that you can have no idea of unless youve watched it the people seem to move in twentymile circles for business or pleasurespecially pleasure oh i tell you japan will be a gridiron of railways before long in another month or two youll be able to travel nearly seven hundred miles on and by the tokaido line alone from one end to the other of the central islands getting from east to west is harder work the backbonehills of the country are just cruel and it will be some time before the japs run many lines across but theyll do it of course their country must go forward  if you want to know anything about their politics im afraid i cant help you much they are so to speak drunk with western liquor and are sucking it up by the hogshead in a few years they will see how much of what we call civilisation they really want and how much they can discard tisnt as if they had to learn the arts of life or how to make themselves comfortable they knew all that long ago when their railway system is completed and they begin to understand their new constitution they will have learned as much as we can teach em thats my opinion but it needs time to understand this country ive been a matter of eight or ten years in it and my views arent worth much ive come to know some of the old families that used to be of the feudal nobility they keep themselves to themselves and live very quietly i dont think youll find many of them in the official classes their one fault is that they entertain far beyond their means they wont receive you informally and take you into their houses they raise dancinggirls or take you to their club and have a big feed they dont introduce you to their wives and they havent yet given up the rule of making the wife eat after the husband like the native of india you say well i am very fond of the jap but i suppose he is a native any way you look at him you wouldnt think that he is careless in his workmanship and dishonest a chinaman on an average is out and away a bigger rogue than a jap but he has sense enough to see that honesty is the best policy and to act by that light a jap will be dishonest just to save himself trouble hes like a child that way  how many times have i had to record such an opinion as the foregoing everywhere the foreigner says the same thing of the neathanded polite little people that live among flowers and babies and smoke tobacco as mild as their own manners i am sorry but when you come to think of it a race without a flaw would be perfect and then all the other nations of the earth would rise up and hammer it to pieces and then there would be no japan  ill give you a day to think over things generally said the professor after that well go to nikko and tokio who has not seen nikko does not know how to pronounce the world beautiful  yokohama is not the proper place to arrange impressions in the pacific ocean knocks at your door asking to be looked at the japanese and american menofwar demand serious attention through a telescope and if you wander about the corridors of the grand hotel you stop to play with spanish generals all gold lace and spurs or are captured by touts for curioshops it is not a nice experience to find a sahib in a panama hat handing you the card of his firm for all the world like a delhi silkmerchant you are inclined to pity that man until he sits down gives you a cigar and tells you all about his diseases his past career in california where he was always making money and always losing it and his hopes for the future you see then that you are entering upon a new world talk to every one you meet if they show the least disposition to talk to you and you will gather as i have done a host of stories that will be of use to you hereafter unfortunately they are not all fit for publication when i tore myself away from the distractions of the outer world and was just sitting down to write seriously on the future of japan there entered a fascinating man with heaps of money who had collected indian and japanese curios all his life and was now come to this country to get some old books which his collection lacked can you imagine a more pleasant life than his wanderings over the earth with untold special knowledge to back each signature of his chequebook  in five minutes he had carried me far away from the clattering fidgetty folk around to a quiet world where men meditated for three weeks over a bronze and scoured all japan for a swordguard designed by a great artist andwere horribly cheated in the end  who is the best artist in japan now i asked  he died in tokio last friday poor fellow and there is no one to take his place his name was k and as a general rule he could never be persuaded to work unless he was drunk he did his best pictures when he was drunk  Ému artists are never drunk  quite right ill show you a swordguard that he designed all the best artists out here do a lot of designing k used to fritter away his time on designs for old friends had he stuck to pictures he could have made twice as much but he never turned out potboilers when you go to tokio make it your business to get two little books of his called drunken sketchespictures that he did when he wasému there is enough dash and go in them to fill half a dozen studios an english artist studied under him for some time but ks touch was not communicable though he might have taught his pupil something about technique have you ever come across one of ks crows you could tell it anywhere he could put all the wicked thoughts that ever came into the mind of a crowand a crow is first cousin to the devilon a piece of paper six inches square with a brush of indian ink and two turns of his wrist look at the swordguard i spoke of how is that for feeling  on a circular piece of iron four inches in diameter and pierced by the pole for the tang of the blade poor k who died last friday had sketched the figure of a coolie trying to fold up a cloth which was bellying to a merry breezenot a cold wind but a sportive summer gust the coolie was enjoying the performance and so was the cloth it would all be folded up in another minute and the coolie would go on his way with a grin  this thing had k conceived and the faithful workman executed with the lightest touches of the graver to the end that it might lie in a collectors cabinet in london  wah wah i said and returned it reverently it would kill a man who could do that to live after his touch had gone well for him he diedbut i wish i had seen him show me some more  ive got a painting by hokusaithe great artist who lived at the end of the last century and the beginning of this even you have heard of hokusai havent you  a little i have heard it was impossible to get a genuine painting with his signature attached  thats true but ive shown this one to the japanese government expert in picturesthe man the mikado consults in cases of doubtto the first european authority on japanese art and of course i have my own opinion to back the signed guarantee of the seller look  he unrolled a silkscroll and showed me the figure of a girl in pale blue and grey crêpe carrying in her arms a bundle of clothes that as the tub behind her showed had just been washed a darkblue handkerchief was thrown lightly over the left forearm shoulder and neck ready to tie up the clothes when the bundle should be put down the flesh of the right arm showed through the thin drapery of the sleeve the right hand merely steadied the bundle from above the left gripped it firmly from below through the stiff blueblack hair showed the outline of the left ear  that there was enormous elaboration in the picture from the ornamentation of the hairpins to the graining of the clogs did not strike me till after the first five minutes when i had sufficiently admired the certainty of touch  recollect there is no room for error in painting on silk said the proud possessor the line must stand under any circumstances all that is possible before painting is a little dotting with charcoal which is rubbed off with a featherbrush did he know anything about drapery or colour or the shape of a woman is there any one who could teach him more if he were alive today  then we went to nikko     no xix  the legend of nikko ford and the story of the avoidance of misfortune      a rosered city half as old as time   five hours in the train took us to the beginning of a rickshaw journey of twentyfive miles the guide unearthed an aged cart on japanese lines and seduced us into it by promises of speed and comfort beyond anything that a rickshaw could offer never go to nikko in a cart the town of departure is full of packponies who are not used to it and every third animal tries to get a kick at his friends in the shafts this renders progress sufficiently exciting till the bumpsomeness of the road quenches all emotions save one nikko is reached through one avenue of cryptomeriascypresslike trees eighty feet high with red or dull silver trunks and hearseplume foliage of darkest green when i say one avenue i mean one continuous avenue twentyfive miles long the trees so close to each other throughout that their roots interlace and form a wall of wood on either side of the sunken road where it was necessary to make a village along the line of marchthat is to say once every two or three milesa few of the giants had been wrenched outas teeth are wrenched from a fullplanted jawto make room for the houses then the trees closed up as before to mount guard over the road the banks between which we drove were alight with azaleas camelias and violets glorious stupendous magnificent sang the professor and i in chorus for the first five miles in the intervals of the bumps the avenue took not the least notice of our praise except by growing the trees even more closely together vistas of pillared shade are very pleasant to read about but on a cold day the ungrateful heart of man could cheerfully dispense with a mile or two of it if that would shorten the journey we were blind to the beauty around to the files of packponies with manes like hearthbrooms and the tempers of eblis kicking about the path to the pilgrims with blue and white handkerchiefs on their heads enviable silvergrey leggings on their feet and buddhalike babies on their backs to the trim country drays pulled by miniature carthorses bringing down copper from the mines and saki from the hills to the colour and movement in the villages where all the little children shouted ohios and all the old people laughed the grey treetrunks marched us solemnly along over that horrid bad road which had been mended with brushwood and after five hours we got nikko in the shape of a long village at the foot of a hill and capricious nature to reward us for our sore bones laughed on the instant in floods of sunshine and upon what a mad scene did the light fall the cryptomerias rose in front of us a wall of green darkness a tearing torrent ran deepgreen over blue boulders and between stream and trees was thrown a bloodred bridgethe sacred bridge of red lacquer that no foot save the mikados may press  very cunning artists are the japanese long ago a greathearted king came to nikko river and looked across at the trees upstream at the torrent and the hills whence it came and downstream at the softer outlines of the crops and spurs of wooded mountains it needs only a dash of colour in the foreground to bring this all together said he and he put a little child in a blue and white dressinggown under the awful trees to judge the effect emboldened by his tenderness an aged beggar ventured to ask for alms now it was the ancient privilege of the great to try the temper of their blades upon beggars and such cattle mechanically the king swept off the old mans head for he did not wish to be disturbed the blood spurted across the granite slabs of the riverford in a sheet of purest vermilion the king smiled chance had solved the problem for him build a bridge here he said to the court carpenter of just such a colour as that stuff on the stones build also a bridge of grey stone close by for i would not forget the wants of my people so he gave the little child across the stream a thousand pieces of gold and went his way he had composed a landscape as for the blood they wiped it up and said no more about it and that is the story of nikko bridge you will not find it in the guidebooks  i followed the voice of the river through a rickety toyvillage across some rough bottomland till crossing a bridge i found myself among lichened stones scrub and the blossoms of spring a hillside steep and wooded as the flanks of the red aravallis rose on my left on my right the eye travelled from village to cropland crop to towering cypress and rested at last on the cold blue of an austere hilltop encircled by streaks of yet unmelted snow the nikko hotel stood at the foot of this hill and the time of the year was may then a sparrow came by with a piece of grass in her beak for she was building her nest and i knew that the spring was come to nikko one is so apt to forget the changes of the year over there with you in india  sitting in a solemn line on the banks of the river were fifty or sixty crosslegged images which the untrained eye put down immediately as so many small buddhas they had all even when the lichen had cloaked them with leprosy the calm port and unwinking regard of the lord of the world they are not buddhas really but other thingspresents from forgotten great men to dead and gone institutions or else memorials of ancestors the guidebook will tell you they were a ghostly crew as i examined them more closely i saw that each differed from the other many of them held in their joined arms a little store of river pebbles evidently put there by the pious when i inquired the meaning of the gift from a stranger who passed he said those so distinguished are images of the god who plays with little children up in the sky he tells them stories and builds them houses of pebbles the stones are put in his arms either that he may not forget to amuse the babies or to prevent his stock running low  i have no means of telling whether the stranger spoke the truth but i prefer to believe that tale as gospel truth only the japanese could invent the god who plays with little children thereafter the images took a new aspect in my eyes and were no longer græcobuddhist sculptures but personal friends i added a great heap of pebbles to the stock of the cheeriest among them his bosom was ornamented with small printed slips of prayers which gave him the appearance of a disreputable old parson with his bands in disorder a little further up the bank of the river was a rough solitary rock hewn with what men called a shinto shrine i knew better the thing was hindu and i looked at the smooth stones on every side for the familiar dab of red paint on a flat rock overhanging the water were carved certain characters in sanscrit remotely resembling those on a thibetan prayerwheel not comprehending these matters and grateful that i had brought no guidebook with me i clambered down to the lip of the rivernow compressed into a raging torrent do you know the strid near boltonthat spot where the full force of the river is pent up in two yards breadth the nikko strid is an improvement upon the yorkshire one the blue rocks are hollowed like soapstone by the rush of the water they rise above headlevel and in spring are tufted with azalea blossom the stranger of the godlings came up behind me as i basked on a boulder he pointed up the little gorge of rocks now if i painted that as it stands every critic in the papers would say i was a liar  the mad stream came down directly from a blue hill blotched with pink through a skyblue gorge also pinkblotched an obviously impossible pine mounted guard over the water i would give much to see an accurate representation of that view the stranger departed growling over some hidden griefconnected with the academy perhaps  hounded on by the professor the guide sought me by banks of the river and bade me come and see temples then i fairly and squarely cursed all temples being stretched at my ease on some warm sand in the hollow of a rock and ignorant as the grassshod cattle that tramped the further bank very fine temples said the guide you come and see by and by temple be shut up because priests make half an hour more time nikko time is half an hour ahead of the standard because the priests of the temples have discovered that travellers arriving at three pm try to do all the temples before fourthe officialhour of closing this defrauds the church of her dues so her servants put the clock on and nikko knowing naught of the value of time is well content  when i cursed the temples i did a foolish thing and one for which this poor pen can never make fitting reparation we went up a hill by way of a flight of grey stone slabs the cryptomerias of the nikko road were as children to the giants that overshadowed us here between their irongrey boles were flashes of redthe bloodred of the mikados bridge that great king who killed the beggar at the ford had been well pleased with the success of his experiment passing under a mighty stone arch we came into a square of splendour alive with the sound of hammers thirty or forty men were tapping the pillars and steps of a carnelian shrine heavy with gold that said the guide impassively is a godown they are renewing the lacquer first they extract it  have you ever extracted lacquer from wood i smote the foot of a pillar with force and after half a dozen blows chipped off one small fragment of the stuff in texture like red horn betraying no surprise i demanded the name of a yet more magnificent shrine across the courtyard it was red lacquered like the others but above its main door were carved in open work three apesone with his hands to his ears another covering his mouth and a third blinding his eyes  that place said the guide used to be a stable when the daimio kept his horses there the monkeys are the three who hear no wrong say no wrong and see no wrong  of course i said what a splendid device for a stable where the grooms steal the grain i was angry because i had grovelled before a godown and a stable though the round world cannot hold their equals  we entered a temple or a tomb i do not know which through a gateway of carven pillars eleven of them bore a running pattern of trefoilthe apex pointing earthwardthe twelfth had its pattern reversed  make em all the sameno good said the guide emphatically something sure to come bad by an by make one different all right save him so nothing happen then  unless i am mistaken that voluntarily breaking of the set was the one sacrifice that the designer had made to the great gods above who are so jealous of the craft of men for the rest he had done what he pleasedeven as a god might have donewith the wood in its gleaming lacquer sheath with enamel and inlay and carving and bronze hammered work and the work of the inspired chisel when he went to his account he saved himself from the jealousy of his judges by pointing to the trefoil pillars for proof that he was only a weak mortal and in no sense their equals men say that never man has given complete drawings details or descriptions of the temples of nikko only a german would try and he would fail in spirit only a frenchman could succeed in spirit but he would be inaccurate i have a recollection of passing through a door with cloisonnée hinges with a golden lintel and red lacquer jambs with panels of tortoiseshell lacquer and clamps of bronze tracery it opened into a halflighted hall on whose blue ceiling a hundred golden dragons romped and spat fire a priest moved about the gloom with noiseless feet and showed me a potbellied lantern four feet high that the dutch traders of old time had sent as a present to the temple there were posts of red lacquer dusted over with gold to support the roof on one post lay a rib of lacquer six inches thick that had been carved or punched over with high relief carvings and had set harder than crystal  the temple steps were of black lacquer and the frames of the sliding screens red that money lakhs and lakhs of money had been lavished on the wonder impressed me but little i wished to know who were the men that when the cryptomerias were saplings had sat down and spent their lives on a niche or corner of the temple and dying passed on the duty of adornment to their sons though neither father nor child hoped to see the work completed this question i asked the guide who plunged me in a tangle of daimios and shoguns all manifestly extracted from a guidebook  after a while the builders idea entered into my soul  he had said let us build bloodred chapels in a cathedral so they planted the cathedral three hundred years ago knowing that treeboles would make the pillars and the sky the roof  round each temple stood a small army of priceless bronze or stone lanterns stamped as was everything else with the three leaves that make the daimios crest the lanterns were dark green or lichened grey and in no way lightened the gloom of the red down below by the sacred bridge i believed red was a joyous colour up the hillside under the trees and the shadow of the temple eaves i saw that it was the hue of sorrow when the great king killed the beggar at the ford he did not laugh as i have said he was very sorry and said art is art and worth any sacrifice take that corpse away and pray for the naked soul once in one of the temple courtyards nature dared to rebel against the scheme of the hillside some forest tree all unimpressed by the cryptomerias had tossed a torrent of tenderest pink flowers down the face of a grey retaining wall that guarded a cutting it was as if a child had laughed aloud at some magnificence it could not understand  you see that cat said the guide pointing out a potbellied pussy painted above a door that is the sleeping cat the artist he paint it lefthanded we are proud of that cat  and did they let him remain lefthanded after he had painted that thing  oh yes you see he was always lefthanded  the infinite tenderness of the japanese towards their children extends it would seem even to artists every guide will take you to see the sleeping cat dont go it is bad coming down the hill i learned that all nikko was two feet under snow in the winter and while i was trying to imagine how fierce red white and blackgreen would look under the light of a winter sun i met the professor murmuring expletives of admiration  what have you done what have you seen said he  nothing ive accumulated a lot of impressions of no use to any one but the owner  which means you are going to slop over for the benefit of the people in india said the professor  and the notion so disgusted me that i left nikko that very afternoon the guide clamouring that i had not seen half its glories there is a lake he said there are mountains you must go see  i will return to tokio and study the modern side of japan this place annoys me because i do not understand it  yet i am the good guide of yokohama said the guide     no xx  shows how i grossly libelled the japanese army and edited a civil and military gazette which is not in the least trustworthy      and the duke said let there be cavalry and there were     cavalry and he said let them be slow and they were slow     dd slow and the japanese imperial horse called he them   i was wrong i know it i ought to have clamoured at the doors of the legation for a pass to see the imperial palace i ought to have investigated tokio and called upon some of the political leaders of the liberal and radical parties there are a hundred things which i ought to have done but somehow or other the bugles began to blare through the chill of the morning and i heard the tramp of armed men under my window the paradeground was within a stones throw of the tokio hotel the imperial troops were going on parade would you have bothered your head about politics or temples i ran after them  it is rather difficult to get accurate information about the japanese army it seems to be in perpetual throes of reorganisation at present so far as one can gather it is about one hundred and seventy thousand strong everybody has to serve for three years but payment of one hundred dollars will shorten the term of service by one year at least this is what a man who had gone through the mill told me he capped his information with this verdict english army no use only navy any good have seen two hundred english army no use  on the paradeground they had a company of foot and a wing of what for the sake of brevity i will call cavalry under instruction the former were being put through some simple evolutions in close order the latter were variously and singularly employed to the former i took off the hat of respect at the latter i am ashamed to say i pointed the finger of derision but let me try to describe what i saw the likeness of the jap infantryman to the gurkha grows when you see him in bulk thanks to their wholesale system of conscription the quality of conscripts varies immensely i have seen scores of persons with spectacles whom it were base flattery to call soldiers and who i hope were in the medical or commissariat departments again i have seen dozens of bullnecked deepchested flatbacked thinflanked little men who were as good as a colonel commanding could desire there was a man of the 2d infantry whom i met at an upcountry railway station he carried just the proper amount of insolent swagger that a soldier should refused to answer any questions of mine and parted the crowd round him without ceremony a gurkha of the prince of wales own could not have been trimmer in the crush of a ticketcollectingwe both got out togetheri managed to run my hand over that small mans forearm and chest they must have a very complete system of gymnastics in the japanese army and i would have given much to have stripped my friend and seen how he peeled if the 2d infantry are equal to sample they are good  the men on parade at tokio belonged either to the 4th or the 9th and turned out with their cowskin valises strapped but i think not packed under full kit such as i saw on the sentry at osaka castle they ought to be much too heavily burdened their officers were as miserable a set of men as japan could furnishspectacled undersized even for japan hollowbacked and humpshouldered they squeaked their words of command and had to trot by the side of their men to keep up with them the jap soldier has the long stride of the gurkha and he doubles with the easy lope of the rickshaw coolie throughout the three hours that i watched them they never changed formation but once when they doubled in pairs across the plain their rifles at the carry their step and intervals were as good as those of our native regiments but they wheeled rather promiscuously and were not checked for this by their officers so far as my limited experience goes their formation was not ours but continental the words of command were as beautifully unintelligible as anything our paradegrounds produce and between them the officers of each halfcompany vehemently harangued their men and shook their swords at em in distinctly unmilitary style the precision of their movements was beyond praise they enjoyed three hours of steady drill and in the rare intervals when they stood easy to draw breath i looked for slackness all down the ranks inasmuch as standing easy is the crucial test of men after the first smartness of the morning has worn off they stood easy neither more nor less but never a hand went to a shoe or stock or button while they were so standing when they knelt still in this queer column of company i understood the mystery of the longsword bayonet which has puzzled me sorely i had expected to see the little fellows lifted into the air as the bayonetsheath took ground but they were not they kicked it sideways as they dropped all the same the authorities tie men to the bayonets instead of bayonets to the men when at the double there was no grabbing at the cartridge pouch with one hand or steadying the bayonet with the other as may be seen any day at runningfiring on indian ranges they ran cleanlyas our gurkhas run  it was an unchristian thought but i would have given a good deal to see that company being blooded on an equal number of our native infantryjust to know how they would work if they have pluck and there is not much in their past record to show that they have not they ought to be firstclass enemies under british officers instead of the little anatomies at present provided and with a better rifle they should be as good as any troops recruited east of suez i speak here only for the handy little men i saw the worst of conscription is that it sweeps in such a mass of fourth and fifthrate citizens who though they may carry a gun are likely by their own excusable ineptitude to do harm to the morale and setup of a regiment in their walks abroad the soldiery never dream of keeping step they tie things to their sidearms they carry bundles they slouch and dirty their uniforms  and so much for a raw opinion on japanese infantry the cavalry were having a picnic on the other side of the paradegroundcircling right and left by sections trying to do something with a troop and so forth i would fain believe that the gentlemen i saw were recruits but they wore all their arms and their officers were just as clever as themselves half of them were in white fatiguedress and flat capand wore halfboots of brown leather with short huntingspurs and black straps no chains they carried carbine and swordthe sword fixed to the man and the carbine slung over the back no martingales but breastplates and crupper a huge heavy saddle with single hidegirth over two numdahs completed the equipment which a thirteenhand pony all mane and tail was trying to get rid of when you thrust a twopound bit and bridoon into a small ponys mouth you hurt his feelings when the riders wear as did my friends white worsted gloves they cannot take a proper hold of the reins when they ride with both hands sitting well on the mounts neck knuckles level with its ears and the stirrup leathers as short as they can be the chances of the pony getting rid of the rider are manifestly increased never have i seen such a wild dream of equitation as the tokio paradeground showed do you remember the picture in alice in wonderland just before alice found the lion and the unicorn when she met the armed men coming through the woods i thought of that and i thought of the white knight in the same classic and i laughed aloud here were a set of very fair ponies surefooted as goats mostly entires and full of go under japanese weights they would have made very thorough mounted infantry and here was this blindly imitative nation trying to turn them into heavy cavalry as long as the little beasts were gravely trotting in circles they did not mind their work but when it came to slashing at the turks head they objected very much indeed i affiliated myself to a section who armed with long wooden swords were enjoying some turksheading out started a pony at the gentlest of canters while the rider bundled all the reins into one hand and held his sword like a lance then the pony shied a little shy shook his shaggy head and began to passage round the turks head there was no pressure of knee or rein to tell him what was wanted the man on top began kicking with the spurs from shoulder to rump and shaking up the ironmongery in the poor brutes mouth the pony could neither rear nor kick nor buck but it shook itself free of the incubus who slid off three times i saw this happen the catastrophe didnt rise to the dignity of a fall it was the blundering collapse of incompetence plus worsted gloves twohanded riding and a haystack of equipment very often the pony went at the post and the man delivered a backhanded cut at the turks head which nearly brought him out of his worldtoowide saddle again and again this solemn performance was repeated i can honestly say that the ponies are very willing to break rank and leave their companions which is what an english troophorse fails in but i fancy this is more due to the urgent private affairs of the pony than any skill in training the troops charged once or twice in a terrifying canter when the men wished to stop they leaned back and tugged and the pony put his head to the ground and bored all he knew they charged me but i was merciful and forebore to empty half the saddles as i assuredly could have done by throwing up my arms and yelling hi the saddest thing of all was the painful conscientiousness displayed by all the performers in the circus they had to turn these rats into cavalry they knew nothing about riding and what they did know was wrong but the rats must be made troophorses why wouldnt the scheme work there was a patient pathetic wonder on the faces of the men that made me long to take one of them in my arms and try to explain things to himbridles for instance and the futility of hanging on by the spurs just when the parade was over and the troops were ambling off providence sent diagonally across the paradeground at a gallop a big rawboned man on a lathyred american horse the brute cracked his nostrils and switched his flag abroad and romped across the plain while his rider dropped one hand and sat still swaying lightly from the hips the two served to scale the surroundings some one really ought to tell the mikado that ponies were never intended for dragoons  if the changes and chances of military service ever send you against japanese troops be tender with their cavalry they mean no harm put some fusees down for the horses to step on and send a fatigueparty out to pick up the remnants but if you meet japanese infantry led by a continental officer commence firing early and often and at the longest ranges compatible with getting at them they are bad little men who know too much  having thoroughly settled the military side of the nation exactly as my japanese friend at the beginning of this letter settled uson the strength of two hundred men caught at randomi devoted myself to a consideration of tokio i am wearied of temples their monotony of splendour makes my head ache you also will weary of temples unless you are an artist and then you will be disgusted with yourself some folk say that tokio covers an area equal to london some folk say that it is not more than ten miles long and eight miles broad there are a good many ways of solving the question i found a teagarden situated on a green plateau far up a flight of steps with pretty girls smiling on every step from this elevation i looked forth over the city and it stretched away from the sea far as the eye could reachone grey expanse of packed houseroof the perspective marked by numberless factory chimneys then i went several miles away and found a park another eminence and some more teagirls prettier than the last and looking again the city stretched out in a new direction as far as the eye could reach taking the scope of the eye on a clear day at eighteen miles i make tokio thirtysix miles long by thirtysix miles broad exactly and there may be some more which i missed the place roared with life through all its quarters double lines of trams ran down the main streets for mile on mile rows of omnibuses stood at the principal railway station and the compagnie general des omnibus de tokio paraded the streets with gold and vermilion cars all the trams were full all the private and public omnibuses were full and the streets were full of rickshaws from the seashore to the shady green park from the park to the dim distance the land pullulated with people  here you saw how western civilisation had eaten into them every tenth man was attired in europe clothes from hat to boots it is a queer race it can parody every type of humanity to be met in a large english town eat and prosperous merchant with muttonchop whiskers mildeyed longhaired professor of science his clothes baggy about him schoolboy in eton jacket broadcloth trousers young clerk member of the clapham athletic club in tennis flannels artisans in sorely worn tweeds tophatted lawyer with cleanshaven upper lip and black leather bag sailor out of work and counterjumper all these and many many more you shall find in the streets of tokio in half an hours walk but when you come to speak to the imitation behold it can only talk japanese you touch it and it is not what you thought i fluctuated down the streets addressing myself to the most englishlooking folk i saw they were polite with a graciousness that in no way accorded with their raiment but they knew not a word of my tongue one small boy in the uniform of the naval college said suddenly i spik inglees and collapsed the rest of the people in our clothes poured their own vernacular upon my head yet the shopsigns were english the tramway under my feet was english gauge the commodities sold were english and the notices on the streets were in english it was like walking in a dream i reflected far away from tokio and off the line of rail i had met men like these men in the streets perfectly dressed englishmen to the outer eye but dumb the country must be full of their likes  good gracious here is japan going to run its own civilisation without learning a language in which you can say damn satisfactorily i must inquire into this  chance had brought me opposite the office of a newspaper and i ran in demanding an editor he camethe editor of the tokio public opinion a young man in a black frockcoat there are not many editors in other parts of the world who would offer you tea and a cigarette ere beginning a conversation my friend had but little english his paper though the name was printed in english was japanese but he knew his business almost before i had explained my errand which was the pursuit of miscellaneous information he began you are english how you think now the american revision treaty out came a notebook and i sweated cold it was not in the bargain that he should interview me  theres a great deal i answered remembering sir roger of blessed memorya great deal to be said on both sides the american revision treatyhmdemands an enormous amount of matured consideration and may safely be referred  but we of japan are now civilised  japan says that she is now civilised that is the crux of the whole matter so far as i understand it let us have done with the idiotic system of treatyports and passports for the foreigner who steps beyond them says japan in effect give us our place among the civilised nations of the earth come among us trade with us hold land in our midst only be subject to our jurisdiction and submit to ourtariffs now since one or two of the foreign nations have won special tariffs for their goods in the usual way they are not overanxious to become just ordinary folk the effect of accepting japans views would be excellent for the individual who wanted to go upcountry and make his money but bad for the nation for our nation in particular  all the same i was not prepared to have my ignorance of a burning question put down in any notebook save my own i gladstoned about the matter with the longest words i could my friend recorded them much after the manner of count smorltork then i attacked him on the subject of civilisationspeaking very slowly because he had a knack of running two words of mine together and turning them into something new  you are right said he we are becoming civilised but not too quick for that is bad now there are two parties in the statethe liberal and the radical one count he lead one one count lead the other the radical say that we should swiftly become all english the liberal he says not so quick because that nation which too swiftly adopt other peoples customs he decay that question of civilisation and the american revision treaty he occupied our chief attentions now we are not so zealous to become civilised as we were twothree years gone not so quickthat is our watchword yes  if matured deliberation be the wholesale adoption of imperfectly understood arrangements i should dearly like to see japan in a hurry we discussed comparative civilisations for a short time and i protested feebly against the defilement of the streets of tokio by rows of houses built after glaring european models surely there is no need to discard your own architecture i said  ha snorted the chief of the public opinion you call it picturesque i call it too wait till he light upincendiate a japanese house then is one only fire box that is why we think good to build in european fashion i tell you and you must believe that we take up no change without thinking upon it truth indeed it is not because we are curious children wanting new things as some people have said we have done with that season of picking up things and throwing them down again you see  where did you pick up your constitution then  i did not know what the question would bring forth yet i ought to have been wise the first question that a japanese on the railway asks an englishman is have you got the english translation of our constitution all the bookstalls sell it in english and japanese and all the papers discuss it the child is not yet three months old  our constitutionthat was promised to uspromised twenty years ago fourteen years ago the provinces they have been allowed to elect their big mentheir heads three years ago they have been allowed to have assemblies and thus civil liberty was assured  i was baffled here for some time in the end i thought i made out that the municipalities had been given certain control over police funds and the appointment of district officials i may have been entirely wrong but the editor bore me along on a torrent of words his body rocking and his arms waving with the double agony of twisting a foreign tongue to his service and explaining the tobetakenseriouslyness of japan whack come the little hand on the little table and the little teacups jumped again  truly and indeed this constitution of ours has not come too soon it proceeded stepby you understand that now your constitution the constitutions of the foreign nations are all bloodybloody constitutions ours has come stepby we did not fight as the barons fought with king john at runnymede  this was a quotation from a speech delivered at otsu a few days previously by a member of the government i grinned at the brotherhood of editors all the world over up went the hand anew  we shall be happy with this constitution and a people civilised among civilisations  of course but what will you actually do with it a constitution is rather a monotonous thing to work after the fun of sending members to parliament has died out you have a parliament have you not  oh yes with partiesliberal and radical  then they will both tell lies to you and to each other then they will pass bills and spend their time fighting each other then all the foreign governments will discover that you have no fixed policy  ah yes but the constitution the little hands were crossed in his lap the cigarette hung limply from his mouth  no fixed policy then when you have sufficiently disgusted the foreign powers they will wait until the liberals and radicals are fighting very hard and then they will blow you out of the water  you are not making fun i do not quite understand said he your constitutions are all so bloody  yes that is exactly what they are you are very much in earnest about yours are you not  oh yes we all talk politics now  and write politics of course by the way under whathm arrangements with the government is a japanese paper published i mean must you pay anything before starting a press  literary scientific and religious papersno quite free all purely political papers pay five hundred yengive to the government to keep or else some man says he will pay  you must give security you mean  i do not know but sometimes the government can keep the money we are purely political  then he asked questions about india and appeared astonished to find that the natives there possessed considerable political power and controlled districts  but have you a constitution in india  i am afraid that we have not  ah  he crushed me there and i left very humbly but cheered by the promise that the tokio public opinion would contain an account of my words mercifully that respectable journal is printed in japanese so the hash will not be served up to a large table i would give a good deal to discover what meaning he attached to my forecast of constitutional government in japan  we all talk politics now that was the sentence which remained to me it was true talk men of the educational department in tokio told me that the students would talk politics by the hour if you allowed them at present they were talking in the abstract about their new plaything the constitution with its upper house and its lower house its committees its questions of supply its rules of procedure and all the other skittles we have played with for six hundred years  japan is the second oriental country which has made it impossible for a strong man to govern alone this she has done of her own free will india on the other hand has been forcibly ravished by the secretary of state and the english m p  japan is luckier than india     no xxi  shows the similarity between the babu and the japanese contains the earnest outcry of an unbeliever the explanation of mr smith of california and elsewhere takes me on board ship after due warning to those who follow      very sadly did we leave it but we gave our hearts in pledge     to the pine above the city to the blossoms by the hedge     to the cherry and the maple and the plum tree and the peach     and the babiesoh the babiesromping fatly under each     eastward ho across the water see the black bow drives and swings     from the land of little children where the babies are the kings   the professor discovered me in meditation amid teagirls at the back of the ueno park in the heart of tokio my rickshaw coolie sat by my side drinking tea from daintiest china and eating maccaroons i thought of sternes donkey and smiled vacuously into the blue above the trees the teagirls giggled one of them captured my spectacles perched them on her own snubbychubby nose and ran about among her cackling fellows  and loose thy fingers in the tresses of the cypressslender minister of wine quoted the professor coming round a booth suddenly why arent you at the mikados garden party  because he didnt invite me and anyhow he wears europe clothesso does the empressso do all the court people lets sit down and consider things this people puzzles me  and i told my story of the interview with the editor of the tokio public opinion the professor had been making investigation into the educational department and further said he at the end of the tale the ambition of the educated student is to get a place under government therefore he comes to tokio will accept any situation at tokio that he may be near to his chance  whose son is that student  son of the peasant yeoman farmer and shopkeeper ryot tehsildar and bunnia while he waits he imbibes republican leanings on account of the nearness of japan to america he talks and writes and debates and is convinced he can manage the empire better than the mikado  does he go away and start newspapers to prove that  he may but it seems to be unwholesome work a paper can be suspended without reason given under the present laws and im told that one enterprising editor has just got three years simple imprisonment for caricaturing the mikado  then there is yet hope for japan i cant quite understand how a people with a taste for fighting and quick artistic perceptions can care for the things that delight our friends in bengal  you make the mistake of looking on the bengali as unique so he is in his own peculiar style but i take it that the drunkenness of western wine affects all oriental folk in much the same way what misleads you is that very likeness followest thou because a jap struggles with problems beyond his grip in much the same phraseology as a calcutta university student and discusses administration with a capital a you lump jap and chatterjee together  no i dont chatterjee doesnt sink his money in railway companies or sit down and provide for the proper sanitation of his own city or of his own notion cultivate the graces of life as the jap does he is like the tokio public opinionpurely political he has no art whatever he has no weapons and there is no power of manual labour in him yet he is like the jap in the pathos of his politics have you ever studied pathetic politics why is he like the jap  both drunk i suppose said the professor get that girl to give back your giglamps and you will be able to see more clearly into the soul of the far east  the far east hasnt got a soul she swapped it for a constitution on the eleventh of february last can any constitution make up for the wearing of europe clothes i saw a jap lady just now in full afternoon callingkit she looked atrocious have you seen the later japanese artthe pictures on the fans and in the shop windows they are faithful reproductions of the changed lifetelegraph poles down the streets conventionalised tramlines tophats and carpetbags in the hands of the men the artists can make those things almost passable but when it comes to conventionalising a europe dress the effect is horrible  japan wishes to take her place among civilised nations said the professor  thats where the pathos comes in its enough to make you weep to watch this misdirected effortthis wallowing in unloveliness for the sake of recognition at the hands of men who paint their ceilings white their grates black their mantelpieces french grey and their carriages yellow and red the mikado wears blue and gold and red his guards wear orange breeches with a stoneblue stripe down them the american missionary teaches the japanese girl to wear bangsshingled bangson her forehead plait her hair into a pigtail and to tie it up with magenta and cobalt ribbons the german sells them the offensive chromos of his own country and the labels of his beerbottles allen and ginter devastate tokio with their bloodred and grassgreen tobaccotins and in the face of all these things the country wishes to progress toward civilisation i have read the entire constitution of japan and it is dearly bought at the price of one of the kaleidoscope omnibuses plying in the street there  are you going to inflict all that nonsense on them at home said the professor  i am for this reason in the years to come when japan has sold her birthright for the privilege of being cheated on equal terms by her neighbours when she has so heavily run into debt for her railways and public works that the financial assistance of england and annexation is her only help when the daimios through poverty have sold the treasures of their houses to the curiodealer and the dealer has sold them to the english collector when all the people wear sloptrousers and readymade petticoats and the americans have established soap factories on the rivers and a boardinghouse on the top of fujiyama some one will turn up the files of the pioneer and say this thing was prophesied then they will be sorry that they began tampering with the great sausagemachine of civilisation what is put into the receiver must come out at the spout but it must come out mincemeat dixi and now let us go to the tomb of the fortyseven ronins  it has been said some time ago and much better than you can say it said the professor apropos of nothing that i could see  distances are calculated by the hour in tokio forty minutes in a rickshaw running at full speed will take you a little way into the city two hours from the ueno park brings you to the tomb of the famous fortyseven passing on the way the very splendid temples of shiba which are all fully described in the guidebooks lacquer goldinlaid bronzework and crystals carved with the words om and shri are fine things to behold but they do not admit of very varied treatment in print in one tomb of one of the temples was a room of lacquer panels overlaid with gold leaf an animal of the name of v gay had seen fit to scratch his entirely uninteresting name on the gold posterity will take note that v gay never cut his fingernails and ought not to have been trusted with anything prettier than a hogtrough  it is the handwriting upon the wall i said  presently there will be neither gold nor lacquernothing but the fingermarks of foreigners let us pray for the soul of v gay all the same perhaps he was a missionary                                       the japanese papers occasionally contain sandwiched between notes of railway mining and tram concessions announcements like the following dr  committed harakiri last night at his private residence in such and such a street family complications are assigned as the reason of the act nor does harakiri merely mean suicide by any method harakiri is harakiri and the private performance is even more ghastly than the official one it is curious to think that any one of the dapper little men with tophats and reticules who have a constitution of their own may in time of mental stress strip to the waist shake their hair over their brows and after prayer rip themselves open when you come to japan look at farsaris harakiri pictures and his photos of the last crucifixion twenty years ago in japan then at deakins inquire for the modelled head of a gentleman who was not long ago executed in tokio there is a grim fidelity in the latter work of art that will make you uncomfortable the japanese in common with the rest of the east have a strain of bloodthirstiness in their compositions it is very carefully veiled now but some of hokusais pictures show it and show that not long ago the people revelled in its outward expression yet they are tender to all children beyond the tenderness of the west courteous to each other beyond the courtesy of the english and polite to the foreigner alike in the big towns and in the mofussil what they will be after their constitution has been working for three generations the providence that made them what they are alone knows  all the world seems ready to proffer them advice colonel olcott is wandering up and down the country now telling them that the buddhist religion needs reformation offering to reform it and eating with ostentation rice gruel which is served to him in cups by admiring handmaidens a wanderer from kioto tells me that in the chionin loveliest of all the temples he saw only three days ago the colonel mixed up with a procession of buddhist priests just such a procession as the one i tried vainly to describe and tramping about as if the whole show belonged to him you cannot appreciate the solemnity of this until you have seen the colonel and the chionin temple the two are built on entirely different lines and they dont seem to harmonise it only needs now madame blavatsky cigarette in mouth under the cryptomerias of nikko and the return of mr caine m p to preach the sin of drinking saki and the menagerie would be full  something should be done to america there are many american missionaries in japan and some of them construct clapboard churches and chapels for whose ugliness no creed could compensate they further instil into the japanese mind wicked ideas of progress and teach that it is well to go ahead of your neighbour to improve your situation and generally to thresh yourself to pieces in the battle of existence they do not mean to do this but their own restless energy enforces the lesson the american is objectionable and yetthis is written from yokohamahow pleasant in every way is a nice american whose tongue is cleansed of right there all the time noos revoo raound and the falling cadence i have met such an one even nowa californian ripened in spain matured in england polished in paris and yet always a californian his voice and manners were soft alike temperate were his judgments and temperately expressed wide was his range of experience genuine his humour and fresh from the mint of his mind his reflections it was only at the end of the conversation that he startled me a little  i understand that you are going to stay some time in california do you mind my giving you a little advice i am speaking now of towns that are still rather brusque in their manners when a man offers you a drink accept at once and then stand drinks all round i dont say that the second part of the programme is as necessary as the first but it puts you on a perfectly safe footing above all remember that where you are going you must never carry anything the men you move among will do that for you they have been accustomed to it it is in some places unluckily a matter of life and death as well as daily practice to draw first i have known really lamentable accidents occur from a man carrying a revolver when he did not know what to do with it do you understand anything about revolvers  nno i stammered of course not  do you think of carrying one  of course not i dont want to kill myself  then you are safe but remember you will be moving among men who go heeled and you will hear a good deal of talk about the thing and a great many tall stories you may listen to the yarns but you must not conform to the custom however much you may feel tempted you invite your own death if you lay your hand on a weapon you dont understand no man flourishes a revolver in a bad place it is produced for one specified purpose and produced before you can wink  but surely if you draw first you have an advantage over the other man said i valorously  you think so let me show you i have no use for any weapon but i believe i have one about me somewhere an ounce of demonstration is worth a ton of theory your pipecase is on the table my hands are on the table too use that pipe case as a revolver and as quickly as you can  i used it in the approved style of the penny dreadfulpointed it with a stiff arm at my friends head before i knew how it came about the pipe case had quitted my hand which was caught close to the funnybone and tingled horribly i heard four persuasive clicks under the table almost before i knew that my arm was useless the gentleman from california had jerked out his pistol from its pocket and drawn the trigger four times his hand resting on his hip while i was lifting my right arm  now do you believe he said only an englishman or an eastern man fires from the shoulder in that melodramatic manner i had you safe before your arm went out merely because i happened to know the trick and there are men out yonder who in a trouble could hold me as safe as i held you they dont reach round for their revolver as novelists say its here in front close to the second right bracebutton and it is fired without aim at the other mans stomach you will understand now why in event of a dispute you should show very clearly that you are unarmed you neednt hold up your hands ostentatiously keep them out of your pockets or somewhere where your friend can see them no man will touch you then or if he does he is pretty sure to be shot by the general sense of the room  that must be a singular consolation to the corpse i said  i see ive misled you dont fancy that any part in america is as free and easy as my lecture shows only in a few really tough towns do you require not to own a revolver elsewhere you are all right most americans of my acquaintance have got into the habit of carrying something but its only a habit theyd never dream of using it unless they are hard pressed its the man who draws to enforce a proposition about canning peaches orangeculture or town lots or waterrights thats a nuisance  thank you i said faintly i purpose to investigate these things later on im much obliged to you for your advice  when he had departed it struck me that in the language of the east he might have been pulling my leg but there remained no doubt whatever as to his skill with the weapon he excused so tenderly  i put the case before the professor we will go to america before you forejudge it altogether said he to america in an american ship will we go and say goodby to japan that night we counted the gain of our sojourn in the land of little children more closely than many men count their silver nagasaki with the grey temples green hills and all the wonder of a firstseen shore the inland sea a thirtyhour panorama of passing islets drawn in grey and buff and silver for our delight kobé where we fed well and went to a theatre osaka of the canals and the peach blossom kiotohappy lazy sumptuous kioto and the blue rapids and innocent delights of arashima otzu on the shoreless rainy lake myanoshita in the hills kamakura by the tumbling pacific where the great god buddha sits and equably hears the centuries and the seas murmur in his ears nikko fairest of all places under the sun tokio the twothirds civilised and altogether progressive warren of humanity and composite francoamerican yokohama we renewed them all sorting out and putting aside our special treasures of memory if we stayed longer we might be disillusioned and yetsurely that would be impossible  what sort of mental impression do you carry away said the professor  a teagirl in fawncoloured crêpe under a cherry tree all blossom behind her green pines two babies and a hogbacked bridge spanning a bottlegreen river running over blue boulders in the foreground a little policeman in badly fitting europe clothes drinking tea from blue and white china on a black lacquered stand fleecy white clouds above and a cold wind up the street i said summarising hastily  mine is a little different a japanese boy in a flatheaded german cap and baggy eton jacket a king taken out of a toyshop a railway taken out of a toyshop hundreds of little noahs ark trees and fields made of greenpainted wood the whole neatly packed in a camphorwood box with an explanatory book called the constitutionprice twenty cents  you looked on the darker side of things but whats the good of writing impressions every man has to get his own at first hand suppose i give an itinerary of what we saw  you couldnt do it said the professor blandly besides by the time the next angloindian comes this way there will be a hundred more miles of railway and all the local arrangements will have changed write that a man should come to japan without any plans the guidebooks will tell him a little and the men he meets will tell him ten times more let him get first a good guide at kobé and the rest will come easily enough an itinerary is only a fresh manifestation of that unbridled egoism which  i shall write that a man can do himself well from calcutta to yokohama stopping at rangoon moulmein penang singapur hongkong canton and taking a month in japan for about sixty poundsrather less than more but if he begins to buy curios that man is lost five hundred rupees cover his month in japan and allow him every luxury above all he should bring with him thousands of cherootsenough to serve him till he reaches frisco singapur is the last place on the line where you can buy burmas beyond that point wicked men sell manila cigars with fancy names for ten and havanas for thirtyfive cents no one inspects your boxes till you reach frisco bring therefore at least one thousand cheroots  do you know it seems to me you have a very queer sense of proportion  and that was the last word the professor spoke on japanese soil     no xxii  shows how i came to america before my time and was much shaken in body and soul      then spoke der captain stossenheim     who had theories of god     oh breitmann this is judgment on     der ways dot you have trod     you only lifs to enjoy yourself     while you yourself agree     dot selfdevelopment requires     der religious ideec g leland   this is america they call her the city of peking and she belongs to the pacific mail company but for all practical purposes she is the united states we are divided between missionaries and generalsgenerals who were at vicksburg and shiloh and german by birth but more american than the americans who in confidence tell you that they are not generals at all but only brevet majors of militia corps the missionaries are perhaps the queerest portion of the cargo did you ever hear an english minister lecture for half an hour on the freighttraffic receipts and general working of let us say the midland the professor has been sitting at the feet of a keeneyed closebearded swarthy man who expounded unto him kindred mysteries with a fluency and precision that a city leaderwriter might have envied whos your financial friend with the figures at his fingers ends i asked missionarypresbyterian mission to the japs said the professor i laid my hand upon my mouth and was dumb  as a counterpoise to the missionaries we carry men from manilalean scotchmen who gamble once a month in the manila state lottery and occasionally turn up trumps one at least drew a tenthousanddollar prize last december and is away to make merry in the new world everybody on the staff of an american steamer this side the continent seems to gamble steadily in that lottery and the talk of the smokingroom runs almost entirely on prizes won by accident or lost through a moments delay the tickets are sold more or less openly at yokahama and hongkong and the drawingslosers and winners both agree hereare above reproach  we have resigned ourselves to the infinite monotony of a twenty days voyage the pacific mail advertises falsely only under the most favorable circumstances of wind and steam can their underengined boats cover the distance in fifteen days our city of peking for instance had been jogging along at a gentle ten knots an hour a pace out of all proportion to her bulk when we get a wind says the captain we shall do better she is a fourmaster and can carry any amount of canvas it is not safe to run steamers across this void under the poles of atlantic liners the monotony of the sea is paralysing we have passed the wreck of a little sealingschooner lying bottom up and covered with gulls she weltered by in the chill dawn unlovely as the corpse of a man and the wild birds piped thinly at us as they steered her across the surges the pulse of the pacific is no little thing even in the quieter moods of the sea it set our bows swinging and nosing and ducking ere we were a day clear of yokohama and yet there was never swell nor crested wave in sight we ride very high said the captain and shes a dry boat she has a knack of crawling over things somehow but we shant need to put her to the test this journey                                       the captain was mistaken for four days we have endured the sullen displeasure of the north pacific winding up with a night of discomfort it began with a grey sea flying clouds and a headwind that smote fifty knots off the days run then rose from the southeast a beam sea warranted by no wind that was abroad upon the waters in our neighbourhood and we wallowed in the trough of it for sixteen mortal hours in the stillness of the harbour when the newspaper man is lunching in her saloon and the steamlaunch is crawling round her sides a ship of pride is a stately liner out in the open one rugged shoulder of a sea between you and the horizon she becomes the old hooker a lively boat and other things of small import for this is necessary to propitiate the ocean theres a storm to the southeast of us explained the captain thats whats kicking up this sea  the city of peking did not belie her reputation she crawled over the seas in liveliest wise never shipping a bucket tillshe was forced to then she took it green over the bows to the vast edification of at least one passenger who had never seen the scuppers full before  later in the day the fun began oh shes a daisy at rolling murmured the chief steward flung starfishwise on a table among his glassware shes rolling some said a black apparition new risen from the stokehold is she going to roll any more demanded the ladies grouped in what ought to have been the ladies saloon but according to american custom was labelled social hall  passed in the twilight the chief officera dripping bearded face shall i mark out the bullboard said he and lurched aft followed by the tongue of a wave shell roll her guards under tonight said a man from louisiana where their riversteamers do not understand the meaning of bulwarks we dined to a dashing accompaniment of crockery the bounds of emancipated beerbottles livelier than their own corks and the clamour of the ships gong broken loose and calling to meals on its own account  after dinner the real rolling began she did roll guards under as the louisiana man had prophesied at thirtyminute intervals to the second arrived one big sea when the electric lamps died down to nothing and the screw raved and the blows of the sea made the decks quiver on those occasions we moved from our chairs not gently but discourteously at other times we were merely holding on with both hands  it was then that i studied fearterror bound in black silk and fighting hard with herself for reasons which will be thoroughly understood there was a tendency among the passengers to herd together and to address inquiries to every officer who happened to stagger through the saloon no one was in the least alarmedoh dear nobut all were keenly anxious for information this anxiety redoubled after a more than usually vicious roll terror was a large handsome and cultured lady who knew the precise value of human life the inwardness of robert elsmere the latest poetryeverything in fact that a clever woman should know when the rolling was near its worst she began to talk swiftly i do not for a moment believe that she knew what she was talking about the rolling increased she buckled down to the task of making conversation by the heave of the labouring bust the restless working of the fingers on the tablecloth and the uncontrollable eyes that turned always to the companion stairhead i was able to judge the extremity of her fear yet her words were frivolous and commonplace enough they poured forth unceasingly punctuated with little laughs and giggles as a womans speech should be presently a member of her group suggested going to bed no she wanted to sit up she wanted to go on talking and as long as she could get a soul to sit with her she had her desire when for sheer lack of company she was forced to get to her cabin she left reluctantly looking back to the welllighted saloon over her shoulder the contrast between the flowing triviality of her speech and the strained intentness of eye and hand was a quaint thing to behold i know now how fear should be painted  no one slept very heavily that night both arms were needed to grip the berth while the trunks below wound the carpetslips into knots and battered the framing of the cabins once it seemed to me that the whole of the labouring fabric that cased our trumpery fortunes stood on end and in this undignified posture hopped a mighty hop twice i know i shot out of my berth to join the adventurous trunks on the floor a hundred times the crash of the wave on the ships side was followed by the roar of the water as it swept the decks and raved round the deckhouses in a lull i heard the flying feet of a man a shout and a faraway chorus of lost spirits singing somebodys requiem  may 24 queens birthdayif ever you meet an american be good to him this day the ship was dressed with flags from stem to stern and chiefest of the bunting was the unionjack they had given no word of warning to the english who were proportionately pleased at dinner up rose an excommissioner of the lucknow division on my honour angloindia extends to the ends of the earth and gave us the health of her majesty and the president it was afterwards that the trouble began a small american penned half a dozen english into a corner and lectured them soundly ontheir want of patriotism  what sort of queens birthday do you call this he thundered what did you drink our presidents health for whats the president to you on this day of all others well suppose you are in the minority all the more reason for standing by your country dont talk to me you britishers made a mess of ita mighty bungle of the whole thing im an american of the americans but if no one can propose her majestys health better than by just throwing it at your heads im going to try  then and there he delivered a remarkably neat little orationpat well put together and clearly delivered so it came to pass that the queens health was best honoured by an american we english were dazed i wondered how many englishmen not trained to addressing their fellows would have spoken half so fluently as the gentleman from frisco  well you see said one of us feebly shes our queen anyhow andandshes been ours for fifty years and not one of us here has seen england for seven years and we cant enthuse over the matter weve lived to be hauled over the coals for want of patriotism by an american well be more careful next time  and the conversation drifted naturally into the question of the government of menenglish japanese we have several travelled japanese aboard and americans throwing the ball from one to another we bore in mind the golden rule never agree with a man who abuses his own country and got on well enough  japan said a little gentleman who was a rich man there japan is divided into two administrative sides on the one the remains of a very strict and quite oriental despotism on the other a mass ofwhat do you call itredtapeism which is not understood even by the officials who handle it we copy the red tape and when it is copied we believe that we administer that is a vice of all oriental nations we are orientals  oh no say the most westerly of the westerns purred an american soothingly  the little man was pleased thanks that is what we hope to believe but up to the present it is not so look now a farmer in my country holds a hillside cut into little terraces every year he must submit to his government a statement of the size and revenue paid not on the whole hillside but on each terrace the complete statement makes a pile three inches high and is of no use when it is made except to keep in work thousands of officials to check the returns is that administration by god we call it so but we multiply officials by the twenty and they are not administration what country is such a fool look at our government offices eaten up with clerks some day i tell you there will be a smash  this was new to me but i might have guessed it in every country where swords and uniforms accompany civil office there is a natural tendency towards an illconsidered increase of officialdom  you might pay india a visit some day i said i fancy that you would find that our country shares your trouble  thereupon a japanese gentleman in the educational department began to crossquestion me on the matters of his craft in india and in a quarter of an hour got from me the very little that i knew about primary schools higher education and the value of an m a degree he knew exactly what he wanted to ask and only dropped me when the tooth of desire had clean picked the bone of ignorance  then an american held forth harping on a string that has already been too often twanged in my ear what will it be in america itself  the whole system is rotten from top to bottom he said as rotten as rotten can be  thats so said the louisiana man with an affirmative puff of smoke  they call us a republic we may be i dont think it you britishers have got the only republic worth the name you choose to run your ship of state with a gilt figurehead but i know and so does every man who has thought about it that your queen doesnt cost you onehalf what our system of pure democracy costs us politics in america there arent any the whole question of the day is spoils thats all we fight our souls out over tramcontracts gascontracts roadcontracts and any darned thing that will turn a dishonest dollar and we call that politics no one but a lowdown man will run for congress and the senatethe senate of the freest people on earth are bound slaves to some blessed monopoly if i had money enough i could buy the senate of the united states the eagle and the starspangled banner complete  and the irish vote included said some onea britisher i fancy  certainly if i chose to go yahooing down the street at the tail of the british lion anything dirty will buy the irish vote thats why our politics are dirty some day you britishers will grant home rule to the vermin in our blankets then the real americans will invite the irish to get up and git to where they came from wish youd hurry up that time before we have another trouble were bound hand and foot by the irish vote or at least thats the excuse for any unusual theft that we perpetrate i tell you theres no good in an irishman except as a fighter he doesnt understand work he has a natural gift of the gab and he can drink a man blind these three qualifications make him a firstclass politician  with one accord the americans present commenced to abuse ireland and its people as they had met them and each man prefaced his commination service with i am an american by birthan american from way back  it must be an awful thing to live in a country where you have to explain that you really belong there louder grew the clamour and crisper the sentiments  if we werent among americans i should say we were consorting with russians said a fellowcountryman in my ear  they cant mean what they say i whispered listen to this fellow he was saying  and i know for i have been three times round the world and resided in most countries on the continent that there was never people yet could govern themselves  allah this from an american  and who should know better than an american was the retort for the ignorantthat is to say for the majoritythere is only one argumentfear the fear of death in our case we give any scallawag who comes across the water all the same privileges that we have made for ourselves there we make a mistake they thank us by playing the fool then we shoot them down you cant persuade the mob of any country to become decent citizens if they misbehave themselves shoot them i saw the bombs thrown at chicago when our police were blown to bits i saw the banners in the procession that threw the bombs all the mottoes on them were in german the men were aliens in our midst and they were shot down like dogs ive been in labour riots and seen the militia go through a crowd like a finger through tissue paper  i was in the riots at new orleans said the man from louisiana we turned the gatling on the other crowd and they were sick  whew i wonder what would have happened if a gatling had been used when the west end riots were in full swing said an englishman if a single rioter were killed in an english town by the police the chances are that the policeman would have to stand his trial for murder and the ministry of the day would go out  then youve got all your troubles before you the more power you give the people the more trouble they will give with us our better classes are corrupt and our lower classes are lawless there are millions of useful lawabiding citizens and they are very sick of this thing we execute our justice in the streets the law courts are no use take the case of the chicago anarchists it was all we could do to get em hanged whereas the dead in the streets had been punished offhand we were sure of them guess thats the reason we are so quick to fire on a mob but its unfair all the same we receive all these cattleanarchists socialists and ruffians of every sortand then we shoot them the states are as republican as they make em we have no use for a man who wants to try any more experiments on the constitution we are the biggest people on gods earth all the world knows that weve been shouting that we are also the greatest people no one cares to contradict us but ourselves and we are now wondering whether we are what we claim to be never mind you britishers will have the same experiences to go through youre beginning to rot now your county councils will make you more rotten because you are putting power into the hands of untrained people when you reach our levelevery man with a vote and the right to sell it the right to nominate fellows of his own kidney to swamp out better menyoull be what we are nowrotten rotten rotten  the voice ceased and no man rose up to contradict  well worry through it somehow said the man from louisiana what would do us a world of good now would be a big european war were getting slack and sprawly now a war outside our borders would make us all pull together but thats a luxury we shant get  cant you raise one within your own borders i said flippantly to get rid of the thought of the great blind nation in her unrest putting out her hand to the sword mine was a most unfortunate remark  i hope not said an american very seriously we have paid a good deal to keep ourselves together before this and it is not likely that we shall split up without protest yet some say we are too large and some say that washington and the eastern states are running the whole country if ever we do dividegod help us when we doit will be east and west this time  we built the old hooker too long in the run we put the engine room aft break her back said an american who had not yet spoken wonder if our forbears knew how she was going to grow  a very large country the speaker sighed as though the weight of it from new york to frisco lay upon his shoulders if ever we do divide it means that we are done for there is no room for four firstclass empires in the states one split will lead to another if the first is successful whats the use of talking  what was the use heres our conversation as it ran the night of the queens birthday what do you think     no xxiii  how i got to san francisco and took tea with the natives there      serene indifferent to fate     thou sittest at the western gate     thou seest the white seas fold their tents     oh warder of two continents     thou drawest all things small and great     to thee beside the western gate   this is what bret harte has written of the great city of san francisco and for the past fortnight i have been wondering what made him do it there is neither serenity nor indifference to be found in these parts and evil would it be for the continent whose wardship were intrusted to so reckless a guardian behold me pitched neckandcrop from twenty days of the high seas into the whirl of california deprived of any guidance and left to draw my own conclusions protect me from the wrath of an outraged community if these letters be ever read by american eyes san francisco is a mad cityinhabited for the most part by perfectly insane people whose women are of a remarkable beauty when the city of peking steamed through the golden gate i saw with great joy that the blockhouse which guarded the mouth of the finest harbour in the world sir could be silenced by two gunboats from hongkong with safety comfort and despatch  then a reporter leaped aboard and ere i could gasp held me in his toils he pumped me exhaustively while i was getting ashore demanding of all things in the world news about indian journalism it is an awful thing to enter a new land with a new lie on your lips i spoke the truth to the evilminded customhouse man who turned my most sacred raiment on a floor composed of stablerefuse and pinesplinters but the reporter overwhelmed me not so much by his poignant audacity as his beautiful ignorance i am sorry now that i did not tell him more lies as i passed into a city of three hundred thousand white men think of it three hundred thousand white men and women gathered in one spot walking upon real pavements in front of real plateglass windowed shops and talking something that was not very different from english it was only when i had tangled myself up in a hopeless maze of small wooden houses dust streetrefuse and children who play with empty kerosene tins that i discovered the difference of speech  you want to go to the palace hotel said an affable youth on a dray what in hell are you doing here then this is about the lowest place in the city go six blocks north to corner of geary and market then walk around till you strike corner of gutter and sixteenth and that brings you there  i do not vouch for the literal accuracy of these directions quoting but from a disordered memory  amen i said but who am i that i should strike the corners of such as you name peradventure they be gentlemen of repute and might hit back bring it down to dots my son  i thought he would have smitten me but he didnt he explained that no one ever used the word street and that every one was supposed to know how the streets run for sometimes the names were upon the lamps and sometimes they werent fortified with these directions i proceeded till i found a mighty street full of sumptuous buildings four or five stories high but paved with rude cobble stones in the fashion of the year one a cablecar without any visible means of support slid stealthily behind me and nearly struck me in the back a hundred yards further there was a slight commotion in the streeta gathering together of three or fourand something that glittered as it moved very swiftly a ponderous irish gentleman with priests cords in his hat and a small nickelplated badge on his fat bosom emerged from the knot supporting a chinaman who had been stabbed in the eye and was bleeding like a pig the bystanders went their ways and the chinaman assisted by the policeman his own of course this was none of my business but i rather wanted to know what had happened to the gentleman who had dealt the stab it said a great deal for the excellence of the municipal arrangements of the town that a surging crowd did not at once block the street to see what was going forward i was the sixth man and the last who assisted at the performance and my curiosity was six times the greatest indeed i felt ashamed of showing it  there were no more incidents till i reached the palace hotel a sevenstoried warren of humanity with a thousand rooms in it all the travelbooks will tell you about hotel arrangements in this country they should be seen to be appreciated understand clearlyand this letter is written after a thousand miles of experiencesthat money will not buy you service in the west  when the hotel clerkthe man who awards your room to you and who is supposed to give you informationwhen that resplendent individual stoops to attend to your wants he does so whistling or humming or picking his teeth or pauses to converse with some one he knows these performances i gather are to impress upon you that he is a free man and your equal from his general appearance and the size of his diamonds he ought to be your superior there is no necessity for this swaggering selfconsciousness of freedom business is business and the man who is paid to attend to a man might reasonably devote his whole attention to the job  in a vast marblepaved hall under the glare of an electric light sat forty or fifty men and for their use and amusement were provided spittoons of infinite capacity and generous gape most of the men wore frockcoats and tophatsthe things that we in india put on at a wedding breakfast if we possessed thembut they all spat they spat on principle the spittoons were on the staircases in each bedroomyea and in chambers even more sacred than these they chased one into retirement but they blossomed in chiefest splendour round the bar and they were all used every reeking one of em just before i began to feel deathly sick another reporter grappled me what he wanted to know was the precise area of india in square miles i referred him to whittaker he had never heard of whittaker he wanted it from my own mouth and i would not tell him then he swerved off like the other man to details of journalism in our own country i ventured to suggest that the interior economy of a paper most concerned the people who worked it thats the very thing that interests us he said have you got reporters anything like our reporters on indian news papers we have not i said and suppressed the thank god rising to my lips why havent you said he because they would die i said it was exactly like talking to a childa very rude little child he would begin almost every sentence with now tell me something about india and would turn aimlessly from one question to another without the least continuity i was not angry but keenly interested the man was a revelation to me to his questions i returned answers mendacious and evasive after all it really did not matter what i said he could not understand i can only hope and pray that none of the readers of the pioneer will ever see that portentous interview the man made me out to be an idiot several sizes more drivelling than my destiny intended and the rankness of his ignorance managed to distort the few poor facts with which i supplied him into large and elaborate lies then thought i the matter of american journalism shall be looked into later on at present i will enjoy myself  no man rose to tell me what were the lions of the place no one volunteered any sort of conveyance i was absolutely alone in this big city of white folk by instinct i sought refreshment and came upon a barroom full of bad salon pictures in which men with hats on the backs of their heads were wolfing food from a counter it was the institution of the free lunch that i had struck you paid for a drink and got as much as you wanted to eat for something less than a rupee a day a man can feed himself sumptuously in san francisco even though he be bankrupt remember this if ever you are stranded in these parts  later i began a vast but unsystematic exploration of the streets i asked for no names it was enough that the pavements were full of white men and women the streets clanging with traffic and that the restful roar of a great city rang in my ears the cablecars glided to all points of the compass i took them one by one till i could go no farther san francisco has been pitched down on the sandbunkers of the bikaneer desert about onefourth of it is ground reclaimed from the seaany oldtimer will tell you all about that the remainder is ragged unthrifty sandhills pegged down by houses  from an english point of view there has not been the least attempt at grading those hills and indeed you might as well try to grade the hillocks of sind the cablecars have for all practical purposes made san francisco a dead level they take no count of rise or fall but slide equably on their appointed courses from one end to the other of a sixmile street they turn corners almost at right angles cross other lines and for aught i know may run up the sides of houses there is no visible agency of their flight but once in a while you shall pass a fivestoried building humming with machinery that winds up an everlasting wirecable and the initiated will tell you that here is the mechanism i gave up asking questions if it pleases providence to make a car run up and down a slit in the ground for many miles and if for twopencehalfpenny i can ride in that car why shall i seek the reasons of the miracle rather let me look out of the windows till the shops give place to thousands and thousands of little houses made of woodeach house just big enough for a man and his family let me watch the people in the cars and try to find out in what manner they differ from us their ancestors they delude themselves into the belief that they talk englishthe englishand i have already been pitied for speaking with an english accent the man who pitied me spoke so far as i was concerned the language of thieves and they all do where we put the accent forward they throw it back and vice versa where we use the long a they use the short and words so simple as to be past mistaking they pronounce somewhere up in the dome of their heads how do these things happen oliver wendell holmes says that yankee schoolmarms the cider and the salt codfish of the eastern states are responsible for what he calls a nasal accent a hindu is a hindu and a brother to the man who knows his vernacular and a frenchman is french because he speaks his own language but the american has no language he is dialect slang provincialism accent and so forth now that i have heard their voices all the beauty of bret harte is being ruined for me because i find myself catching through the roll of his rhythmical prose the cadence of his peculiar fatherland get an american lady to read to you how santa claus came to simpsons bar and see how much is under her tongue left of the beauty of the original  but i am sorry for bret harte it happened this way a reporter asked me what i thought of the city and i made answer suavely that it was hallowed ground to me because of bret harte that was true well said the reporter bret harte claims california but california dont claim bret harte hes been so long in england that hes quite english have you seen our crackerfactories and the new offices of the examiner he could not understand that to the outside world the city was worth a great deal less than the man                                       night fell over the pacific and the white seafog whipped through the streets dimming the splendours of the electric lights it is the use of this city her men and women to parade between the hours of eight and ten a certain street called kearney street where the finest shops are situated here the click of heels on the pavement is loudest here the lights are brightest and here the thunder of the traffic is most overwhelming i watched young california and saw that it was at least expensively dressed cheerful in manner and selfasserting in conversation also the women are very fair the maidens were of generous build large wellgroomed and attired in raiment that even to my inexperienced eyes must have cost much kearney street at nine oclock levels all distinctions of rank as impartially as the grave again and again i loitered at the heels of a couple of resplendent beings only to overhear when i expected the level voice of culture the staccato sez he sez i that is the mark of the white servantgirl all the world over  this was depressing because in spite of all that goes to the contrary fine feathers ought to make fine birds there was wealthunlimited wealthin the streets but not an accent that would not have been dear at fifty cents wherefore revolving in my mind that these folk were barbarians i was presently enlightened and made aware that they also were the heirs of all the ages and civilised after all there appeared before me an affable stranger of prepossessing appearance with a blue and an innocent eye addressing me by name he claimed to have met me in new york at the windsor and to this claim i gave a qualified assent i did not remember the fact but since he was so certain of it why theni waited developments and what did you think of indiana when you came through was the next question it revealed the mystery of previous acquaintance and one or two other things with reprehensible carelessness my friend of the lightblue eye had looked up the name of his victim in the hotel register and read india for indiana he could not imagine an englishman coming through the states from west to east instead of by the regularly ordained route my fear was that in his delight at finding me so responsive he would make remarks about new york and the windsor which i could not understand and indeed he adventured in this direction once or twice asking me what i thought of such and such streets which from his tone i gathered were anything but respectable it is trying to talk unknown new york in almost unknown san francisco but my friend was merciful he protested that i was one after his own heart and pressed upon me rare and curious drinks at more than one bar these drinks i accepted with gratitude as also the cigars with which his pockets were stored he would show me the life of the city having no desire to watch a weary old play again i evaded the offer and received in lieu of the devils instruction much coarse flattery curiously constituted is the soul of man knowing how and where this man lied waiting idly for the finale i was distinctly conscious as he bubbled compliments in my ear of soft thrills of gratified pride i was wise quoth he anybody could see that with half an eye sagacious versed in the affairs of the world an acquaintance to be desired one who had tasted the cup of life with discretion all this pleased me and in a measure numbed the suspicion that was thoroughly aroused eventually the blueeyed one discovered nay insisted that i had a taste for cards this was clumsily worked in but it was my fault in that i met him halfway and allowed him no chance of good acting hereupon i laid my head to one side and simulated unholy wisdom quoting odds and ends of pokertalk all ludicrously misapplied my friend kept his countenance admirably and well he might for five minutes later we arrived always by the purest of chances at a place where we could play cards and also frivol with louisiana state lottery tickets would i play nay said i for to me cards have neither meaning nor continuity but let us assume that i am going to play how would you and your friends get to work would you play a straight game or make me drunk orwell the fact is im a newspaper man and id be much obliged if youd let me know something about buncosteering my blueeyed friend cursed me by his godsthe right and the left bower he even cursed the very good cigars he had given me but the storm over he quieted down and explained i apologised for causing him to waste an evening and we spent a very pleasant time together inaccuracy provincialism and a too hasty rushing to conclusions were the rocks that he had split on but he got his revenge when he said how would i play with you from all the poppycock anglice bosh you talked about poker id ha played a straight game and skinned you i wouldnt have taken the trouble to make you drunk you never knew anything of the game but the way i was mistaken in you makes me sick he glared at me as though i had done him an injury today i know how it is that year after year week after week the buncosteerer who is the confidencetrick and the cardsharper man of other climes secures his prey he slavers them over with flattery as the snake slavers the rabbit the incident depressed me because it showed i had left the innocent east far behind and was come to a country where a man must look out for himself the very hotel bristled with notices about keeping my door locked and depositing my valuables in a safe the white man in a lump is bad weeping softly for otoyo little i knew then that my heart was to be torn afresh from my bosom i fell asleep in the clanging hotel  next morning i had entered upon the deferred inheritance there are no princes in americaat least with crowns on their headsbut a generousminded member of some royal family received my letter of introduction ere the day closed i was a member of the two clubs and booked for many engagements to dinner and party now this prince upon whose financial operations be continual increase had no reason nor had the others his friends to put himself out for the sake of one briton more or less but he rested not till he had accomplished all in my behalf that a mother could think of for her débutante daughter do you know the bohemian club of san francisco they say its fame extends over the world it was created somewhat on the lines of the savage by men who wrote or drew things and it has blossomed into most unrepublican luxury the ruler of the place is an owlan owl standing upon a skull and crossbones showing forth grimly the wisdom of the man of letters and the end of his hopes for immortality the owl stands on the staircase a statue four feet high is carved in the woodwork flutters on the frescoed ceilings is stamped on the note paper and hangs on the walls he is an ancient and honourable bird under his wing twas my privilege to meet with white men whose lives were not chained down to routine of toil who wrote magazine articles instead of reading them hurriedly in the pauses of officework who painted pictures instead of contenting themselves with cheap etchings picked up at another mans sale of effects mine were all the rights of social intercourse that india stonyhearted stepmother of collectors has swindled us out of treading soft carpets and breathing the incense of superior cigars i wandered from room to room studying the paintings in which the members of the club had caricatured themselves their associates and their aims there was a slick french audacity about the workmanship of these men of toil unbending that went straight to the heart of the beholder and yet it was not altogether french a dry grimness of treatment almost dutch marked the difference the men painted as they spokewith certainty the club indulges in revelries which it calls jinkshigh and lowat intervalsand each of these gatherings is faithfully portrayed in oils by hands that know their business in this club were no amateurs spoiling canvas because they fancied they could handle oils without knowledge of shadows or anatomyno gentleman of leisure ruining the temper of publishers and an already ruined market with attempts to write because everybody writes something these days my hosts were working or had worked for their daily bread with pen or paint and their talk for the most part was of the shop shoppythat is to say delightful they extended a large hand of welcome and were as brethren and i did homage to the owl and listened to their talk an indian club about christmastime will yield if properly worked an abundant harvest of queer tales but at a gathering of americans from the uttermost ends of their own continent the tales are larger thicker more spinous and even more azure than any indian variety tales of the war i heard told by an exofficer of the south over his evening drink to a colonel of the northern army my introducer who had served as a trooper in the northern horse throwing in emendations from time to time  other voices followed with equally wondrous tales of riatathrowing in mexico or arizona of gambling at army posts in texas of newspaper wars waged in godless chicago of deaths sudden and violent in montana and dakota of the loves of halfbreed maidens in the south and fantastic huntings for gold in mysterious alaska above all they told the story of the building of old san francisco when the finest collection of humanity on gods earth sir started this town and the water came up to the foot of market street very terrible were some of the tales grimly humorous the others and the men in broadcloth and fine linen who told them had played their parts in them  and now and again when things got too bad they would toll the city bell and the vigilance committee turned out and hanged the suspicious characters a man didnt begin to be suspected in those days till he had committed at least one unprovoked murder said a calmeyed portly old gentleman i looked at the pictures around me the noiseless neatuniformed waiter behind me the oakribbed ceiling above the velvety carpet beneath it was hard to realise that even twenty years ago you could see a man hanged with great pomp later on i found reason to change my opinion the tales gave me a headache and set me thinking how in the world was it possible to take in even onethousandth of this huge roaring manysided continent in the silence of the sumptuous library lay professor bryces book on the american republic it is an omen said i he has done all things in all seriousness and he may be purchased for half a guinea those who desire information of the most undoubted must refer to his pages for me is the daily round of vagabondage the recording of the incidents of the hour and talk with the travelling companion of the day i will not do this country at all  and i forgot all about india for ten days while i went out to dinners and watched the social customs of the people which are entirely different from our customs and was introduced to the men of many millions these persons are harmless in their earlier stages that is to say a man worth three or four million dollars may be a good talker clever amusing and of the world a man with twice that amount is to be avoided and a twentymillion man isjust twenty millions take an instance i was speaking to a newspaper man about seeing the proprietor of his journal my friend snorted indignantly see him great scott no if he happens to appear in the office i have to associate with him but thank heaven outside of that i move in circles where he cannot come  and yet the first thing i have been taught to believe is that money was everything in america     no xxiv  shows how through folly i assisted at a murder and was afraid the rule of the democracy and the despotism of the alien      poor mengod made and all for that   it was a bad business throughout and the only consolation is that it was all my fault a man took me round the chinese quarter of san francisco which is a ward of the city of canton set down in the most eligible businessquarter of the place the chinaman with his usual skill has possessed himself of good brick fireproof buildings and following instinct has packed each tenement with hundreds of souls all living in filth and squalor not to be appreciated save by you in india that cursory investigation ought to have sufficed but i wanted to know how deep in the earth the pigtail had taken root therefore i explored the chinese quarter a second time and alone which was foolishness no one in the filthy streets but for the blessed sea breezes san francisco would enjoy cholera every season interfered with my movements though many asked for cumshaw i struck a house about four stories high full of celestial abominations and began to burrow down having heard that these tenements were constructed on the lines of icebergstwothirds below sight level downstairs i crawled past chinamen in bunks opiumsmokers brothels and gambling hells till i had reached the second cellarwas in fact in the labyrinths of a warren great is the wisdom of the chinaman in time of trouble that house could be razed to the ground by the mob and yet hide all its inhabitants in brickwalled and woodenbeamed subterranean galleries strengthened with ironframed doors and gates on the second underground floor a man asked for cumshaw and took me downstairs to yet another cellar where the air was as thick as butter and the lamps burned little holes in it not more than an inch square in this place a poker club had assembled and was in full swing the chinaman loves pokel and plays it with great skill swearing like a cat when he loses most of the men round the table were in semieuropean dress their pigtails curled up under billycock hats one of the company looked like a eurasian whence i argued that he was a mexicana supposition that later inquiries confirmed they were a picturesque set of fiends and polite being too absorbed in their game to look at the stranger we were all deep down under the earth and save for the rustle of a blue gown sleeve and the ghostly whisper of the cards as they were shuffled and played there was no sound the heat was almost unendurable there was some dispute between the mexican and the man on his left the latter shifted his place to put the table between himself and his opponent and stretched a lean yellow hand towards the mexicans winnings  mark how purely man is a creature of instinct rarely introduced to the pistol i saw the mexican half rise in his chair and at the same instant found myself full length on the floor none had told me that this was the best attitude when bullets are abroad i was there prone before i had time to thinkdropping as the room was filled with an intolerable clamour like the discharge of a cannon in those close quarters the pistol report had no room to spread any more than the smokethen acrid in my nostrils there was no second shot but a great silence in which i rose slowly to my knees the chinaman was gripping the table with both hands and staring in front of him at an empty chair the mexican had gone and a little whirl of smoke was floating near the roof still gripping the table the chinaman said ah in the tone that a man would use when looking up from his work suddenly he sees a wellknown friend in the doorway then he coughed and fell over to his own right and i saw that he had been shot in the stomach  i became aware that save for two men leaning over the stricken one the room was empty and all the tides of intense fear hitherto held back by intenser curiosity swept over my soul i ardently desired the outside air it was possible that the chinamen would mistake me for the mexicaneverything horrible seemed possible just thenand it was more than possible that the stairways would be closed while they were hunting for the murderer the man on the floor coughed a sickening cough i heard it as i fled and one of his companions turned out the lamp those stairs seemed interminable and to add to my dismay there was no sound of commotion in the house no one hindered no one even looked at me there was no trace of the mexican i found the doorway and my legs trembling under me reached the protection of the clear cool night the fog and the rain i dared not run and for the life of me i could not walk i must have effected a compromise for i remember the light of a street lamp showed the shadow of one half skippingcaracoling along the pavements in what seemed to be an ecstacy of suppressed happiness but it was feardeadly fear fear compounded of past knowledge of the orientalonly other white manavailable witnessthree stories undergroundand the cough of the chinaman now some forty feet under my clattering bootheels it was good to see the shopfronts and electric lights again not for anything would i have informed the police because i firmly believed that the mexican had been dealt with somewhere down there on the third floor long ere i had reached the air and moreover once clear of the place i could not for the life of me tell where it was my illconsidered flight brought me out somewhere a mile distant from the hotel and the clank of the lift that bore me to a bed six stories above ground was music in my ears wherefore i would impress it upon you who follow after do not knock about the chinese quarters at night and alone you may stumble across a picturesque piece of human nature that will unsteady your nerves for half a day                                       and this brings me by natural sequence to the great drink question as you know of course the american does not drink at meals as a sensible man should indeed he has no meals he stuffs for ten minutes thrice a day also he has no decent notions about the sun being over the yardarm or below the horizon he pours his vanity into himself at unholy hours and indeed he can hardly help it you have no notion of what treating means on the western slope it is more than an institution it is a religion though men tell me that it is nothing to what it was take a very common instance at 1030 am a man is smitten with desire for stimulants he is in the company of two friends all three adjourn to the nearest barseldom more than twenty yards awayand take three straight whiskys they talk for two minutes the second and third man then treats in order and thus each walks into the street two of them the poorer by three goes of whisky under their belt and one with two more liquors than he wanted it is not etiquette yet to refuse a treat the result is peculiar i have never yet i confess seen a drunken man in the streets but i have heard more about drunkenness among white men and seen more decent men above or below themselves with drink than i care to think about and the vice runs up into all sorts of circles and societies never was i more astonished than at one pleasant dinner party to hear a pair of pretty lips say casually of a gentleman friend then under discussion he was drunk the fact was merely stated without emotion that was what startled me but the climate of california deals kindly with excess and treacherously covers up its traces a man neither bloats nor shrivels in this dry air he continues with the false bloom of health upon his cheeks an equable eye a firm mouth and a steady hand till a day of reckoning arrives and suddenly breaking up about the head he dies and his friends speak his epitaph accordingly why people who in most cases cannot hold their liquor should play with it so recklessly i leave to others to decide this unhappy state of affairs has however produced one good result which i will confide to you in the heart of the business quarter where banks and bankers are thickest and telegraph wires most numerous stands a semisubterranean bar tended by a german with long blond locks and a crystalline eye go thither softly treading on the tips of your toes and ask him for a button punch twill take ten minutes to brew but the result is the highest and noblest product of the age no man but one knows what is in it i have a theory it is compounded of the shavings of cherubs wings the glory of a tropical dawn the red clouds of sunset and fragments of lost epics by dead masters but try you for yourselves and pause a while to bless me who am always mindful of the truest interests of my brethren  but enough of the stale spilth of barrooms turn now to the august spectacle of a government of the people by the people for the people as it is understood in the city of san francisco professor bryces book will tell you that every american citizen over twentyone years of age possesses a vote he may not know how to run his own business control his wife or instil reverence into his children may be pauper halfcrazed with drink bankrupt dissolute or merely a born fool but he has a vote if he likes he can be voting most of his timevoting for his state governor his municipal officers local option sewage contracts or anything else of which he has no special knowledge  once every four years he votes for a new president in his spare moments he votes for his own judgesthe men who shall give him justice these are dependent on popular favour for reelection inasmuch as they are but chosen for a term of yearstwo or three i believe such a position is manifestly best calculated to create an independent and unprejudiced administrator now this mass of persons who vote is divided into two partiesrepublican and democrat they are both agreed in thinking that the other part is running creation which is america into red flame also the democrat as a party drinks more than the republican and when drunk may be heard to talk about a thing called the tariff which he does not understand but which he conceives to be the bulwark of the country or else the surest power for its destruction sometimes he says one thing and sometimes another in order to contradict the republican who is always contradicting himself and this is a true and lucid account of the forepart of american politics the behindpart is otherwise  since every man has a vote and may vote on every conceivable thing it follows that there exist certain wise men who understand the art of buying up votes retail and vending them wholesale to whoever wants them most urgently now an american engaged in making a home for himself has not time to vote for turncocks and district attorneys and cattle of that kind but the unemployed have much time because they are always on hand somewhere in the streets they are called the boys and form a peculiar class the boys are young men inexpert in war unskilled in labour who have neither killed a man lifted cattle or dug a well in plain english they are just the men in the streets who can always be trusted to rally round any cause that has a glass of liquor for a visible heart they waitthey are on hand and in being on hand lies the crown and the glory of american politics the wise man is he who keeping a liquorsaloon and judiciously dispensing drinks knows how to retain within arms reach a block of men who will vote for or against anything under the canopy of heaven not every saloonkeeper can do this it demands careful study of city politics tact the power of conciliation and infinite resources of anecdote to amuse and keep the crowd together night after night till the saloon becomes a salon above all the liquor side of the scheme must not be worked for immediate profit the boys who drink so freely will ultimately pay their host a thousandfold an irishman and an irishman preeminently knows how to work such a saloon parliament observe for a moment the plan of operations the rank and file are treated to drink and a little moneyand they vote he who controls ten votes receives a proportionate reward the dispenser of a thousand votes is worthy of reverence and so the chain runs on till we reach the most successful worker of public saloonsthe man most skilful in keeping his items together and using them when required such a man governs the city as absolutely as a king and you would know where the gain comes in the whole of the public offices of a city with the exception of a very few where special technical skill is required are shortterm offices distributed according to political leanings what would you have a big city requires many officials each office carries a salary and influence worth twice the pay the offices are for the representatives of the men who keep together and are on hand to vote the commissioner of sewage let us say is a gentleman who has been elected to his office by a republican vote he knows little and cares less about sewage but he has sense enough to man the pumpingworks and the streetsweepingmachines with the gentlemen who elected him the commissioner of police has been helped to his post very largely by the influence of the boys at such and such a saloon he may be the guardian of city morals but he is not going to allow his subordinates to enforce early closing or abstention from gambling in that saloon most offices are limited to four years consequently he is a fool who does not make his office pay him while he is in it  the only people who suffer by this happy arrangement are in fact the people who devised the lovely system and they suffer because they are americans let us explain as you know every big city here holds at least one big foreign votegenerally irish frequently german in san francisco the gathering place of the races there is a distinct italian vote to be considered but the irish vote is more important for this reason the irishman does not kill himself with overwork he is made for the cheery dispensing of liquors for everlasting blarney and possesses a wonderfully keen appreciation of the weaknesses of lesser human nature also he has no sort of conscience and only one strong convictionthat of deeprooted hatred toward england he keeps to the streets he is on hand he votes joyously spending days lavishlyand time is the americans dearest commodity behold the glorious result today the city of san francisco is governed by the irish vote and the irish influence under the rule of a gentleman whose sight is impaired and who requires a man to lead him about the streets he is called officially boss buckley and unofficially the blind white devil i have before me now the record of his amiable career in black and white it occupies four columns of small print and perhaps you would think it disgraceful summarised it is as follows boss buckley by tact and deep knowledge of the seamy side of the city won himself a following of voters he sought no office himself or rarely but as his following increased he sold their services to the highest bidder himself taking toll of the revenues of every office he controlled the democratic party in the city of san francisco the people appoint their own judges boss buckleys people appointed judges these judges naturally were boss buckleys property i have been to dinner parties and heard educated men not concerned with politics telling stories one to another of justice both civil and criminal being bought with a price from the hands of these judges such tales they told without heat as men recording facts contracts for roadmending public buildings and the like are under the control of boss buckley because the men whom buckleys following sent to the city council adjudicate on these contracts and on each and every one of these contracts boss buckley levies his percentage for himself and his allies  the republican party in san francisco also have their boss he is not so great a genius as boss buckley but i decline to believe that he is any whit more virtuous he has a smaller number of votes at his command       from sea to sea   letters of travel     by rudyard kipling     new york   doubleday page  company    1913     copyright 1899 1907

sea     no xxv  tells how i dropped into politics and the tenderer sentiments contains a moral treatise on american maidens and an ethnological one on the negro ends with a banquet and a typewriter   i have been watching machinery in repose after reading about machinery in action an excellent gentleman who bears a name honoured in the magazines writes much as disraeli orated of the sublime instincts of an ancient people the certainty with which they can be trusted to manage their own affairs in their own way and the speed with which they are making for all sorts of desirable goals this he called a statement or purview of american politics i went almost directly afterwards to a saloon where gentlemen interested in ward politics nightly congregate they were not pretty persons some of them were bloated and they all swore cheerfully till the heavy gold watchchains on their fat stomachs rose and fell again but they talked over their liquor as men who had power and unquestioned access to places of trust and profit the magazinewriter discussed theories of government these men the practice they had been there they knew all about it they banged their fists on the table and spoke of political pulls the vending of votes and so forth theirs was not the talk of village babblers reconstructing the affairs of the nation but of strong coarse lustful men fighting for spoil and thoroughly understanding the best methods of reaching it i listened long and intently to speech i could not understand or only in spots it was the speech of business however i had sense enough to know that and to do my laughing outside the door then i began to understand why my pleasant and welleducated hosts in san francisco spoke with a bitter scorn of such duties of citizenship as voting and taking an interest in the distribution of offices scores of men have told me with no false pride that they would as soon concern themselves with the public affairs of the city or state as rake muck read about politics as the cultured writer of the magazines regards em and then and not till then pay your respects to the gentlemen who run the grimy reality  im sick of interviewing nighteditors who in response to my demand for the record of a prominent citizen answer well you see he began by keeping a saloon etc i prefer to believe that my informants are treating me as in the old sinful days in india i was used to treat our wandering globetrotters they declare that they speak the truth and the news of dogpolitics lately vouchsafed to me in groggeries incline me to believebut i wont the people are much too nice to slangander as recklessly as i have been doing besides i am hopelessly in love with about eight american maidensall perfectly delightful till the next one comes into the room otoyo was a darling but she lacked several things conversation for one you cannot live on giggles she shall remain unmoved at nagasaki while i roast a battered heart before the shrine of a big kentucky blonde who had for a nurse when she was little a negro mammy by consequence she has welded on to californian beauty paris dresses eastern culture europe trips and wild western originality the queer dreamy superstitions of the negro quarters and the result is soulshattering and she is but one of many stars item a maiden who believes in education and possesses it with a few hundred thousand dollars to boot and a taste for slumming item the leader of a sort of informal salon where girls congregate read papers and daringly discuss metaphysical problems and candya sloeeyed blackbrowed imperious maiden item a very small maiden absolutely without reverence who can in one swift sentence trample upon and leave gasping half a dozen young men item a millionnairess burdened with her money lonely caustic with a tongue keen as a sword yearning for a sphere but chained up to the rock of her vast possessions item a typewritermaiden earning her own bread in this big city because she doesnt think a girl ought to be a burden on her parents she quotes théophile gautier and moves through the world manfully much respected for all her twenty inexperienced summers item a woman from cloudland who has no history in the past but is discreetly of the present and strives for the confidences of male humanity on the grounds of sympathy this is not altogether a new type item a girl in a dive blessed with a greek head and eyes that seem to speak all that is best and sweetest in the world but woe is meshe has no ideas in this world or the next beyond the consumption of beer a commission on each bottle and protests that she sings the songs allotted to her nightly with no more than the vaguest notion of their meaning  sweet and comely are the maidens of devonshire delicate and of gracious seeming those who live in the pleasant places of london fascinating for all their demureness the damsels of france clinging closely to their mothers and with large eyes wondering at the wicked world excellent in her own place and to those who understand her is the angloindian spin in her second season but the girls of america are above and beyond them all they are clever they can talk yea it is said that they think certainly they have an appearance of so doing they are original and look you between the brows with unabashed eyes as a sister might look at her brother they are instructed in the folly and vanity of the male mind for they have associated with the boys from babyhood and can discerningly minister to both vices or pleasantly snub the possessor they possess moreover a life among themselves independent of masculine associations they have societies and clubs and unlimited teafights where all the guests are girls they are selfpossessed without parting with any tenderness that is their sexright they understand they can take care of themselves they are superbly independent when you ask them what makes them so charming they say it is because we are better educated than your girls andand we are more sensible in regard to men we have good times all round but we arent taught to regard every man as a possible husband nor is he expected to marry the first girl he calls on regularly yes they have good times their freedom is large and they do not abuse it they can go driving with young men and receive visits from young men to an extent that would make an english mother wink with horror and neither driver nor drivee have a thought beyond the enjoyment of a good time as certain also of their own poets have said      man is fire and woman is tow     and the devil he comes and begins to blow  in america the tow is soaked in a solution that makes it fireproof in absolute liberty and large knowledge consequently accidents do not exceed the regular percentage arranged by the devil for each class and climate under the skies but the freedom of the young girl has its drawbacks she isi say it with all reluctanceirreverent from her fortydollar bonnet to the buckles in her eighteendollar shoes she talks flippantly to her parents and men old enough to be her grandfather she has a prescriptive right to the society of the man who arrives the parents admit it this is sometimes embarrassing especially when you call on a man and his wife for the sake of information the one being a merchant of varied knowledge the other a woman of the world in five minutes your host has vanished in another five his wife has followed him and you are left with a very charming maiden doubtless but certainly not the person you came to see she chatters and you grin but you leave with the very strong impression of a wasted morning this has been my experience once or twice i have even said as pointedly as i dared to a man i came to see you youd better see me in my office then the house belongs to my womenfolkto my daughter that is to say he spoke with truth the american of wealth is owned by his family they exploit him for bullion and sometimes it seems to me that his lot is a lonely one the women get the hapence the kicks are all his own nothing is too good for an americans daughter i speak here of the moneyed classes the girls take every gift as a matter of course yet they develop greatly when a catastrophe arrives and the man of many millions goes up or goes down and his daughters take to stenography or typewriting i have heard many tales of heroism from the lips of girls who counted the principals among their friends the crash came mamie or hattie or sadie gave up their maid their carriages and candy and with a no 2 remington and a stout heart set about earning their daily bread  and did i drop her from the list of my friends no sir said a scarletlipped vision in white lace that might happen to me any day  it may be this sense of possible disaster in the air that makes san franciscan society go with so captivating a rush and whirl recklessness is in the air i cant explain where it comes from but there it is the roaring winds off the pacific make you drunk to begin with the aggressive luxury on all sides helps out the intoxication and you spin for ever down the ringing groves of change there is no small change by the way west of the rockies as long as money lasts they make greatly and they spend lavishly not only the rich but the artisans who pay nearly five pounds for a suit of clothes and for other luxuries in proportion the young men rejoice in the days of their youth they gamble yacht race enjoy prizefights and cockfightsthe one openly the other in secretthey establish luxurious clubs they break themselves over horseflesh andother things and they are instant in quarrel at twenty they are experienced in business embark in vast enterprises take partners as experienced as themselves and go to pieces with as much splendour as their neighbours remember that the men who stocked california in the fifties were physically and as far as regards certain tough virtues the pick of the earth the inept and the weakly died en route or went under in the days of construction to this nucleus were added all the races of the continentfrench italian german and of course the jew the result you shall see in largeboned deepchested delicatehanded women and long elastic wellbuilt boys it needs no little golden badge swinging from his watchchain to mark the native son of the golden westthe countrybred of california him i love because he is devoid of fear carries himself like a man and has a heart as big as his boots i fancy too he knows how to enjoy the blessings of life that his world so abundantly bestows upon him at least i heard a little rat of a creature with hockbottle shoulders explaining that a man from chicago could pull the eyeteeth of a californian in business well if i lived in fairyland where cherries were as big as plums plums as big as apples and strawberries of no account where the procession of the fruits of the seasons was like a pageant in a drury lane pantomime and where the dry air was wine i should let business slide once in a way and kick up my heels with my fellows the tale of the resources of californiavegetable and mineralis a fairy tale you can read it in books you would never believe me all manner of nourishing food from seafish to beef may be bought at the lowest prices and the people are well developed and of a high stomach they demand ten shillings for tinkering a jammed lock of a trunk they receive sixteen shillings a day for working as carpenters they spend many sixpences on very bad cigars and they go mad over a prizefight when they disagree they do so fatally with firearms in their hands and on the public streets i was just clear of mission street when the trouble began between two gentlemen one of whom perforated the other when a policeman whose name i do not recollect fatally shot ed kearney for attempting to escape arrest i was in the next street for these things i am thankful it is enough to travel with a policeman in a tramcar and while he arranges his coattails as he sits down to catch sight of a loaded revolver it is enough to know that fifty per cent of the men in the public saloons carry pistols about them the chinaman waylays his adversary and methodically chops him to pieces with his hatchet then the press roar about the brutal ferocity of the pagan the italian reconstructs his friend with a long knife the press complains of the waywardness of the alien the irishman and the native californian in their hours of discontent use the revolver not once but six times the press records the fact and asks in the next column whether the world can parallel the progress of san francisco the american who loves this country will tell you that this sort of thing is confined to the lower classes just at present an exjudge who was sent to jail by another judge upon my word i cannot tell whether these titles mean anything is breathing redhot vengeance against his enemy the papers have interviewed both parties and confidently expect a fatal issue  now let me draw breath and curse the negro waiter and through him the negro in service generally he has been made a citizen with a vote consequently both political parties play with him but that is neither here nor there he will commit in one meal every bétise that a scullion fresh from the ploughtail is capable of and he will continue to repeat those faults he is as complete a heavyfooted uncomprehending bunglefisted fool as any memsahib in the east ever took into her establishment but he is according to law a free and independent citizenconsequently above reproof or criticism he and he alone in this insane city will wait at table the chinaman doesnt count he is untrained inept but he will fill the place and draw the pay now god and his fathers kismet made him intellectually inferior to the oriental he insists on pretending that he serves tables by accidentas a sort of amusement he wishes you to understand this little fact you wish to eat your meals and if possible to have them properly served he is a big black vain baby and a man rolled into one a coloured gentleman who insisted on getting me pie when i wanted something else demanded information about india i gave him some facts about wages oh hell said he cheerfully that wouldnt keep me in cigars for a month then he fawned on me for a tencent piece later he took it upon himself to pity the natives of indiaheathen he called them this woolly one whose race has been the butt of every comedy on the asiatic stage since the beginning and i turned and saw by the head upon his shoulders that he was a yoruba man if there be any truth in ethnological castes he did his thinking in english but he was a yoruba negro and the race type had remained the same throughout his generations and the room was full of other racessome that looked exactly like gallas but the trade was never recruited from that side of africa some duplicates of cameroon heads and some kroomen if ever kroomen wore evening dress the american does not consider little matters of descent though by this time he ought to know all about damnable heredity as a general rule he keeps himself very far from the negro and says unpretty things about him there are six million negroes more or less in the states and they are increasing the americans once having made them citizens cannot unmake them he says in his newspapers they ought to be elevated by education he is trying this but it is like to be a long job because black blood is much more adhesive than white and throws back with annoying persistence when the negro gets a religion he returns directly as a hiving bee to the first instincts of his people just now a wave of religion is sweeping over some of the southern states up to the present two messiahs and one daniel have appeared and several human sacrifices have been offered up to these incarnations the daniel managed to get three young men who he insisted were shadrach meshach and abednego to walk into a blast furnace guaranteeing noncombustion they did not return i have seen nothing of this kind but i have attended a negro church the congregation were moved by the spirit to groans and tears and one of them danced up the aisle to the mourners bench the motive may have been genuine the movements of the shaken body were those of a zanzibar stickdance such as you see at aden on the coal boats and even as i watched the people the links that bound them to the white man snapped one by one and i saw before methe hubshi the woolly one praying to the god he did not understand those neatly dressed folk on the benches the greyheaded elder by the window were savagesneither more nor less what will the american do with the negro the south will not consort with him in some states miscegenation is a penal offence the north is every year less and less in need of his services and he will not disappear he will continue as a problem his friends will urge that he is as good as the white man his enemies  it is not good to be a negro in the land of the free and the home of the brave  but this has nothing to do with san francisco and her merry maidens her strong swaggering men and her wealth of gold and pride they bore me to a banquet in honour of a brave lieutenantcarlin of the vandaliawho stuck by his ship in the great cyclone at apia and comported himself as an officer should on that occasiontwas at the bohemian clubi heard oratory with the roundest of os and devoured a dinner the memory of which will descend with me into the hungry grave there were about forty speeches delivered and not one of them was average or ordinary it was my first introduction to the american eagle screaming for all it was worth the lieutenants heroism served as a peg from which those silvertongued ones turned themselves loose and kicked they ransacked the clouds of sunset the thunderbolts of heaven the deeps of hell and the splendours of the resurrection for tropes and metaphors and hurled the result at the head of the guest of the evening never since the morning stars sang together for joy i learned had an amazed creation witnessed such superhuman bravery as that displayed by the american navy in the samoa cyclone till earth rotted in the phosphorescent starandstripe slime of a decayed universe that godlike gallantry would not be forgotten i grieve that i cannot give the exact words my attempt at reproducing their spirit is pale and inadequate i sat bewildered on a coruscating niagara ofblatherumskite it was magnificentit was stupendous and i was conscious of a wicked desire to hide my face in a napkin and grin then according to rule they produced their dead and across the snowy tablecloths dragged the corpse of every man slain in the civil war and hurled defiance at our natural enemy england so please you with her chain of fortresses across the world thereafter they glorified their nation afresh from the beginning in case any detail should have been overlooked and that made me uncomfortable for their sakes how in the world can a white man a sahib of our blood stand up and plaster praise on his own country he can think as highly as he likes but his openmouthed vehemence of adoration struck me almost as indelicate my hosts talked for rather more than three hours and at the end seemed ready for three hours more but when the lieutenantsuch a big brave gentle giantrose to his feet he delivered what seemed to me as the speech of the evening i remember nearly the whole of it and it ran something in this way gentlemenits very good of you to give me this dinner and to tell me all these pretty things but what i want you to understandthe fact iswhat we want and what we ought to get at once is a navymore shipslots of em then we howled the top of the roof off and i for one fell in love with carlin on the spot wallah he was a man  the prince among merchants bade me take no heed to the warlike sentiments of some of the old generals the skyrockets are thrown in for effect quoth he and whenever we get on our hind legs we always express a desire to chaw up england its a sort of family affair  and indeed when you come to think of it there is no other country for the american public speaker to trample upon  france has germany we have russia for italy austria is provided and the humblest pathan possesses an ancestral enemy only america stands out of the racket and therefore to be in fashion makes a sandbag of the mothercountry and bangs her when occasion requires the chain of fortresses man a fascinating talker explained to me after the affair that he was compelled to blow off steam everybody expected it when we had chanted the starspangled banner not more than eight times we adjourned america is a very great country but it is not yet heaven with electric lights and plush fittings as the speakers professed to believe my listening mind went back to the politicians in the saloon who wasted no time in talking about freedom but quietly made arrangements to impose their will on the citizens the judge is a great man but give thy presents to the clerk as the proverb saith  and what more remains to tell i cannot write connectedly because i am in love with all those girls aforesaid and some others who do not appear in the invoice the typewriter girl is an institution of which the comic papers make much capital but she is vastly convenient she and a companion rent a room in a business quarter and copy manuscript at the rate of six annas a page only a woman can manage a typewriting machine because she has served apprenticeship to the sewingmachine she can earn as much as a hundred dollars a month and professes to regard this form of breadwinning as her natural destiny but oh how she hates it in her heart of hearts when i had got over the surprise of doing business and trying to give orders to a young woman of coldly clerkly aspect intrenched behind goldrimmed spectacles i made inquiries concerning the pleasures of this independence they liked itindeed they did twas the natural fate of almost all girlsthe recognised custom in americaand i was a barbarian not to see it in that light  well and after said i what happens  we work for our bread  and then what do you expect  then we shall work for our bread  till you die  yeesunless  unless what a man works till he dies  so shall we this without enthusiasmi suppose  said the partner in the firm audaciously sometimes we marry our employersat least thats what the newspapers say the hand banged on half a dozen of the keys of the machine at once yes i dont care i hate iti hate iti hate it and you neednt look so  the senior partner was regarding the rebel with graveeyed reproach  i thought you did said i i dont suppose american girls are much different from english ones in instinct  isnt it théophile gautier who says that the only differences between country and country lie in the slang and the uniform of the police  now in the name of all the gods at once what is one to say to a young lady who in england would be a person who earns her own bread and very naturally hates the employ and slings outoftheway quotations at your head that one falls in love with her goes without saying but that is not enough  a mission should be established     no xxvi  takes me through bret hartes country and to portland with old man california explains how two vagabonds became homesick through looking at other peoples houses      i walked in the lonesome even     and who so sad as i     as i saw the young men and maidens     merrily passing by   san francisco has only one drawback tis hard to leave when like the pious hans breitmann i cut that city by the sea it was with regrets for the pleasant places left behind for the men who were so clever and the women who were so witty for the dives the beerhalls the bucketshops and the pokerhells where humanity was going to the devil with shouting and laughter and song and the rattle of diceboxes i would fain have stayed but i feared that an evil end would come to me when my money was all spent and i descended to the street corner a voice inside me said get out of this go north strike for victoria and vancouver bask for a day under the shadow of the old flag so i set forth from san francisco to portland in oregon and that was a railroad run of thirtysix hours  the oakland railway terminus whence all the main lines start does not own anything approaching to a platform a yard with a dozen or more tracks is roughly asphalted and the traveller laden with handbags skips merrily across the metals in search of his own particular train the bells of half a dozen shunting engines are tolling suggestively in his ears if he is run down so much the worse for him when the bell rings look out for the locomotive long use has made the nation familiar and even contemptuous towards trains to an extent which god never intended women who in england would gather up their skirts and scud timorously over a level crossing in the country here talk dress and babies under the very nose of the cowcatcher and little children dally with the moving car in a manner horrible to behold we pulled out at the wholly insignificant speed of twentyfive miles an hour through the streets of a suburb of fifty thousand and in our progress among the carts and the children and the shop fronts slew nobody at which i was not a little disappointed  when the negro porter bedded me up for the night and i had solved the problem of undressing while lying downi was much cheered by the thought that if anything happened i should have to stay where i was and wait till the kerosene lamps set the overturned car alight and burned me to death it is easier to get out of a full theatre than to leave a pullman in haste  by the time i had discovered that a profusion of nickelplating plush and damask does not compensate for closeness and dust the train ran into the daylight on the banks of the sacramento river a few windows were gingerly opened after the bunks had been reconverted into seats but that long coffincar was by no means ventilated and we were a gummy grimy crew who sat there at six in the morning the heat was distinctly unpleasant but seeing with the eye of the flesh that i was in bret hartes own country i rejoiced there were the pines and madroneclad hills his miners lived and fought among there was the heated red earth that showed whence the gold had been washed the dry gulch the red dusty road where hamblin was used to stop the stage in the intervals of his elegant leisure and superior cardplay there was the timber felled and sweating resin in the sunshine and above all there was the quivering pungent heat that bret harte drives into your dull brain with the magic of his pen when we stopped at a collection of packingcases dignified by the name of a town my felicity was complete the name of the place was something offensiveamberville or jacksonburghbut it owned a castiron fountain worthy of a town of thirty thousand next to the fountain was a hotel at least seventeen feet high including the chimney and next to the hotel was the forestthe pine the oak and the untrammelled undergrowth of the hillside a cinnamonbear cubbaby sylvester in the very furwas tied to the stump of a tree opposite the fountain a packmule dozed in the dusthaze a redshirted miner in a slouch hat supported the hotel a blueshirted miner swung round the corner and the two went indoors for a drink a girl came out of the only other house but one and shading her eyes with a brown hand stared at the panting train she didnt recognise me but i knew herhad known her for years she was mliss she never married the schoolmaster after all but stayed always young and always fair among the pines i knew redshirt too he was one of the bearded men who stood back when tennessee claimed his partner from the hands of the law the sacramento river a few yards away shouted that all these things were true the train went on while baby sylvester stood on his downy head and mliss swung her sunbonnet by the strings  what do you think said a lawyer who was travelling with me its a new world to you isnt it  no its quite familiar i was never out of england its as if i saw it all  quick as light came the answer yes they lived once thus at venice when the miners were the kings  i loved that lawyer on the spot we drank to bret harte who you remember claimed california but california never claimed him hes turned english  lying back in state i waited for the flying miles to turn over the pages of the book i knew they brought me all i desiredfrom the man of no account sitting on a stump and playing with a dog to that most sarcastic man the quiet mister brown he boarded the train from out of the woods and there was venom and sulphur on his tongue he had just lost a lawsuit only yuba bill failed to appear the train had taken his employment from him a nameless ruffian backed me into a corner and began telling me about the resources of the country and what it would eventually become all i remember of his lecture was that you could catch trout in the sacramento riverthe stream that we followed so faithfully  then rose a tough and wiry old man with grizzled hair and made inquiries about the trout to him was added the secretary of a lifeinsurance company i fancy he was travelling to rake in the dead that the train killed but he too was a fisherman and the two turned to meward the frankness of a westerner is delightful they tell me that in the eastern states i shall meet another type of man and a more reserved the californian always speaks of the man from the new england states as a different breed it is our punjab and madras over again but more so the old man was on a holiday in search of fish when he discovered a brotherloafer he proposed a confederation of rods quoth the insuranceagent im not staying any time in portland but i will introduce you to a man there wholl tell you about fishing the two told strange tales as we slid through the forests and saw afar off the snowy head of a great mountain there were vineyards fruit orchards and wheat fields where the land opened out and every ten miles or so twenty or thirty wooden houses and at least three churches a large town would have a population of two thousand and an infinite belief in its own capacities sometimes a flaring advertisement flanked the line calling for men to settle down take up the ground and make their home there at a big town we could pick up the local newspaper narrow as the cutting edge of a chisel and twice as keena journal filled with the prices of stock notices of improved reaping and binding machines movements of eminent citizenswhose fame beyond their own abode extendsfor miles along the harlem road there was not much grace about these papers but all breathed the same need for good men steady men who would plough and till and build schools for their children and make a township in the hills once only i found a sharp change in the note and a very pathetic one i think it was a young soul in trouble who was writing poetry the editor had jammed the verses between the flamboyant advertisement of a realestate agenta man who sells you land and lies about itand that of a jew tailor who disposed of nobby suits at cutthroat prices here are two verses i think they tell their own story      god made the pine with its root in the earth         its top in the sky     they have burned the pine to increase the worth         of the wheat and the silver rye      go weigh the cost of the soul of the pine         cut off from the sky     and the price of the wheat that grows so fine         and the worth of the silver rye  the thinlipped keeneyed men who boarded the train would not read that poetry or if they did would not understand heaven guard that poor pine in the desert and keep its top in the sky  when the train took to itself an extra engine and began to breathe heavily some one said that we were ascending the siskiyou mountains we had been climbing steadily from san francisco and at last won to over four thousand feet above sealevel always running through forest then naturally enough we came down but we dropped two thousand two hundred feet in about thirteen miles it was not so much the grinding of the brakes along the train or the sight of three curves of track apparently miles below us or even the vision of a goodstrain apparently just under our wheels or even the tunnels that made me reflect it was the trestles over which we crawledtrestles something over a hundred feet high and looking like a collection of matchsticks  i guess our timber is as much a curse as a blessing said the old man from southern california these trestles last very well for five or six years then they get out of repair and a train goes through em or else a forest fire burns em up  this was said in the middle of a groaning shivering trestle an occasional platelayer took a look at us as we went down but that railway didnt waste men on inspection duty very often there were cattle on the track against which the engine used a diabolical form of whistling the old man had been a driver in his youth and beguiled the way with cheery anecdotes of what might be expected if we fouled a young calf  you see they get their legs under the cowcatcher and thatll put an engine off the line i remember when a hog wrecked an excursiontrain and killed sixty people guess the engineer will look out though  there is considerably too much guessing about this large nation as one of them put it rather forcibly we guess a trestle will stand for ever and we guess that we can patch up a washout on the track and we guess the roads clear and sometimes we guess ourselves into the deepot and sometimes we guess ourselves into hell                                       the descent brought us far into oregon and a timber and wheat country we drove through wheat and pine in alternate slices but pine chiefly till we reached portland which is a city of fifty thousand possessing the electric light of course equally of course devoid of pavements and a port of entry about a hundred miles from the sea at which big steamers can load it is a poor city that cannot say it has no equal on the pacific coast portland shouts this to the pines which run down from a thousandfoot ridge clear up to the city you may sit in a bedizened barroom furnished with telephone and clicker and in half an hour be in the woods  portland produces lumber and jigsaw fittings for houses and beer and buggies and bricks and biscuit and in case you should miss the fact there are glorified views of the town hung up in public places with the value of the products set down in dollars all this is excellent and exactly suitable to the opening of a new country but when a man tells you it is civilisation you object the first thing that the civilised man learns to do is to keep the dollars in the background because they are only the oil of the machine that makes life go smoothly  portland is so busy that it cant attend to its own sewage or paving and the fourstorey brick blocks front cobblestones and plank sidewalks and other things much worse i saw a foundation being dug out the sewage of perhaps twenty years ago had thoroughly soaked into the soil and there was a familiar and oriental look about the compost that flew up with each shovelload yet the local papers as was just and proper swore there was no place like portland oregon usa chronicled the performances of oregonians claimed prominent citizens elsewhere as oregonians and fought tooth and nail for dock rail and wharfage projects and you could find men who had thrown in their lives with the city who were bound up in it and worked their life out for what they conceived to be its material prosperity pity it is to record that in this strenuous labouring town there had been a week before a shootingcase one wellknown man had shot another on the street and was now pleading selfdefence because the other man had or the murderer thought he had a pistol about him not content with shooting him dead he squibbed off his revolver into him as he lay i read the pleadings and they made me ill so far as i could judge if the dead mans body had been found with a pistol on it the shooter would have gone free apart from the mere murder cowardly enough in itself there was a refinement of cowardice in the plea here in this civilised city the surviving brute was afraid he would be shotfancied he saw the other man make a motion to his hippocket and so on eventually the jury disagreed and the degrading thing was that the trial was reported by men who evidently understood all about the pistol was tried before a jury who were versed in the etiquette of the hippocket and was discussed on the streets by men equally initiate  but let us return to more cheerful things the insuranceagent introduced us as friends to a realestate man who promptly bade us go up the columbia river for a day while he made inquiries about fishing there was no overwhelming formality the old man was addressed as california i answered indifferently to england or johnny bull and the realestate man was portland this was a lofty and spacious form of address  so california and i took a steamboat and upon a sumptuous blue and gold morning steered up the willamette river on which portland stands into the great columbiathe river that brings the salmon that goes into the tin that is emptied into the dish when the extra guest arrives in india california introduced me to the boat and the scenery showed me the texas the difference between a towhead and a sawyer and the precise nature of a slue all i remember is a delightful feeling that mark twains huckleberry finn and mississippi pilot were quite true and that i could almost recognise the very reaches down which huck and jim had drifted we were on the border line between oregon state and washington territory but that didnt matter the columbia was the mississippi so far as i was concerned we ran along the sides of wooded islands whose banks were caving in with perpetual smashes and we skipped from one side to another of the milewide stream in search of a channel exactly like a mississippi steamer and when we wanted to pick up or set down a passenger we chose a soft and safe place on the shore and ran our very snub nose against it california spoke to each new passenger as he came aboard and told me the mans birthplace a longhaired tender of kine crashed out of the underwood waved his hat and was taken aboard forthwith south carolina said california almost without looking at him when he talks you will hear a softer dialect than mine and it befell as he said whereat i marvelled and california chuckled every island in the river carried fields of rich wheat orchards and a white wooden house or else if the pines grew very thickly a sawmill the tremulous whine of whose saws flickered across the water like the drone of a tired bee from remarks he let fall i gathered that california owned timber ships and dealt in lumber had ranches too a partner and everything handsome about him in addition to a chequered career of some thirtyfive years but he looked almost as disreputable a loafer as i  say young feller were going to see scenery now you shout and sing said california when the bland wooded islands gave place to bolder outlines and the steamer ran herself into a hornets nest of blackfanged rocks not a foot below the boiling broken water we were trying to get up a slue or back channel by a short cut and the sternwheel never spun twice in the same direction then we hit a floating log with a jar that ran through our system and then whitebellied opengilled spun by a dead salmona lordly twentypound chinook salmon who had perished in his pride youll see the salmonwheels fore long said a man who lived way back on the washoogle and whose hat was spangled with troutflies those chinook salmon never rise to the fly the canneries take them by the wheel at the next bend we sighted a wheelan infernal arrangement of wiregauze compartments worked by the current and moved out from a barge in shore to scoop up the salmon as he races up the river california swore long and fluently at the sight and the more fluently when he was told of the weight of a good nights catchsome thousands of pounds think of the black and bloody murder of it but you out yonder insist in buying tinned salmon and the canneries cannot live by letting down lines  about this time california was struck with madness i found him dancing on the foredeck shouting isnt she a daisy isnt she a darling he had found a waterfalla blown thread of white vapour that broke from the crest of a hilla waterfall eight hundred and fifty feet high whose voice was even louder than the voice of the river bridal veil jerked out the purser dn that purser and the people who christened her why didnt they call her mechlin lace falls at fifty dollars a yard while they were at it said california and i agreed with him there are many bridal veil falls in this country but few men say lovelier than those that come down to the columbia river then the scenery beganpoured forth with the reckless profusion of nature who when she wants to be amiable succeeds only in being oppressively magnificent the river was penned between gigantic stone walls crowned with the ruined bastions of oriental palaces the stretch of green water widened and was guarded by pineclad hills three thousand feet high a wicked devils thumb nail of rock shot up a hundred feet in midstream a sandbar of blinding white sand gave promise of flat country that the next bend denied for lo we were running under a triple tier of fortifications lavatopped pineclothed and terrible behind them the white dome of mount hood ran fourteen thousand feet into the blue and at their feet the river threshed among a belt of cottonwood trees there i sat down and looked at california half out of the boat in his anxiety to see both sides of the river at once he had seen my notebook and it offended him young feller let her goand you shut your head its not you nor anybody like you can put this down black the novelist he could he can describe salmonfishing he can and he glared at me as though he expected me to go and do likewise  i cant i know it i said humbly  then thank god that you came along this way  we reached a little railway on an island which was to convey us to a second steamer because as the purser explained the river was a trifle broken we had a sixmile run sitting in the sunshine on a dummy wagon whirled just along the edge of the riverbluffs sometimes we dived into the fragrant pine woods ablaze with flowers but we generally watched the river now narrowed into a turbulent millrace just where the whole body of water broke in riot over a series of cascades the united states government had chosen to build a lock for steamers and the stream was one boiling spouting mob of water a log shot down the race struck on a rock split from end to end and rolled over in white foam i shuddered because my toes were not more than sixty feet above the log and i feared that a stray splinter might have found me but the train ran into the river on a sort of floating trestle and i was upon another steamer ere i fully understood why the cascades were not two hundred yards below us and when we cast off to go upstream the rush of the river ere the wheel struck the water dragged us as though we had been towed then the country opened out and california mourned for his lost bluffs and crags till we struck a rock wall four hundred feet high crowned by the gigantic figure of a man watching us on a rocky island we saw the white tomb of an oldtime settler who had made his money in san francisco but had chosen to be buried in an indian buryingground a decayed wooden wickyup where the bones of the indian dead are laid almost touched the tomb the river ran into a canal of basaltic rock painted in yellow vermilion and green by indians and by inferior brutes adorned with advertisements of bile beans we had reached the dallesthe centre of a great sheep and wool district and the head of navigation  when an american arrives at a new town it is his bounden duty to take it in california swung his coat over his shoulder with the gesture of a man used to long tramps and together at eight in the evening we explored the dalles the sun had not yet set and it would be light for at least another hour all the inhabitants seemed to own a little villa and one church apiece the young men were out walking with the young maidens the old folks were sitting on the front stepsnot the ones that led to the religiously shuttered best drawingroom but the sidefrontstepsand the husbands and wives were tying back pear trees or gathering cherries a scent of hay reached me and in the stillness we could hear the cattle bells as the cows came home across the lavasprinkled fields california swung down the wooden pavements audibly criticising the housewives hollyhocks and the more perfect ways of peargrafting and as the young men and maidens passed giving quaint stories of his youth i felt that i knew all the people aforetime i was so interested in them and their life a woman hung over a gate talking to another woman and as i passed i heard her say skirts and again skirts and ill send you over the pattern and i knew they were talking dress we stumbled upon a young couple saying goodby in the twilight and when shall i see you again quoth he and i understood that to the doubting heart the tiny little town we paraded in twenty minutes might be as large as all london and as impassable as an armed camp i gave them both my blessing because when shall i see you again is a question that lies very near to hearts of all the world the last garden gate shut with a click that travelled far down the street and the lights of the comfortable families began to shine in the confidingly uncurtained windows  say johnny bull doesnt all this make you feel lonesome said california have you got any folks at home sove ia wife and five childrenand im only on a holiday  and im only on a holiday i said and we went back to the spittoonwood hotel alas for the peace and purity of the little town that i had babbled about at the back of a shop and discreetly curtained was a room where the young men who had been talking to the young maidens could play poker and drink and swear and on the shop were dime novels of bloodshed to corrupt the mind of the little boy and prurient servantgirlslush yarns to poison the mind of the girl california only laughed grimly he said that all these little onehouse towns were pretty much the same all over the states  that night i dreamed i was back in india with no place to sleep in tramping up and down the station mall and asking everybody when shall i see you again     no xxvii  shows how i caught salmon in the clackamas      the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong but     time and chance cometh to all   i have lived the american continent may now sink under the sea for i have taken the best that it yields and the best was neither dollars love nor real estate hear now gentlemen of the punjab fishing club who whip the reaches of the tavi and you who painfully import trout to ootacamund and i will tell you how old man california and i went fishing and you shall envy we returned from the dalles to portland by the way we had come the steamer stopping en route to pick up a nights catch of one of the salmon wheels on the river and to deliver it at a cannery downstream when the proprietor of the wheel announced that his take was two thousand two hundred and thirty pounds weight of fish and not a heavy catch neither i thought he lied but he sent the boxes aboard and i counted the salmon by the hundredhuge fiftypounders hardly dead scores of twenty and thirtypounders and a host of smaller fish  the steamer halted at a rude wooden warehouse built on piles in a lonely reach of the river and sent in the fish i followed them up a scalestrewn fishy incline that led to the cannery the crazy building was quivering with the machinery on its floors and a glittering bank of tinscraps twenty feet high showed where the waste was thrown after the cans had been punched only chinamen were employed on the work and they looked like bloodbesmeared yellow devils as they crossed the rifts of sunlight that lay upon the floor when our consignment arrived the rough wooden boxes broke of themselves as they were dumped down under a jet of water and the salmon burst out in a stream of quicksilver a chinaman jerked up a twentypounder beheaded and detailed it with two swift strokes of a knife flicked out its internal arrangements with a third and cast it into a bloodydyed tank the headless fish leaped from under his hands as though they were facing a rapid other chinamen pulled them from the vat and thrust them under a thing like a chaffcutter which descending hewed them into unseemly red gobbets fit for the can more chinamen with yellow crooked fingers jammed the stuff into the cans which slid down some marvellous machine forthwith soldering their own tops as they passed each can was hastily tested for flaws and then sunk with a hundred companions into a vat of boiling water there to be half cooked for a few minutes the cans bulged slightly after the operation and were therefore slidden along by the trolleyful to men with needles and soldering irons who vented them and soldered the aperture except for the label the finest columbia salmon was ready for the market i was impressed not so much with the speed of the manufacture as the character of the factory inside on a floor ninety by forty the most civilised and murderous of machinery outside three footsteps the thickgrowing pines and the immense solitude of the hills our steamer only stayed twenty minutes at that place but i counted two hundred and forty finished cans made from the catch of the previous night ere i left the slippery bloodstained scalespangled oily floors and the offalsmeared chinamen  we reached portland california and i crying for salmon and the realestate man to whom we had been intrusted by portland the insurance man met us in the street saying that fifteen miles away across country we should come upon a place called clackamas where we might perchance find what we desired and california his coattails flying in the wind ran to a livery stable and chartered a wagon and team forthwith i could push the wagon about with one hand so light was its structure the team was purely americanthat is to say almost human in its intelligence and docility some one said that the roads were not good on the way to clackamas and warned us against smashing the springs portland who had watched the preparations finally reckoned hed come along too and under heavenly skies we three companions of a day set forth california carefully lashing our rods into the carriage and the bystanders overwhelming us with directions as to the sawmills we were to pass the ferries we were to cross and the signposts we were to seek signs from half a mile from this city of fifty thousand souls we struck and this must be taken literally a plankroad that would have been a disgrace to an irish village  then six miles of macadamised road showed us that the team could move a railway ran between us and the banks of the willamette and another above us through the mountains all the land was dotted with small townships and the roads were full of farmers in their town wagons bunches of towhaired boggleeyed urchins sitting in the hay behind the men generally looked like loafers but their women were all well dressed brown hussarbraiding on a tailormade jacket does not however consort with haywagons then we struck into the woods along what california called a camina realea good roadand portland a fair track it wound in and out among fireblackened stumps under pine trees along the corners of logfences through hollows which must be hopeless marsh in the winter and up absurd gradients but nowhere throughout its length did i see any evidence of roadmaking there was a trackyou couldnt well get off itand it was all you could do to stay on it the dust lay a foot thick in the blind ruts and under the dust we found bits of planking and bundles of brushwood that sent the wagon bounding into the air sometimes we crashed through bracken anon where the blackberries grew rankest we found a lonely little cemetery the wooden rails all awry and the pitiful stumpy headstones nodding drunkenly at the soft green mulleins then with oaths and the sound of rent underwood a yoke of mighty bulls would swing down a skid road hauling a fortyfoot log along a rudely made slide a valley full of wheat and cherry trees succeeded and halting at a house we bought ten pound weight of luscious black cherries for something less than a rupee and got a drink of icycold water for nothing while the untended team browsed sagaciously by the roadside once we found a wayside camp of horsedealers lounging by a pool ready for a sale or a swap and once two suntanned youngsters shot down a hill on indian ponies their full creels banging from the highpommelled saddles they had been fishing and were our brethren therefore we shouted aloud in chorus to scare a wildcat we squabbled over the reasons that had led a snake to cross a road we heaved bits of bark at a venturesome chipmunk who was really the little grey squirrel of india and had come to call on me we lost our way and got the wagon so beautifully fixed on a steep road that we had to tie the two hindwheels to get it down above all california told tales of nevada and arizona of lonely nights spent out prospecting of the slaughter of deer and the chase of men of woman lovely woman who is a firebrand in a western city and leads to the popping of pistols and of the sudden changes and chances of fortune who delights in making the miner or the lumberman a quadruplicate millionnaire and in busting the railroad king that was a day to be remembered and it had only begun when we drew rein at a tiny farmhouse on the banks of the clackamas and sought horsefeed and lodging ere we hastened to the river that broke over a weir not a quarter of a mile away  imagine a stream seventy yards broad divided by a pebbly island running over seductive riffles and swirling into deep quiet pools where the good salmon goes to smoke his pipe after meals set such a stream amid fields of breasthigh crops surrounded by hills of pines throw in where you please quiet water logfenced meadows and a hundredfoot bluff just to keep the scenery from growing too monotonous and you will get some faint notion of the clackamas  portland had no rod he held the gaff and the whisky california sniffed upstream and downstream across the racing water chose his ground and let the gaudy spoon drop in the tail of a riffle i was getting my rod together when i heard the joyous shriek of the reel and the yells of california and three feet of living silver leaped into the air far across the water the forces were engaged the salmon tore up stream the tense line cutting the water like a tiderip behind him and the light bamboo bowed to breaking what happened after i cannot tell california swore and prayed and portland shouted advice and i did all three for what appeared to be half a day but was in reality a little over a quarter of an hour and sullenly our fish came home with spurts of temper dashes headon and sarabands in the air but home to the bank came he and the remorseless reel gathered up the thread of his life inch by inch we landed him in a little bay and the springweight checked at eleven and a half pounds eleven and onehalf pounds of fighting salmon we danced a war dance on the pebbles and california caught me round the waist in a hug that went near to breaking my ribs while he shouted partner partner this is glory now you catch your fish twentyfour years ive waited for this  i went into that icycold river and made my cast just above a weir and all but foulhooked a blue and black watersnake with a coral mouth who coiled herself on a stone and hissed maledictions the next castah the pride of it the regal splendour of it the thrill that ran down from fingertip to toe the water boiled he broke for the spoon and got it there remained enough sense in me to give him all he wanted when he jumped not once but twenty times before the upstream flight that ran my line out to the last halfdozen turns and i saw the nickled reelbar glitter under the thinning green coils my thumb was burned deep when i strove to stopper the line but i did not feel it till later for my soul was out in the dancing water praying for him to turn ere he took my tackle away the prayer was heard as i bowed back the butt of the rod on my left hipbone and the top joint dipping like unto a weeping willow he turned and i accepted each inch of slack that i could by any means get in as a favour from on high there be several sorts of success in this world that taste well in the moment of enjoyment but i question whether the stealthy theft of line from an ablebodied salmon who knows exactly what you are doing and why you are doing it is not sweeter than any other victory within human scope like californias fish he ran at me headon and leaped against the line but the lord gave me two hundred and fifty pairs of fingers in that hour the banks and the pine trees danced dizzily round me but i only reeledreeled as for lifereeled for hours and at the end of the reeling continued to give him the butt while he sulked in a pool california was farther up the reach and with the corner of my eye i could see him casting with long casts and much skill then he struck and my fish broke for the weir in the same instant and down the reach we came california and i reel answering reel even as the morning stars sung together  the first wild enthusiasm of capture had died away we were both at work now in deadly earnest to prevent the lines fouling to stall off a downstream rush for deep water just above the weir and at the same time to get the fish into the shallow bay downstream that gave the best practicable landing portland bade us both be of good heart and volunteered to take the rod from my hands i would rather have died among the pebbles than surrender my right to play and land my first salmon weight unknown on an eightounce rod i heard california at my ear it seemed gasping hes a fighter from fightersville sure as his fish made a fresh break across the stream i saw portland fall off a log fence break the overhanging bank and clatter down to the pebbles all sand and landingnet and i dropped on a log to rest for a moment as i drew breath the weary hands slackened their hold and i forgot to give him the butt a wild scutter in the water a plunge and a break for the headwaters of the clackamas was my reward and the hot toil of reelingin with one eye under the water and the other on the top joint of the rod was renewed worst of all i was blocking californias path to the little landingbay aforesaid and he had to halt and tire his prize where he was the father of all salmon he shouted for the love of heaven get your trout to bank johnny bull but i could no more even the insult failed to move me the rest of the game was with the salmon he suffered himself to be drawn skipping with pretended delight at getting to the haven where i would fain have him yet no sooner did he feel shoal water under his ponderous belly than he backed like a torpedoboat and the snarl of the reel told me that my labour was in vain a dozen times at least this happened ere the line hinted he had given up that battle and would be towed in he was towed the landingnet was useless for one of his size and i would not have him gaffed i stepped into the shallows and heaved him out with a respectful hand under the gill for which kindness he battered me about the legs with his tail and i felt the strength of him and was proud california had taken my place in the shallows his fish hard held i was up the bank lying full length on the sweetscented grass and gasping in company with my first salmon caught played and landed on an eightounce rod my hands were cut and bleeding i was dripping with sweat spangled like harlequin with scales wet from the waist down nosepeeled by the sun but utterly supremely and consummately happy he the beauty the darling the daisy my salmon bahadur weighed twelve pounds and i had been seven and thirty minutes bringing him to bank he had been lightly hooked on the angle of the right jaw and the hook had not wearied him that hour i sat among princes and crowned headsgreater than them all below the bank we heard california scuffling with his salmon and swearing spanish oaths portland and i assisted at the capture and the fish dragged the springbalance out by the roots it was only constructed to weigh up to fifteen pounds we stretched the three fish on the grassthe eleven and a half the twelve and fifteen pounderand we swore an oath that all who came after should merely be weighed and put back again  how shall i tell the glories of that day so that you may be interested again and again did california and i prance down that reach to the little bay each with a salmon in tow and land him in the shallows then portland took my rod and caught some tenpounders and my spoon was carried away by an unknown leviathan each fish for the merits of the three that had died so gamely was hastily hooked on the balance and flung back portland recording the weight in a pocketbook for he was a realestate man each fish fought for all he was worth and none more savagely than the smallesta game little sixpounder at the end of six hours we added up the list total 16 fish aggregate weight 142 lbs the score in detail runs something like thisit is only interesting to those concerned 15 1112 12 10 934 8 and so forth as i have said nothing under six pounds and three tenpounders  very solemnly and thankfully we put up our rodsit was glory enough for all timeand returned weeping in each others armsweeping tears of pure joyto that simple barelegged family in the packingcase house by the waterside the old farmer recollected days and nights of fierce warfare with the indiansway back in the fifties when every ripple of the columbia river and her tributaries hid covert danger god had dowered him with a queer crooked gift of expression and a fierce anxiety for the welfare of his two little sonstanned and reserved children who attended school daily and spoke good english in a strange tongue his wife was an austere woman who had once been kindly and perhaps handsome many years of toil had taken the elasticity out of step and voice she looked for nothing better than everlasting workthe chafing detail of housework and then a grave somewhere up the hill among the blackberries and the pines but in her grim way she sympathised with her eldest daughter a small and silent maiden of eighteen who had thoughts very far from the meals she tended or the pans she scoured we stumbled into the household at a crisis and there was a deal of downright humanity in that same a bad wicked dressmaker had promised the maiden a dress in time for a tomorrows railway journey and though the barefooted georgie who stood in very wholesome awe of his sister had scoured the woods on a pony in search that dress never arrived so with sorrow in her heart and a hundred sister anne glances up the road she waited upon the strangers and i doubt not cursed them for the wants that stood between her and her need for tears it was a genuine little tragedy the mother in a heavy passionless voice rebuked her impatience yet sat bowed over a heap of sewing for the daughters benefit these things i beheld in the long marigoldscented twilight and whispering night loafing round the little house with california who unfolded himself like a lotus to the moon or in the little boarded bunk that was our bedroom swapping tales with portland and the old man most of the yarns began in this way red larry was a bullpuncher back of lone county montanna or there was a man riding the trail met a jackrabbit sitting in a cactus or bout the time of the san diego land boom a woman from monterey etc you can try to piece out for yourselves what sort of stories they were  and next day california tucked me under his wing and told me we were going to see a city smitten by a boom and catch trout so we took a train and killed a cowshe wouldnt get out of the way and the locomotive chanced her and slewand crossing into washington territory won the town of tacoma which stands at the head of puget sound upon the road to alaska and vancouver  california was right tacoma was literally staggering under a boom of the boomiest i do not quite remember what her natural resources were supposed to be though every second man shrieked a selection in my ear they included coal and iron carrots potatoes lumber shipping and a crop of thin newspapers all telling portland that her days were numbered california and i struck the place at twilight the rude boarded pavements of the main streets rumbled under the heels of hundreds of furious men all actively engaged in hunting drinks and eligible cornerlots they sought the drinks first the street itself alternated fivestorey business blocks of the later and more abominable forms of architecture with board shanties overhead the drunken telegraph telephone and electriclight wires tangled on the tottering posts whose butts were halfwhittled through by the knife of the loafer down the muddy grimy unmetalled thoroughfare ran a horsecar linethe metals three inches above road level beyond this street rose many hills and the town was thrown like a broken set of dominoes over all a steam tramwayit left the track the only time i used itwas nosing about the hills but the most prominent features of the landscape were the foundations in brick and stone of a gigantic opera house and the blackened stumps of the pines california sized up the town with one comprehensive glance big boom said he and a few instants later about time to step off i think meaning thereby that the boom had risen to its limit and it would be expedient not to meddle with it we passed down ungraded streets that ended abruptly in a fifteenfoot drop and a nest of brambles along pavements that beginning in pineplank ended in the living tree by hotels with turkish mosque trinketry on their shameless tops and the pine stamps at their very doors by a female seminary tall gaunt and red which a native of the town bade us marvel at and we marvelled by houses built in imitation of the ones on nob hill san franciscoafter the dutch fashion by other houses plenteously befouled with jigsaw work and others flaring with the castlemented battlemented bosh of the wooden gothic school  you can tell just about when those fellers had their houses built quoth california that one yonder wanted to be italian and his architect built him what he wanted the new houses with the low straddle roofs and windows pitched in sideways and red brick walls are dutch thats the latest idea i can read the history of the town i had no occasion so to read the natives were only too glad and too proud to tell me the hotel walls bore a flaming panorama of tacoma in which by the eye of faith i saw a faint resemblance to the real town the hotel stationary advertised that tacoma bore on its face all the advantages of the highest civilisation and the newspapers sang the same tune in a louder key the realestate agents were selling houselots on unmade streets miles away for thousands of dollars on the streetsthe rude crude streets where the unshaded electric light was fighting with the gentle northern twilightmen were babbling of money town lots and again moneyhow alf or ed had done such and such a thing that had brought him so much money and round the corner in a creaking boarded hall the redjerseyed salvationists were calling upon mankind to renounce all and follow their noisy god the men dropped in by twos and threes listened silently for a while and as silently went their way the cymbals clashing after them in vain i think it was the raw new smell of fresh sawdust everywhere pervading the air that threw upon me a desolating homesickness it brought back in a moment all remembrances of that terrible first night at school when the establishment has been newly whitewashed and a soft smell of escaping gas mingles with the odour of trunks and wet overcoats i was a little boy and the school was very new a vagabond among collarless vagabonds i loafed up the street looking into the fronts of little shops where they sold slop shirts at fancy prices which shops i saw later described in the papers as great california had gone off to investigate on his own account and presently returned laughing noiselessly they are all mad here he said all mad a man nearly pulled a gun on me because i didnt agree with him that tacoma was going to whip san francisco on the strength of carrots and potatoes i asked him to tell me what the town produced and i couldnt get anything out of him except those two darned vegetables say what do you think  i responded firmly im going into british territory a little whileto draw breath  im going up the sound too for a while said he but im coming backcoming back to our salmon on the clackamas a man has been pressing me to buy real estate here young feller dont you buy real estate here  california disappeared with a kindly wave of his overcoat into worlds other than minegood luck go with him for he was a true sportsmanand i took a steamer up puget sound for vancouver which is the terminus of the canadian pacific railway that was a queer voyage the water landlocked among a thousand islands lay still as oil under our bows and the wake of the screw broke up the unquivering reflections of pines and cliffs a mile away twas as though we were trampling on glass no one not even the government knows the number of islands in the sound even now you can get one almost for the asking can build a house raise sheep catch salmon and become a king on a small scaleyour subjects the indians of the reservation who glide among the islets in their canoes and scratch their hides monkeywise by the beach a sound indian is unlovely and only by accident picturesque his wife drives the canoe but he himself is so thorough a mariner that he can spring up in his cocklecraft and whack his wife over the head with a paddle without tipping the whole affair into the water this i have seen him do unprovoked i fancy it must have been to show off before the whites  have i told you anything about seattlethe town that was burned out a few weeks ago when the insurance men at san francisco took their losses with a grin in the ghostly twilight just as the forest fires were beginning to glare from the unthrifty islands we struck itstruck it heavily for the wharves had all been burned down and we tied up where we could crashing into the rotten foundations of a boathouse as a pig roots in high grass the town like tacoma was built upon a hill in the heart of the business quarters there was a horrible black smudge as though a hand had come down and rubbed the place smooth i know now what being wiped out means the smudge seemed to be about a mile long and its blackness was relieved by tents in which men were doing business with the wreck of the stock they had saved there were shouts and countershouts from the steamer to the temporary wharf which was laden with shingles for roofing chairs trunks provisionboxes and all the lath and string arrangements out of which a western town is made this is the way the shouts ran  oh george whats the best with you  nawthin got the old safe out shes burned to a crisp books all gone  save anythin  barl o crackers and my wifes bonnet goin to start store on them though  bully for you wheres

you howd you like us act  the jobs comforter on the steamer retired into himself  oh george dived into the bar for a drink  p samong many curiosities i have unearthed one it was a face on the steamera face above a pointed strawcoloured beard a face with thin lips and eloquent eyes we conversed and presently i got at the ideas of the face it was though it lived for nine months of the year in the wilds of alaska and british columbia an authority on the canon law of the church of englanda zealous and bitter upholder of the supremacy of the aforesaid church into my amazed ears as the steamer plodded through the reflections of the stars it poured the battlecry of the church militant here on earth and put forward as a foul injustice that in the prisons of british columbia the protestant chaplain did not always belong to the church the face had no official connection with the august body and by force of his life very seldom attended service  but said he proudly i should think it direct disobedience to the orders of my church if i attended any other places of worship than those prescribed i was once for three months in a place where there was only a wesleyan methodist chapel and i never set foot in it once sir never once twould have been heresy rank heresy  and as i leaned over the rail methought that all the little stars in the water were shaking with austere merriment but it may have been only the ripple of the steamer after all     no xxviii  takes me from vancouver to the yellowstone national park      but who shall chronicle the ways     of common folk the nights and days     spent with rough goatherds on the snows     and travellers come whence no man knows   this day i know how a deserter feels here in victoria a hundred and forty miles out of america the mail brings me news from our homethe land of regrets i was enjoying myself by the side of a troutstream and i feel inclined to apologise for every rejoicing breath i drew in the diamond clear air the sickness they said is heavy with you from rewari to the south good men are dying two names come in by the mail of two strong men deadmen that i dined and jested with only a little time ago and it seems unfair that i should be here cut off from the chaingang and the shotdrill of our weary life after all there is no life like it that we lead over yonder americans are americans and there are millions of them english are english but we of india are us all the world over knowing the mysteries of each others lives and sorrowing for the death of a brother how can i sit down and write to you of the mere joy of being alive the news has killed the pleasure of the day for me and i am ashamed of myself there are seventy brook trout lying in a creel fresh drawn from harrison hot springs and they do not console me they are like the stolen apples that clinch the fact of a bad boys playing truant i would sell them all with my heritage in the woods and air and the delight of meeting new and strange people just to be back again in the old galling harness the heat and the dust the gatherings in the evenings by the flooded tenniscourts the ghastly dull dinners at the club when the very last woman has been packed off to the hills and the four or five surviving men ask the doctor the symptoms of incubating smallpox i should be troubled in body but at peace in the soul o excellent and toilworn public of minemen of the brotherhood griffins new joined from the february troopers and gentlemen waiting for your offreckoningstake care of yourselves and keep well it hurts so when any die there are so few of us and we know one another too intimately                                       vancouver three years ago was swept off by fire in sixteen minutes and only one house was left standing today it has a population of fourteen thousand people and builds its houses out of brick with dressed granite fronts but a great sleepiness lies on vancouver as compared with an american town men dont fly up and down the streets telling lies and the spittoons in the delightfully comfortable hotel are unused the baths are free and their doors are unlocked you do not have to dig up the hotel clerk when you want to bathe which shows the inferiority of vancouver an american bade me notice the absence of bustle and was alarmed when in a loud and audible voice i thanked god for it give me granitehewn granite and peace quoth i and keep your deal boards and bustle for yourselves  the canadian pacific terminus is not a very gorgeous place as yet but you can be shot directly from the window of the train into the liner that will take you in fourteen days from vancouver to yokohama the parthia of some five thousand tons was at her berth when i came and the sight of the excunard on what seemed to be a little lake was curious except for certain currents which are not much mentioned but which make the entrance rather unpleasant for sailingboats vancouver possesses an almost perfect harbour the town is built all round and about the harbour and young as it is its streets are better than those of western america moreover the old flag waves over some of the buildings and this is cheering to the soul the place is full of englishmen who speak the english tongue correctly and with clearness avoiding more blasphemy than is necessary and taking a respectable length of time to getting outside their drinks these advantages and others that i have heard about such as the construction of elaborate workshops and the like by the canadian pacific in the near future moved me to invest in real estate he that sold it me was a delightful english boy who having tried for the army and failed had somehow meandered into a realestate office where he was doing well i couldnt have bought it from an american he would have overstated the case and proved me the possessor of the original eden all the boy said was i give you my word it isnt on a cliff or under water and before long the town ought to move out that way id advise you to take it and i took it as easily as a man buys a piece of tobacco me voici owner of some four hundred welldeveloped pines a few thousand tons of granite scattered in blocks at the roots of the pines and a sprinkling of earth thats a townlot in vancouver you or your agent hold to it till property rises then sell out and buy more land further out of town and repeat the process i do not quite see how this sort of thing helps the growth of a town but the english boy says that it is the essence of speculation so it must be all right but i wish there were fewer pines and rather less granite on my ground moved by curiosity and the lust of trout i went seventy miles up the canadian pacific in one of the crosscontinent cars which are cleaner and less stuffy than the pullman a man who goes all the way across canada is liable to be disappointednot in the scenery but in the progress of the country so a batch of wandering politicians from england told me they even went so far as to say that eastern canada was a failure and unprofitable the place didnt move they complained and whole countiesthey said provinceslay under the rule of the roman catholic priests who took care that the people should not be overcumbered with the good things of this world to the detriment of their souls my interest was in the linethe real and accomplished railway which is to throw actual fighting troops into the east some day when our hold of the suez canal is temporarily loosened  all that vancouver wants is a fat earthwork fort upon a hillthere are plenty of hills to choose froma selection of big guns a couple of regiments of infantry and later on a big arsenal the raw selfconsciousness of america would be sure to make her think these arrangements intended for her benefit but she could be enlightened it is not seemly to leave unprotected the headend of a big railway for though victoria and esquimalt our naval stations on vancouver island are very near so also is a place called vladivostok and though vancouver narrows are strait they allow room enough for a manofwar the peoplei did not speak to more than two hundred of themdo not know about russia or military arrangements they are trying to open trade with japan in lumber and are raising fruit wheat and sometimes minerals all of them agree that we do not yet know the resources of british columbia and all joyfully bade me note the climate which was distinctly warm we never have killing cold here its the most perfect climate in the world then there are three perfect climates for i have tasted emcalifornia washington territory and british columbia i cannot say which is the loveliest  when i left by steamer and struck across the sound to our naval station at victoria vancouver island i found in that quite english town of beautiful streets quite a colony of old men doing nothing but talking fishing and loafing at the club that means that the retired go to victoria on a thousand a year pension a man would be a millionnaire in these parts and for four hundred he could live well it was at victoria they told me the tale of the fire in vancouver how the inhabitants of new westminster twelve miles from vancouver saw a glare in the sky at six in the evening but thought it was a forest fire how later bits of burnt paper flew about their streets and they guessed that evil had happened how an hour later a man rode into the city crying that there was no vancouver left all had been wiped out by the flames in sixteen minutes how two hours later the mayor of new westminster having voted nine thousand dollars from the municipal funds reliefwagons with food and blankets were pouring into where vancouver stood how fourteen people were supposed to have died in the fire but how even now when they laid new foundations the workmen unearth charred skeletons many more than fourteen that night said the teller all vancouver was houseless the wooden town had gone in a breath next day they began to build in brick and you have seen what they have achieved  the sight afar off of three british menofwar and a torpedoboat consoled me as i returned from victoria to tacoma and discovered en route that i was surfeited with scenery there is a great deal in the remark of a discontented traveller when you have seen a fine forest a bluff a river and a lake you have seen all the scenery of western america sometimes the pine is three hundred feet high and sometimes the rock is and sometimes the lake is a hundred miles long but its all the same dont you know im getting sick of it i dare not say getting sick im only tired if providence could distribute all this beauty in little bits where people most wanted itamong you in indiait would be well but it is en masse overwhelming with nobody but the tobaccochewing captain of a river steamboat to look at it men said if i went to alaska i should see islands even more wooded snowpeaks loftier and rivers more lovely than those around me that decided me not to go to alaska i went easteast to montana after another horrible night in tacoma among the men who spat why does the westerner spit it cant amuse him and it doesnt interest his neighbour  but i am beginning to mistrust everything good as well as everything bad is supposed to come from the east is there a shootingscrape between prominent citizens oh youll find nothing of that kind in the east is there a more than usually revolting lynching they dont do that in the east i shall find out when i get there whether this unnatural perfection be real  eastward then to montana i took my way for the yellowstone national park called in the guidebooks wonderland but the real wonderland began in the train we were a merry crew one gentleman announced his intention of paying no fare and grappled the conductor who neatly crossbuttocked him through a double plateglass window his head was cut open in four or five places a doctor on the train hastily stitched up the biggest gash and he was dropped at a wayside station spurting blood at every haira scarletheaded and ghastly sight the conductor guessed that he would die and volunteered the information that there was no profit in monkeying with the north pacific railway  night was falling as we cleared the forests and sailed out upon a wilderness of sage brush the desolation of montgomery the wilderness of sind the hummockstudded desert of bikaneer are joyous and homelike compared to the impoverished misery of the sage it is blue it is stunted it is dusty it wraps the rolling hills as a mildewed shroud wraps the body of a longdead man it makes you weep for sheer loneliness and there is no getting away from it when childe roland came to the dark tower he traversed the sage brush  yet there is one thing worse than sage unadulterated and that is a prairie city we stopped at pasco junction and a man told me that it was the queen city of the prairie i wish americans didnt tell such useless lies i counted fourteen or fifteen framehouses and a portion of a road that showed like a bruise on the untouched surface of the blue sage running away and away up to the setting sun the sailor sleeps with a halfinch plank between himself and death he is at home beside the handful of people who curl themselves up o nights with nothing but a frail scantling almost as thin as a blanket to shut out the unmeasurable loneliness of the sage  when the train stopped on the road as it did once or twice the solid silence of the sage got up and shouted at us it was like a nightmare and one not in the least improved by having to sleep in an emigrantcar the regularly ordained sleepers being full there was a row in our car toward morning a man having managed to get querulously drunk in the night up rose a cornishman with a red head full of strategy and strapped the obstreperous one smiling largely as he did so and a delicate little woman in a far bunk watched the fray and called the drunken man a damned hog which he certainly was though she neednt have put it quite so coarsely emigrant cars are clean but the accommodation is as hard as a plank bed  later we laid our bones down to crossing the rockies an american train can climb up the side of a house if need be but it is not pleasant to sit in it we clomb till we struck violent cold and an indian reservation and the noble savage came to look at us he was a flathead and unlovely most americans are charmingly frank about the indian let us get rid of him as soon as possible they say we have no use for him some of the men i meet have a notion that we in india are exterminating the native in the same fashion and i have been asked to fix a date for the final extinguishment of the aryan i answer that it will be a long business very many americans have an offensive habit of referring to natives as heathen mahometans and hindus are heathen alike in their eyes and they vary the epithet with pagan and idolater but this is beside the matter which is the stampede tunnelour actual point of crossing the rockies thank heaven i need never take that tunnel again it is about two miles long and in effect is nothing more than the gallery of a mine shored with timber and lighted with electric lamps black darkness would be preferable for the lamps just reveal the rough cutting of the rocks and that is very rough indeed the train crawls through brakes down and you can hear the water and little bits of stone falling on the roof of the car then you pray pray fervently and the air gets stiller and stiller and you dare not take your unwilling eyes off the timber shoring lest a prop should fall for lack of your moral support before the tunnel was built you crossed in the open air by a switchback line a watchman goes through the tunnel after each train but that is no protection he just guesses that another train will pull through and the enginedriver guesses the same thing some day between the two of them there will be a cave in the tunnel then the enterprising reporter will talk about the shrieks and groans of the buried and the heroic efforts of the press in securing first information andthat will be all human life is of small account out here  i was listening to yarns in the smokingcompartment of the pullman all the way to helena and with very few exceptions each had for its point violent brutal and ruffianly murdermurder by fraud and the craft of the savagemurder unavenged by the law or at the most by an outbreak of fresh lawlessness at the end of each tale i was assured that the old days had passed away and that these were anecdotes of five years standing one man in particular distinguished himself by holding up to admiration the exploits of some cowboys of his acquaintance and their skill in the use of the revolver each tale of horror wound up with and thats the sort of man he was as who should say go and do likewise remember that the shootings the cuttings and the stabbings were not the outcome of any species of legitimate warfare the heroes were not forced to fight for their lives far from it the brawls were bred by liquor in which they assistedin saloons and gamblinghells they were wont to pull their guns on a man and in the vast majority of cases without provocation the tales sickened me but taught one thing a man who carries a pistol may be put down as a cowarda person to be shut out from every decent mess and club and gathering of civilised folk there is neither chivalry nor romance in the weapon for all that american authors have seen fit to write i would i could make you understand the full measure of contempt with which certain aspects of western life have inspired me let us try a comparison sometimes it happens that a young a very young man whose first dresscoat is yet glossy gets slightly flushed at a dinnerparty among his seniors after the ladies are gone he begins to talk he talks you will remember as a man of the world and a person of varied experiences an authority on all things human and divine the grey heads of the elders bow assentingly to his wildest statement some one tries to turn the conversation when what the youngster conceives to be wit has offended a sensibility and another deftly slides the decanters beyond him as they circle round the table you know the feeling of discomfortpity mingled with aversionover the boy who is making an exhibition of himself the same emotion came back to me when an old man who ought to have known better appealed from time to time for admiration of his pitiful sentiments it was right in his mind to insult to maim and to kill right to evade the law where it was strong and to trample over it where it was weak right to swindle in politics to lie in affairs of state and commit perjury in matters of municipal administration the car was full of little children utterly regardless of their parents fretful peevish spoilt beyond anything i have ever seen in angloindia they in time would grow up into men such as sat in the smoker and had no regard for the law men who would conduct papers siding with defiance of any and every law but its of no consequence as mr toots says  during the descent of the rockies we journeyed for a season on a trestle only two hundred and eightysix feet high it was made of iron but up till two years ago a wooden structure bore up the train and was used long after it had been condemned by the civil engineers some day the iron one will come down just as stampede tunnel will and the results will be even more startling  late in the night we ran over a skunkran over it in the dark everything that has been said about the skunk is true it is an awesome stink     no xxix  shows how yankee jim introduced me to diana of the crossways on the banks of the yellowstone and how a german jew said i was no true citizen ends with the celebration of the 4th of july and a few lessons therefrom   livingstone is a town of two thousand people and the junction for the little sideline that takes you to the yellowstone national park it lies in a fold of the prairie and behind it is the yellowstone river and the gate of the mountains through which the river flows there is one street in the town where the cowboys pony and the little foal of the broodmare in the buggy rest contentedly in the blinding sunshine while the cowboy gets himself shaved at the only other barbers shop and swaps lies at the bar i exhausted the town including the saloons in ten minutes and got away on the rolling grass downs where i threw myself to rest directly under the hill i was on swept a drove of horses in charge of two mounted men that was a picture i shall not soon forget a light haze of dust went up from the hooftrodden green scarcely veiling the unfettered deviltries of three hundred horses who very much wanted to stop and graze yow yow yow yapped the mounted men in chorus like coyotes the column moved forward at a trot divided as it met a hillock and scattered into fan shape all among the suburbs of livingstone i heard the snick of a stock whip half a dozen yow yows and the mob had come together again and with neighing and whickering and squealing and a great deal of kicking on the part of the youngsters rolled like a wave of brown water toward the uplands  i was within twenty feet of the leader a grey stallionlord of many broodmares all deeply concerned for the welfare of their fuzzy foals a creamcoloured beasti knew him at once for the bad character of the troopbroke back taking with him some frivolous fillies i heard the snick of the whips somewhere in the dust and the fillies came back at a canter very shocked and indignant on the heels of the last rode both the stockmenpicturesque ruffians who wanted to know what in hell i was doing there waved their hats and sped down the slope after their charges when the noise of the troop had died there came a wonderful silence on all the prairiethat silence they say which enters into the heart of the oldtime hunter and trapper and marks him off from the rest of his race the town disappeared in the darkness and a very young moon showed herself over a baldheaded snowflecked peak then the yellowstone hidden by the waterwillows lifted up its voice and sang a little song to the mountains and an old horse that had crept up in the dusk breathed inquiringly on the back of my neck when i reached the hotel i found all manner of preparation under way for the 4th of july and a drunken man with a winchester rifle over his shoulder patrolling the sidewalk i do not think he wanted any one he carried the gun as other folk carry walkingsticks none the less i avoided the direct line of fire and listened to the blasphemies of miners and stockmen till far into the night in every barroom lay a copy of the local paper and every copy impressed it upon the inhabitants of livingstone that they were the best finest bravest richest and most progressive town of the most progressive nation under heaven even as the tacoma and portland papers had belauded their readers and yet all my purblind eyes could see was a grubby little hamlet full of men without clean collars and perfectly unable to get through one sentence unadorned by three oaths they raise horses and minerals round and about livingstone but they behave as though they raised cherubims with diamonds in their wings  from livingstone the national park train follows the yellowstone river through the gate of the mountains and over arid volcanic country a stranger in the cars saw me look at the ideal troutstream below the windows and murmured softly lie off at yankee jims if you want good fishing they halted the train at the head of a narrow valley and i leaped literally into the arms of yankee jim sole owner of a log hut an indefinite amount of hayground and constructor of twentyseven miles of wagonroad over which he held toll right there was the hutthe river fifty yards away and the polished line of metals that disappeared round a bluff that was all the railway added the finishing touch to the already complete loneliness of the place yankee jim was a picturesque old man with a talent for yarns that ananias might have envied it seemed to me presumptuous in my ignorance that i might hold my own with the oldtimer if i judiciously painted up a few lies gathered in the course of my wanderings yankee jim saw every one of my tales and went fifty better on the spot he dealt in bears and indiansnever less than twenty of each had known the yellowstone country for years and bore upon his body marks of indian arrows and his eyes had seen a squaw of the crow indians burned alive at the stake he said she screamed considerable in one point did he speak the truthas regarded the merits of that particular reach of the yellowstone he said it was alive with trout it was i fished it from noon till twilight and the fish bit at the brown hook as though never a fat troutfly had fallen on the water from pebbly reaches quivering in the heathaze where the foot caught on stumps cut foursquare by the chiseltooth of the beaver past the fringe of the waterwillow crowded with the breeding troutfly and alive with toads and watersnakes over the drifted timber to the grateful shadow of big trees that darkened the holes where the fattest fish lay i worked for seven hours the mountain flanks on either side of the valley gave back the heat as the desert gives it and the dry sand by the railway track where i found a rattlesnake was hotiron to the touch but the trout did not care for the heat they breasted the boiling river for my fly and they got it i simply dare not give my bag at the fortieth trout i gave up counting and i had leached the fortieth in less than two hours they were small fishnot one over two poundsbut they fought like small tigers and i lost three flies before i could understand their methods of escape ye gods that was fishing though it peeled the skin from my nose in strips  at twilight yankee jim bore me off protesting to supper in the hut the fish had prepared me for any surprise wherefore when yankee jim introduced me to a young woman of fiveandtwenty with eyes like the deepfringed eyes of the gazelle and on the neck the small head buoyant like a bellflower in its bed i said nothing it was all in the days events she was californiaraised the wife of a man who owned a stockfarm up the river a little ways and with her husband tenant of yankee jims shanty i know she wore list slippers and did not wear stays but i know also that she was beautiful by any standard of beauty and that the trout she cooked were fit for a kings supper and after supper strange men loafed up in the dim delicious twilight with the little news of the dayhow a heifer had gone strayed from nicholsons how the widow at grants fork wouldnt part with a little hayland nohow though shes an her big brothers cant manage more than haaf their land now shes so darned proud diana of the crossways entertained them in queenly wise and her husband and yankee jim bade them sit right down and make themselves at home then did yankee jim uncurl his choicest lies on indian warfare aforetime then did the whiskyflask circle round the little crowd then did dianas husband low that he was quite handy with the lariat but had seen men rope a steer by any foot or horn indicated then did diana unburden herself about her neighbours the nearest house was three miles away but the women arent nice neighbourly folk they talk so they havent got anything else to do seemingly if a woman goes to a dance and has a good time they talk and if she wears a silk dress they want to know how jest ranchin folksfolk on a ranchecome by such things and they make mischief down all the lands here from gardiner city way back up to livingstone theyre mostly montanna raised and they havent been nowheres ah how they talk were things like this demanded diana in the big world outside whence i had come yes i said things were very much the same all over the world and i thought of a faraway station in india where new dresses and the having of good times at dances raised cackle more grammatical perhaps but no less venomous than the gossip of the montannaraised folk on the ranches of the yellowstone  next morn i fished again and listened to diana telling the story of her life i forget what she told me but i am distinctly aware that she had royal eyes and a mouth that the daughter of a hundred earls might have enviedso small and so delicately cut it was an you come back an see us again said the simpleminded folk come back an well show you how to catch sixpound trout at the head of the cañon  today i am in the yellowstone park and i wish i were dead the train halted at cinnabar station and we were decanted a howling crowd of us into stages variously horsed for the eightmile drive to the first spectacle of the parka place called the mammoth hot springs what means this eager anxious throng i asked the driver youve struck one of rayments excursion partiesthats alla crowd of creatorcondemned fools mostly arent you one of em no i said may i sit up here with you great chief and man with a golden tongue i do not know mister rayment i belong to t cook and son the other person from the quality of the material he handles must be the son of a seacook he collects masses of downeasters from the new england states and elsewhere and hurls them across the continent and into the yellowstone park on tour a brakeload of cooks continental tourists trapezing through paris ive seen em are angels of light compared to the rayment trippers it is not the ghastly vulgarity the oozing rampant bessemersteel selfsufficiency and ignorance of the men that revolts me so much as the display of these same qualities in the womenfolk i saw a new type in the coach and all my dreams of a better and more perfect east died away are theseumpersons here any sort of persons in their own places i asked a shepherd who appeared to be herding them  why certainly they include very many prominent and representative citizens from seven states of the union and most of them are wealthy yes sir representative and prominent  we ran across bare hills on an unmetalled road under a burning sun in front of a volley of playful repartee from the prominent citizens inside it was the 4th of july the horses had american flags in their headstalls some of the women wore flags and coloured handkerchiefs in their belts and a young german on the boxseat with me was bewailing the loss of a box of crackers he said he had been sent to the continent to get his schooling and so had lost his american accent but no continental schooling writes german jew all over a mans face and nose he was a rabid american citizenone of a very difficult class to deal with as a general rule praise unsparingly and without discrimination that keeps most men quiet but some if you fail to keep up a continuous stream of praise proceed to revile the old countrygermans and irish who are more americans than the americans are the chief offenders this young american began to attack the english army he had seen some of it on parade and he pitied the men in bearskins as slaves the citizen by the way has a contempt for his own army which exceeds anything you meet among the most illiberal classes in england i admitted that our army was very poor had done nothing and had been nowhere this exasperated him for he expected an argument and he trampled on the british lion generally failing to move me he vowed that i had no patriotism like his own i said i had not and further ventured that very few englishmen had which when you come to think of it is quite true by the time he had proved conclusively that before the prince of wales came to the throne we should be a blethering republic we struck a road that overhung a river and my interest in politics was lost in admiration of the drivers skill as he sent his four big horses along that winding road there was no room for any sort of accidenta shy or a swerve would have dropped us sixty feet into the roaring gardiner river some of the persons in the coach remarked that the scenery was elegant wherefore even at the risk of my own life i did urgently desire an accident and the massacre of some of the more prominent citizens what elegance lies in a thousandfoot pile of honeycoloured rock riven into peak and battlement the highest peak defiantly crowned by an eagles nest the eaglet peering into the gulf and screaming for his food i could not for the life of me understand but they speak a strange tongue  en route we passed other carriages full of trippers who had done their appointed five days in the park and yelped at us fraternally as they disappeared in clouds of red dust when we struck the mammoth hot spring hotela huge yellow barna signboard informed us that the altitude was six thousand two hundred feet the park is just a howling wilderness of three thousand square miles full of all imaginable freaks of a fiery nature an hotel company assisted by the secretary of state for the interior appears to control it there are hotels at all the points of interest guidebooks stalls for the sale of minerals and so forth after the model of swiss summer places  the touristsmay their master die an evil death at the hand of a mad locomotivepoured into that place with a joyful whoop and scarce washing the dust from themselves began to celebrate the 4th of july they called it patriotic exercises elected a clergyman of their own faith as president and sitting on the landing of the first floor began to make speeches and read the declaration of independence the clergyman rose up and told them they were the greatest freest sublimest most chivalrous and richest people on the face of the earth and they all said amen another clergyman asserted in the words of the declaration that all men were created equal and equally entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness i should like to know whether the wild and woolly west recognises this first right as freely as the grantors intended the clergyman then bade the world note that the tourists included representatives of seven of the new england states whereat i felt deeply sorry for the new england states in their latter days he opined that this running to and fro upon the earth under the auspices of the excellent rayment would draw america more closely together especially when the westerners remembered the perils that they of the east had surmounted by rail and river at duly appointed intervals the congregation sang my country tis of thee to the tune of god save the queen here they did not stand up and the starspangled banner here they did winding up the exercise with some doggrel of their own composition to the tune of john browns body movingly setting forth the perils before alluded to they then adjourned to the verandahs and watched firecrackers of the feeblest exploding one by one for several hours  what amazed me was the calm with which these folks gathered together and commenced to belaud their noble selves their country and their institootions and everything else that was theirs the language was to these bewildered ears wild advertisement gas bunkum blow anything you please beyond the bounds of common sense an archangel selling townlots on the glassy sea would have blushed to the tips of his wings to describe his property in similar terms then they gathered round the pastor and told him his little sermon was perfectly glorious really grand sublime and so forth and he bridled ecclesiastically at the end a perfectly unknown man attacked me and asked me what i thought of american patriotism i said there was nothing like it in the old country by the way always tell an american this it soothes him  then said he are you going to get out your lettersyour letters of naturalisation  why i asked  i presoom you do business in this country and make money out of itand it seems to me that it would be your dooty  sir said i sweetly there is a forgotten little island across the seas called england it is not much bigger than the yellowstone park in that island a man of your country could work marry make his fortune or twenty fortunes and die throughout his career not one soul would ask him whether he were a british subject or a child of the devil do you understand  i think he did because he said something about britishers which wasnt complimentary     no xxx  shows how i entered mazanderan of the persians and saw devils of every colour and some troopers hell and the old lady from chicago the captain and the lieutenant      that desolate land and lone     where the big horn and yellowstone     roar down their mountain path   twice have i written this letter from end to end twice have i torn it up fearing lest those across the water should say that i had gone mad on a sudden now we will begin for the third time quite solemnly and soberly i have been through the yellowstone national park in a buggy in the company of an adventurous old lady from chicago and her husband who disapproved of scenery as being ongodly i fancy it scared them  we began as you know with the mammoth hot springs they are only a gigantic edition of those pink and white terraces not long ago destroyed by earthquake in new zealand at one end of the little valley in which the hotel stands the limeladen springs that break from the pinecovered hillsides have formed a frozen cataract of white lemon and palest pink formation through and over and in which water of the warmest bubbles and drips and trickles from palegreen lagoon to exquisitely fretted basin the ground rings hollow as a kerosenetin and some day the mammoth hotel guests and all will sink into the caverns below and be turned into a stalactite when i set foot on the first of the terraces a touristtrampled ramp of scabby grey stuff i met a stream of ironred hot water which ducked into a hole like a rabbit followed a gentle chuckle of laughter and then a deep exhausted sigh from nowhere in particular fifty feet above my head a jet of steam rose up and died out in the blue it was worse than the boiling mountain at myanoshita the dirty white deposit gave place to lime whiter than snow and i found a basin which some learned hotelkeeper has christened cleopatras pitcher or mark antonys whiskyjug or something equally poetical it was made of frosted silver it was filled with water as clear as the sky i do not know the depth of that wonder the eye looked down beyond grottoes and caves of beryl into an abyss that communicated directly with the central fires of earth and the pool was in pain so that it could not refrain from talking about it muttering and chattering and moaning from the lips of the limeledges forty feet under water spurts of silver bubbles would fly up and break the peace of the crystal atop then the whole pool would shake and grow dim and there were noises i removed myself only to find other pools all equally unhappy rifts in the ground full of running redhot water slippery sheets of deposit overlaid with greenish grey hot water and here and there pitholes dry as a rifled tomb in india dusty and waterless elsewhere the infernal waters had first boiled dead and then embalmed the pines and underwood or the forest trees had taken heart and smothered up a blind formation with greenery so that it was only by scraping the earth you could tell what fires had raged beneath yet the pines will win the battle in years to come because nature who first forges all her work in her great smithies has nearly finished this job and is ready to temper it in the soft brown earth the fires are dying down the hotel is built where terraces have overflowed into flat wastes of deposit the pines have taken possession of the high ground whence the terraces first started only the actual curve of the cataract stands clear and it is guarded by soldiers who patrol it with loaded sixshooters in order that the tourist may not bring up fencerails and sink them in a pool or chip the fretted tracery of the formations with a geological hammer or walking where the crust is too thin foolishly cook himself  i manoeuvred round those soldiers they were cavalry in a very slovenly uniform darkblue blouse and lightblue trousers unstrapped cut spoonshape over the boot cartridge belt revolver peaked cap and worsted glovesblack buttons by the mercy of allah i opened conversation with a spectacled scot he had served the queen in the marines and a line regiment and the gofever being in his bones had drifted to america there to serve uncle sam we sat on the edge of an extinct little pool that under happier circumstances would have grown into a geyser and began to discuss things generally to us appeared yet another soldier no need to ask his nationality or to be told that the troop called him the henglishman a cockney was he who had seen something of warfare in egypt and had taken his discharge from a fusilier regiment not unknown to you  and how do things go  very much as you please said they theres not half the discipline here that there is in the queens servicenot halfnor the work either but what there is is rough work why theres a sergeant now with a black eye that one of our men gave him they wont say anything about that of course our punishments fines mostly and then if you carry on too much you go to the coolerthats the clink yes sir horses oh theyre devils these montanna horses bronchos mostly we dont slick em up for paradenot much and the amount of schooling that you put into one english troophorse would be enough for a whole squadron of these creatures youll meet more troopers further up the park go and look at their horses and their turnouts i fancy itll startle you im wearing a made tie and a breastpin under my blouse of course i am i can wear anything i darn please we arent particular here i shouldnt dare come on paradeno nor yet fatigue dutyin this condition in the old country but it dont matter here but dont you forget sir that its taught me how to trust to myself and my shooting irons i dont want fifty orders to move me across the park and catch a poacher yes they poach here men come in with an outfit and ponies smuggle in a gun or two and shoot the bison if you interfere they shoot at you then you confiscate all their outfit and their ponies we have a pound full of them now down below theres our captain over yonder speak to him if you want to know anything special this service isnt a patch on the old countrys service but you look if it was worked up it would be just a hell of a service but these citizens despise us and they put us on to roadmending and such like nough to ruin any army  to the captain i addressed myself after my friends had gone they told me that a good many american officers dressed by the french army the captain certainly might have been mistaken for a french officer of light cavalry and he had more than the courtesy of a frenchman yes he had read a good deal about our indian border warfare and had been much struck with the likeness it bore to red indian warfare i had better when i reached the next cavalry post scattered between two big geyser basins introduce myself to a captain and lieutenant they could show me things he himself was devoting all his time to conserving the terraces and surreptitiously running hot water into driedup basins that fresh pools might form i get very interested in that sort of thing its not duty but its what im put here for and then he began to talk of his troop as i have heard his brethren in india talk such a troop built up carefully and watched lovingly not a man that id wish to exchange and whats more i believe not a man that would wish to leave on his own account were different i believe from the english your officers value the horses we set store on the men we train them more than we do the horses  of the american trooper i will tell you more hereafter he is not a gentleman to be trifled with  next dawning entering a buggy of fragile construction with the old people from chicago i embarked on my perilous career we ran straight up a mountain till we could see sixty miles away the white houses of cook city on another mountain and the whiplashlike trail leading thereto the live air made me drunk if tom the driver had proposed to send the mares in a beeline to the city i should have assented and so would the old lady who chewed gum and talked about her symptoms the tubended rockdog which is but the translated prairiedog broke across the road under our horses feet the rabbit and the chipmunk danced with fright we heard the roar of the river and the road went round a corner on one side piled rock and shale that enjoined silence for fear of a general slidedown on the other a sheer drop and a fool of a noisy river below then apparently in the middle of the road lest any should find driving too easy a post of rock nothing beyond that save the flank of a cliff then my stomach departed from me as it does when you swing for we left the dirt which was at least some guarantee of safety and sailed out round the curve and up a steep incline on a plankroad built out from the cliff the planks were nailed at the outer edge and did not shift or creak very muchbut enough quite enough that was the golden gate i got my stomach back again when we trotted out on to a vast upland adorned with a lake and hills have you ever seen an untouched landthe face of virgin nature it is rather a curious sight because the hills are choked with timber that has never known an axe and the storm has rent a way through this timber so that a hundred thousand trees lie matted together in swathes and since each tree lies where it falls you may behold trunk and branch returning to the earth whence they sprangexactly as the body of man returnseach limb making its own little grave the grass climbing above the bark till at last there remains only the outline of a tree upon the rank undergrowth  then we drove under a cliff of obsidian which is black glass some two hundred feet high and the road at its foot was made of black glass that crackled this was no great matter because half an hour before tom had pulled up in the woods that we might sufficiently admire a mountain who stood all by himself shaking with laughter or rage  the glass cliff overlooks a lake where the beavers built a dam about a mile and a half long in a zigzag line as their necessities prompted then came the government and strictly preserved them and as you shall learn later on they be damn impudent beasts the old lady had hardly explained the natural history of beavers before we climbed some hillsit really didnt matter in that climate because we could have scaled the starsand this mattered very much indeed shot down a desperate dusty slope brakes shrieking on the wheels the mares clicking among unseen rocks the dust dense as a fog and a wall of trees on either side how do the heavy fourhorse coaches take it tom i asked remembering that some twentythree souls had gone that way half an hour before take it at the run said tom spitting out the dust of course there was a sharp curve and a bridge at the bottom but luckily nothing met us and we came to a wooden shanty called an hotel in time for a crazy tiffin served by very gorgeous handmaids with very pink cheeks when health fails in other and more exciting pursuits a season as help in one of the yellowstone hotels will restore the frailest constitution  then by companies after tiffin we walked chattering to the uplands of hell they call it the norris geyser basin on earth it was as though the tide of desolation had gone out but would presently return across innumerable acres of dazzling white geyser formation there were no terraces here but all other horrors not ten yards from the road a blast of steam shot up roaring every few seconds a mud volcano spat filth to heaven streams of hot water rumbled under foot plunged through the dead pines in steaming cataracts and died on a waste of white where greengrey blackyellow and pink pools roared shouted bubbled or hissed as their wicked fancies prompted by the look of the eye the place should have been frozen over by the feel of the feet it was warm i ventured out among the pools carefully following tracks but one unwary foot began to sink a squirt of water followed and having no desire to descend quick into tophet i returned to the shore where the mud and the sulphur and the nameless fat oozevegetation of lethe lay but the very road rang as though built over a gulf and besides how was i to tell when the raving blast of steam would find its vent insufficient and blow the whole affair into nirvana there was a potent stench of stale eggs everywhere and crystals of sulphur crumbled under the foot and the glare of the sun on the white stuff was blinding sitting under a bank to me appeared a young trooperexcape mounted rifles this man the real american seems to object to his armymounted on a horse halfmaddened by the noise and steam and smell he carried only the sixshooter and cartridgebelt on service the springfield carbine which is clumsy and a cartridgebelt slung diagonally complete equipment the sword is no earthly use for border warfare and except at state parades is never worn the saddle is the mcclellan tree over a fourfolded blanket sweatleathers you must pay for yourself and the beauty of the tree is that it necessitates first very careful girthing and a thorough knowledge of tricks with the blanket to suit the varying conditions of the horsea broncho will bloat in a night if he can get at a bellyfuland secondly even more careful riding to prevent galling crupper and breastband do not seem to be usedbut they are casual about their accoutrementsand the bit is the single jawbreaking curb which american warpictures show us that young man was very handsome and the grey service hatmost like the under half of a seedy teraishaded his strong face admirably as his horse backed and shivered and sidled and plunged all over the road and he lectured from his saddle one foot out of the heavyhooded stirrup one hand on the sweating neck hes not used to the park this brute and hes a confirmed bolter on parade but we understand each other whoosh went the steamblast down the road with a dry roar round spun the troop horse prepared to bolt and his momentum being suddenly checked reared till i thought he would fall back on his rider oh no weve settled that little matter when i was breaking him said centaur he used to try to fall back on me isnt he a devil i think youd laugh to see the way our regiments are horsed sometimes a big montana beast like mine has a thirteentwo broncho pony for neighbour and its annoying if youre used to better things and oh how you have to ride your mount its necessary but i can tell you at the end of a long days march when youd give all the world to ride like a sack it isnt sweet to get extra drill for slouching when were turned out were turned out for anythingnot a fifteenmile trot but for the use and behoof of all the northern states ive been in arizona a trooper there who had been in india told me that arizona was like afghanistan theres nothing under heaven there except horned toads and rattlesnakesand indians our trouble is that we only deal with indians and they dont teach us much and of course the citizens look down on us and all that as a matter of fact i suppose were really only mounted infantry but remember were the best mounted infantry in the world and the horse danced a fandango in proof  my faith said i looking at the dusty blouse grey hat soiled leather accoutrements and whalebone poise of the wearer if they are all like you you are  thanks whoever you may be of course if we were turned into a lawntennis court and told to resist say your heavy cavalry wed be ridden off the face of the earth if we couldnt get away we have neither the weight nor the drill for a charge my horse for instance by english standards is halfbroken and like all the others he bolts when were in line but cavalry charge against cavalry charge doesnt happen often and if it did wellall our men know that up to a hundred yards they are absolutely safe behind this old thing he patted his revolver pouch absolutely safe from any shooting of yours what man do you think would dare to use a pistol at even thirty yards if his life depended oh it not one of your men they cant shoot we can youll hear about that down the parkfurther up  then he added courteously just now it seems that the english supply all the men to the american army thats what makes them so good perhaps and with mutual expressions of goodwill we partedhe to an outlying patrol fifteen miles away i to my buggy and the old lady who regarding the horrors of the fireholes could only say good lord at thirtysecond intervals her husband talked about dreffel waste of steampower and we went on in the clear crisp afternoon speculating as to the formation of geysers  what i say shrieked the old lady apropos of matters theological and what i say more after having seen all that is that the lord has ordained a hell for such as disbelieve his gracious works  nota benetom had profanely cursed the near mare for stumbling he looked straight in front of him and said no word but the left corner of his left eye flickered in my direction  and if continued the old lady if we find a thing so dreffel as all that steam and sulphur allowed on the face of the earth musnt we believe that there is something ten thousand times more terrible below prepared untoe our destruction  some people have a wonderful knack of extracting comfort from things i am ashamed to say i agreed ostentatiously with the old lady she developed the personal view of the matter  now i shall be able to say something to anna fincher about her way of living shant i blake this to her husband  yes said he speaking slowly after a heavy tiffin but the girls a good girl and they fell to arguing as to whether the luckless anna fincher really stood in need of lectures edged with hell fire she went to dances i believe while i got out and walked in the dust alongside of tom  i drive blame curous kinder folk through this place said he blame curous seems a pity that they should ha come so far just to liken norris basin to hell guess chicago would ha served em speaking in comparison jest as good  we curved the hill and entered a forest of spruce the path serpentining between the treeboles the wheels running silent on immemorial mould there was nothing alive in the forest save ourselves only a river was speaking angrily somewhere to the right for miles we drove till tom bade us alight and look at certain falls wherefore we stepped out of that forest and nearly fell down a cliff which guarded a tumbled river and returned demanding fresh miracles if the water had run uphill we should perhaps have taken more notice of it but twas only a waterfall and i really forget whether the water was warm or cold there is a stream here called firehole river it is fed by the overflow from the various geysers and basinsa warm and deadly river wherein no fish breed i think we crossed it a few dozen times in the course of a day  then the sun began to sink and there was a taste of frost about and we went swiftly from the forest into the open dashed across a branch of the firehole river and found a wood shanty even rougher than the last at which after a fortymile drive we were to dine and sleep half a mile from this place stood on the banks of the firehole river a beaverlodge and there were rumours of bears and other cheerful monsters in the woods on the hill at the back of the building  in the cool crisp quiet of the evening i sought that river and found a pile of newly gnawed sticks and twigs the beaver works with the coldchisel and a few clean strokes suffice to level a fourinch bole across the water on the far bank glimmered with the ghastly white of peeled dead timber the beaverlodgea mass of dishevelled branches the inhabitants had dammed the stream lower down and spread it into a nice little lake the question was would they come out for their walk before it got too dark to see they cameblessings on their blunt muzzles they cameas shadows come drifting down the stream stirring neither foot nor tail there were three of them one went down to investigate the state of the dam the other two began to look for supper there is only one thing more startling than the noiselessness of a tiger in the jungle and that is the noiselessness of a beaver in the water the straining ear could catch no sound whatever till they began to eat the thick green riverscudge that they call beavergrass i bowed among the logs held my breath and stared with all my eyes they were not ten yards from me and they would have eaten their dinner in peace so long as i had kept absolutely still they were dear and desirable beasts and i was just preparing to creep a step nearer when that wicked old lady from chicago clattered down the bank an umbrella in her hand shrieking beavers beavers young man whurr are those beavers good lord what was that now  the solitary watcher might have heard a pistol shot ring through the air i wish it had killed the old lady but it was only the beaver giving warning of danger with the slap of his tail on the water it was exactly like the phink of a pistol fired with damp powder then there were no more beaversnot a whiskerend the lodge however was there and a beast lower than any beaver began to throw stones at it because the old lady from chicago said praps if you rattle them up theyll come out i do so want to see a beaver  yet it cheers me to think i have seen the beaver in his wilds never will i go to the zoo that even after suppertwere flattery to call it dinnera captain and a subaltern of the cavalry post appeared at the hotel these were the officers of whom the mammoth springs captain had spoken the lieutenant had read everything that he could lay hands on about the indian army especially our cavalry arrangements and was very full of a scheme for raising the riding red indiansit is not every noble savage that will make a trooperinto frontier leviesa sort of khyber guard only as he said ruefully there is no frontier these days and all our indian wars are nearly over those beautiful beasts will die out and nobody will ever know what splendid cavalry they can make  the captain told stories of border warfareof ambush firing on the rearguard heat that split the skull better than any tomahawk cold that wrinkled the very liver nightstampedes of baggagemules raiding of cattle and hopeless sternchases into inhospitable hills when the cavalry knew that they were not only being outpaced but outspied then he spoke of one fair charge when a tribe gave battle in the open and the troopers rode in swordless firing right and left with their revolvers andit was excessively uncomfy for that tribe and i spoke of what men had told me of huntings in burma of hillclimbing in the black mountain affair and so forth  exactly said the captain nobody knows and nobody cares what does it matter to the downeaster who wrapuphistail was  and what does the fat briton know or care about boh hlaoo said i then both together depend upon it my dear sir the army in both anglosaxon countries is a mischievously underestimated institution and its a pleasure to meet a man who etc etc and we nodded triangularly in all good will and swore eternal friendship the lieutenant made a statement which rather amazed me he said that on account of the scarcity of business many american officers were to be found getting practical instruction from little troubles among the south american republics when the need broke out they would return there is so little for us to do and the republic has a trick of making us hedge and ditch for our pay a little roadmaking on service is not a bad thing but continuous navvying is enough to knock the heart out of any army  i agreed and we sat up till two in the morning swapping the lies of east and west as that glorious chief manafraidofpinkrats once said to the agent on the reservation melican officer good man heap good man drink me drink he drink me drink he drink he me blind heap good man     no xxxi  ends with the caÑon of the yellowstone the maiden from new hampshirelarrywrapuphistailtomthe old lady from chicagoand a few natural phenomenaincluding one briton      what man would read and read the selfsame faces     and like the marbles which the windmill grinds     rub smooth forever with the same smooth minds     this year retracing last years every years dull traces     when there are woods and unmanstifled places     lowell   once upon a time there was a carter who brought his team and a friend into the yellowstone park without due thought presently they came upon a few of the natural beauties of the place and that carter turned his team into his friends team howling get back o this jim all hells alight under our noses and they call the place hells halfacre to this day we too the old lady from chicago her husband tom and the good little mares came to hells halfacre which is about sixty acres and when tom said would you like to drive over it we said certainly no and if you do we shall report you to the authorities there was a plain blistered and peeled and abominable and it was given over to the sportings and spoutings of devils who threw mud and steam and dirt at each other with whoops and halloos and bellowing curses the place smelt of the refuse of the pit and that odour mixed with the clean wholesome aroma of the pines in our nostrils throughout the day be it known that the park is laid out like ollendorf in exercises of progressive difficulty hells halfacre was a prelude to ten or twelve miles of geyser formation we passed hot streams boiling in the forest saw whiffs of steam beyond these and yet other whiffs breaking through the misty green hills in the far distance we trampled on sulphur and sniffed things much worse than any sulphur which is known to the upper world and so came upon a parklike place where tom suggested we should get out and play with the geysers  imagine mighty green fields splattered with lime beds all the flowers of the summer growing up to the very edge of the lime that was the first glimpse of the geyser basins the buggy had pulled up close to a rough broken blistered cone of stuff between ten and twenty feet high there was trouble in that placemoaning splashing gurgling and the clank of machinery a spurt of boiling water jumped into the air and a wash of water followed i removed swiftly the old lady from chicago shrieked what a wicked waste said her husband i think they call it the riverside geyser its spout was torn and ragged like the mouth of a gun when a shell has burst there it grumbled madly for a moment or two and then was still i crept over the steaming limeit was the burning marl on which satan layand looked fearfully down its mouth you should never look a gift geyser in the mouth i beheld a horrible slippery slimy funnel with water rising and falling ten feet at a time then the water rose to lip level with a rush and an infernal bubbling troubled this devils bethesda before the sullen heave of the crest of a wave lapped over the edge and made me run mark the nature of the human soul i had begun with awe not to say terror i stepped back from the flanks of the riverside geyser saying pooh is that all it can do yet for aught i knew the whole thing might have blown up at a minutes notice she he or it being an arrangement of uncertain temper  we drifted on up that miraculous valley on either side of us were hills from a thousand to fifteen hundred feet high and wooded from heel to crest as far as the eye could range forward were columns of steam in the air misshapen lumps of lime most like preadamite monsters still pools of turquoise blue stretches of blue cornflowers a river that coiled on itself twenty times boulders of strange colours and ridges of glaring staring white  the old lady from chicago poked with her parasol at the pools as though they had been alive on one particularly innocentlooking little puddle she turned her back for a moment and there rose behind her a twentyfoot column of water and steam then she shrieked and protested that she never thought it would ha done it and the old man chewed his tobacco steadily and mourned for steam power wasted i embraced the whitened stump of a middlesized pine that had grown all too close to a hot pools lip and the whole thing turned over under my hand as a tree would do in a nightmare from right and left came the trumpetings of elephants at play i stepped into a pool of old dried blood rimmed with the nodding cornflowers the blood changed to ink even as i trod and ink and blood were washed away in a spurt of boiling sulphurous water spat out from the lee of a bank of flowers this sounds mad doesnt it  a moonfaced trooper of german extractionnever was park so carefully patrolledcame up to inform us that as yet we had not seen any of the real geysers that they were all a mile or so up the valley tastefully scattered round the hotel in which we would rest for the night america is a free country but the citizens look down on the soldier i had to entertain that trooper the old lady from chicago would have none of him so we loafed along together now across halfrotten pine logs sunk in swampy ground anon over the ringing geyser formation then kneedeep through long grass  and why did you list said i  the moonfaced ones face began to work i thought he would have a fit but he told me a story insteadsuch a nice tale of a naughty little girl who wrote love letters to two men at once she was a simple village wife but a wicked family novelette countess couldnt have accomplished her ends better she drove one man nearly wild with her pretty little treachery and the other man abandoned her and came west to forget moonface was that man  we rounded a low spur of hill and came out upon a field of aching snowy lime rolled in sheets twisted into knots riven with rents and diamonds and stars stretching for more than half a mile in every direction in this place of despair lay most of the big geysers who know when there is trouble in krakatoa who tell the pines when there is a cyclone on the atlantic seaboard and whoare exhibited to visitors under pretty and fanciful names the first mound that i encountered belonged to a goblin splashing in his tub i heard him kick pull a showerbath on his shoulders gasp crack his joints and rub himself down with a towel then he let the water out of the bath as a thoughtful man should and it all sank down out of sight till another goblin arrived yet they called this place the lioness and the cubs it lies not very far from the lion which is a sullen roaring beast and they say that when it is very active the other geysers presently follow suit after the krakatoa eruption all the geysers went mad together spouting spurting and bellowing till men feared that they would rip up the whole field mysterious sympathies exist among them and when the giantess speaks of her more anon they all hold their peace  i was watching a solitary spring when far across the fields stood up a plume of spun glass iridescent and superb against the sky that said the trooper is old faithful he goes off every sixtyfive minutes to the minute plays for five minutes and sends up a column of water a hundred and fifty feet high by the time you have looked at all the other geysers he will be ready to play  so we looked and we wondered at the beehive whose mouth is built up exactly like a hive at the turban which is not in the least like a turban and at many many other geysers hot holes and springs some of them rumbled some hissed some went off spasmodically and others lay still in sheets of sapphire and beryl  would you believe that even these terrible creatures have to be guarded by the troopers to prevent the irreverent american from chipping the cones to pieces or worse still making the geysers sick if you take of softsoap a small barrelful and drop it down a geysers mouth that geyser will presently be forced to lay all before you and for days afterwards will be of an irritated and inconsistent stomach when they told me the tale i was filled with sympathy now i wish that i had stolen soap and tried the experiment on some lonely little beast of a geyser in the woods it sounds so probableand so human  yet he would be a bold man who would administer emetics to the giantess she is flatlipped having no mouth she looks like a pool fifty feet long and thirty wide and there is no ornamentation about her at irregular intervals she speaks and sends up a column of water over two hundred feet high to begin with then she is angry for a day and a halfsometimes for two days owing to her peculiarity of going mad in the night not many people have seen the giantess at her finest but the clamour of her unrest men say shakes the wooden hotel and echoes like thunder among the hills when i saw her trouble was brewing the pool bubbled seriously and at fiveminute intervals sank a foot or two then rose washed over the rim and huge steam bubbles broke on the top just before an eruption the water entirely disappears from view whenever you see the water die down in a geysermouth get away as fast as you can i saw a tiny little geyser suck in its breath in this way and instinct made me retire while it hooted after me  leaving the giantess to swear and spit and thresh about we went over to old faithful who by reason of his faithfulness has benches close to him whence you may comfortably watch at the appointed hour we heard the water flying up and down the mouth with the sob of waves in a cave then came the preliminary gouts then a roar and a rush and that glittering column of diamonds rose quivered stood still for a minute then it broke and the rest was a confused snarl of water not thirty feet high all the young ladiesnot more than twentyin the tourist band remarked that it was elegant and betook themselves to writing their names in the bottoms of shallow pools nature fixes the insult indelibly and the afteryears will learn that hattie sadie mamie sophie and so forth have taken out their hairpins and scrawled on the face of old faithful  the congregation returned to the hotel to put down their impressions in diaries and notebooks which they wrote up ostentatiously in the verandahs it was a sweltering hot day albeit we stood somewhat higher than the summit of jakko and i left that raw pinecreaking caravanserai for the cool shade of a clump of pines between whose trunks glimmered tents a batch of troopers came down the road and flung themselves across country into their rough lines verily the melican cavalryman can ride though he keeps his accoutrements pig and his horse cowfashion  i was free of that camp in five minutesfree to play with the heavy lumpy carbines to have the saddles stripped and punch the horses knowingly in the ribs one of the men had been in the fight with wrapuphistail before alluded to and he told me how that great chief his horses tail tied up in red calico swaggered in front of the united states cavalry challenging all to single combat but he was slain and a few of his tribe with him theres no use in an indian anyway concluded my friend  a couple of cowboysreal cowboys not the buffalo bill articlejingled through the camp amid a shower of mild chaff they were on their way to cook city i fancy and i know that they never washed but they were picturesque ruffians with long spurs hooded stirrups slouch hats fur weathercloths over their knees and pistolbutts easy to hand  the cowboys goin under before long said my friend soon as the countrys settled up hell have to go but hes mighty useful now what should we do without the cowboy  as how said i and the camp laughed  he has the money we have the knowhow he comes in in winter to play poker at the military posts we play pokera few when hes lost his money we make him drunk and let him go sometimes we get the wrong man and he told a tale of an innocent cowboy who turned up cleaned out at a post and played poker for thirtysix hours but it was the post that was cleaned out when that longhaired caucasian ah sin removed himself heavy with everybodys pay and declining the proffered liquor naow said the historian i dont play with no cowboy unless hes a little bit drunk first  ere i departed i gathered from more than one man that significant fact that up to one hundred yards he felt absolutely secure behind his revolver  in england i understand quoth a limber youth from the south in england a man arent allowed to play with no firearms hes got to be taught all that when he enlists i didnt want much teaching how to shoot straight fore i served uncle sam and thats just where it is but you was talking about your horse guards now  i explained briefly some peculiarities of equipment connected with our crackest crack cavalry i grieve to say the camp roared  take em over swampy ground let em run around a bit an work the starch out of em an then almighty if we wouldnt plug em at ease id eat their horses  but suppose they engaged in the open said i  engage the hades not if there was a treetrunk within twenty miles they couldnt engage in the open  gentlemen the officers have you ever seriously considered the existence on earth of a cavalry who by preference would fight in timber the evident sincerity of the proposition made me think hard as i moved over to the hotel and joined a party exploration which diving into the woods unearthed a pit pool of burningest water fringed with jet black sandall the ground near by being pure white but miracles pall when they arrive at the rate of twenty a day a flaming dragonfly flew over the pool reeled and dropped on the water dying without a quiver of his gorgeous wings and the pool said nothing whatever but sent its thin steam wreaths up to the burning sky i prefer pools that talk  there was a maidena very trim maidenwho had just stepped out of one of mr jamess novels she owned a delightful mother and an equally delightful father a heavyeyed slowvoiced man of finance the parents thought that their daughter wanted change she lived in new hampshire accordingly she had dragged them up to alaska to the yosemite valley and was now returning leisurely via the yellowstone just in time for the tailend of the summer season at saratoga we had met once or twice before in the park and i had been amazed and amused at her critical commendation of the wonders that she saw from that very resolute little mouth i received a lecture on american literature the nature and inwardness of washington society the precise value of cables works as compared with uncle remus harris and a few other things that had nothing whatever to do with geysers but were altogether delightful now an english maiden who had stumbled on a dustgrimed limewashed sunpeeled collarless wanderer come from and going to goodness knows where would her mother inciting her and her father brandishing his umbrella have regarded him as a dissolute adventurer not so those delightful people from new hampshire they were good enough to treat meit sounds almost incredibleas a human being possibly respectable probably not in immediate need of financial assistance papa talked pleasantly and to the point the little maiden strove valiantly with the accent of her birth and that of her reading and mamma smiled benignly in the background  balance this with a story of a young english idiot i met knocking about inside his high collars attended by a valet he condescended to tell me that you cant be too careful who you talk to in these parts and stalked on fearing i suppose every minute for his social chastity now that man was a barbarian i took occasion to tell him so for he comported himself after the manner of the headhunters of assam who are at perpetual feud one with another  you will understand that these foolish tales are introduced in order to cover the fact that this pen cannot describe the glories of the upper geyser basin the evening i spent under the lee of the castle geyser sitting on a log with some troopers and watching a baronial keep forty feet high spouting hot water if the castle went off first they said the giantess would be quiet and vice versa and then they told tales till the moon got up and a party of campers in the woods gave us all something to eat  next morning tom drove us on promising new wonders he pulled up after a few miles at a clump of brushwood where an army was drowning i could hear the sick gasps and thumps of the men going under but when i broke through the brushwood the hosts had fled and there were only pools of pink black and white lime thick as turbid honey they shot up a pat of mud every minute or two choking in the effort it was an uncanny sight do you wonder that in the old days the indians were careful to avoid the yellowstone geysers are permissible but mud is terrifying the old lady from chicago took a piece of it and in half an hour it died into limedust and blew away between her fingers all mayaillusionyou see then we clinked over sulphur in crystals there was a waterfall of boiling water and a road across a level park hotly contested by the beavers every winter they build their dam and flood the lowlying land every summer that dam is torn up by the government and for half a mile you must plough axledeep in water the willows brushing into the buggy and little waterways branching off right and left the road is the main streamjust like the bolan line in flood if you turn up a byway there is no more of you and the beavers work your buggy into next years dam  then came soft turfy forest that deadened the wheels and two trooperson detachment dutycame noiselessly behind us one was the wrapuphistail man and we talked merrily while the halfbroken horses bucked about among the trees till we came to a mighty hill all strewn with moss agates and everybody had to get out and pant in that thin air but how intoxicating it was the old lady from chicago clucked like an emancipated hen as she scuttled about the road cramming pieces of rock into her reticule she sent me fifty yards down the hill to pick up a piece of broken bottle which she insisted was moss agate ive some o that at home an they shine you go get it young feller  as we climbed the long path the road grew viler and viler till it became without disguise the bed of a torrent and just when things were at their rockiest we emerged into a little sapphire lakebut never sapphire was so bluecalled marys lake and that between eight and nine thousand feet above the sea then came grass downs all on a vehement slope so that the buggy following the newmade road ran on to the two offwheels mostly till we dipped headfirst into a ford climbed up a cliff raced along a down dipped again and pulled up dishevelled at larrys for lunch and an hours rest only larry could have managed that schoolfeast tent on the lonely hillside need i say that he was an irishman his supplies were at their lowest ebb but larry enveloped us all in the golden glamour of his speech ere we had descended and the tent with the rude trestletable became a palace the rough fare delicacies of delmonico and we the abashed recipients of larrys imperial bounty it was only later that i discovered i had paid eight shillings for tinned beef biscuits and beer but on the other hand larry had said will i go out an kill a buffalo and i felt that for me and for me alone would he have done it everybody else felt that way good luck go with larry  an now youll all go an wash your pockethandkerchiefs in that beautiful hot spring round the corner said he theres soap an a washboard ready an tis not every day that ye can get hot water for nothing he waved us largehandedly to the open downs while he put the tent to rights these was no sense of fatigue on the body or distance in the air hill and dale rode on the eyeball i could have clutched the faroff snowy peaks by putting out my hand never was such maddening air why we should have washed pockethandkerchiefs larry alone knows it appeared to be a sort of religious rite in a little valley overhung with gay painted rocks ran a stream of velvet brown and pink it was hothotter than the hand could bearand it coloured the boulders in its course  there was the maiden from new hampshire the old lady from chicago papa mamma the woman who chewed gum and all the rest of them gravely bending over a washboard and soap mysterious virtues lay in that queer stream it turned the linen white as driven snow in five minutes and then we lay on the grass and laughed with sheer bliss of being alive this have i known once in japan once on the banks of the columbia what time the salmon came in and california howled and once again in the yellowstone by the light of the eyes of the maiden from new hampshire four little pools lay at my elbow one was of black water tepid one clear water cold one clear water hot one red water boiling my newly washed handkerchief covered them all we marvelled as children marvel  this evening we shall do the grand cañon of the yellowstone said the maiden  together said i and she said yes  the sun was sinking when we heard the roar of falling waters and came to a broad river along whose banks we ran and thenoh then i might at a pinch describe the infernal regions but not the other place be it known to you that the yellowstone river has occasion to run through a gorge about eight miles long to get to the bottom of the gorge it makes two leaps one of about one hundred and twenty and the other of three hundred feet i investigated the upper or lesser fall which is close to the hotel up to that time nothing particular happens to the yellowstone its banks being only rocky rather steep and plentifully adorned with pines at the falls it comes round a corner green solid ribbed with a little foam and not more than thirty yards wide then it goes over still green and rather more solid than before after a minute or two you sitting upon a rock directly above the drop begin to understand that something has occurred that the river has jumped a huge distance between solid cliff walls and what looks like the gentle froth of ripples lapping the sides of the gorge below is really the outcome of great waves and the river yells aloud but the cliffs do not allow the yells to escape  that inspection began with curiosity and finished in terror for it seemed that the whole world was sliding in chrysolite from under my feet i followed with the others round the corner to arrive at the brink of the cañon we had to climb up a nearly perpendicular ascent to begin with for the ground rises more than the river drops stately pine woods fringe either lip of the gorge which isthe gorge of the yellowstone  all i can say is that without warning or preparation i looked into a gulf seventeen hundred feet deep with eagles and fishhawks circling far below and the sides of that gulf were one wild welter of colourcrimson emerald cobalt ochre amber honey splashed with portwine snowwhite vermilion lemon and silvergrey in wide washes the sides did not fall sheer but were graven by time and water and air into monstrous heads of kings dead chiefs men and women of the old time so far below that no sound of its strife could reach us the yellowstone river rana fingerwide strip of jadegreen the sunlight took those wondrous walls and gave fresh hues to those that nature had already laid there once i saw the dawn break over a lake in rajputana and the sun set over the oodey sagar amid a circle of holman hunt hills this time i was watching both performances going on below meupside down you understandand the colours were real the cañon was burning like troy town but it would burn for ever and thank goodness neither pen nor brush could ever portray its splendours adequately the academy would reject the picture for a chromolithograph the public would scoff at the letterpress for daily telegraphese i will leave this thing alone said i tis my peculiar property nobody else shall share it with me evening crept through the pines that shadowed us but the full glory of the day flamed in that cañon as we went out very cautiously to a jutting piece of rockbloodred or pink it wasthat overhung the deepest deeps of all now i know what it is to sit enthroned amid the clouds of sunset giddiness took away all sensation of touch or form but the sense of blinding colour remained when i reached the mainland again i had sworn that i had been floating the maid from new hampshire said no word for a very long time she then quoted poetry which was perhaps the best thing she could have done  and to think that this showplace has been going on all these days an none of we ever saw it said the old lady from chicago with an acid glance at her husband  no only the injuns said he unmoved and the maiden and i laughed long inspiration is fleeting beauty is vain and the power of the mind for wonder limited though the shining hosts themselves had risen choiring from the bottom of the gorge they would not have prevented her papa and one baser than himself from rolling stones down those stupendous rainbowwashed slides seventeen hundred feet of steepest pitch and rather more than seventeen hundred colours for log or boulder to whirl through so we heaved things and saw them gather way and bound from white rock to red or yellow dragging behind them torrents of colour till the noise of their descent ceased and they bounded a hundred yards clear at the last into the yellowstone  ive been down there said tom that evening its easy to get down if youre carefuljust sit and slide but getting up is worse an i found down below there two rocks just marked with a picture of the cañon i wouldnt sell those rocks not for fifteen dollars  and papa and i crawled down to the yellowstonejust above the first little fallto wet a line for good luck the round moon came up and turned the cliffs and pines into silver a twopound trout came up also and we slew him among the rocks nearly tumbling into that wild river                                       then out and away to livingstone once more the maiden from new hampshire disappeared papa and mamma with her disappeared disappeared too the old lady from chicago and all the rest while i thought of all that i had not seenthe forest of petrified trees with amethyst crystals in their black hearts the great yellowstone lake where you catch your trout alive in one spring and drop him into another to boil him and most of all of that mysterious hoodoo region where all the devils not employed in the geysers live and kill the wandering bear and elk so that the scared hunter finds in death gulch piled carcasses of the dead whom no man has smitten hoodooland with the overhead noises the bird and beast and devilrocks the mazes and the bottomless pitsall these things i missed on the return road yankee jim and diana of the crossways gave me kindly greeting as the train paused an instant before their door and at livingstone whom should i see but tom the driver  ive done with the yellowstone and decided to clear out east somewheres said he your talkin about movin round so gay an careless made me kinder restless im movin out  lord forgie us for our responsibility one to another  and your partner said i  heres him said tom introducing a gawky youth with a bundle and i saw those two young men turn their faces to the east     no xxxii  of the american army and the city of the saints the temple the book of mormon and the girl from dorset an oriental consideration of polygamy      a fool also is full of words a man cannot tell what shall be     and what shall be after him who can tell   it has just occurred to me with great force that delightful as these letters are to myself their length and breadth and depth may be just the least little bit in the world wearisome to you over there i will compress myself rigorously though i should very much like to deliver a dissertation on the american army and the possibilities of its extension  the american army is a beautiful little army some day when all the indians are happily dead or drunk it ought to make the finest scientific and survey corps that the world has ever seen it does excellent work now but there is this defect in its nature it is officered as you know from west point but the mischief of it is that west point seems to be created for the purpose of spreading a general knowledge of military matters among the people a boy goes up to that institution gets his pass and returns to civil life so they tell me with a dangerous knowledge that he is a sucking moltke and may apply his learning when occasion offers given trouble that man will be a nuisance because he is a hideously versatile american to begin with as cocksure of himself as a man can be and with all the racial disregard for human life to back him through his demisemiprofessional generalship in a country where as the records of the daily papers show men engaged in a conflict with police or jails are all too ready to adopt a military formation and get heavily shot in a sort of cheap halfinstructed warfare instead of being decently scared by the appearance of the military this sort of arrangement does not seem wise the bond between the states is of amazing tenuity so long as they do not absolutely march into the district of columbia sit on the washington statues and invent a flag of their own they can legislate lynch hunt negroes through swamps divorce railroad and rampage as much as ever they choose they do not need knowledge of their own military strength to back their genial lawlessness that regular army which is a dear little army should be kept to itself blooded on detachment duty turned into the paths of science and now and again assembled at feasts of freemasons and so forth its too tiny to be a political power the immortal wreck of the grand army of the republic is a political power of the largest and most unblushing description it ought not to help to lay the foundations of an amateur military power that is blind and irresponsible  be thankful that the balance of this lecture is suppressed and with it the account of a shiveree which i attended in livingstone city and the story of the editor and the subeditor the latter was a pet cougar or mountain lion who used they said skilfully to subedit disputants in the office of the livingstone daily paper  omitting a thousand matters of first importance let me pick up the thread of things on a narrowgauge line that took me down to salt lake the run between delhi and ahmedabad on a may day would have been bliss compared to this torture there was nothing but glare and desert and alkali dust there was no smokingaccommodation i sat in the lavatory with the conductor and a prospector who told stories about indian atrocities in the voice of a dreaming childoath following oath as smoothly as clotted cream laps the mouth of the jug i dont think he knew he was saying anything out of the way but nine or ten of those oaths were new to me and one even made the conductor raise his eyebrows  and when a mans alone mostly leadin his horse across the hills he gets to talk aloud to himself as it was said the weatherworn retailer of tortures a vision rose before me of this man trampling the bannack city trail under the starsswearing always swearing  bundles of rags that were pointed out as red indians boarded the train from time to time their race privileges allow them free transit on the platforms of the cars they mustnt come inside of course and equally of course the train never thinks of pulling up for them i saw a squaw take us flying and leave us in the same manner when we were spinning round a curve like the punjabi the red indian gets out by preference on the trackless plain and walks stolidly to the horizon he never says where he is going  salt lake i am concerned for the sake of mr phil robinson his soul you will remember that he wrote a book called saints and sinners in which he proved very prettily that the mormon was almost altogether an estimable person ever since my arrival at salt lake i have been wondering what made him write that book on mature reflection and after a long walk round the city i am inclined to think it was the sun which is very powerful hereabouts  by great good luck the evilminded train already delayed twelve hours by a burnt bridge brought me to the city on a saturday by way of that valley which the mormons aver their efforts had caused to blossom like the rose some hours previously i had entered a new world where in conversation every one was either a mormon or a gentile it is not seemly for a free and independent citizen to dub himself a gentile but the mayor of ogdenwhich is the gentile city of the valleytold me that there must be some distinction between the two flocks long before the fruit orchards of logan or the shining levels of the salt lake had been reached that mayorhimself a gentile and one renowned for his dealings with the mormonstold me that the great question of the existence of the power within the power was being gradually solved by the ballot and by education we have quoth he hills round and about here stuffed full of silver and gold and lead and all hell atop of the mormon church cant keep the gentile from flocking in when thats the case at ogden thirty miles from salt lake this year the gentile vote swamped the mormon at the municipal elections and next year we trust that we shall be able to repeat our success in salt lake itself in that city the gentiles are only onethird of the total population but the mass of em are grown men capable of voting whereas the mormons are cluttered up with children i guess as soon as we have purely gentile officers in the township and the control of the policy of the city the mormons will have to back down considerable theyre bound to go before long my own notion is that its the older men who keep alive the opposition to the gentile and all his works the younger ones spite of all the elders tell em will mix with the gentile and read gentile books and you bet your sweet life theres a holy influence working toward conversion in the kiss of an average gentilespecially when the girl knows that he wont think it necessary for her salvation to load the house up with other womanfolk i guess the younger generation are giving sore trouble to the elders whats that you say about polygamy its a penal offence now under a bill passed not long ago the mormon has to elect one wife and keep to her if hes caught visiting any of the othersdo you see that cool and restful brown stone building way over there against the hillside thats the penitentiary he is sent there to consider his sins and he pays a fine too but most of the police in salt lake are mormons and i dont suppose they are too hard on their friends i presoom theres a good deal of polygamy practised on the sly but the chief trouble is to get the mormon to see that the gentile isnt the doublydamned beast that the elders represent only get the gentiles well into the state and the whole concern is bound to go to pieces in a very little time  and the wish being father to the thought why certainly said i and began to take in the valley of deseret the home of the latterday saints and the abode perhaps of as much misery as has ever been compressed into forty years the good folk at home will not understand but you will what follows you know how in bengal to this day the childwife is taught to curse her possible cowife ere yet she has gone to her husbands house and the bengali woman has been accustomed to polygamy for a few hundred years you know too the awful jealousy between mother wife and barren behind the purdahthe jealousy that culminates sometimes in the poisoning of the wellbeloved son now and again an englishwoman employs a highcaste mussulman nurse and in the offices of that hire women are apt to forget the differences of colour and to speak unreservedly as twin daughters under eves curse the nurse tells very strange and awful things she has and this the mormons count a privilege been born into polygamy but she loathes and detests it from the bottom of her jealous soul and to the lot of the bengali cowifethe cursed of the cursedthe daughter of the dunghillthe scaldhead and the barrenmute you know the rest of that sweet comminationserviceone creed of all the white creeds today deliberately introduces the white woman taken from centuries of training which have taught her that it is right to control the undivided heart of one man to quench her most natural rebellion that amazing creed and fantastic jumble of mahometanism the mosaical law and imperfectly comprehended fragments of freemasonry calls to its aid all the powers of a hell conceived and elaborated by coarseminded hedgers and ditchers a sweet view isnt it  all the beauty of the valley could not make me forget it but the valley is very fair bench after bench of land flat as a table against the flanks of the ringing hills marks where the salt lake rested for a while as it sunk from an inland sea to a lake fifty miles long and thirty broad before long the benches will be covered with houses at present these are hidden among the green trees on the dead flat of the valley you have read a hundred times how the streets of salt lake city are very broad furnished with rows of shade trees and gutters of fresh water this is true but i struck the town in a season of great drouththat same drouth which is playing havoc with the herds of montana the trees were limp and the rills of sparkling water that one reads about were represented by dusty paved courses main street appears to be inhabited by the commercial gentile who has made of it a busy bustling thoroughfare and in the eye of the sun swigs the ungodly lager and smokes the improper cigar all day long for which i like him at the head of main street stand the lions of the place the temple and the tabernacle the tithing house and the houses of brigham young whose portrait is on sale in most of the booksellers shops incidentally it may be mentioned that the late amir of utah does not unremotely resemble his highness the amir of afghanistan whom these fortunate eyes have seen and i have no desire to fall into the hands of the amir the first thing to be seen was of course the temple the outward exponent of a creed armed with a copy of the book of mormon for better comprehension i went to form rash opinions some day the temple will be finished it was begun only thirty years ago and up to date rather more than three million dollars and a half have been expended in its granite bulk the walls are ten feet thick the edifice itself is about a hundred feet high and its towers will be nearly two hundred and that is all there is of it unless you choose to inspect more closely always reading the book of mormon as you walk then the wondrous puerility of what i suppose we must call the design becomes apparent these men directly inspired from on high heaped stone on stone and pillar on pillar without achieving either dignity relief or interest there is over the main door some pitiful scratching in stone representing the allseeing eye the masonic grip the sun moon and stars and perhaps other skittles the flatness and meanness of the thing almost makes you weep when you look at the magnificent granite in blocks strewn abroad and think of the art that three million dollars might have called in to the aid of the church it is as though a child had said let us draw a great big fine housefiner than any house that ever wasand in that desire had laboriously smudged along with a ruler and pencil piling meaningless straight lines on compassdrawn curves with his tongue following every movement of the inept hand then sat i down on a wheelbarrow and read the book of mormon and behold the spirit of the book was the spirit of the stone before me the estimable joseph and hyrum smith struggling to create a new bible when they knew nothing of the history of old and new testament and the inspired architect muddling with his bricksthey were brothers but the book was more interesting than the building it is written and all the world has read how to joseph smith an angel came down from heaven with a pair of celestial giglamps whereby he was marvellously enabled to interpret certain plates of gold scribbled over with dots and scratches and discovered by him in the ground which plates joseph smith did translateonly he spelt the mysterious characters caractorsand out of the dots and scratches produced a volume of six hundred closely printed pages containing the books of nephi first and second jacob enos jarom omni mormon mosiah the record of zeniff the book of alma helaman the third of nephi the book of ether the whole thing is a powerful anæsthetic by the way and the final book of mononi three men of whom one i believe is now living bear solemn witness that the angel with the spectacles appeared unto them eight other men swear solemnly that they have seen the golden plates of the revelation and upon this testimony the book of mormon stands the mormon bible begins at the days of zedekiah king of judah and ends in a wild and weltering quagmire of tribal fights bits of revelation and wholesale cribs from the bible very sincerely did i sympathise with the inspired brothers as i waded through their joint production as a humble fellowworker in the field of fiction i knew what it was to get good names for ones characters but joseph and hyrum were harder bestead than ever i have been and bolder men to boot they created teancum and coriantumy pakhoran kishkumen and gadianton and other priceless names which the memory does not hold but of geography they wisely steered clear and were astutely vague as to the localities of places because you see they were by no means certain what lay in the next county to their own they marched and countermarched bloodthirsty armies across their pages and added new and amazing chapters to the records of the new testament and reorganised the heavens and the earth as it is always lawful to do in print but they could not achieve style and it was foolish of them to let into their weird mosaic pieces of the genuine bible whenever the labouring pen dropped from its toilsome parody to a sentence or two of vile bad english or downright penny dreadfulism and moses said unto the people of israel great scott what air you doing there is no sentence in the book of mormon word for word like the foregoing but the general tone is not widely different  there are the makings of a very fine creed about mormonism to begin with the church is rather more absolute than that of rome drop the polygamy plank in the platform but on the other hand deal lightly with certain forms of excess keep the quality of the recruits down to a low mental level and see that the best of the agricultural science available is in the hands of the elders and you have there a firstclass engine for pioneer work the tawdry mysticism and the borrowings from freemasonry serve the lowcaste swede and the dane the welshman and the cornish cottar just as well as a highly organised heaven  i went about the streets and peeped into peoples front windows and the decorations upon the tables were after the manner of the year 1850 main street was full of country folk from the outside come in to trade with the zion mercantile cooperative institute the church i fancy looks after the finances of this thing and it consequently pays good dividends the faces of the women were not lovely indeed but for the certainty that ugly persons are just as irrational in the matter of undivided love as the beautiful it seemed that polygamy was a blessed institution for the women and that only the spiritual power could drive the hulking boardfaced men into it the women wore hideous garments and the men seemed to be tied up with string they would market all that afternoon and on sunday go to the prayingplace i tried to talk to a few of them but they spoke strange tongues and stared and behaved like cows yet one woman and not an altogether ugly one confided to me that she hated the idea of salt lake city being turned into a showplace for the amusement of the gentile  if we ave our own institutions that aint no reason why people should come ere and stare at us his it  the dropped h betrayed her  and when did you leave england i said  summer of 84 i am from dorset she said the mormon agents was very good to us and we was very poor now were better offmy father an mother an me  then you like the state  she misunderstood at first oh i aint livin in the state of polygamy not me yet i aint married i like where i am ive got things o my ownand some land  but i suppose you will  not me i aint like them swedes an danes i aint got nothin to say for or against polygamy its the elders business an between you an me i dont think its going on much longer youll ear them in the ouse tomorrer talkin as if it was spreadin all over america the swedes they think it his i know it hisnt  but youve got your land all right  oh yes weve got our land an we never say aught against polygamy o coursefather an mother an me  it strikes me that there is a fraud somewhere youve never heard of the ricechristians have you  i should have liked to have spoken to the maiden at length but she dived into the zion coop and a man captured me saying that it was my bounden duty to see the sights of salt lake these comprised the eggshaped tabernacle the beehive and town houses of brigham young the same great ruffians tomb with assorted samples of his wives sleeping round him just as the eleven faithful ones sleep round the ashes of runjit singh outside fort lahore and one or two other curiosities but all these things have been described by abler pens than mine the animalhouses where brigham used to pack his wives are grubby villas the tabernacle is a shingled fraud and the tithing house where all the revenue returns seem to be made much resembles a stable the mormons have a paper currency of their ownecclesiastical banknotes which are exchanged for local produce but the little boys of the place prefer the bullion of the gentiles it is not pleasant to be taken round a township with your guide stopping before every third house to say thats where elder so and so kept amelia bathershins his fifth wifeno his third amelia she was took on after keziah but keziah was the elders pet an he didnt dare to let amelia come across keziah for fear of her spilin keziahs beauty the mussulmans are quite right the minute that all the domestic details of polygamy are discussed in the mouths of the people that institution is ready to fall i shook off my guide when he had told me his very last doubtful tale and went on alone an ordered peace and a perfection of quiet luxury is the note of the city of salt lake the houses stand in generous and wellgroomed grassplots none very much worse or better than their neighbours creepers grow over the house fronts and there is a very pleasant music of wind among the trees in the vast empty streets bringing a smell of hay and the flowers of summer  on a tableland overlooking all the city stands the united states garrison of infantry and artillery the state of utah can do nearly anything it pleases until that muchtobedesired hour when the gentile vote shall quietly swamp out mormonism but the garrison is kept there in case of accidents the big sharkmouthed pigeared heavyboned farmers sometimes take to their creed with wildest fanaticism and in past years have made life excessively unpleasant for the gentile when he was few in the land but today so far from killing openly or secretly or burning gentile farms it is all the mormon dares do to feebly try to boycott the interloper his journals preach defiance to the united states government and in the tabernacle of a sunday the preachers follow suit when i went down there the place was full of people who would have been much better for a washing a man rose up and told them that they were the chosen of god the elect of israel that they were to obey their priest and that there was a good time coming i fancy that they had heard all this before so many times it produced no impression whatever even as the sublimest mysteries of another faith lost salt through constant iteration they breathed heavily through their noses and stared straight in front of themimpassive as flatfish  and that evening i went up to the garrison postone of the most coveted of all the army commandsand overlooked the city of the saints as it lay in the circle of its forbidding hills you can speculate a good deal about the mass of human misery the loves frustrated the gentle hearts broken and the strong souls twisted from the law of life to a fiercer following of the law of death that the hills have seen how must it have been in the old days when the footsore emigrants broke through into the circle and knew that they were cut off from hope of return or sight of friendswere handed over to the power of the friends that called themselves priests of the most high but for the grace of god there goes richard baxter as the eminent divine once said it seemed good that fate did not order me to be a brick in the upbuilding of the mormon church that has so aptly established herself by the borders of a lake bitter salt and hopeless     no xxxiii  how i met certain people of importance between salt lake and omaha      much have i seen     cities and men   let there be no misunderstanding about the matter i love this people and if any contemptuous criticism has to be done i will do it myself my heart has gone out to them beyond all other peoples and for the life of me i cannot tell why they are bleedingraw at the edges almost more conceited than the english vulgar with a massive vulgarity which is as though the pyramids were coated with christmascake sugarworks cocksure they are lawless and as casual as they are cocksure but i love them and i realised it when i met an englishman who laughed at them he proved conclusively that they were all wrong from their tariff to their goasyouplease civil service and beneath the consideration of a true briton  i admit everything said i their governments provisional their laws the notion of the moment their railways are made of hairpins and matchsticks and most of their good luck lives in their woods and mines and rivers and not in their brains but for all that they be the biggest finest and best people on the surface of the globe just you wait a hundred years and see how theyll behave when theyve had the screw put on them and have forgotten a few of the patriarchal teachings of the late mister george washington wait till the angloamericangermanjewthe man of the futureis properly equipped hell have just the least little kink in his hair now and again hell carry the english lungs above the teuton feet that can walk for ever and he will wave long thin bony yankee hands with the big blue veins on the wrist from one end of the earth to the other hell be the finest writer poet and dramatist specially dramatist that the world as it recollects itself has ever seen by virtue of his jew bloodjust a little little drophell be a musician and a painter too at present there is too much balcony and too little romeo in the lifeplays of his fellowcitizens later on when the proportion is adjusted and he sees the possibilities of his land he will produce things that will make the effete east stare he will also be a complex and highly composite administrator there is nothing known to man that he will not be and his country will sway the world with one foot as a man tilts a seesaw plank  but this is worse than the eagle at its worst do you seriously believe all that said the englishman  if i believe anything seriously all this i most firmly believe you wait and see sixty million people chiefly of english instincts who are trained from youth to believe that nothing is impossible dont slink through the centuries like russian peasantry they are bound to leave their mark somewhere and dont you forget it  but isnt it sad to think that with all eternity behind and before us we cannot even though we would pay for it with sorrow filch from the immensities one hundred poor years of life wherein to watch the two great experiments a hundred years hence india and america will be worth observing at present the one is burned out and the other is only just stoking up when i left my opponent there was much need for faith because i fell into the hands of a perfectly delightful man whom i had met casually in the street sitting in a chair on the pavement smoking a huge cigar he was a commercial traveller and his beat lay through southern mexico and he told me tales of forgotten cities stone gods up to their sacred eyes in forest growth mexican priests rebellions and dictatorships that made my hair curl it was he who dragged me forth to bathe in salt lake which is some fifteen miles away from the city and reachable by many trains which are but open tramcars the track like all american tracks was terrifying in its roughness and the end of the journey disclosed the nakedness of the accommodation there were piers and band houses and refreshment stalls built over the solid grey levels of the lake but they only accentuated the utter barrenness of the place americans dont mix with their scenery as yet  and have faith said the commercial traveller as he walked into water heavy as quicksilver walk i walked and i walked till my legs flew up and i had to walk as one struggling with a high wind but still i rode head and shoulders above the water it was a horrible feeling this inability to sink swimming was not much use you couldnt get a grip of the water so i een sat me down and drifted like a luxurious anemone among the hundreds that were bathing in that place you could wallow for threequarters of an hour in that warm sticky brine and fear no evil consequences but when you came out you were coated with white salt from top to toe and if you accidentally swallowed a mouthful of the water you died this is true because i swallowed half a mouthful and was halfdead in consequence  the commercial traveller on our return journey across the level flats that fringe the lakes edge bade me note some of the customs of his people the great open railway car held about a hundred men and maidens coming up with a song from the sea they sang and they shouted and they exchanged witticisms of the most poignant and comported themselves like their brothers and sisters over the seasthe arries and arriets of the older world and there sat behind me two modest maidens in white alone and unattended to these the privileged youth of the cara youth of a marvellous range of voiceproffered undying affection they laughed but made no reply in words the suit was renewed and with extravagant imagery the nearest seats applauding when we arrived at the city the maidens turned and went their way up a dark treeshaded street and the boys elsewhere whereat recollecting what the london rough was like i marvelled that they did not pursue its all right said the commercial traveller if they had followedwell i guess some one would ha shot em the very next day on those very peaceful cars returning from the lake some one was shotdead he was what they call a sport which is american for a finished leg and he had an argument with a police officer and the latter slew him i saw his funeral go down the main street there were nearly thirty carriages filled with doubtful men and women not in the least doubtful and the local papers said that deceased had his merits but it didnt much matter because if the sheriff hadnt dropped him he would assuredly have dropped the sheriff somehow this jarred on my sensitive feelings and i went away though the commercial traveller would fain have entertained me in his own house he knowing not my name twice through the long hot nights we talked tilting up our chairs on the sidewalk of the future of america  you should hear the saga of the states reeled off by a young and enthusiastic citizen who had just carved out for himself a home filled it with a pretty little wife and is preparing to embark on commerce on his own account i was tempted to believe that pistolshots were regrettable accidents and lawlessness only the top scum on the great sea of humanity i am tempted to believe that still though baked and dusty utah is very many miles behind me  then chance threw me into the arms of another and very different commercial traveller as we pulled out of utah on our way to omaha via the rockies he travelled in biscuits of which more anon and fate had smitten him very heavily having at one stroke knocked all the beauty and joy out of his poor life so he journeyed with a case of samples as one dazed and his eyes took no pleasure in anything that he saw in his despair he had withdrawn himself to his religionhe was a baptistand spoke of its consolation with the artless freedom that an american generally exhibits when he is talking about his most sacred private affairs there was a desert beyond utah hot and barren as mian mir in may the sun baked the carroof and the dust caked the windows and through the dust and the glare the man with the biscuits bore witness to his creed which seems to include one of the greatest miracles in the worldthe immediate unforeseen selfconscious redemption of the soul by means very similar to those which turned paul to the straight path  you must experience religion he repeated his mouth twitching and his eyes blackringed with his recent loss you must experience religion you cant tell when youre goin to get or haow but it will comeit will come sir like a lightning stroke an you will wrestle with yourself before you receive full conviction and assurance  how long does that take i asked reverently  it may take hours it may take days i knew a man in san jo who lay under conviction for a month an then he got the sperritas you must git it  and then  and then you are saved you feel that an you kin endure anything he sighed yes anything i dont care what it is though i allow that some things are harder than others  then you have to wait for the miracle to be worked by powers outside yourself and if the miracle doesnt work  but it must i tell you it must it comes to all who profess with faith  i learned a good deal about that creed as the train fled on and i wondered as i learned it was a strange thing to watch that poor human soul broken and bowed by its loss nerving itself against each new pang of pain with the iterated assurance that it was safe against the pains of hell  the heat was stifling we quitted the desert and launched into the rolling green plains of colorado dozing uneasily with every removable rag removed i was roused by a blast of intense cold and the drumming of a hundred drums the train had stopped far as the eye could range the land was white under two feet of haileach hailstone as big as the top of a sherryglass i saw a young colt by the side of the track standing with his poor little fluffy back to the pitiless pelting he was pounded to death an old horse met his doom on the run he galloped wildly towards the train but his hind legs dropped into a hole half water and half ice he beat the ground with his forefeet for a minute and then rolling over on his side submitted quietly to be killed  when the storm ceased we picked our way cautiously and crippledly over a track that might give way at any moment the western driver urges his train much as does the subaltern the bounding pony and twould seem with an equal sense of responsibility if a foot does go wrong why there you are dont you know and if it is all right why all right it is dont you know but i would sooner be on the pony than the train  this seems a good place wherein to preach on american versatility when mr howells writes a novel when a reckless hero dams a flood by heaving a dynamiteshattered mountain into it or when a notorietyhunting preacher marries a couple in a balloon you shall hear the great american press rise on its hind legs and walk round mouthing over the versatility of the american citizen and he is versatilehorribly so the unlimited exercise of the right of private judgment which by the way is a weapon not one man in ten is competent to handle his blatant cocksureness and the dryairbred restlessness that makes him crawl all over the furniture when he is talking to you conspire to make him versatile but what he calls versatility the impartial bystander of angloindian extraction is apt to deem mere casualness and dangerous casualness at that no man can grasp the inwardness of an employ by the light of pure reasoneven though that reason be republican he must serve an apprenticeship to one craft and learn that craft all the days of his life if he wishes to excel therein otherwise he merely puts the thing through somehow and occasionally he doesnt but wherein lies the beauty of this form of mental suppleness old man california whom i shall love and respect always told me one or two anecdotes about american versatility and its consequences that came back to my mind with direful force as the train progressed we didnt upset but i dont think that that was the fault of the driver or the men who made the track take upyou can easily find themthe accounts of ten consecutive railway catastrophesnot little accidents but firstclass fatalities when the long cars turn over take fire and roast the luckless occupants alive to seven out of the ten you shall find appended the cheerful statement the accident is supposed to have been due to the rails spreading that means the metals were spiked down to the ties with such versatility that the spikes or the tracks drew under the constant vibration of the traffic and the metals opened out no one is hanged for these little affairs  we began to climb hills and then we stoppedat night in darkness while men threw sand under the wheels and crowbarred the track and then guessed that we might proceed not being in the least anxious to face my maker half asleep and rubbing my eyes i went forward to a common car and was rewarded by two hours conversation with the stranded brokendown husbandabandoned actress of a fourthrate stranded brokendown managerbereft company she was muzzy with beer reduced to her last dollar fearful that there would be no one to meet her at omaha and wept at intervals because she had given the conductor a fivedollar bill to change and he hadnt come back he was an irishman so i knew he couldnt steal and i addressed myself to the task of consolation i was rewarded after a decent interval by the history of a life so wild so mixed so desperately improbable and yet so simply probable and above all so quicknot fastin its kaleidoscopic changes that the pioneer would reject any summary of it and so you will never know how she the beery woman with the tangled blond hair was once a girl on a farm in faroff new jersey how he a travelling actor had wooed and won herbut paw he was always set against alfand how he and she embarked all their little capital on the word of a faithless manager who disbanded his company a hundred miles from nowhere and how she and alf and a third person who had not yet made any noise in the world had to walk the railwaytrack and beg from the farmhouses how that third person arrived and went away again with a wail and how alf took to the whisky and other things still more calculated to make a wife unhappy and how after barnstormings insults shootingscrapes and pitiful collapses of poor companies she had once won an encore it was not a cheerful tale to listen to there was a real actress in the pullmansuch an one as travels sumptuously with a maid and dressingcaseand my draggletail thought of appealing to her for help but broke down after several attempts to walk into the car jauntily as befitted a sister in the profession then the conductor reappearedthe fivedollar bill honestly changedand she wept by reason of beer and gratitude together and then fell asleep waveringly alone in the car and became almost beautiful and quite kissable while the man with the sorrow stood at the door between actress and actress and preached grim sermons on the certain end of each if they did not mend their ways and find regeneration through the miracle of the baptist creed yes we were a queer company going up to the rockies together i was the luckiest because when a breakdown occurred and we were delayed for twelve hours i ate all the baptists samplebiscuits they were various in composition but nourishing always travel with a drummer     no xxxiv  across the great divide and how the man gring showed me the garments of the ellewomen   after much dallying and more climbing we came to a pass like all the bolan passes in the world and the black cañon of the gunnison called they it we had been climbing for very many hours and attained a modest elevation of some seven or eight thousand feet above the sea when we entered a gorge remote from the sun where the rocks were two thousand feet sheer and where a rocksplintered river roared and howled ten feet below a track which seemed to have been built on the simple principle of dropping miscellaneous dirt into the river and pinning a few rails atop there was a glory and a wonder and a mystery about that mad ride which i felt keenly you will find it properly dressed up in the guidebooks until i had to offer prayers for the safety of the train there was no hope of seeing the track two hundred yards ahead we seemed to be running into the bowels of the earth at the invitation of an irresponsible stream then the solid rock would open and disclose a curve of awful twistfulness then the driver put on all steam and we would go round that curve on one wheel chiefly the gunnison river gnashing its teeth below the cars overhung the edge of the water and if a single one of the rails had chosen to spread nothing in the wide world could have saved us from drowning i knew we should damage something in the endthe sombre horrors of the gorge the rush of the jadegreen water below and the cheerful tales told by the conductor made me certain of the catastrophe  we had just cleared the black cañon and another gorge and were sailing out into open country nine thousand feet above the level of the sea when we came most suddenly round a corner upon a causeway across a waste waterhalf dam and half quarrypool the locomotive gave one wild hoo hoo hoo but it was too late he was a beautiful bull and goodness only knows why he had chosen the track for a constitutional with his wife she was flung to the left but the cowcatcher caught him and turning him round heaved him shoulder deep into the pool the expression of blank blind bewilderment on his bovine jovine face was wonderful to behold he was not angry i dont think he was even scared though he must have flown ten yards through the air all he wanted to know was will somebody have the goodness to tell a respectable old gentleman what in the world or out of it has occurred and five minutes later the stream that had been snapping at our heels in the gorges split itself into a dozen silver threads on a breezy upland and became an innocent trout beck and we halted at a halfdead city the name of which does not remain with me it had originally been built on the crest of a wave of prosperity once ten thousand people had walked its street but the boom had collapsed the great brick houses and the factories were empty the population lived in little timber shanties on the fringes of the deserted town there were some railway workshops and things and the hotel whose pavement formed the platform of the railway contained one hundred and more roomsempty the place in its halfinhabitedness was more desolate than amber or chitor but a man said troutsix poundstwo miles away and the sorrowful man and myself went in search of em the town was ringed by a circle of hills all alive with little thunderstorms that broke across the soft green of the plain in wisps and washes of smoke and amber  to our tiny party associated himself a lawyer from chicago we foregathered on the question of flies but i didnt expect to meet elijah pogram in the flesh he delivered orations on the future of england and america and of the great federation that the years will bring forth when america and england will belt the globe with their linked hands according to the notions of the british he made an ass of himself but for all his highfalutin he talked sense i might knock through england on a four months tour and not find a man capable of putting into words the passionate patriotism that possessed the little chicago lawyer and he was a man with points for he offered me three days shooting in illinois if i would step out of my path a little i might travel for ten years up and down england ere i found a man who would give a complete stranger so much as a sandwich and for twenty ere i squeezed as much enthusiasm out of a britisher he and i talked politics and troutflies all one sultry day as we wandered up and down the shallows of the stream aforesaid little fish are sweet i spent two hours whipping a ripple for a fish that i knew was there and in the pasturescented dusk caught a threepounder on a ragged old brown hackle and landed him after ten minutes excited argument he was a beauty if ever any man works the western troutstreams he would do well to bring out with him the dingiest flies he possesses the natives laugh at the tiny english hooks but they hold and duns and drabs and sober greys seem to tickle the æsthetic tastes of the trout for salmon but dont say that i told you use the spoongold on one side silver on the other it is as killing as is a similar article with fish of another calibre the natives seem to use much too coarse tackle  it was a search for a small boy who should know the river that revealed to me a new phase of lifeslack slovenly and shiftless but very interesting there was a family in a packingcase hut on the outskirts of the town they had seen the city when it was on the boom and made pretence of being the metropolis of the rockies and when the boom was over they did not go she was affable but deeply coated with dirt he was grim and grimy and the little children were simply caked with filth of various descriptions but they lived in a certain sort of squalid luxury six or eight of them in two rooms and they enjoyed the local society it was their eightyearold son whom i tried to take out with me but he had been catching trout all his life and guessed he didnt feel like coming though i proffered him six shillings for what ought to have been a days pleasuring ill stay with maw he said and from that attitude i could not move him maw didnt attempt to argue with him if he says he wont come he wont she said as though he were one of the elemental forces of nature instead of a spankable brat and paw lounging by the store refused to interfere maw told me that she had been a schoolteacher in her notsodistant youth but did not tell me what i was dying to knowhow she arrived at this mucky tenement at the back of beyond and why though preserving the prettinesses of her new england speech she had come to regard washing as a luxury paw chewed tobacco and spat from time to time yet when he opened his mouth for other purposes he spoke like a welleducated man there was a story there but i couldnt get at it  next day the man with the sorrow and myself and a few others began the real ascent of the rockies up to that time our climbing didnt count the train ran violently up a steep place and was taken to pieces five cars were hitched on to two locomotives and two cars to one locomotive this seemed to be a kind and thoughtful act but i was idiot enough to go forward and watch the couplingon of the two rear cars in which cæsar and his fortunes were to travel some one had lost or eaten the regularly ordained coupling and a man picked up from the tailboard of the engine a single iron link about as thick as a fetterlink watchchain and guessed it would do get hauled up a simla cliff by the hook of a ladys parasol if you wish to appreciate my sentiments when the cars moved uphill and the link drew tight miles away and two thousand feet above our heads rose the shoulder of a hill epauletted with the long line of a snowtunnel the first section of the cars crawled a quarter of a mile ahead of us the track snaked and looped behind and there was a black drop to the left so we went up and up and up till the thin air grew thinner and the chunkchunkchunk of the labouring locomotive was answered by the oppressed beating of the exhausted heart through the chequed light and shade of the snow tunnels horrible caverns of rude timbering we ground our way halting now and again to allow a downtrain to pass one monster of forty mineralcars slid past scarce held by four locomotives their brakes screaming and chortling in chorus and in the end after a glimpse at half america spread mapwise leagues below us we halted at the head of the longest snow tunnel of all on the crest of the divide between ten and eleven thousand feet above the level of the sea the locomotive wished to draw breath and the passengers to gather the flowers that nodded impertinently through the chinks of the boarding a lady passengers nose began to bleed and other ladies threw themselves down on the seats and gasped with the gasping train while a wind as keen as a knifeedge rioted down the grimy tunnel  then despatching a pilotengine to clear the way we began the downward portion of the journey with every available brake on and frequent shrieks till after some hours we reached the level plain and later the city of denver where the man with the sorrow went his way and left me to journey on to omaha alone after one hasty glance at denver the pulse of that town was too like the rushing mighty wind in the rocky mountain tunnel it made me tired because complete strangers desired me to do something to mines which were in mountains and to purchase building blocks upon inaccessible cliffs and once a woman urged that i should supply her with strong drinks i had almost forgotten that such attacks were possible in any land for the outward and visible signs of public morality in american towns are generally safeguarded for that i respect this people omaha nebraska was but a haltingplace on the road to chicago but it revealed to me horrors that i would not willingly have missed the city to casual investigation seemed to be populated entirely by germans poles slavs hungarians croats magyars and all the scum of the eastern european states but it must have been laid out by americans no other people would cut the traffic of a main street with two streams of railway lines each some eight or nine tracks wide and cheerfully drive tramcars across the metals every now and again they have horrible railwaycrossing accidents at omaha but nobody seems to think of building an overheadbridge that would interfere with the vested interests of the undertakers  be blessed to hear some details of one of that class  there was a shop the like of which i had never seen before its windows were filled with dresscoats for men and dresses for women but the studs of the shirts were made of stamped cloth upon the shirt front and there were no trousers to those coatsnothing but a sweep of cheap black cloth falling like an abbés frock in the doorway sat a young man reading pollocks course of time and by that i knew that he was an undertaker his name was gring which is a beautiful name and i talked to him on the mysteries of his craft he was an enthusiast and an artist i told him how corpses were burnt in india said he were vastly superior we holdthat is to say embalmour dead so whereupon he produced the horrible weapons of his trade and most practically showed me how you held a man back from that corruption which is his birthright and i wish i could live a few generations just to see how my people keep but im sure its all right nothing can touch em after ive embalmed em then he displayed one of those ghastly dresssuits and when i laid a shuddering hand upon it behold it crumpled to nothing for the white linen was sewn on to the black cloth andthere was no back to it that was the horror the garment was a shell we dress a man in that said gring laying it out tastily on the counter as you see here our caskets have a plateglass window in front oh me but that window in the coffin was fitted with plush like a broughamwindow and you dont see anything below the level of the mans waistcoat consequently  he unrolled the terrible cheap black cloth that falls down over the stark feet and i jumped back of course a man can be dressed in his own clothes if he likes but these are the regular things and for women look at this he took up the body of a highnecked dinnerdress in subdued lilac slashed and puffed and bedeviled with black but like the dresssuit backless and below the waist turning to shroud thats for an old maid but for young girls we give white with imitation pearls round the neck that looks very pretty through the window of the casketyou see theres a cushion for the headwith flowers banked all round can you imagine anything more awful than to take your last rest as much of a dead fraud as ever you were a living lieto go into the darkness one half of you shaved trimmed and dressed for an evening party while the other halfthe half that your friends cannot seeis enwrapped in a flapping black sheet  i know a little about burial customs in various places in the world and i tried hard to make mr gring comprehend dimly the awful heathendom that he was responsible forthe grotesqueriethe giggling horror of it all but he couldnt see it even when he showed me a little boys last suit he couldnt see it he said it was quite right to embalm and trick out and hypocritically bedizen the poor innocent dead in their superior cushioned and pillowed caskets with the window in front  bury me cased in canvas like a fishingrod in the deep sea burn me on a backwater of the hughli with damp wood and no oil pin me under a pullman car and let the lighted stove do its worst sizzle me with a fallen electric wire or whelm me in the sludge of a broken river dam but may i never go down to the pit grinning out of a plateglass window in a backless dresscoat and the front half of a black stuff dressinggown not though i were held against the ravage of the grave for ever and ever amen     no xxxv  how i struck chicago and how chicago struck me of religion politics and pigsticking and the incarnation of the city among shambles      i know thy cunning and thy greed     thy hard high lust and wilful deed     and all thy glory loves to tell     of specious gifts material   i have struck a citya real cityand they call it chicago the other places do not count san francisco was a pleasureresort as well as a city and salt lake was a phenomenon this place is the first american city i have encountered it holds rather more than a million people with bodies and stands on the same sort of soil as calcutta having seen it i urgently desire never to see it again it is inhabited by savages its water is the water of the hugli and its air is dirt also it says that it is the boss town of america  i do not believe that it has anything to do with this country they told me to go to the palmer house which is a gilded and mirrored rabbitwarren and there i found a huge hall of tessellated marble crammed with people talking about money and spitting about everywhere other barbarians charged in and out of this inferno with letters and telegrams in their hands and yet others shouted at each other a man who had drunk quite as much as was good for him told me that this was the finest hotel in the finest city on god almightys earth by the way when an american wishes to indicate the next county or state he says god amightys earth this prevents discussion and flatters his vanity  then i went out into the streets which are long and flat and without end and verily it is not a good thing to live in the east for any length of time your ideas grow to clash with those held by every rightthinking white man i looked down interminable vistas flanked with nine ten and fifteen storied houses and crowded with men and women and the show impressed me with a great horror except in londonand i have forgotten what london is likei had never seen so many white people together and never such a collection of miserables there was no colour in the street and no beautyonly a maze of wireropes overhead and dirty stone flagging underfoot a cabdriver volunteered to show me the glory of the town for so much an hour and with him i wandered far he conceived that all this turmoil and squash was a thing to be reverently admired that it was good to huddle men together in fifteen layers one atop of the other and to dig holes in the ground for offices he said that chicago was a live town and that all the creatures hurrying by me were engaged in business that is to say they were trying to make some money that they might not die through lack of food to put into their bellies he took me to canals black as ink and filled with untold abominations and bade me watch the stream of traffic across the bridges he then took me into a saloon and while i drank made me note that the floor was covered with coins sunk into cement a hottentot would not have been guilty of this sort of barbarism the coins made an effect pretty enough but the man who put them there had no thought to beauty and therefore he was a savage then my cabdriver showed me businessblocks gay with signs and studded with fantastic and absurd advertisements of goods and looking down the long street so adorned it was as though each vender stood at his door howling for the sake of money employ or buy of me and me only have you ever seen a crowd at our famine relief distributions you know then how men leap into the air stretching out their arms above the crowd in the hope of being seen while the women dolorously slap the stomachs of their children and whimper i had sooner watch faminerelief than the white man engaged in what he calls legitimate competition the one i understand the other makes me ill and the cabman said that these things were the proof of progress and by that i knew he had been reading his newspaper as every intelligent american should the papers tell their readers in language fitted to their comprehension that the snarling together of telegraph wires the heaving up of houses and the making of money is progress  i spent ten hours in that huge wilderness wandering through scores of miles of these terrible streets and jostling some few hundred thousand of these terrible people who talked money through their noses the cabman left me but after a while i picked up another man who was full of figures and into my ears he poured them as occasion required or the big blank factories suggested here they turned out so many hundred thousand dollars worth of such and such an article there so many million other things this house was worth so many million dollars that one so many million more or less it was like listening to a child babbling of its hoard of shells it was like watching a fool playing with buttons but i was expected to do more than listen or watch he demanded that i should admire and the utmost that i could say was are these things so then i am very sorry for you that made him angry and he said that insular envy made me unresponsive so you see i could not make him understand  about four and a half hours after adam was turned out of the garden of eden he felt hungry and so bidding eve take care that her head was not broken by the descending fruit shinned up a cocoanut palm that hurt his legs cut his breast and made him breathe heavily and eve was tormented with fear lest her lord should miss his footing and so bring the tragedy of this world to an end ere the curtain had fairly risen had i met adam then i should have been sorry for him today i find eleven hundred thousand of his sons just as far advanced as their father in the art of getting food and immeasurably inferior to him in that they think that their palmtrees lead straight to the skies consequently i am sorry in rather more than a million different ways in our east bread comes naturally even to the poorest by a little scratching or the gift of a friend not quite so poor in less favoured countries one is apt to forget then i went to bed and that was on a saturday night  sunday brought me the queerest experience of alla revelation of barbarism complete i found a place that was officially described as a church it was a circus really but that the worshippers did not know there were flowers all about the building which was fitted up with plush and stained oak and much luxury including twisted brass candlesticks of severest gothic design to these things and a congregation of savages entered suddenly a wonderful man completely in the confidence of their god whom he treated colloquially and exploited very much as a newspaper reporter would exploit a foreign potentate but unlike the newspaper reporter he never allowed his listeners to forget that he and not he was the centre of attraction with a voice of silver and with imagery borrowed from the auctionroom he built up for his hearers a heaven on the lines of the palmer house but with all the gilding real gold and all the plateglass diamond and set in the centre of it a loudvoiced argumentative and very shrewd creation that he called god one sentence at this point caught my delighted ear it was apropos of some question of the judgment day and ran no i tell you god doesnt do business that way he was giving them a deity whom they could comprehend in a gold and jewel heaven in which they could take a natural interest he interlarded his performance with the slang of the streets the counter and the exchange and he said that religion ought to enter into daily life consequently i presume he introduced it as daily lifehis own and the life of his friends  then i escaped before the blessing desiring no benediction at such hands but the persons who listened seemed to enjoy themselves and i understood that i had met with a popular preacher later on when i had perused the sermons of a gentleman called talmage and some others i perceived that i had been listening to a very mild specimen yet that man with his brutal gold and silver idols his handsinpocket cigarinmouth and hatonthebackofthehead style of dealing with the sacred vessels would count himself spiritually quite competent to send a mission to convert the indians all that sunday i listened to people who said that the mere fact of spiking down strips of iron to wood and getting a steam and iron thing to run along them was progress that the telephone was progress and the network of wires overhead was progress they repeated their statements again and again one of them took me to their city hall and board of trade works and pointed it out with pride it was very ugly but very big and the streets in front of it were narrow and unclean when i saw the faces of the men who did business in that building i felt that there had been a mistake in their billeting  by the way tis a consolation to feel that i am not writing to an english audience then should i have to fall into feigned ecstasies over the marvellous progress of chicago since the days of the great fire to allude casually to the raising of the entire city so many feet above the level of the lake which it faces and generally to grovel before the golden calf but you who are desperately poor and therefore by these standards of no account know things and will understand when i write that they have managed to get a million of men together on flat land and that the bulk of these men appear to be lower than mahajans and not so companionable as a punjabi jat after harvest but i dont think it was the blind hurry of the people their argot and their grand ignorance of things beyond their immediate interests that displeased me so much as a study of the daily papers of chicago imprimis there was some sort of dispute between new york and chicago as to which town should give an exhibition of products to be hereafter holden and through the medium of their more dignified journals the two cities were yahooing and hiyiing at each other like opposition newsboys they called it humour but it sounded like something quite different that was only the first trouble the second lay in the tone of the productions leading articles which include gems such as back of such and such a place or we noticed tuesday such an event or dont for does not are things to be accepted with thankfulness all that made me want to cry was that in these papers were faithfully reproduced all the warcries and backtalk of the palmer house bar the slang of the barbers shops the mental elevation and integrity of the pullmancar porter the dignity of the dime museum and the accuracy of the excited fishwife i am sternly forbidden to believe that the paper educates the public then i am compelled to believe that the public educate the paper  just when the sense of unreality and oppression were strongest upon me and when i most wanted help a man sat at my side and began to talk what he called politics i had chanced to pay about six shillings for a travellingcap worth eighteen pence and he made of the fact a text for a sermon he said that this was a rich country and that the people liked to pay two hundred per cent on the value of a thing they could afford it he said that the government imposed a protective duty of from ten to seventy per cent on foreignmade articles and that the american manufacturer consequently could sell his goods for a healthy sum thus an imported hat would with duty cost two guineas the american manufacturer would make a hat for seventeen shillings and sell it for one pound fifteen in these things he said lay the greatness of america and the effeteness of england competition between factory and factory kept the prices down to decent limits but i was never to forget that this people were a rich people not like the pauper continentals and that they enjoyed paying duties to my weak intellect this seemed rather like juggling with counters everything that i have yet purchased costs about twice as much as it would in england and when nativemade is of inferior quality moreover since these lines were first thought of i have visited a gentleman who owned a factory which used to produce things he owned the factory still not a man was in it but he was drawing a handsome income from a syndicate of firms for keeping it closed in order that it might not produce things this man said that if protection were abandoned a tide of pauper labour would flood the country and as i looked at his factory i thought how entirely better it was to have no labour of any kind whatever rather than face so horrible a future meantime do you remember that this peculiar country enjoys paying money for value not received i am an alien and for the life of me cannot see why six shillings should be paid for eighteenpenny caps or eight shillings for halfcrown cigarcases when the country fills up to a decently populated level a few million people who are not aliens will be smitten with the same sort of blindness  but my friends assertion somehow thoroughly suited the grotesque ferocity of chicago see now and judge in the village of isser jang on the road to montgomery there be four changar women who winnow cornsome seventy bushels a year beyond their hut lives puran dass the moneylender who on good security lends as much as five thousand rupees in a year jowala singh the lohar mends the village ploughssome thirty broken at the share in three hundred and sixtyfive days and hukm chund who is letterwriter and head of the little club under the travellers tree generally keeps the village posted in such gossip as the barber and the midwife have not yet made public property chicago husks and winnows her wheat by the million bushels a hundred banks lend hundreds of millions of dollars in the year and scores of factories turn out plough gear and machinery by steam scores of daily papers do work which hukm chund and the barber and the midwife perform with due regard for public opinion in the village of isser jang so far as manufactures go the difference between chicago on the lake and isser jang on the montgomery road is one of degree only and not of kind as far as the understanding of the uses of life goes isser jang for all its seasonal cholera has the advantage over chicago jowala singh knows and takes care to avoid the three or four ghoulhaunted fields on the outskirts of the village but he is not urged by millions of devils to run about all day in the sun and swear that his ploughshares are the best in the punjab nor does puran dass fly forth in a cart more than once or twice a year and he knows on a pinch how to use the railway and the telegraph as well as any son of israel in chicago but this is absurd the east is not the west and these men must continue to deal with the machinery of life and to call it progress their very preachers dare not rebuke them they gloss over the hunting for money and the twicesharpened bitterness of adams curse by saying that such things dower a man with a larger range of thoughts and higher aspirations they do not say free yourself from your own slavery but rather if you can possibly manage it do not set quite so much store on the things of this world and they do not know what the things of this world are  i went off to see cattle killed by way of clearing my head which as you will perceive was getting muddled they say every englishman goes to the chicago stockyards you shall find them about six miles from the city and once having seen them will never forget the sight as far as the eye can reach stretches a township of cattlepens cunningly divided into blocks so that the animals of any pen can be speedily driven out close to an inclined timber path which leads to an elevated covered way straddling high above the pens these viaducts are twostoried on the upper storey tramp the doomed cattle stolidly for the most part on the lower with a scuffling of sharp hooves and multitudinous yells run the pigs the same end is appointed for each thus you will see the gangs of cattle waiting their turnas they wait sometimes for days and they need not be distressed by the sight of their fellows running about in the fear of death all they know is that a man on horseback causes their nextdoor neighbours to move by means of a whip certain bars and fences are unshipped and behold that crowd have gone up the mouth of a sloping tunnel and return no more it is different with the pigs they shriek back the news of the exodus to their friends and a hundred pens skirl responsive it was to the pigs i first addressed myself selecting a viaduct which was full of them as i could hear though i could not see i marked a sombre building whereto it ran and went there not unalarmed by stray cattle who had managed to escape from their proper quarters a pleasant smell of brine warned me of what was coming i entered the factory and found it full of pork in barrels and on another storey more pork unbarrelled and in a huge room the halves of swine for whose use great lumps of ice were being pitched in at the window that room was the mortuary chamber where the pigs lie for a little while in state ere they begin their progress through such passages as kings may sometimes travel turning a corner and not noting an overhead arrangement of greased rail wheel and pulley i ran into the arms of four eviscerated carcasses all pure white and of a human aspect being pushed by a man clad in vehement red when i leaped aside the floor was slippery under me there was a flavour of farmyard in my nostrils and the shouting of a multitude in my ears but there was no joy in that shouting twelve men stood in two linessix aside between them and overhead ran the railway of death that had nearly shunted me through the window each man carried a knife the sleeves of his shirt were cut off at the elbows and from bosom to heel he was bloodred the atmosphere was stifling as a night in the rains by reason of the steam and the crowd i climbed to the beginning of things and perched upon a narrow beam overlooked very nearly all the pigs ever bred in wisconsin they had just been shot out of the mouth of the viaduct and huddled together in a large pen thence they were flicked persuasively a few at a time into a smaller chamber and there a man fixed tackle on their hinder legs so that they rose in the air suspended from the railway of death oh it was then they shrieked and called on their mothers and made promises of amendment till the tackleman punted them in their backs and they slid head down into a brickfloored passage very like a big kitchen sink that was bloodred there awaited them a red man with a knife which he passed jauntily through their throats and the fullvoiced shriek became a sputter and then a fall as of heavy tropical rain the red man who was backed against the passage wall stood clear of the wildly kicking hoofs and passed his hand over his eyes not from any feeling of compassion but because the spurted blood was in his eyes and he had barely time to stick the next arrival then that first stuck swine dropped still kicking into a great vat of boiling water and spoke no more words but wallowed in obedience to some unseen machinery and presently came forth at the lower end of the vat and was heaved on the blades of a blunt paddlewheelthing which said hough hough hough and skelped all the hair off him except what little a couple of men with knives could remove then he was again hitched by the heels to that said railway and passed down the line of the twelve meneach man with a knifeleaving with each man a certain amount of his individuality which was taken away in a wheelbarrow and when he reached the last man he was very beautiful to behold but immensely unstuffed and limp preponderance of individuality was ever a bar to foreign travel that pig could have been in no case to visit you in india had he not parted with some of his most cherished notions  the dissecting part impressed me not so much as the slaying they were so excessively alive these pigs and then they were so excessively dead and the man in the dripping clammy hot passage did not seem to care and ere the blood of such an one had ceased to foam on the floor such another and four friends with him had shrieked and died but a pig is only the unclean animalforbidden by the prophet  i was destined to make rather a queer discovery when i went over to the cattleslaughter all the buildings here were on a much larger scale and there was no sound of trouble but i could smell the salt reek of blood before i set foot in the place the cattle did not come directly through the viaduct as the pigs had done they debouched into a yard by the hundred and they were big red brutes carrying much flesh in the centre of that yard stood a red texan steer with a headstall on his wicked head no man controlled him he was so to speak picking his teeth and whistling in an open byre of his own when the cattle arrived as soon as the first one had fearfully quitted the viaduct this red devil put his hands in his pockets and slouched across the yard no man guiding him then he lowed something to the effect that he was the regularly appointed guide of the establishment and would show them round they were country folk but they knew how to behave and so followed judas some hundred strong patiently and with a look of bland wonder in their faces i saw his broad back jogging in advance of them up a limewashed incline where i was forbidden to follow then a door shut and in a minute back came judas with the air of a virtuous ploughbullock and took up his place in his byre somebody laughed across the yard but i heard no sound of cattle from the big brick building into which the mob had disappeared only judas chewed the cud with a malignant satisfaction and so i knew there was trouble and ran round to the front of the factory and so entered and stood aghast  who takes count of the prejudices which we absorb through the skin by way of our surroundings it was not the spectacle that impressed me the first thought that almost spoke itself aloud was they are killing kine and it was a shock the pigs were nobodys concern but cattlethe brothers of the cow the sacred cowwere quite otherwise the next time an mp tells me that india either sultanises or brahminises a man i shall believe about half what he says it is unpleasant to watch the slaughter of cattle when one has laughed at the notion for a few years i could not see actually what was done in the first instance because the row of stalls in which they lay was separated from me by fifty impassable feet of butchers and slung carcasses all i know is that men swung open the doors of a stall as occasion required and there lay two steers already stunned and breathing heavily these two they poleaxed and half raising them by tackle they cut their throats two men skinned each carcase somebody cut off the head and in half a minute more the overhead rail carried two sides of beef to their appointed place there was clamour enough in the operating room but from the waiting cattle invisible on the other side of the line of pens never a sound they went to their death trusting judas without a word they were slain at the rate of five a minute and if the pig men were spattered with blood the cow butchers were bathed in it the blood ran in muttering gutters there was no place for hand or foot that was not coated with thicknesses of dried blood and the stench of it in the nostrils bred fear  and then the same merciful providence that has showered good things on my path throughout sent me an embodiment of the city of chicago so that i might remember it forever women come sometimes to see the slaughter as they would come to see the slaughter of men and there entered that vermilion hall a young woman of large mould with brilliantly scarlet lips and heavy eyebrows and dark hair that came in a widows peak on the forehead she was well and healthy and alive and she was dressed in flaming red and black and her feet know you that the feet of american women are like unto the feet of fairies her feet i say were cased in red leather shoes she stood in a patch of sunlight the red blood under her shoes the vivid carcasses packed round her a bullock bleeding its life away not six feet away from her and the death factory roaring all round her she looked curiously with hard bold eyes and was not ashamed  then said i this is a special sending i have seen the city of chicago and i went away to get peace and rest     no xxxvi  how i found peace at musquash on the monongahela      prince blown by many a western breeze     our vessels greet you treasureladen     we send them allbut best of these     a free and frank young yankee maiden   it is a mean thing and an unhandsome to do a continent in fivehundredmile jumps but after those swine and bullocks at chicago i felt that complete change of air would be good the united states at present hinge in or about chicago as a doubleleaved screen hinges to be sure the tiny new england states call a trip to pennsylvania going west but the largerminded citizen seems to reckon his longitude from chicago twenty years hence the centre of populationthat shaded square on the census mapwill have shifted men say far west of chicago twenty years later it will be on the pacific slope twenty years after that america will begin to crowd up and there will be some trouble people will demand manufactured goods for their reducedestablishment households at the cheapest possible rates and the cry that the land is rich enough to afford protection will cease with a great abruptness at present it is the farmer who pays most dearly for the luxury of high prices in the old days when the land was fresh and there was plenty of it and it cropped like the garden of eden he did not mind paying now there is not so much free land and the old acres are needing stimulants which cost money and the farmer who pays for everything is beginning to ask questions also the great american nation which individually never shuts a door behind its noble self very seldom attempts to put back anything that it has taken from natures shelves it grabs all it can and moves on but the movingon is nearly finished and the grabbing must stop and then the federal government will have to establish a woods and forests department the like of which was never seen in the world before and all the people who have been accustomed to hack mangle and burn timber as they please will object with shots and protestations to this infringement of their rights the nigger will breed bounteously and he will have to be reckoned with and the manufacturer will have to be contented with smaller profits and he will have to be reckoned with and the railways will no longer rule the countries through which they run and they will have to be reckoned with and nobody will approve of it in the least  yes it will be a spectacle for all the world to watch this big slashing colt of a nation that has got off with a flying start on a freshly littered course being pulled back to the ruck by that very muttonfisted jockey necessity there will be excitement in america when a few score millions of sovereigns discover that what they considered the outcome of their own government is but the rapidly diminishing bounty of nature and that if they want to get on comfortably they must tackle every single problem from labour to finance humbly without gasconade and afresh but at present they look that all the tomorrows shall be as today and if you argue with them they say that the democratic idea will keep things going they believe in that idea and the less wellinformed fortify themselves in their belief by curious assertions as to the despotism that exists in england this is pure provincialism of course but it is very funny to listen to especially when you compare the theory with the practice pistol chiefly as proven in the newspapers i have striven to find out where the central authority of the land lies it isnt at washington because the federal government cant do anything to the states save run the mail and collect a federal tax or two it isnt in the states because the townships can do as they like and it isnt in the townships because these are bossed by alien voters or rings of patriotic homebred citizens and it certainly is not in the citizens because they are governed and coerced by despotic power of public opinion as represented by their papers preachers or local society i found one man who told me that if anything went wrong in this huge congress of kingsif there was a split or an upheaval or a smashthe people in detail would be subject to the idea of the sovereign people in mass this is a survival from the civil war when you remember the people in a majority did with guns and swords slay and wound the people in detail all the same the notion seems very much like the worship by the savage of the unloaded rifle as it leans against the wall  but the men and women set us an example in patriotism they believe in their land and its future and its honour and its glory and they are not ashamed to say so from the largest to the least runs this same proud passionate conviction to which i take off my hat and for which i love them an average english householder seems to regard his country as an abstraction to supply him with policemen and firebrigades the cockney cad cannot understand what the word means the bloomin toffs he knows and the law and the soldiers that supply him with a spectacle in the parks but he would laugh in your face at the notion of any duty being owed by himself to his land pick an american of the second generation anywhere you pleasefrom the cabrank the porters room or the ploughtailspecially the ploughtailand that man will make you understand in five minutes that he understands what manner of thing his republic is he might laugh at a law that didnt suit his convenience draw your eyeteeth in a bargain and applaud cuteness on the outer verge of swindling but you should hear him stand up and sing      my country tis of thee     sweet land of liberty     of thee i sing  i have heard a few thousand of them engaged in that employment i respect him there is too much romeo and too little balcony about our national anthem with the american article it is all balcony there must be born a poet who shall give the english the song of their own own countrywhich is to say of about half the world remains then only to compose the greatest song of allthe saga of the anglosaxon all round the eartha pæan that shall combine the terrible slow swing of the battle hymn of the republic which if you know not get chanted to you with britannia needs no bulwarks the skirl of the british grenadiers with that perfect quickstep marching through georgia and at the end the wail of the dead march for we even we who share the earth between us as no gods have ever shared it we also are mortal in the matter of our single selves will any one take the contract  it was with these rambling notions that i arrived at the infinite peace of the tiny township of musquash on the monongahela river the clang and tumult of chicago belonged to another world imagine a rolling wooded english landscape under softest of blue skies dotted at threemile intervals with fat little quiet little villages or aggressive little manufacturing towns that the trees and the folds of the hills mercifully prevented from betraying their presence the goldenrod blazed in the pastures against the green of the mulleins and the cows picked their way home through the twisted paths between the blackberry bushes all summer was on the orchards and the applessuch apples as we dream of when we eat the woolly imitations of kashmirwere ripe and toothsome it was good to lie in a hammock with halfshut eyes and in the utter stillness to hear the apples dropping from the trees and the tinkle of the cowbells as the cows walked statelily down the main road of the village everybody in that restful place seemed to have just as much as he wanted a house with all comfortable appliances a big or little verandah wherein to spend the day a neatly shaved garden with a wild wealth of flowers some cows and an orchard everybody knew everybody else intimately and what they did not know the local daily papera daily for a village of twelve hundred peoplesupplied there was a courthouse where justice was done and a jail where some most enviable prisoners lived and there were four or five churches of four or five denominations also it was impossible to buy openly any liquor in that little paradise butand this is a very serious butyou could by procuring a medical certificate get strong drinks from the chemist that is the drawback of prohibition it makes a man who wants a drink a shirker and a contriver which things are not good for the soul of a man and presently specially if he be young causes him to believe that he may just as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb and the end of that young man is not pretty nothing except a rattling fall will persuade an average colt that a fence is not meant to be jumped over whereas if he be turned out into the open he learns to carry himself with discretion one heard a good deal of this same dread of drink in musquash and even the maidens seemed to know too much about its effects upon certain unregenerate youths who if they had been once made thoroughly effectually and persistently drunkwith a tepid brandy and soda thrust before their goosefleshed noses on the terrible next morningwould perhaps have seen the futility of their ways it was a sin by village canons to imbibe lager thoughexperto credeyou can get dropsy on that stuff long before you can get drunk but what man knows his mind besides it was all their own affair  the little community seemed to be as selfcontained as an indian village had the rest of the land sunk under the sea musquash would have gone on sending its sons to school in order to make them good citizens which is the constant prayer of the true american father settling its own roadmaking local cesses townlot arbitrations and internal government by ballot and vote and due respect to the voices of the headmen which is the salvation of the ballot until such time as all should take their places in the cemetery appointed for their faith here were americans and no aliensmen ruling themselves by themselves and for themselves and their wives and their childrenin peace order and decency  but what went straightest to this heart though they did not know it was that they were methody folk for the most partay methody as ever trod a yorkshire moor or drove on a sunday to some chapel of the faith in the dales the old methody talk was there with the discipline whereby the souls of the just are sometimes to their intense vexation made perfect on this earth in order that they may take out their letters and live and die in good standing if you dont know the talk you wont know what that means the discipline or discipline is no thing to be trifled with and its working among a congregation depends entirely upon the tact humanity and sympathy of the leader who works it he knowing what youths desires are can turn the soul in the direction of good gently instead of wrenching it savagely towards the right path only to see it break away quivering and scared the arm of the discipline is long a maiden told me as a new and strange fact and one that would interest a foreigner of a friend of hers who had once been admonished by some elders somewherenot in musquashfor the heinous crime of dancing she the friend did not in the least like it she would not cant you imagine the delightful results of a formal wigging administered by a youngish and austere elder who was not accustomed to make allowances for the natural dancing instincts of the young of the human animal the hot irons that are held forth to scare may also sear as those who have ever lain under an unfortunate exposition of the old faith can attest  but it was all immensely interestingthe absolutely fresh wholesome sweet life that paid due reverence to the things of the next world but took good care to get enough tennis in the cool of the evening that concerned itself as honestly and thoroughly with the daily round the trivial task and that same task is anything but trivial when you are helped by an american help as with the salvation of the soul i had the honour of meeting in the flesh even as miss louisa alcott drew them meg and joe and beth and amy whom you ought to know there was no affectation of concealment in their lives who had nothing to conceal there were many little women in that place because even as is the case in england the boys had gone out to seek their fortunes some were working in the thundering clanging cities others had removed to the infinite west and others had disappeared in the languid lazy south and the maidens waited their return which is the custom of maidens all over the world then the boys would come back in the soft sunlight attired in careful raiment their tongues cleansed of evil words and discourtesy they had just come to callbless their carefully groomed heads so they hadand the maidens in white dresses glimmered like ghosts on the stoop and received them according to their merits mamma had nothing to do with this nor papa either for he was downtown trying to drive reason into the head of a land surveyor and all along the shaded lazy intimate street you heard the gardengates click and clash as the mood of the man varied and bursts of pleasant laughter where three or fourbe sure the white muslins were among themdiscussed a picnic past or a buggydrive to come then the couples went their ways and talked together till the young men had to go at last on account of the trains and all trooped joyously down to the station and thought no harm of it and indeed why should they from her fifteenth year the american maiden moves among the boys as a sister among brothers they are her servants to take her out ridingwhich is drivingto give her flowers and candy the last two items are expensive and this is good for the young man as teaching him to value friendship that costs a little in cash and may necessitate economy on the cigar side as to the maiden she is taught to respect herself that her fate is in her own hands and that she is the more stringently bound by the very measure of the liberty so freely accorded to her wherefore in her own language she has a lovely time with about two or three hundred boys who have sisters of their own and a very accurate perception that if they were unworthy of their trust a syndicate of other boys would probably pass them into a world where there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage and so time goes till the maiden knows the other side of the houseknows that a man is not a demigod nor a mysteriously veiled monster but an average egotistical vain gluttonous but on the whole companionable sort of person to be soothed fed and managedknowledge that does not come to her sister in england till after a few years of matrimony and then she makes her choice the golden light touches eyes that are full of comprehension but the light is golden none the less for she makes just the same sweet irrational choices that an english girl does with this advantage she knows a little more has experience in entertaining insight into the businesses employ and hobbies of men gathered from countless talks with the boys and talks with the other girls who find time at those mysterious conclaves to discuss what tom ted stuke or jack have been doing thus it happens that she is a companion in the fullest sense of the word of the man she weds zealous for the interest of the firm to be consulted in time of stress and to be called upon for help and sympathy in time of danger pleasant it is that one heart should beat for you but it is better when the head above that heart has been thinking hard on your behalf and when the lips that are also very pleasant to kiss give wise counsel  when the american maideni speak now for the rank and file of that noble armyis once married why it is finished she has had her lovely time it may have been five seven or ten years according to circumstances she abdicates promptly with startling speed and her place knows her no more except as with her husband the queen is dead or looking after the house this same household work seems to be the thing that ages the american woman she is infamously helped by the irish trollop and the negress alike it is not fair upon her because she has to do three parts of the housework herself and in dry nervestraining air the chores are a burden be thankful o my people for mauz baksh kadir baksh and the ayah while they are with you they are twice as handy as the unkempt slatterns of the furnished apartments to which you will return commissioners though you be and five times as clever as the amelia araminta rebellia secessia jackson coloured under whose ineptitude and insolence the young american housewife groans but all this is far enough from peaceful placid musquash and its boundless cordiality its simple genuine hospitality and itswhats the french word that just covers allgragracieuseness isnt it oh be good to an american wherever you meet him put him up for the club and he will hold you listening till three in the morning give him the best tent and the gramfed mutton i have incurred a debt of salt that i can never repay but do you return it piecemeal to any of that nation and the account will be on my head till our paths in the world cross again he drinks iced water just as we do but he doesnt quite like our cigars  and how shall i finish the tale would it interest you to learn of the picnics in the hot still woods that overhang the monongahela when those idiotic american buggies that cant turn round got stuck among the brambles and all but capsized of boating in the blazing sun on the river that but a little time before had cast at the feet of the horrified village the corpses of the johnstown tragedy i saw one only one remnant of that terrible wreck he had been a minister house church congregation wife and children had been swept away from him in one night of terror he had no employment he could have employed himself at nothing but god had been very good to him he sat in the sun and smiled a little weakly it was in his poor blurred mind that something had happenedhe was not sure what it was but undoubtedly something had occurred one could only pray that the light would never return  but there be many pictures on my mind of a huge manufacturing city of three hundred thousand souls lighted and warmed by natural gas so that the great valley full of flaming furnaces sent up no smoke wreaths to the clear sky of musquash itself lighted by the same mysterious agency flares of gas eight feet long roaring day and night at the corners of the grassgrown streets because it wasnt worth while to turn them out of fleets of coalflats being hauled down the river on an interminable journey to st louis of factories nestling in woods where all the axehandles and shovels in the world seemed to be manufactured daily and last of that quaint forgotten german community the brotherhood of perpetual separation who founded themselves when the state was yet young and land cheap and are now dying out because they will neither marry nor give in marriage and their recruits are very few the advance in the value of land has almost smothered these poor old people in a golden affluence that they never desired they live in a little village where the houses are built old dutch fashion with their front doors away from the road and cobbled paths all about the cloistered peace of musquash is a metropolitan riot beside the hush of that village and there is too a lovetale tucked away among the flowers it has taken seventy years in the telling for the brother and sister loved each other well but they loved their duty to the brotherhood more so they have lived and still do live seeing each other daily and separated for all time any trouble that might have been is altogether wiped out of their faces which are as calm as those of very little children to the uninitiated those constant ones resemble extremely old people in garments of absurd cut but they love each other and that seems to bring one back quite naturally to the girls and the boys in musquash the boys were nice boysgraduates of yale of course you mustnt mention harvard herebut none the less skilled in business in stocks and shares the boring for oil and the sale of everything that can be sold by one sinner to another skilled too in baseball bigshouldered with straight eyes and square chinsbut not above occasional diversion and mild orgies they will make good citizens and possess the earth and eventually wed one of the nice white muslin dresses there are worse things in this world than being one of the boys in musquash     no xxxvii  an interview with mark twain   you are a contemptible lot over yonder some of you are commissioners and some lieutenantgovernors and some have the v c and a few are privileged to walk about the mall arm in arm with the viceroy but i have seen mark twain this golden morning have shaken his hand and smoked a cigarno two cigarswith him and talked with him for more than two hours understand clearly that i do not despise you indeed i dont i am only very sorry for you from the viceroy downward to soothe your envy and to prove that i still regard you as my equals i will tell you all about it  they said in buffalo that he was in hartford conn and again they said perchance he is gone upon a journey to portland and a big fat drummer vowed that he knew the great man intimately and that mark was spending the summer in europewhich information so upset me that i embarked upon the wrong train and was incontinently turned out by the conductor threequarters of a mile from the station amid the wilderness of railway tracks have you ever encumbered with greatcoat and valise tried to dodge diverselyminded locomotives when the sun was shining in your eyes but i forgot that you have not seen mark twain you people of no account  saved from the jaws of the cowcatcher me wandering devious a stranger met  elmira is the place elmira in the state of new yorkthis state not two hundred miles away and he added perfectly unnecessarily slide kelley slide  i slid on the west shore line i slid till midnight and they dumped me down at the door of a frowzy hotel in elmira yes they knew all about that man clemens but reckoned he was not in town had gone east somewhere i had better possess my soul in patience till the morrow and then dig up the man clemens brotherinlaw who was interested in coal  the idea of chasing half a dozen relatives in addition to mark twain up and down a city of thirty thousand inhabitants kept me awake morning revealed elmira whose streets were desolated by railway tracks and whose suburbs were given up to the manufacture of doorsashes and windowframes it was surrounded by pleasant fat little hills rimmed with timber and topped with cultivation the chemung river flowed generally up and down the town and had just finished flooding a few of the main streets  the hotelman and the telephoneman assured me that the muchdesired brotherinlaw was out of town and no one seemed to know where the man clemens abode later on i discovered that he had not summered in that place for more than nineteen seasons and so was comparatively a new arrival  a friendly policeman volunteered the news that he had seen twain or some one very like him driving a buggy the day before this gave me a delightful sense of nearness fancy living in a town where you could see the author of tom sawyer or some one very like him jolting over the pavements in a buggy  he lives out yonder at east hill said the policeman three miles from here  then the chase beganin a hired hack up an awful hill where sunflowers blossomed by the roadside and crops waved and harpers magazine cows stood in eligible and commanding attitudes kneedeep in clover all ready to be transferred to photogravure the great man must have been persecuted by outsiders aforetime and fled up the hill for refuge  presently the driver stopped at a miserable little white wood shanty and demanded mister clemens  i know hes a bigbug and all that he explained but you can never tell what sort of notions those sort of men take into their heads to live in anyways  there rose up a young lady who was sketching thistletops and goldenrod amid a plentiful supply of both and set the pilgrimage on the right path  its a pretty gothic house on the lefthand side a little way farther on  gothic h said the driver very few of the city hacks take this drive specially if they know they are coming out here and he glared at me savagely  it was a very pretty house anything but gothic clothed with ivy standing in a very big compound and fronted by a verandah full of chairs and hammocks the roof of the verandah was a trelliswork of creepers and the sun peeping through moved on the shining boards below  decidedly this remote place was an ideal one for work if a man could work among these soft airs and the murmur of the longeared crops  appeared suddenly a lady used to dealing with rampageous outsiders mr clemens has just walked downtown he is at his brotherinlaws house  then he was within shouting distance after all and the chase had not been in vain with speed i fled and the driver skidding the wheel and swearing audibly arrived at the bottom of that hill without accidents it was in the pause that followed between ringing the brotherinlaws bell and getting an answer that it occurred to me for the first time mark twain might possibly have other engagements than the entertainment of escaped lunatics from india be they never so full of admiration and in another mans houseanyhow what had i come to do or say suppose the drawingroom should be full of peoplesuppose a baby were sick how was i to explain that i only wanted to shake hands with him  then things happened somewhat in this order a big darkened drawingroom a huge chair a man with eyes a mane of grizzled hair a brown mustache covering a mouth as delicate as a womans a strong square hand shaking mine and the slowest calmest levellest voice in all the world saying  well you think you owe me something and youve come to tell me so thats what i call squaring a debt handsomely  piff from a cobpipe i always said that a missouri meerschaum was the best smoking in the world and behold mark twain had curled himself up in the big armchair and i was smoking reverently as befits one in the presence of his superior  the thing that struck me first was that he was an elderly man yet after a minutes thought i perceived that it was otherwise and in five minutes the eyes looking at me i saw that the grey hair was an accident of the most trivial he was quite young i was shaking his hand i was smoking his cigar and i was hearing him talkthis man i had learned to love and admire fourteen thousand miles away  reading his books i had striven to get an idea of his personality and all my preconceived notions were wrong and beneath the reality blessed is the man who finds no disillusion when he is brought face to face with a revered writer that was a moment to be remembered the landing of a twelvepound salmon was nothing to it i had hooked mark twain and he was treating me as though under certain circumstances i might be an equal  about this time i became aware that he was discussing the copyright question here so far as i remember is what he said attend to the words of the oracle through this unworthy medium transmitted you will never be able to imagine the long slow surge of the drawl and the deadly gravity of the countenance the quaint pucker of the body one foot thrown over the arm of the chair the yellow pipe clinched in one corner of the mouth and the right hand casually caressing the square chin  copyright some men have morals and some men haveother things i presume a publisher is a man he is not born he is createdby circumstances some publishers have morals mine have they pay me for the english productions of my books when you hear men talking of bret hartes works and other works and my books being pirated ask them to be sure of their facts i think theyll find the books are paid for it was ever thus  i remember an unprincipled and formidable publisher perhaps hes dead now he used to take my short storiesi cant call it steal or pirate them it was beyond these things altogether he took my stories one at a time and made a book of it if i wrote an essay on dentistry or theology or any little thing of that kindjust an essay that long he indicated half an inch on his finger any sort of essaythat publisher would amend and improve my essay  he would get another man to write some more to it or cut it about exactly as his needs required then he would publish a book called dentistry by mark twain that little essay and some other things not mine added theology would make another book and so on i do not consider that fair its an insult but hes dead now i think i didnt kill him  there is a great deal of nonsense talked about international copyright the proper way to treat a copyright is to make it exactly like realestate in every way  it will settle itself under these conditions if congress were to bring in a law that a mans life was not to extend over a hundred and sixty years somebody would laugh that law wouldnt concern anybody the man would be out of the jurisdiction of the court a term of years in copyright comes to exactly the same thing no law can make a book live or cause it to die before the appointed time  tottletown cal was a new town with a population of three thousandbanks firebrigade brick buildings and all the modern improvements it lived it flourished and it disappeared today no man can put his foot on any remnant of tottletown cal its dead london continues to exist bill smith author of a book read for the next year or so is realestate in tottletown william shakespeare whose works are extensively read is realestate in london let bill smith equally with mr shakespeare now deceased have as complete a control over his copyright as he would over his realestate let him gamble it away drink it away orgive it to the church let his heirs and assigns treat it in the same manner  every now and again i go up to washington sitting on a board to drive that sort of view into congress congress takes its arguments against international copyright delivered ready made andcongress isnt very strong i put the realestate view of the case before one of the senators  he said suppose a man has written a book that will live for ever  i said neither you nor i will ever live to see that man but well assume it what then  he said i want to protect the world against that mans heirs and assigns working under your theory  i said you think that all the world has no commercial sense the book that will live for ever cant be artificially kept up at inflated prices there will always be very expensive editions of it and cheap ones issuing side by side  take the case of sir walter scotts novels mark twain continued turning to me when the copyright notes protected them i bought editions as expensive as i could afford because i liked them at the same time the same firm were selling editions that a cat might buy they had their real estate and not being fools recognised that one portion of the plot could be worked as a gold mine another as a vegetable garden and another as a marble quarry do you see  what i saw with the greatest clearness was mark twain being forced to fight for the simple proposition that a man has as much right to the work of his brains think of the heresy of it as to the labour of his hands when the old lion roars the young whelps growl i growled assentingly and the talk ran on from books in general to his own in particular  growing bold and feeling that i had a few hundred thousand folk at my back i demanded whether tom sawyer married judge thatchers daughter and whether we were ever going to hear of tom sawyer as a man  i havent decided quoth mark twain getting up filling his pipe and walking up and down the room in his slippers i have a notion of writing the sequel to tom sawyer in two ways in one i would make him rise to great honour and go to congress and in the other i should hang him then the friends and enemies of the book could take their choice  here i lost my reverence completely and protested against any theory of the sort because to me at least tom sawyer was real  oh he is real said mark twain hes all the boy that i have known or recollect but that would be a good way of ending the book then turning round because when you come to think of it neither religion training nor education avails anything against the force of circumstances that drive a man suppose we took the next four and twenty years of tom sawyers life and gave a little joggle to the circumstances that controlled him he would logically and according to the joggle turn out a rip or an angel  do you believe that then  i think so isnt it what you call kismet  yes but dont give him two joggles and show the result because he isnt your property any more he belongs to us  he laugheda large wholesome laughand this began a dissertation on the rights of a man to do what he liked with his own creations which being a matter of purely professional interest i will mercifully omit  returning to the big chair he speaking of truth and the like in literature said that an autobiography was the one work in which a man against his own will and in spite of his utmost striving to the contrary revealed himself in his true light to the world  a good deal of your life on the mississippi is autobiographical isnt it i asked  as near as it can bewhen a man is writing to a book and about himself but in genuine autobiography i believe it is impossible for a man to tell the truth about himself or to avoid impressing the reader with the truth about himself  i made an experiment once i got a friend of minea man painfully given to speak the truth on all occasionsa man who wouldnt dream of telling a lieand i made him write his autobiography for his own amusement and mine he did it the manuscript would have made an octavo volume butgood honest man that he wasin every single detail of his life that i knew about he turned out on paper a formidable liar he could not help himself  it is not in human nature to write the truth about itself none the less the reader gets a general impression from an autobiography whether the man is a fraud or a good man the reader cant give his reasons any more than a man can explain why a woman struck him as being lovely when he doesnt remember her hair eyes teeth or figure and the impression that the reader gets is a correct one  do you ever intend to write an autobiography  if i do it will be as other men have donewith the most earnest desire to make myself out to be the better man in every little business that has been to my discredit and i shall fail like the others to make my readers believe anything except the truth  this naturally led to a discussion on conscience then said mark twain and his words are mighty and to be remembered  your conscience is a nuisance a conscience is like a child if you pet it and play with it and let it have everything that it wants it becomes spoiled and intrudes on all your amusements and most of your griefs treat your conscience as you would treat anything else when it is rebellious spank itbe severe with it argue with it prevent it from coming to play with you at all hours and you will secure a good conscience that is to say a properly trained one a spoiled one simply destroys all the pleasure in life i think i have reduced mine to order at least i havent heard from it for some time perhaps i have killed it from overseverity its wrong to kill a child but in spite of all i have said a conscience differs from a child in many ways perhaps its best when its dead  here he told me a littlesuch things as a man may tell a strangerof his early life and upbringing and in what manner he had been influenced for good by the example of his parents he spoke always through his eyes a light under the heavy eyebrows anon crossing the room with a step as light as a girls to show me some book or other then resuming his walk up and down the room puffing at the cob pipe i would have given much for nerve enough to demand the gift of that pipevalue five cents when new i understood why certain savage tribes ardently desired the liver of brave men slain in combat that pipe would have given me perhaps a hint of his keen insight into the souls of men but he never laid it aside within stealing reach  once indeed he put his hand on my shoulder it was an investiture of the star of india blue silk trumpets and diamondstudded jewel all complete if hereafter in the changes and chances of this mortal life i fall to cureless ruin i will tell the superintendent of the workhouse that mark twain once put his hand on my shoulder and he shall give me a room to myself and a double allowance of paupers tobacco  i never read novels myself said he except when the popular persecution forces me towhen people plague me to know what i think of the last book that every one is reading  and how did the latest persecution affect you  robert said he interrogatively  i nodded  i read it of course for the workmanship that made me think i had neglected novels too longthat there might be a good many books as graceful in style somewhere on the shelves so i began a course of novel reading i have dropped it now it did not amuse me but as regards robert the effect on me was exactly as though a singer of street ballads were to hear excellent music from a church organ i didnt stop to ask whether the music was legitimate or necessary i listened and i liked what i heard i am speaking of the grace and beauty of the style  you see he went on every man has his private opinion about a book but that is my private opinion if i had lived in the beginning of things i should have looked around the township to see what popular opinion thought of the murder of abel before i openly condemned cain i should have had my private opinion of course but i shouldnt have expressed it until i had felt the way you have my private opinion about that book i dont know what my public ones are exactly they wont upset the earth  he recurled himself into the chair and talked of other things  i spend nine months of the year at hartford i have long ago satisfied myself that there is no hope of doing much work during those nine months people come in and call they call at all hours about everything in the world one day i thought i would keep a list of interruptions it began this way  a man came and would see no one but mr clemens he was an agent for photogravure reproductions of salon pictures i very seldom use salon pictures in my books  after that man another man who refused to see any one but mr clemens came to make me write to washington about something i saw him i saw a third man then a fourth by this time it was noon i had grown tired of keeping the list i wished to rest  but the fifth man was the only one of the crowd with a card of his own he sent up his card ben koontz hannibal mo i was raised in hannibal ben was an old schoolmate of mine consequently i threw the house wide open and rushed with both hands out at a big fat heavy man who was not the ben i had ever knownnor anything like him  but is it you ben i said youve altered in the last thousand years  the fat man said well im not koontz exactly but i met him down in missouri and he told me to be sure and call on you and he gave me his card andhere he acted the little scene for my benefitif you can wait a minute till i can get out the circularsim not koontz exactly but im travelling with the fullest line of rods you ever saw  and what happened i asked breathlessly  i shutthe door he was not ben koontzexactlynot my old schoolfellow but i had shaken him by both hands in love and  i had been bearded by a lightningrod man in my own house  as i was saying i do very little work in hartford i come here for three months every year and i work four or five hours a day in a study down the garden of that little house on the hill of course i do not object to two or three interruptions when a man is in the full swing of his work these little things do not affect him eight or ten or twenty interruptions retard composition  i was burning to ask him all manner of impertinent questions as to which of his works he himself preferred and so forth but standing in awe of his eyes i dared not he spoke on and i listened grovelling  it was a question of mental equipment that was on the carpet and i am still wondering whether he meant what he said  personally i never care for fiction or storybooks what i like to read about are facts and statistics of any kind if they are only facts about the raising of radishes they interest me just now for instance before you came inhe pointed to an encyclopædia on the shelvesi was reading an article about mathematics perfectly pure mathematics  my own knowledge of mathematics stops at twelve times twelve but i enjoyed that article immensely i didnt understand a word of it but facts or what a man believes to be facts are always delightful that mathematical fellow believed in his facts so do i get your facts first andthe voice dies away to an almost inaudible dronethen you can distort em as much as you please  bearing this precious advice in my bosom i left the great man assuring me with gentle kindness that i had not interrupted him in the least once outside the door i yearned to go back and ask some questionsit was easy enough to think of them nowbut his time was his own though his books belonged to me  i should have ample time to look back to that meeting across the graves of the days but it was sad to think of the things he had not spoken about  in san francisco the men of the call told me many legends of marks apprenticeship in their paper five and twenty years ago how he was a reporter delightfully incapable of reporting according to the needs of the day he preferred so they said to coil himself into a heap and meditate until the last minute then he would produce copy bearing no sort of relationship to his legitimate workcopy that made the editor swear horribly and the readers of the call ask for more  i should like to have heard marks version of that with some stories of his joyous and variegated past he has been journeyman printer in those days he wandered from the banks of the missouri even to philadelphia pilot cub and fullblown pilot soldier of the south that was for three weeks only private secretary to a lieutenantgovernor of nevada that displeased him miner editor special correspondent in the sandwich islands and the lord only knows what else if so experienced a man could by any means be made drunk it would be a glorious thing to fill him up with composite liquors and in the language of his own country let him retrospect but these eyes will never see that orgy fit for the gods     the city of dreadful night     the city of dreadful night     chapter i  janfeb 1888  a real live city   we are all backwoodsmen and barbarians togetherwe others dwelling beyond the ditch in the outer darkness of the mofussil there are no such things as commissioners and heads of departments in the world and there is only one city in india bombay is too green too pretty and too stragglesome and madras died ever so long ago let us take off our hats to calcutta the manysided the smoky the magnificent as we drive in over the hugli bridge in the dawn of a still february morning we have left india behind us at howrah station and now we enter foreign parts no not wholly foreign say rather too familiar  all men of a certain age know the feeling of caged irritationan illustration in the graphic a bar of music or the light words of a friend from home may set it ablazethat comes from the knowledge of our lost heritage of london at home they the other men our equals have at their disposal all that town can supplythe roar of the streets the lights the music the pleasant places the millions of their own kind and a wilderness full of pretty freshcoloured englishwomen theatres and restaurants it is their right they accept it as such and even affect to look upon it with contempt and wewe have nothing except the few amusements that we painfully build up for ourselvesthe dolorous dissipations of gymkhanas where every one knows everybody else or the chastened intoxication of dances where all engagements are booked in ink ten days ahead and where everybodys antecedents are as patent as his or her method of waltzing we have been deprived of our inheritance the men at home are enjoying it all not knowing how fair and rich it is and we at the most can only fly westward for a few months and gorge what properly speaking should take seven or eight or ten luxurious years that is the lost heritage of london and the knowledge of the forfeiture wilful or forced comes to most men at times and seasons and they get cross  calcutta holds out false hopes of some return the dense smoke hangs low in the chill of the morning over an ocean of roofs and as the city wakes there goes up to the smoke a deep fullthroated boom of life and motion and humanity for this reason does he who sees calcutta for the first time hang joyously out of the ticcaghari11 and sniff the smoke and turn his face toward the tumult saying this is at last some portion of my heritage returned to me this is a city there is life here and there should be all manner of pleasant things for the having across the river and under the smoke  11 hired carriage  the litany is an expressive one and exactly describes the first emotions of a wandering savage adrift in calcutta the eye has lost its sense of proportion the focus has contracted through overmuch residence in upcountry stationstwenty minutes canter from hospital to paradeground you knowand the mind has shrunk with the eye both say together as they take in the sweep of shipping above and below the hugli bridge why this is london this is the docks this is imperial this is worth coming across india to see  then a distinctly wicked idea takes possession of the mind what a divinewhat a heavenly place to loot this gives place to a much worse devilthat of conservatism it seems not only a wrong but a criminal thing to allow natives to have any voice in the control of such a cityadorned docked wharfed fronted and reclaimed by englishmen existing only because england lives and dependent for its life on england all india knows of the calcutta municipality but has any one thoroughly investigated the big calcutta stink there is only one benares is fouler in point of concentrated pentup muck and there are local stenches in peshawar which are stronger than the b c s but for diffused soulsickening expansiveness the reek of calcutta beats both benares and peshawar bombay cloaks her stenches with a veneer of assafoetida and tobacco calcutta is above pretence there is no tracing back the calcutta plague to any one source it is faint it is sickly and it is indescribable but americans at the great eastern hotel say that it is something like the smell of the chinese quarter in san francisco it is certainly not an indian smell it resembles the essence of corruption that has rotted for the second timethe clammy odour of blue slime and there is no escape from it it blows across the maidan it comes in gusts into the corridors of the great eastern hotel what they are pleased to call the palaces of chowringhi carry it it swirls round the bengal club it pours out of bystreets with sickening intensity and the breeze of the morning is laden with it it is first found in spite of the fume of the engines in howrah station it seems to be worst in the little lanes at the back of lai bazar where the drinkingshops are but it is nearly as bad opposite government house and in the public offices the thing is intermittent six moderately pure mouthfuls of air may be drawn without offence then comes the seventh wave and the queasiness of an uncultured stomach if you live long enough in calcutta you grow used to it the regular residents admit the disgrace but their answer is wait till the wind blows off the salt lakes where all the sewage goes and then youll smell something that is their defence small wonder that they consider calcutta is a fit place for a permanent viceroy englishmen who can calmly extenuate one shame by another are capable of asking for anythingand expecting to get it  if an upcountry station holding three thousand troops and twenty civilians owned such a possession as calcutta does the deputy commissioner or the cantonment magistrate would have all the natives off the board of management or decently shovelled into the background until the mess was abated then they might come on again and talk of highhanded oppression as much as they liked that stink to an unprejudiced nose damns calcutta as a city of kings and in spite of that stink they allow they even encourage natives to look after the place the damp drainagesoaked soil is sick with the teeming life of a hundred years and the municipal board list is choked with the names of nativesmen of the breed born in and raised off this surfeited muckheap they own property these amiable aryans on the municipal and the bengal legislative council launch a proposal to tax them on that property and they naturally howl they also howl upcountry but there the halls for massmeetings are few and the vernacular papers fewer and with a strong secretary and a president whose favour is worth the having and whose wrath is undesirable men are kept clean despite themselves and may not poison their neighbours why asks a savage let them vote at all they can put up with this filthiness they cannot have any feelings worth caring a rush for let them live quietly and hide away their money under our protection while we tax them till they know through their purses the measure of their neglect in the past and when a little of the smell has been abolished let us bring them back again to talk and take the credit of enlightenment the better classes own their broughams and barouches the worse can shoulder an englishman into the kennel and talk to him as though he were a cook they can refer to an english lady as an aurat12 they are permitted a freedomnot to put it too coarselyof speech which if used by an englishman toward an englishman would end in serious trouble they are fenced and protected and made inviolate surely they might be content with all those things without entering into matters which they cannot by the nature of their birth understand  12 woman  now whether all this genial diatribe be the outcome of an unbiassed mind or the result first of sickness caused by that ferocious stench and secondly of headache due to daylong smoking to drown the stench is an open question anyway calcutta is a fearsome place for a man not educated up to it  a word of advice to other barbarians do not bring a northcountry servant into calcutta he is sure to get into trouble because he does not understand the customs of the city a punjabi in this place for the first time esteems it his bounden duty to go to the ajaibgharthe museum such an one has gone and is even now returned very angry and troubled in the spirit i went to the museum says he and no one gave me any abuse i went to the market to buy my food and then i sat upon a seat there came an orderly who said go away i want to sit here i said i am here first he said i am a chaprassi13 get out and he hit me now that sittingplace was open to all so i hit him till he wept he ran away for the police and i went away too for the police here are all sahibs can i have leave from two oclock to go and look for that man and hit him again  13 messenger  behold the situation an unknown city full of smell that makes one long for rest and retirement and a champing servant not yet six hours in the stew who has started a bloodfeud with an unknown chaprassi and clamours to go forth to the fray  alas for the lost delusion of the heritage that was to be restored let us sleep let us sleep and pray that calcutta may be better tomorrow  at present it is remarkably like sleeping with a corpse     chapter ii  the reflections of a savage   morning brings counsel does calcutta smell so pestiferously after all heavy rain has fallen in the night she is newly washed and the clear sunlight shows her at her best where oh where in all this wilderness of life shall a man go  the great eastern hums with life through all its hundred rooms doors slam merrily and all the nations of the earth run up and down the staircases this alone is refreshing because the passers bump you and ask you to stand aside fancy finding any place outside the levéeroom where englishmen are crowded together to this extent fancy sitting down seventy strong to tâble dhôte and with a deafening clatter of knives and forks fancy finding a real bar whence drinks may be obtained and joy of joys fancy stepping out of the hotel into the arms of a live white helmeted buttoned truncheoned bobby what would happen if one spoke to this bobby would he be offended he is not offended he is affable he has to patrol the pavement in front of the great eastern and to see that the crowding carriages do not jam toward a presumably respectable white he behaves as a man and a brother there is no arrogance about him and this is disappointing closer inspection shows that he is not a real bobby after all he is a municipal police something and his uniform is not correct at least if they have not changed the dress of the men at home but no matter later on we will inquire into the calcutta bobby because he is a white man and has to deal with some of the toughest folk that ever set out of malice aforethought to paint job charnocks city vermilion you must not you cannot cross old court house street without looking carefully to see that you stand no chance of being run over this is beautiful there is a steady roar of traffic cut every two minutes by the deep roll of the trams the driving is eccentric not to say bad but there is the trafficmore than unsophisticated eyes have beheld for a certain number of years it means business it means moneymaking it means crowded and hurrying life and it gets into the blood and makes it move here be big shops with plateglass frontsall displaying the wellknown names of firms that we savages only correspond with through the parcels post14 they are all here as large as life ready to supply anything you need if you only care to sign great is the fascination of being able to obtain a thing on the spot without having to write for a week and wait for a month and then get something quite different no wonder pretty ladies who live anywhere within a reasonable distance come down to do their shopping personally  14 cod  look here if you want to be respectable you mustnt smoke in the streets nobody does it this is advice kindly tendered by a friend in a black coat there is no levée or lieutenantgovernor in sight but he wears the frockcoat because it is daylight and he can be seen he refrains from smoking for the same reason he admits that providence built the open air to be smoked in but he says that it isnt the thing this man has a brougham a remarkably natty little pillbox with a curious wabble about the wheels he steps into the brougham and puts ona tophat a shiny black plug  there was a man upcountry once who owned a tophat he leased it to amateur theatrical companies for some seasons until the nap wore off then he threw it into a tree and wild bees hived in it men were wont to come and look at the hat in its palmy days for the sake of feeling homesick it interested all the station and died with two seers of babulflower honey in its bosom but tophats are not intended to be worn in india they are as sacred as home letters and old rosebuds the friend cannot see this he allows that if he stepped out of his brougham and walked about in the sunshine for ten minutes he would get a bad headache in halfanhour he would probably die of sunstroke he allows all this but he keeps to his hat and cannot see why a barbarian is moved to inextinguishable laughter at the sight every one who owns a brougham and many people who hire ticcagharis keep tophats and black frockcoats the effect is curious and at first fills the beholder with surprise  and now let us see the handsome houses where the wealthy nobles dwell northerly lies the great human jungle of the native city stretching from burra bazar to chitpore that can keep southerly is the maidan and chowringhi if you get out into the centre of the maidan you will understand why calcutta is called the city of palaces the travelled american said so at the great eastern there is a short tower falsely called a memorial standing in a waste of soft sour green that is as good a place to get to as any other the size of the maidan takes the heart out of any one accustomed to the gardens of upcountry just as they say newmarket heath cows a horse accustomed to more a shutin course the huge level is studded with brazen statues of eminent gentlemen riding fretful horses on diabolically severe curbs the expanse dwarfs the statues dwarfs everything except the frontage of the faraway chowringhi road it is bigit is impressive there is no escaping the fact they built houses in the old days when the rupee was two shillings and a penny those houses are threestoried and ornamented with servicestaircases like houses in the hills they are very close together and they have garden walls of masonry pierced with a single gate in their shutupness they are british in their spaciousness they are oriental but those servicestaircases do not look healthy we will form an amateur sanitary commission and call upon chowringhi  a first introduction to the calcutta durwân or doorkeeper is not nice if he is chewing pân he does not take the trouble to get rid of his quid if he is sitting on his cot chewing sugarcane he does not think it worth his while to rise he has to be taught those things and he cannot understand why he should be reproved clearly he is a survival of a playedout system providence never intended that any native should be made a concierge more insolent than any of the french variety the people of calcutta put a man in a little lodge close to the gate of their house in order that loafers may be turned away and the houses protected from theft the natural result is that the durwân treats everybody whom he does not know as a loafer has an intimate and vendible knowledge of all the outgoings and incomings in that house and controls to a large extent the nomination of the servants they say that one of the estimable class is now suing a bank for about three lakhs of rupees15 upcountry a lieutenantgovernors servant has to work for thirty years before he can retire on seventy thousand rupees of savings the calcutta durwân is a great institution the head and front of his offence is that he will insist upon trying to talk english how he protects the houses calcutta only knows he can be frightened out of his wits by severe speech and is generally asleep in calling hours if a rough round of visits be any guide three times out of seven he is fragrant of drink so much for the durwân now for the houses he guards  15 say 100000  very pleasant is the sensation of being ushered into a pestiferously stablesome drawingroom does this always happen no not unless you shut up the room for some time but if you open the shutters there are other smells you see the stables and the servants quarters are close to people pay five hundred a month for halfadozen rooms filled with scents of this kind they make no complaint when they think the honour of the city is at stake they say defiantly yes but you must remember were a metropolis we are crowded here we have no room we arent like your little stations chowringhi is a stately place full of sumptuous houses but it is best to look at it hastily stop to consider for a moment what the cramped compounds the black soaked soil the netted intricacies of the servicestaircases the packed stables the seethment of human life round the durwâns lodges and the curious arrangement of little open drains mean and you will call it a whited sepulchre  men living in expensive tenements suffer from chronic sore throat and will tell you cheerily that weve got typhoid in calcutta now is the pest ever out of it everything seems to be built with a view to its comfort it can lodge comfortably on roofs climb along from the gutterpipe to piazza or rise from sink to verandah and thence to the topmost story but calcutta says that all is sound and produces figures to prove it at the same time admitting that healthy cut flesh will not readily heal further evidence may be dispensed with  here come pouring down park street on the maidân a rush of broughams neat buggies the lightest of gigs trim office brownberrys shining victorias and a sprinkling of veritable hansom cabs in the broughams sit men in tophats in the other carts young men all very much alike and all immaculately turned out a fresh stream from chowringhi joins the park street detachment and the two together stream away across the maidân toward the business quarter of the city this is calcutta going to officethe civilians to the government buildings and the young men to their firms and their blocks and their wharves here one sees that calcutta has the best turnout in the empire horses and traps alike are enviably perfect andmark the touchstone of civilizationthe lamps are in their sockets the countrybred is a rare beast here his place is taken by the waler16 and the waler though a ruffian at heart can be made to look like a gentleman it would be indecorous to applaud the winking harness the perfectly lacquered panels and the liveried saises they show well in the outwardly fair roads shadowed by the palaces  16 imported australian horse  how many sections of the complex society of the place do the carts carry first the bengal civilian who goes to writers buildings and sits in a perfect office and speaks flippantly of sending things to india meaning thereby referring matters to the supreme government he is a great person and his mouth is full of promotionandappointment shop generally he is referred to as a rising man calcutta seems full of rising men secondly the government of india man who wears a familiar simla face rents a flat when he is not up in the hills and is rational on the subject of the drawbacks of calcutta thirdly the man of the firms the pure nonofficial who fights under the banner of one of the great houses of the city or for his own hand in a neat office or dashes about clive street in a brougham doing share work or something of the kind he fears not bengal nor regards he india he swears impartially at both when their actions interfere with his operations his shop is quite unintelligible he is like the english city man with the chill off lives well and entertains hospitably in the old days he was greater than he is now but still he bulks large he is rational in so far that he will help the abuse of the municipality but womanish in his insistence on the excellencies of calcutta over and above these who are hurrying to work are the various brigades squads and detachments of the other interests but they are sets and not sections and revolve round belvedere government house and fort william simla and darjeeling claim them in the hot weather let them go they wear tophats and frockcoats  it is time to escape from chowringhi road and get among the longshore folk who have no prejudices against tobacco and who all use very much the same sort of hat     chapter iii  the council of the gods      he set up conclusions to the number of nine thousand seven     hundred and sixtyfour  he went afterwards to the sorbonne     where he maintained argument against the theologians for the     space of six weeks from four oclock in the morning till six in     the evening except for an interval of two hours to refresh     themselves and take their repasts and at this were present the     greatest part of the lords of the court the masters of request     presidents counsellors those of the accompts secretaries     advocates and others as also the sheriffs of the said     townpantagruel   the bengal legislative council is sitting now you will find it in an octagonal wing of writers buildings straight across the maidân its worth seeing what are they sitting on municipal business no end of a debate so much for trying to keep low company the longshore loafers must stand over without doubt this council is going to hang some one for the state of the city and sir steuart bayley will be chief executioner one does not come across councils every day  writers buildings are large you can trouble the busy workers of halfadozen departments before you stumble upon the blackstained staircase that leads to an upper chamber looking out over a populous street wild orderlies block the way the councillor sahibs are sitting but any one can enter to the right of the lât sahibs chair and go quietly illmannered minion does he expect the awestricken spectator to prance in with a warwhoop or turn catherinewheels round that sumptuous octagonal room with the bluedomed roof there are gilt capitals to the half pillars and an egyptian patterned lotusstencil makes the walls gay a thick piled carpet covers all the floor and must be delightful in the hot weather on a black wooden throne comfortably cushioned in green leather sits sir steuart bayley ruler of bengal the rest are all great men or else they would not be there not to know them argues oneself unknown there are a dozen of them and sit six aside at two slightly curved lines of beautifully polished desks thus sir steuart bayley occupies the frog of a badly made horseshoe split at the toe in front of him at a table covered with books and pamphlets and papers toils a secretary there is a seat for the reporters and that is all the place enjoys a chastened gloom and its very atmosphere fills one with awe this is the heart of bengal and uncommonly well upholstered if the work matches the firstclass furniture the inkpots the carpet and the resplendent ceilings there will be something worth seeing but where is the criminal who is to be hanged for the stench that runs up and down writers buildings staircases for the rubbish heaps in the chitpore road for the sickly savour of chowringhi for the dirty little tanks at the back of belvedere for the street full of smallpox for the reeking gharistand outside the great eastern for the state of the stone and dirt pavements for the condition of the gullies of shampooker and for a hundred other things  this i submit is an artificial scheme in supersession of natures unit the individual the speaker is a slight spare native in a flat hatturban and a black alpaca frockcoat he looks like a scribe to the bootheels and with his unvarying smile and regulated gesticulation recalls memories of upcountry courts he never hesitates is never at a loss for a word and never in one sentence repeats himself he talks and talks and talks in a level voice rising occasionally half an octave when a point has to be driven home some of his periods sound very familiar this for instance might be a sentence from the indian mirror so much for the principle let us now examine how far it is supported by precedent this sounds bad when a fluent native is discoursing of principles and precedents the chances are that he will go on for some time moreover where is the criminal and what is all this talk about abstractions they want shovels not sentiments in this part of the world  a friendly whisper brings enlightenment they are ploughing through the calcutta municipal billplurality of votes you know here are the papers and so it is a mass of motions and amendments on matters relating to ward votes is a to be allowed to give two votes in one ward and one in another is section 10 to be omitted and is one man to be allowed one vote and no more how many votes does three hundred rupees worth of landed property carry is it better to kiss a post or throw it in the fire not a word about carbolic acid and gangs of sweepers the little man in the black dressinggown revels in his subject he is great on principles and precedents and the necessity of popularising our system he fears that under certain circumstances the status of the candidates will decline he riots in selfadjusting majorities and the healthy influence of the educated middle classes  for a practical answer to this there steals across the council chamber just one faint whiff of the stink it is as though some one laughed low and bitterly but no man heeds the englishmen look supremely bored the native members stare stolidly in front of them sir steuart bayleys face is as set as the face of the sphinx for these things he draws his paya low wage for heavy labour but the speaker now adrift is not altogether to be blamed he is a bengali who has got before him just such a subject as his soul lovethan elaborate piece of academical reform leading nowhere here is a quiet room full of pens and papers and there are men who must listen to him apparently there is no time limit to the speeches can you wonder that he talks he says i submit once every ninety seconds varying the form with i do submit the popular element in the electoral body should have prominence quite so he quotes one john stuart mill to prove it there steals over the listener a numbing sense of nightmare he has heard all this before somewhereyea even down to j s mill and the references to the true interests of the ratepayers he sees what is coming next yes there is the old sabha anjuman journalistic formulawestern education is an exotic plant of recent importation how on earth did this man drag western education into this discussion who knows perhaps sir steuart bayley does he seems to be listening the others are looking at their watches the spell of the level voice sinks the listener yet deeper into a trance he is haunted by the ghosts of all the cant of all the political platforms of great britain he hears all the old old vestry phrases and once more he smells the smell that is no dream western education is an exotic plant it is the upas tree and it is all our fault we brought it out from england exactly as we brought out the inkbottles and the patterns for the chairs we planted it and it grewmonstrous as a banian now we are choked by the roots of it spreading so thickly in this fat soil of bengal the speaker continues bit by bit we builded this dome visible and invisible the crown of writers buildings as we have built and peopled the buildings now we have gone too far to retreat being tied and bound with the chain of our own sins the speech continues we made that florid sentence that torrent of verbiage is ours we taught him what was constitutional and what was unconstitutional in the days when calcutta smelt calcutta smells still but we must listen to all that he has to say about the plurality of votes and the threshing of wind and the weaving of ropes of sand it is our own fault  the speech ends and there rises a grey englishman in a black frockcoat he looks a strong man and a worldly surely he will say yes lala sahib all this may be true talk but theres a vile smell in this place and everything must be cleaned in a week or the deputy commissioner will not take any notice of you in durbar he says nothing of the kind this is a legislative council where they call each other honourable soandsos the englishman in the frockcoat begs all to remember that we are discussing principles and no consideration of the details ought to influence the verdict on the principles is he then like the rest how does this strange thing come about perhaps these so english office fittings are responsible for the warp the council chamber might be a london boardroom perhaps after long years among the pens and papers its occupants grew to think that it really is and in this belief give résumés of the history of local selfgovernment in england  the black frockcoat emphasising his points with his spectaclecase is telling his friends how the parish was first the unit of selfgovernment he then explains how burgesses were elected and in tones of deep fervour announces commissioners of sewers are elected in the same way whereunto all this lecture is he trying to run a motion through under cover of a cloud of words essaying the wellknown cuttlefish trick of the west  he abandons england for a while and now we get a glimpse of the cloven hoof in a casual reference to hindus and mahometans the hindus will lose nothing by the complete establishment of plurality of votes they will have the control of their own wards as they used to have so there is racefeeling to be explained away even among these beautiful desks scratch the council and you come to the old old trouble the black frockcoat sits down and a keeneyed blackbearded englishman rises with one hand in his pocket to explain his views on an alteration of the vote qualification the idea of an amendment seems to have just struck him he hints that he will bring it forward later on he is academical like the others but not half so good a speaker all this is dreary beyond words why do they talk and talk about owners and occupiers and burgesses in england and the growth of autonomous institutions when the city the great city is here crying out to be cleansed what has england to do with calcuttas evil and why should englishmen be forced to wander through mazes of unprofitable argument against men who cannot understand the iniquity of dirt  a pause follows the blackbearded mans speech rises another native a heavily built babu in a black gown and a strange headdress a snowy white strip of cloth is thrown dusterwise over his shoulders his voice is high and not always under control he begins i will try to be as brief as possible this is ominous by the way in council there seems to be no necessity for a form of address the orators plunge in medias res and only when they are well launched throw an occasional sir towards sir steuart bayley who sits with one leg doubled under him and a dry pen in his hand this speaker is no good he talks but he says nothing and he only knows where he is drifting to he says we must remember that we are legislating for the metropolis of india and therefore we should borrow our institutions from large english towns and not from parochial institutions if you think for a minute that shows a large and healthy knowledge of the history of local selfgovernment it also reveals the attitude of calcutta if the city thought less about itself as a metropolis and more as a midden its state would be better the speaker talks patronisingly of my friend alluding to the black frockcoat then he flounders afresh and his voice gallops up the gamut as he declares and therefore that makes all the difference he hints vaguely at threats something to do with the hindus and the mahometans but what he means it is difficult to discover here however is a sentence taken verbatim it is not likely to appear in this form in the calcutta papers the black frockcoat had said that if a wealthy native had eight votes to his credit his vanity would prompt him to go to the pollingbooth because he would feel better than halfadozen ghariwans or petty traders fancy allowing a ghariwan to vote he has yet to learn how to drive hereon the gentleman with the white cloth then the complaint is that influential voters will not take the trouble to vote in my humble opinion if that be so adopt votingpapers that is the way to meet them in the same waythe calcutta trades associationyou abolish all plurality of votes and that is the way to meet them lucid is it not up flies the irresponsible voice and delivers this statement in the election for the house of commons plurality are allowed for persons having interest in different districts then hopeless hopeless fog it is a great pity that india ever heard of anybody higher than the heads of the civil service once more a whiff of the stink the gentleman gives a defiant jerk of his shouldercloth and sits down  then sir steuart bayley the question before the council is etc there is a ripple of ayes and noes and the noes have it whatever it may be the blackbearded gentleman springs his amendment about the voting qualifications a large senator in a white waistcoat and with a most genial smile rises and proceeds to smash up the amendment cant see the use of it calls it in effect rubbish the black dressinggown he who spoke first of all speaks again and talks of the sojourner who comes here for a little time and then leaves the land well it is for the black gown that the sojourner does come or there would be no comfy places wherein to talk about the power that can be measured by wealth and the intellect which sir i submit cannot be so measured the amendment is lost and trebly and quadruply lost is the listener in the name of sanity and to preserve the tattered shirttails of a torn illusion let us escape this is the calcutta municipal bill they have been at it for several saturdays last saturday sir steuart bayley pointed out that at their present rate they would be about two years in getting it through now they will sit till dusk unless sir steuart bayley who wants to see lord connemara off puts up the black frockcoat to move an adjournment it is not good to watch a government close to this leads to the formation of blatantly selfsatisfied judgments which may be quite as wrong as the cramping system with which we have encompassed ourselves and in the streets outside englishmen summarise the situation brutally thus the whole thing is a farce time is money to us we cant stick out those everlasting speeches in the municipality the natives choke us off but we know that if things get too bad the government will step in and interfere and so we worry along somehow  meantime calcutta continues to cry out for the bucket and the broom     chapter iv  on the banks of the hugli   the clocks of the city have struck two where can a man get food calcutta is not rich in respect of dainty accommodation you can stay your stomach at pelitis or bonsards but their shops are not to be found in hastings street or in the places where brokers fly to and fro in officejauns sweating and growing visibly rich there must be some sort of entertainment where sailors congregate honest bombay jack supplies nothing but burma cheroots and whisky in liqueurglasses but in lal bazar not far from the sailors coffeerooms a board gives bold advertisement that officers and seamen can find good quarters in evidence a row of neat officers and seamen are sitting on a bench by the hotel door smoking there is an almost military likeness in their clothes perhaps honest bombay jack only keeps one kind of felt hat and one brand of suit when jack of the mercantile marine is sober he is very sober when he is drunk he isbut ask the river police what a lean mad yankee can do with his nails and teeth these gentlemen smoking on the bench are impassive almost as red indians their attitudes are unrestrained and they do not wear braces nor it would appear from the bill of fare are they particular as to what they eat when they attend tâble dhôte the fare is substantial and the regulation pegevery house has its own depth of peg if you will refrain from stopping ganymedesomething to wonder at three fingers and a trifle over seems to be the use of the officers and seamen who are talking so quietly in the doorway one sayshe has evidently finished a long storyand so he shipped for four pound ten with a first mates certificate and all and that was in a german barque another spits with conviction and says genially without raising his voice that was a hell of a ship who knows her no answer from the assembly but a dane or a german wants to know whether the myra is up yet a dry redhaired man gives her exact position in the riverhow in the world can he knowand the probable hour of her arrival the grave debate drifts into a discussion of a recent river accident whereby a big steamer was damaged and had to put back and discharge cargo a burly gentleman who is taking a constitutional down lal bazar strolls up and says i tell you she fouled her own chain with her own forefoot hev you seen the plates no then how the  can any  like you  say what it  well was he passes on having delivered his highly flavored opinion without heat or passion no one seems to resent the garnish  let us get down to the river and see this stamp of men more thoroughly clarke russell has told us that their lives are hard enough in all conscience what are their pleasures and diversions the port office where live the gentlemen who make improvements in the port of calcutta ought to supply information it stands large and fair and built in an orientalised manner after the italians at the corner of fairlie place upon the great strand road and a continual clamour of traffic by land and by sea goes up throughout the day and far into the night against its windows this is a place to enter more reverently than the bengal legislative council for it controls the direction of the uncertain hugli down to the sandheads owns enormous wealth and spends huge sums on the frontaging of river banks the expansion of jetties and the manufacture of docks costing two hundred lakhs of rupees two million tons of seagoing shippage yearly find their way up and down the river by the guidance of the port office and the men of the port office know more than it is good for men to hold in their heads they can without reference to telegraphic bulletins give the position of all the big steamers coming up or going down from the hugli to the sea day by day with their tonnage the names of their captains and the nature of their cargo looking out from the verandah of their office over a lancerregiment of masts they can declare truthfully the name of every ship within eyescope with the day and hour when she will depart  in a room at the bottom of the building lounge big men carefully dressed now there is a type of face which belongs almost exclusively to bengal cavalry officersmajors for choice everybody knows the bronzed blackmoustached clearspeaking native cavalry officer he exists unnaturally in novels and naturally on the frontier these men in the big room have his cast of face so strongly marked that one marvels what officers are doing by the river have they come to book passages for home those men theyre pilots some of them draw between two and three thousand rupees a month they are responsible for halfamillion pounds worth of cargo sometimes they certainly are men and they carry themselves as such they confer together by twos and threes and appeal frequently to shipping lists  isnt a pilot a man who always wears a peajacket and shouts through a speakingtrumpet well you can ask those gentlemen if you like youve got your notions from home pilots ours arent that kind exactly they are a picked service as carefully weeded as the indian civil some of em have brothers in it and some belong to the old indian army families but they are not all equally well paid the calcutta papers echo the groans of the junior pilots who are not allowed the handling of ships over a certain tonnage as it is yearly growing cheaper to build one big steamer than two little ones these juniors are crowded out and while the seniors get their thousands some of the youngsters make at the end of one month exactly thirty rupees this is a grievance with them and it seems wellfounded  in the flats above the pilots room are hushed and chapellike offices all sumptuously fitted where englishmen write and telephone and telegraph and deft babus for ever draw maps of the shifting hugli any hope of understanding the work of the port commissioners is thoroughly dashed by being taken through the port maps of a quarter of a century past men have played with the hugli as children play with a gutterrunnel and in return the hugli once rose and played with men and ships till the strand road was littered with the raffle and the carcasses of big ships there are photos on the walls of the cyclone of 64 when the thunder came inland and sat upon an american barque obstructing all the traffic very curious are these photos and almost impossible to believe how can a big strong steamer have her three masts razed to deck level how can a heavy country boat be pitched on to the poop of a highwalled liner and how can the side be bodily torn out of a ship the photos say that all these things are possible and men aver that a cyclone may come again and scatter the craft like chaff outside the port office are the export and import sheds buildings that can hold a ships cargo apiece all standing on reclaimed ground here be several strong smells a mass of railway lines and a multitude of men do you see where that trolly is standing behind the big p and o berth in that place as nearly as may be the govindpur went down about twenty years ago and began to shift out but that is solid ground she sank there and the next tide made a scourhole on one side of her the returning tide knocked her into it then the mud made up behind her next tide the business was repeatedalways the scourhole in the mud and the filling up behind her so she rolled and was pushed out and out until she got in the way of the shipping right out yonder and we had to blow her up when a ship sinks in mud or quicksand she regularly digs her own grave and wriggles herself into it deeper and deeper till she reaches moderately solid stuff then she sticks horrible idea is it not to go down and down with each tide into the foul hugli mud  close to the port offices is the shipping office where the captains engage their crews the men must produce their discharges from their last ships in the presence of the shipping master or as they call him the deputy shipping he passes them after having satisfied himself that they are not deserters from other ships and they then sign articles for the voyage this is the ceremony beginning with the dearly beloved of the crewhunting captain down to the amazement of the deserter there is a dingy building next door to the sailors home at whose gate stand the castups of all the seas in all manner of raiment there are the seedee boys bombay serangs and madras fishermen of the salt villages malays who insist upon marrying calcutta women grow jealous and run amok malayhindus hindumalaywhites burmese burmawhites burmanativewhites italians with gold earrings and a thirst for gambling yankees of all the states with mulattoes and pure buckniggers red and rough danes cingalese cornish boys fresh taken from the ploughtail cornstalks from colonial ships where they got four pound ten a month as seamen tunbellied germans cockney mates keeping a little aloof from the crowd and talking in knots together unmistakable tommies who have tumbled into seafaring life by some mistake cockatootufted welshmen spitting and swearing like cats brokendown loafers greyheaded penniless and pitiful swaggering boys and very quiet men with gashes and cuts on their faces it is an ethnological museum where all the specimens are playing comedies and tragedies the head of it all is the deputy shipping and he sits supported by an english policeman whose fists are knobby in a great chair of state the deputy shipping knows all the iniquity of the riverside all the ships all the captains and a fair amount of the men he is fenced off from the crowd by a strong wooden railing behind which are gathered the unemployed of the mercantile marine they have had their spreepoor devilsand now they will go to sea again on as low a wage as three pound ten a month to fetch up at the end in some shanghai stew or san francisco hell they have turned their backs on the seductions of the howrah boardinghouses and the delights of colootollah if fate will nightingales will know them no more for a season but what skipper will take some of these battered shattered wrecks whose hands shake and whose eyes are red  enter suddenly a bearded captain who has made his selection from the crowd on a previous day and now wants to get his men passed he is not fastidious in his choice his eleven seem a tough lot for such a mildeyed civilspoken man to manage but the captain in the shipping office and the captain on his ship are two different things he brings his crew up to the deputy shippings bar and hands in their greasy tattered discharges but the heart of the deputy shipping is hot within him because two days ago a howrah crimp stole a whole crew from a downdropping ship insomuch that the captain had to come back and whip up a new crew at one oclock in the day evil will it be if the deputy shipping finds one of these bountyjumpers in the chosen crew of the blenkindoon  the deputy shipping tells the story with heat i didnt know they did such things in calcutta says the captain do such things theyd steal the eyeteeth out of your head there captain he picks up a discharge and calls for michael donelly a looseknit viciouslooking irishamerican who chews stand up man stand up michael donelly wants to lean against the desk and the english policeman wont have it what was your last ship fairy queen when did you leave her bout leven days captains name flahy thatll do next man jules anderson jules anderson is a dane his statements tally with the dischargecertificate of the united states as the eagle attesteth he is passed and falls back slivey the englishman and david a huge plumcoloured negro who ships as cook are also passed then comes bassompra a little italian who speaks english whats your last ship ferdinand no after that german barque bassompra does not look happy when did she sail about three weeks ago whats her name haidée you deserted from her yes but shes left port the deputy shipping runs rapidly through a shippinglist throws it down with a bang twont do no german barque haidée here for three months how do i know you dont belong to the jacksons crew capen im afraid youll have to ship another man he must stand over take the rest away and make em sign  the beadeyed bassompra seems to have lost his chance of a voyage and his case will be inquired into the captain departs with his men and they sign articles for the voyage while the deputy shipping tells strange tales of the sailormans life theyll quit a good ship for the sake of a spree and catch on again at three pound ten and by jove theyll let their skippers pay em at ten rupees to the sovereignpoor beggars as soon as the moneys gone theyll ship but not before every one under rank of captain engages here the competition makes firstmates ship sometimes for five pounds or as low as four ten a month the gentleman in the boardinghouse was right you see a first mates wages are seven ten or eight and foreign captains ship for twelve pounds a month and bring their own small storeseverything that is to say except beef peas flour coffee and molasses  these things are not pleasant to listen to while the hungryeyed men in the bad clothes lounge and scratch and loaf behind the railing what comes to them in the end they die it seems though that is not altogether strange they die at sea in strange and horrible ways they die a few of them in the kintals being lost and suffocated in the great sink of calcutta they die in strange places by the waterside and the hugli takes them away under the mooring chains and the buoys and casts them up on the sands below if the river police have missed the capture they sail the sea because they must live and there is no end to their toil very very few find haven of any kind and the earth whose ways they do not understand is cruel to them when they walk upon it to drink and be merry after the manner of beasts jack ashore is a pretty thing when he is in a book or in the blue jacket of the navy mercantile jack is not so lovely later on we will see where his sprees lead him     chapter v  with the calcutta police      the city was of nightperchance of death     but certainly of night      the city of dreadful night   in the beginning the police were responsible they said in a patronising way that they would prefer to take a wanderer round the great city themselves sooner than let him contract a broken head on his own account in the slums they said that there were places and places where a white man unsupported by the arm of the law would be robbed and mobbed and that there were other places where drunken seamen would make it very unpleasant for him  come up to the fire lookout in the first place and then youll be able to see the city this was at no 22 lal bazar which is the headquarters of the calcutta police the centre of the great web of telephone wires where justice sits all day and all night looking after one million people and a floating population of one hundred thousand but her work shall be dealt with later on the fire lookout is a little sentrybox on the top of the threestoried police offices here a native watchman waits to give warning to the brigade below if the smoke rises by day or the flames by night in any ward of the city from this eyrie in the warm night one hears the heart of calcutta beating northward the city stretches away three long miles with three more miles of suburbs beyond to dumdum and barrackpore the lamplit dusk on this side is full of noises and shouts and smells close to the police office jovial mariners at the sailors coffeeshop are roaring hymns southerly the citys confused lights give place to the orderly lamprows of the maidân and chowringhi where the respectabilities live and the police have very little to do from the east goes up to the sky the clamour of sealdah the rumble of the trams and the voices of all bow bazar chaffering and making merry westward are the business quarters hushed now the lamps of the shipping on the river and the twinkling lights on the howrah side does the noise of traffic go on all through the hot weather of course the hot months are the busiest in the year and moneys tightest you should see the brokers cutting about at that season calcutta cant stop my dear sir what happens then nothing happens the deathrate goes up a little thats all even in february the weather would upcountry be called muggy and stifling but calcutta is convinced that it is her cold season the noises of the city grow perceptibly it is the night side of calcutta waking up and going abroad jack in the sailors coffeeshop is singing joyously shall we gather at the riverthe beautiful the beautiful the river there is a clatter of hoofs in the courtyard below some of the mounted police have come in from somewhere or other out of the great darkness a clogdance of iron hoofs follows and an englishmans voice is heard soothing an agitated horse who seems to be standing on his hind legs some of the mounted police are going out into the great darkness whats on a dance at government house the reserve men are being formed up below theyre calling the roll the reserve men are all english and big english at that they form up and tramp out of the courtyard to line government place and see that mrs lollipops brougham does not get smashed up by sirdar chuckerbutty bahadurs lumbering cspring barouche with the two raw walers very military men are the calcutta european police in their setup and he who knows their composition knows some startling stories of gentlemanrankers and the like they are despite the wearing climate they work in and the wearing work they do as fine a fivescore of englishmen as you shall find east of suez  listen for a moment from the fire lookout to the voices of the night and you will see why they must be so two thousand sailors of fifty nationalities are adrift in calcutta every sunday and of these perhaps two hundred are distinctly the worse for liquor there is a mild row going on even now somewhere at the back of bow bazar which at nightfall fills with sailormen who have a wonderful gift of falling foul of the native population to keep the queens peace is of course only a small portion of police duty but it is trying the burly president of the lockup for european drunkscalcutta central lockup is worth seeingrejoices in a sprained thumb just now and has to do his work lefthanded in consequence but his left hand is a marvellously persuasive one and when on duty his sleeves are turned up to the shoulder that the jovial mariner may see that there is no deception the presidents labours are handicapped in that the road of sin to the lockup runs through a grimy little gardenthe brick paths are worn deep with the tread of many drunken feetwhere a man can give a great deal of trouble by sticking his toes into the ground and getting mixed up with the shrubs a straight runin would be much more convenient both for the president and the drunk generally speakingand here police experience is pretty much the same all over the civilised worlda womandrunk is a good deal worse than a mandrunk she scratches and bites like a chinaman and swears like several fiends strange people may be unearthed in the lockups here is a perfectly true story not three weeks old a visitor an unofficial one wandered into the native side of the spacious accommodation provided for those who have gone or done wrong a wildeyed babu rose from the fixed charpoy and said in the best of english good morning sir good morning who are you and what are you in for then the babu in one breath i would have you know that i do not go to prison as a criminal but as a reformer youve read the vicar of wakefield yees well i am the vicar of bengalat least thats what i call myself the visitor collapsed he had not nerve enough to continue the conversation then said the voice of the authority hes down in connection with a cheating case at serampore may be shamming insane but hell be looked to in time  the best place to hear about the police is the fire lookout from that eyrie one can see how difficult must be the work of control over the great growling beast of a city by all means let us abuse the police but let us see what the poor wretches have to do with their three thousand natives and one hundred englishmen from howrah and bally and the other suburbs at least a hundred thousand people come in to calcutta for the day and leave at night then too chandernagore is handy for the fugitive lawbreaker who can enter in the evening and get away before the noon of the next day having marked his house and broken into it  but how can the prevalent offence be housebreaking in a place like this easily enough when youve seen a little of the city youll see natives sleep and lie about all over the place and whole quarters are just so many rabbitwarrens wait till you see the machua bazar well besides the petty theft and burglary we have heavy cases of forgery and fraud that leave us with our wits pitted against a bengalis when a bengali criminal is working a fraud of the sort he loves he is about the cleverest soul you could wish for he gives us cases a year long to unravel then there are the murders in the low housesvery curious things they are youll see the house where sheikh babu was murdered presently and youll understand the burra bazar and jora bagan sections are the two worst ones for heavy cases but colootollah is the most aggravating theres colootollah over yonderthat patch of darkness beyond the lights that section is full of tuppennyhapenny petty cases that keep the men up all night and make em swear youll see colootollah and then perhaps youll understand bamun bustee is the quietest of all and lal bazar and bow bazar as you can see for yourself are the rowdiest youve no notion what the natives come to the police station for a man will come on and want a summons against his master for refusing him halfanhours leave i suppose it does seem rather revolutionary to an upcountry man but they try to do it here now wait a minute before we go down into the city and see the fire brigade turned out business is slack with them just now but you time em and see an order is given and a bell strikes softly thrice there is a rush of men the click of a bolt a red fireengine spitting and swearing with the sparks flying from the furnace is dragged out of its shelter a huge brake which holds supplementary horses men and hatchets follows and a hosecart is the third on the list the men push the heavy things about as though they were pith toys the men clamber up some one says softly all ready there and with an angry whistle the fireengine followed by the other two flies out into lal bazar time1 min 40 secs theyll find out its a false alarm and come back again in five minutes why because there will be no constables on the road to give em the direction of the fire and because the driver wasnt told the ward of the outbreak when he went out do you mean to say that you can from this absurd pigeonloft locate the wards in the nighttime what would be the good of a lookout if the man couldnt tell where the fire was but its all pitchy black and the lights are so confusing  youll be more confused in ten minutes youll have lost your way as you never lost it before youre going to go round bow bazar section  and the lord have mercy on my soul calcutta the darker portion of it does not look an inviting place to dive into at night     chapter vi  the city of dreadful night      and since they cannot spend or use aright       the little time here given them in trust     but lavish it in weary undelight       of foolish toil and trouble strife and lust     they naturally clamour to inherit     the everlasting futurethat their merit       may have full scope as surely is most just      the city of dreadful night   the difficulty is to prevent this account from growing steadily unwholesome but one cannot rake through a big city without encountering muck  the police kept their word in five short minutes as they had prophesied their charge was lost as he had never been lost before where are we now somewhere off the chitpore road but you wouldnt understand if you were told follow now and step pretty much where we steptheres a good deal of filth hereabouts  the thick greasy night shuts in everything we have gone beyond the ancestral houses of the ghoses of the boses beyond the lamps the smells and the crowd of chitpore road and have come to a great wilderness of packed housesjust such mysterious conspiring tenements as dickens would have loved there is no breeze here and the air is perceptibly warmer if calcutta keeps such luxuries as commissioners of sewers and paving they die before they reach this place the air is heavy with a faint sour stenchthe essence of longneglected abominationsand it cannot escape from among the tall threestoried houses this my dear sir is a perfectly respectable quarter as quarters go that house at the head of the alley with the elaborate stuccowork round the top of the door was built long ago by a celebrated midwife great people used to live here once now its theaha look out for that carriage a big mailphaeton crashes out of the darkness and recklessly driven disappears the wonder is how it ever got into this maze of narrow streets where nobody seems to be moving and where the dull throbbing of the citys life only comes faintly and by snatches now its the what the st johns wood of calcuttafor the rich babus that fitton belonged to one of them well its not much of a place to look at dont judge by appearances about here live the women who have beggared kings we arent going to let you down into unadulterated vice all at once you must see it first with the gilding onand mind that rotten board  stand at the bottom of a lift shaft and look upwards then you will get both the size and the design of the tiny courtyard round which one of these big dark houses is built the central square may be perhaps ten feet every way but the balconies that run inside it overhang and seem to cut away half the available space to reach the square a man must go round many corners down a coveredin way and up and down two or three baffling and confused steps now you will understand say the police kindly as their charge blunders shinfirst into a welldark winding staircase that these are not the sort of places to visit alone who wants to of all the disgusting inaccessible densholy cupid whats this  a glare of light on the stairhead a clink of innumerable bangles a rustle of much fine gauze and the dainty iniquity stands revealed blazingliterally blazingwith jewellery from head to foot take one of the fairest miniatures that the delhi painters draw and multiply it by ten throw in one of angelica kaufmanns best portraits and add anything that you can think of from beckford to lalla rookh and you will still fall short of the merits of that perfect face for an instant even the grim professional gravity of the police is relaxed in the presence of the dainty iniquity with the gems who so prettily invites every one to be seated and proffers such refreshments as she conceives the palates of the barbarians would prefer her maids are only one degree less gorgeous than she half a lakh or fifty thousand pounds worthit is easier to credit the latter statement than the formerare disposed upon her little body each hand carries five jewelled rings which are connected by golden chains to a great jewelled boss of gold in the centre of the back of the hand earrings weighted with emeralds and pearls diamond noserings and how many other hundred articles make up the list of adornments english furniture of a gorgeous and gimcrack kind unlimited chandeliers and a collection of atrocious continental prints are scattered about the house and on every landing squats or loafs a bengali who can talk english with unholy fluency the recurrence suggestsonly suggests minda grim possibility of the affectation of excessive virtue by day tempered with the sort of unwholesome enjoyment after duskthis loafing and lobbying and chattering and smoking and unless the bottles lie tippling among the foultongued handmaidens of the dainty iniquity how many men follow this double deleterious sort of life the police are discreetly dumb  now dont go talking about domiciliary visits just because this one happens to be a pretty woman weve got to know these creatures they make the rich man and the poor spend their money and when a man cant get money for em honestly he comes under our notice now do you see if there was any domiciliary visit about it the whole houseful would be hidden past our finding as soon as we turned up in the courtyard were friendsto a certain extent and indeed it seemed no difficult thing to be friends to any extent with the dainty iniquity who was so surpassingly different from all that experience taught of the beauty of the east here was the face from which a man could write lalla rookhs by the dozen and believe every work that he wrote hers was the beauty that byron sang of when he wrote  remember if you come here alone the chances are that youll be clubbed or stuck or anyhow mobbed youll understand that this part of the world is shut to europeansabsolutely mind the steps and follow on the vision dies out in the smells and gross darkness of the night in evil timerotten brickwork and another wilderness of shutup houses  follows after another plunge into a passage of a courtyard and up a staircase the apparition of a fat vice in whom is no sort of romance nor beauty but unlimited coarse humour she too is studded with jewels and her house is even finer than the house of the other and more infested with the extraordinary men who speak such good english and are so deferential to the police the fat vice has been a great leader of fashion in her day and stripped a zemindar raja to his last acreinsomuch that he ended in the house of correction for a theft committed for her sake native opinion has it that she is a monstrous wellpreserved woman on this point as on some others the races will agree to differ  the scene changes suddenly as a slide in a magic lantern dainty iniquity and fat vice slide away on a roll of streets and alleys each more squalid than its predecessor we are somewhere at the back of the machua bazar well in the heart of the city there are no houses herenothing but acres and acres it seems of foul wattleanddab huts any one of which would be a disgrace to a frontier village the whole arrangement is a neatly contrived germ and fire trap reflecting great credit upon the calcutta municipality  what happens when these pigsties catch fire theyre built up again say the police as though this were the natural order of things land is immensely valuable here all the more reason then to turn several hausmanns loose into the city with instructions to make barracks for the population that cannot find room in the huts and sleeps in the open ways cherishing dogs and worse much worse in its unwashen bosom here is a licensed coffeeshop this is where your servants go for amusement and to see nautches there is a huge thatch shed ingeniously ornamented with insecure kerosene lamps and crammed with drivers cooks small storekeepers and the like never a sign of a european why because if an englishman messed about here hed get into trouble men dont come here unless theyre drunk or have lost their way the hackdriversthey have the privilege of voting have they notlook peaceful enough as they squat on tables or crowd by the doors to watch the nautch that is going forward five pitiful draggletails are huddled together on a bench under one of the lamps while the sixth is squirming and shrieking before the impassive crowd she sings of love as understood by the orientalthe love that dries the heart and consumes the liver in this place the words that would look so well on paper have an evil and ghastly significance the men stare or sup tumblers and cups of a filthy decoction and the kunchenee howls with renewed vigour in the presence of the police where the dainty iniquity was hung with gold and gems she is trapped with pewter and glass and where there was heavy embroidery on the fat vices dress defaced stamped tinsel faithfully reduplicates the pattern on the tawdry robes of the kunchenee  two or three men with uneasy consciences have quietly slipped out of the coffeeshop into the mazes of the huts the police laugh and those nearest in the crowd laugh applausively as in duty bound perhaps the rabbits grin uneasily when the ferret lands at the bottom of the burrow and begins to clear the warren  the chandooshops shut up at six so youll have to see opiumsmoking before dark some day no you wont though the detective makes for a halfopened door of a hut whence floats the fragrance of the black smoke those of the inhabitants who are able promptly clear outthey have no love for the policeand there remain only four men lying down and one standing up this latter has a pet mongoose coiled round his neck he speaks english fluently yes he has no fear it was a private smoking party andno business tonightshow how you smoke opium aha you want to see very good i show hiya youhe kicks a man on the floorshow how opiumsmoke the kickee grunts lazily and turns on his elbow the mongoose always keeping to the mans neck erects every hair of its body like an angry cat and chatters in its owners ear the lamp for the opiumpipe is the only one in the room and lights a scene as wild as anything in the witches revel the mongoose acting as the familiar spirit a voice from the ground says in tones of infinite weariness you take afim soa long long pause and another kick from the man possessed of the devilthe mongoose you take afim he takes a pellet of the black treacly stuff on the end of a knittingneedle and light afim he plunges the pellet into the nightlight where it swells and fumes greasily and then you put it in your pipe the smoking pellet is jammed into the tiny bowl of the thick bamboostemmed pipe and all speech ceases except the unearthly chitter of the mongoose the man on the ground is sucking at his pipe and when the smoking pellet has ceased to smoke will be halfway to nibban now you go says the man with the mongoose i am going smoke the hut floor closes upon a redlit view of huddled legs and bodies and the man with the mongoose sinking sinking on to his knees his head bowed forward and the little hairy devil chattering on the nape of his neck  after this the fetid night air seems almost cool for the hut is as hot as a furnace now for colootollah come through the huts there is no decoration about this vice  the huts now gave place to houses very tall and spacious and very dark but for the narrowness of the streets we might have stumbled upon chowringhi in the dark an hour and a half has passed and up to this time we have not crossed our trail once you might knock about the city for a night and never cross the same line recollect calcutta isnt one of your poky upcountry cities of a lakh and a half of people how long does it take to know it then about a lifetime and even then some of the streets puzzle you how much has the head of a ward to know every house in his ward if he can who owns it what sort of character the inhabitants are who are their friends who go out and in who loaf about the place at night and so on and so on and he knows all this by night as well as by day of course why shouldnt he no reason in the world only its pitchy black just now and id like to see where this alley is going to end round the corner beyond that dead wall theres a lamp there then youll be able to see a shadow flits out of a gulley and disappears whos that sergeant of police just to see where were going in case of accidents another shadow staggers into the darkness whos that soldier from the fort or a sailor from the ships i couldnt quite see the police open a shut door in a high wall and stumble unceremoniously among a gang of women cooking their food the floor is of beaten earth the steps that lead into the upper stories are unspeakably grimy and the heat is the heat of april the women rise hastily and the light of the bulls eyefor the police have now lighted a lantern in regular london fashionshows six bleared facesone a halfnative halfchinese one and the others bengali there are no men here they cry the house is empty then they grin and jabber and chew pan and spit and hurry up the steps into the darkness a range of three big rooms has been knocked into one here and there is some sort of arrangement of mats but an average countrybred is more sumptuously accommodated in an englishmans stable a horse would snort at the accommodation  nice sort of place isnt it say the police genially this is where the sailors get robbed and drunk they must be blind drunk before they come nana na sailor men eeyah chorus the women catching at the one word they understand arl gone the police take no notice but tramp down the big room with the mat looseboxes a woman is shivering in one of these whats the matter fever seek vary vary seek she huddles herself into a heap on the charpoy and groans  a tiny pitchblack closet opens out of the long room and into this the police plunge hullo whats here down flashes the lantern and a white hand with black nails comes out of the gloom somebody is asleep or drunk in the cot the ring of lantern light travels slowly up and down the body a sailor from the ships hell be robbed before the morning most likely the man is sleeping like a little child both arms thrown over his head and he is not unhandsome he is shoeless and there are huge holes in his stockings he is a pureblooded white and carries the flush of innocent sleep on his cheeks  the light is turned off and the police depart while the woman in the loosebox shivers and moans that she is seek vary vary seek     chapter vii  deeper and deeper still      i built myself a lordly pleasurehouse       wherein at ease for aye to dwell     i saido soul make merry and carouse       dear soulfor all is well      the palace of art   and where next i dont like colootollah the police and their charge are standing in the interminable waste of houses under the starlight to the lowest sink of all but you wouldnt know if you were told they lead till they come to the last circle of the infernoa long quiet winding road there you are you can see for yourself  but there is nothing to be seen on one side are housesgaunt and dark naked and devoid of furniture on the other low mean stalls lighted and with shamelessly open doors where women stand and mutter and whisper one to another there is a hush here or at least the busy silence of an officer of countinghouse in working hours one look down the street is sufficient lead on gentlemen of the calcutta police we do not love the lines of open doors the flaring lamps within the glimpses of the tawdry toilettables adorned with little plaster dogs glass balls from christmastrees andfor religion must not be despised though women be fallenpictures of the saints and statuettes of the virgin the street is a long one and other streets full of the same pitiful wares branch off from it  why are they so quiet why dont they make a row and sing and shout and so on why should they poor devils say the police and fall to telling tales of horror of women decoyed and shot into this trap then other tales that shatter ones belief in all things and folk of good repute how can you police have faith in humanity  thats because youre seeing it all in a lump for the first time and its not nice that way makes a man jump rather doesnt it but recollect youve asked for the worst places and you cant complain whos complaining bring on your atrocities isnt that a european woman at that door yes mrs d widow of a soldier mother of seven children nine if you please and good evening to you shrills mrs d leaning against the doorpost her arms folded on her bosom she is a rather pretty slightly made eurasian and whatever shame she may have owned she has long since cast behind her a shapeless burmonative trot with high cheekbones and mouth like a shark calls mrs d memsahib the word jars unspeakably her life is a matter between herself and her maker but in that shethe widow of a soldier of the queenhas stooped to this common foulness in the face of the city she has offended against the white race youre from upcountry and of course you dont understand there are any amount of that lot in the city say the police then the secret of the insolence of calcutta is made plain small wonder the natives fail to respect the sahib seeing what they see and knowing what they know in the good old days the honourable the directors deported him or her who misbehaved grossly and the white man preserved his face he may have been a ruffian but he was a ruffian on a large scale he did not sink in the presence of the people the natives are quite right to take the wall of the sahib who has been at great pains to prove that he is of the same flesh and blood  all this time mrs d stands on the threshold of her room and looks upon the men with unabashed eyes mrs d is a lady with a story she is not averse to telling it what wasahemthe case in which you wereerhmnconcerned mrs d they said id poisoned my husband by putting something into his drinking water this is interesting andahdid you twasnt proved says mrs d with a laugh a pleasant ladylike laugh that does infinite credit to her education and upbringing worthy mrs d it would pay a novelista french one let us sayto pick you out of the stews and make you talk  the police move forward into a region of mrs ds everywhere are the empty houses and the babbling women in print gowns the clocks in the city are close upon midnight but the police show no signs of stopping they plunge hither and thither like wreckers into the surf and each plunge brings up a sample of misery filth and woe  a womaneurasianrises to a sitting position on a cot and blinks sleepily at the police then she throws herself down with a grunt whats the matter with you i live in markiss lane andthis with intense gravityim so drunk she has a rather striking gipsylike face but her language might be improved  come along say the police well head back to bentinck street and put you on the road to the great eastern they walk long and steadily and the talk falls on gambling hells you ought to see our men rush one of em when weve marked a hell down we post men at the entrances and carry it sometimes the chinese bite but as a rule they fight fair its a pity we hadnt a hell to show you lets go in herethere may be something forward here appears to be in the heart of a chinese quarter for the pigtailsdo they ever go to bedare scuttling about the streets never go into a chinese place alone say the police and swing open a postern gate in a strong green door two chinamen appear  what are we going to see japanese girno we arent by jove catch that chinaman quick the pigtail is trying to double back across a courtyard into an inner chamber but a large hand on his shoulder spins him round and puts him in rear of the line of advancing englishmen who are be it observed making a fair amount of noise with their boots a second door is thrown open and the visitors advance into a large square room blazing with gas here thirteen pigtails deaf and blind to the outer world are bending over a table the captured chinaman dodges uneasily in the rear of the procession fivetenfifteen seconds pass the englishmen standing in the full light less than three paces from the absorbed gang who see nothing then the burly superintendent brings his hand down on his thigh with a crack like a pistolshot and shouts how do john follows a frantic rush of scared celestials almost tumbling over each other in their anxiety to get clear one pigtail scoops up a pile of copper money another a chinaware soupbowl and only a little mound of accusing cowries remains on the white matting that covers the table in less than half a minute two facts are forcibly brought home to the visitor first that a pigtail is largely composed of silk and rasps the palm of the hand as it slides through and secondly that the forearm of a chinaman is surprisingly muscular and welldeveloped whats going to be done nothing there are only three of us and all the ringleaders would get away weve got em safe any time we want to catch em if this little visit doesnt make em shift their quarters hi john no pidgin tonight show how you makee play that fat youngster there is our informer  half the pigtails have fled into the darkness but the remainder assured and trebly assured that the police really mean no pidgin return to the table and stand round while the croupier manipulates the cowries the little curved slip of bamboo and the soupbowl they never gamble these innocents they only come to look on and smoke opium in the next room yet as the game progresses their eyes light up and one by one put their money on odd or eventhe number of the cowries that are covered and left uncovered by the little soupbowl mythan is the name of the amusement and whatever may be its demerits it is clean the police look on while their charge plays and loots a parchmentskinned horrorone of swifts struldburgs strayed from laputaof the enormous sum of two annas the return of this wealth doubled sets the loser beating his forehead against the table from sheer gratitude  most immoral game this a man might drop five whole rupees if he began playing at sundown and kept it up all night dont you ever play whist occasionally  now we didnt bring you round to make fun of this department a man can lose as much as ever he likes and he can fight as well and if he loses all his money he steals to get more a chinaman is insane about gambling and half his crime comes from it it must be kept down here we are in bentinck street and you can be driven to the great eastern in a few minutes joss houses oh yes if you want more horrors superintendent lamb will take you round with him tomorrow afternoon at five good night  the police depart and in a few minutes the silent respectability of old council house street with the grim free kirk at the end of it is reached all good calcutta has gone to bed the last tram has passed and the peace of the night is upon the world would it be wise and rational to climb the spire of that kirk and shout o true believers decency is a fraud and a sham there is nothing clean or pure or wholesome under the stars and we are all going to perdition together amen on second thoughts it would not for the spire is slippery the night is hot and the police have been specially careful to warn their charge that he must not be carried away by the sight of horrors that cannot be written or hinted at  good morning says the policeman tramping the pavement in front of the great eastern and he nods his head pleasantly to show that he is the representative of law and peace and that the city of calcutta is safe from itself for the present     chapter viii  concerning lucia   time must be filled in somehow till five this afternoon when superintendent lamb will reveal more horrors why not the trams aiding go to the old park street cemetery  you want go park street no trams going park street you get out here calcutta tram conductors are not polite the car shuffles unsympathetically down the street and the evicted is stranded in dhurrumtollah which may be the hammersmith highway of calcutta providence arranged this mistake and paved the way to a great discovery now published for the first time dhurrumtollah is full of the people of india walking in family parties and groups and confidential couples and the people of india are neither hindu nor mussulmanjew ethiop gueber or expatriated british they are the eurasians and there are hundreds and hundreds of them in dhurrumtollah now there is papa with a shining black hat fit for a counsellor of the queen and mamma whose silken dress is tight upon her portly figure and the brood made up of strawhatted olivecheeked sharpeyed little boys and leggy maidens wearing white openwork stockings calculated to show dust there are the young men who smoke bad cigars and carry themselves lordilysuch as have incomes there are also the young women with the beautiful eyes and the wonderful dresses which always fit so badly across the shoulders and they carry prayerbooks or baskets because they are either going to mass or the market without doubt these are the people of india they were born in it bred in it and will die in it the englishman only comes to the country and the natives of course were there from the first but these people have been made here and no one has done anything for them except talk and write about them yet they belong some of them to old and honourable families hold houses in sealdah and are rich a few of them they all look prosperous and contented and they chatter eternally in that curious dialect that no one has yet reduced to print beyond what little they please to reveal now and again in the newspapers we know nothing about their life which touches so intimately the white on the one hand and the black on the other it must be interestingmore interesting than the colourless angloindian article but who has treated of it there was one novel once in which the second heroine was an eurasienne she was a strictly subordinate character and came to a sad end the poet of the race henry deroziohe of whom mr thomas edwards wrote a historywas bitten with keats and scott and shelley and overlooked in his search for material things that lay nearest to him all this mass of humanity in dhurrumtollah is unexploited and almost unknown wanted therefore a writer from among the eurasians who shall write so that men shall be pleased to read a story of eurasian life then outsiders will be interested in the people of india and will admit that the race has possibilities  a futile attempt to get to park street from dhurrumtollah ends in the marketthe hogg market men call it perhaps a knight of that name built it it is not onehalf as pretty as the crawford market in bombay but  it appears to be the trysting place of young calcutta the natural inclination of youth is to lie abed late and to let the seniors do all the hard work why therefore should pyramus who has to be ruling account forms at ten and thisbe who cannot be interested in the price of secondquality beef wander in studiously correct raiment round and about the stalls before the sun is well clear of the earth pyramus carries a walking stick with imitation silver straps upon it and there are cloth tops to his boots but his collar has been two days worn thisbe

street cemetery a hundred hackdrivers leap from their boxes and invade the market and after a short struggle one of them uncarts his capture in a burialgrounda ghastly new place close to a tramway this is not what is wanted the living dead are herethe people whose names are not yet altogether perished and whose tombstones are tended where are the old dead nobody goes there says the driver it is up that road he points up a long and utterly deserted thoroughfare running between high walls this is the place and the entrance to it with its gardener waiting with one brown battered rose for the visitor its grilled door and its professional notices bears a hideous likeness to the entrance of simla churchyard but once inside the sightseer stands in the heart of utter desolationall the more forlorn for being swept up lower park street cuts a great graveyard in two the guidebooks will tell you when the place was opened and when it was closed the eye is ready to swear that it is as old as herculaneum and pompeii the tombs are small houses it is as though we walked down the streets of a town so tall are they and so closely do they standa town shrivelled by fire and scarred by frost and siege men must have been afraid of their friends rising up before the due time that they weighted them with such cruel mounds of masonry strong man weak woman or somebodys infant son aged fifteen months for each the squat obelisk the defaced classic temple the cellaret of chunam or the candlestick of brickworkthe heavy slab the rusteaten railings the whopperjawed cherubs and the apoplectic angels men were rich in those days and could afford to put a hundred cubic feet of masonry into the grave of even so humble a person as jno clements captain of the country service 1820 when the dearly beloved had held rank answering to that of commissioner the efforts are still more sumptuous and the verse well the following speaks for itself      soft on thy tomb shall fond remembrance shed       the warm yet unavailing tear     and purple flowers that deck the honoured dead       shall strew the loved and honoured bier  failure to comply with the contract does not let us hope entail forfeiture of the earnestmoney or the honoured dead might be grieved the slab is out of his tomb and leans foolishly against it the railings are rotted and there are no more lasting ornaments than blisters and stains which are the work of the weather and not the result of the warm yet unavailing tear  let us go about and moralise cheaply on the tombstones trailing the robe of pious reflection up and down the pathways of the grave here is a big and stately tomb sacred to lucia who died in 1776 ad aged 23 here also be lichened verses which an irreverent thumb can bring to light thus they wrote when their hearts were heavy in them one hundred and sixteen years ago      what needs the emblem what the plaintive strain       what all the arts that sculpture eer expressed     to tell the treasure that these walls contain       let those declare it most who knew her best      the tender pity she would oft display       shall be with interest at her shrine returned     connubial love connubial tears repay       and lucia loved shall still be lucia mourned      though closed the lips though stopped the tuneful breath       the silent claycold monitress shall teach     in all the alarming eloquence of death       with double pathos to the heart shall preach      shall teach the virtuous maid the faithful wife       if young and fair that young and fair was she     then close the useful lesson of her life       and tell them what she is they soon must be  that goes well even after all these years does it not and seems to bring lucia very near in spite of what the later generation is pleased to call the stiltedness of the oldtime verse  who will declare the merits of luciadead in her spring before there was even a hickeys gazette to chronicle the amusements of calcutta and publish with scurrilous asterisks the liaisons of heads of departments what potbellied east indiaman brought the virtuous maid up the river and did lucia make her bargain as the cant of those times went on the first second or third day after her arrival or did she with the others of the batch give a spinsters ball as a last trialfollowing the custom of the country no she was a fair kentish maiden sent out at a cost of five hundred pounds english money under the captains charge to wed the man of her choice and he knew clive well had had dealings with omichand and talked to men who had lived through the terrible night in the black hole he was a rich man lucias battered tomb proves it and he gave lucia all that her heart could wish a greenpainted boat to take the air in on the river of evenings coffree slaveboys who could play on the french horn and even a very elegant neat coach with a genteel rutlan roof ornamented with flowers very highly finished ten best polished plate glasses ornamented with a few elegant medallions enriched with motheropearl that she might take her drive on the course as befitted a factors wife all these things he gave her and when the convoys came up the river and the guns thundered and the servants of the honourable the east india company drank to the kings health be sure that lucia before all the other ladies in the fort had her choice of the new stuffs from england and was cordially hated in consequence tilly kettle painted her picture a little before she died and the hotblooded young writers did duel with small swords in the fort ditch for the honour of piloting her through a minuet at the calcutta theatre or the punch house but warren hastings danced with her instead and the writers were confoundedevery man of them she was a toast far up the river and she walked in the evening on the bastions of fort william and said la i protest it was there that she exchanged congratulations with all her friends on the 20th of october when those who were alive gathered together to felicitate themselves on having come through another hot season and the meneven the sober factor saw no wrong heregot most royally and britishly drunk on madeira that had twice rounded the cape but lucia fell sick and the doctorhe who went home after seven years with five lakhs and a half and a corner of this vast graveyard to his accountsaid that it was a pukka or putrid fever and the system required strengthening so they fed lucia on hot curries and mulled wine worked up with spirits and fortified with spices for nearly a week at the end of which time she closed her eyes on the weary river and the fort for ever and a gallant with a turn for belleslettres wept openly as men did then and had no shame of it and composed the verses above set and thought himself a neat hand at the penstap his vitals but the factor was so grieved that he could write nothing at allcould only spend his moneyand he counted his wealth by lakhson a sumptuous grave a little later on he took comfort and when the next batch came out  but this has nothing whatever to do with the story of lucia the virtuous maid the faithful wife her ghost went to a big calcutta powder ball that very night and looked very beautiful i met her     among the railway folk     chapter i  mar 1888  a railway settlement   jamalpur is the headquarters of the east india railway this in itself is not a startling statement the wonder begins with the exploration of jamalpur which is a station entirely made by and devoted to the use of those untiring servants of the public the railway folk they have towns of their own at toondla and assensole a sundried sanitarium at bandikui and howrah ajmir allahabad lahore and pindi know their colonies but jamalpur is unadulteratedly railway and he who has nothing to do with the e i railway in some shape or another feels a stranger and an interloper running always east and southerly the train carries him from the torments of the northwest into the wet woolly warmth of bengal where may be found the hothouse heat that has ruined the temper of the good people of calcutta the land is fat and greasy with good living and the wealth of the bodies of innumerable dead things and herejust above mokamehmay be seen fields stretching without stick stone or bush to break the view from the railway line to the horizon  upcountry innocents must look at the map to learn that jamalpur is near the top lefthand corner of the big loop that the e i r throws out round bhagalpur and part of the barabanki districts northward of jamalpur as near as may be lies the ganges and tirhoot and eastward an offshoot of the volcanic rajmehal range blocks the view  a station which has neither judge commissioner deputy or stunt which is devoid of law courts ticcagharies district superintendents of police and many other evidences of an overcultured civilisation is a curiosity we administer ourselves says jamalpur proudly or we didtill we had local selfgovernment inand now the racketmarker administers us this is a solemn fact the station which had its beginnings thirty odd years ago used till comparatively recent times to control its own roads sewage conservancy and the like but with the introduction of local selfgovernment it was ordained that the inestimable boon should be extended to a place made by and maintained for europeans and a brandnew municipality was created and nominated according to the many rules of the game in the skirmish that ensued the club racketmarker fought his way to the front secured a place on a board largely composed of babus and since that day jamalpurs views on government have not been fit for publication to understand the magnitude of the insult one must study the cityfor station in the strict sense of the word it is not crotons palms mangoes mellingtonias teak and bamboos adorn it and the poinsettia and bougainvillea the railway creeper and the bignonia venusta make it gay with many colours it is laid out with military precision to each house its just share of garden its red brick path its growth of trees and its neat little wicket gate its general aspect in spite of the dutch formality is that of an english village such a thing as enterprising stagemanagers put on the theatres at home the hills have thrown a protecting arm round nearly three sides of it and on the fourth it is bounded by what are locally known as the sheds in other words the station offices and workshops of the company the e i r only exists for outsiders its servants speak of it reverently angrily despitefully or enthusiastically as the company and they never omit the big big c men must have treated the honourable the east india company in something the same fashion ages ago the company in jamalpur is lord dufferin all the members of council the bodyguard sir frederick roberts mr westland whose name is at the bottom of the currency notes the oriental life assurance company and the bengal government all rolled into one at first when a stranger enters this life he is inclined to scoff and ask in his ignorance what is this company that you talk so much about later on he ceases to scoff for the company is a big thingalmost big enough to satisfy an american  ere beginning to describe its doings let it be written and repeated several times hereafter that the e i r passenger carriages and especially the secondclass are just now horridbeing filthy and unwashen dirty to look at and dirty to live in having cast this small stone we will examine jamalpur when it was laid out in or before the mutiny year its designers allowed room for growth and made the houses of one general designsome of brick some of stone some three four and six roomed some single mens barracks and some twostoriedall for the use of the employés kings road princes road queens road and victoria roadjamalpur is loyalcut the breadth of the station and albert road church street and steam road the length of it neither on these roads or on any of the coolshaded smaller ones is anything unclean or unsightly to be found there is a dreary village in the neighbourhood which is said to make the most of any cholera that may be going but jamalpur itself is specklessly and spotlessly neat from st marys church to the railway station and from the buildings where they print daily about half a lakh of tickets to the ringing roaring rattling workshops everything has the air of having been cleaned up at ten that very morning and put under a glass case there is a holy calm about the roadstotally unlike anything in an english manufacturing town wheeled conveyances are few because every mans bungalow is close to his work and when the day has begun and the offices of the loco and traffic have soaked up their thousands of natives and hundreds of europeans you shall pass under the dappled shadows of the trees hearing nothing louder than the croon of some bearer playing with a child in the verandah or the faint tinkle of a piano this is pleasant and produces an impression of watteaulike refinement tempered with arcadian simplicity the dry anguished howl of the buzzer the big steamwhistle breaks the hush and all jamalpur is alive with the tramping of tiffinseeking feet the company gives one hour for meals between eleven and twelve on the stroke of noon there is another rush back to the works or the offices and jamalpur sleeps through the afternoon till four or halfpast and then rouses for tennis at the institute  in the hot weather it splashes in the swimming bath or reads for it has a library of several thousand books one of the most nourishing lodges in the bengal jurisdictionst george in the eastlives at jamalpur and meets twice a month its members point out with justifiable pride that all the fittings were made by their own hands and the lodge in its accoutrements and the energy of the craftsmen can compare with any in india but the institute is the central gathering place and its halfdozen tenniscourts and neatlylaidout grounds seem to be always full here if a stranger could judge the greater part of the flirtation of jamalpur is carried out and here the dashing apprenticethe apprentices are the liveliest of alllearns that there are problems harder than any he studies at the night school and that the heart of a maiden is more inscrutable than the mechanism of a locomotive on tuesdays and fridays the volunteers parade a and b companies 150 strong in all of the e i r volunteers are stationed here with the band their uniform grey with red facings is not lovely but they know how to shoot and drill they have to the company makes it a condition of service that a man must be a volunteer and volunteer in something more than name he must be or some one will ask the reason why seeing that there are no regulars between howrah and dinapore the company does well in exacting this toll some of the old soldiers are wearied of drill some of the youngsters dont like it butthe way they entrain and detrain is worth seeing they are as mobile a corps as can be desired and perhaps ten or twelve years hence the government may possibly be led to take a real interest in them and spend a few thousand rupees in providing them with real soldiers kitsnot uniform and rifle merely their ranks include all sorts and conditions of menheads of the loco and traffic the company is no respecter of rankclerks in the audit boys from mercantile firms at home fighting with the intricacies of time fare and freight tables guards who have grown grey in the service of the company mail and passenger drivers with nerves of castiron who can shoot through a long afternoon without losing temper or flurrying lightblue east indians tyneside men slow of speech and uncommonly strong in the arm lathy apprentices who have not yet filled out fitters turners foremen full assistant and subassistant stationmasters and a host of others in the hands of the younger men the regulation martinihenri naturally goes off the line occasionally on hunting expeditions  there is a twelvehundred yards range running down one side of the station and the condition of the grass by the firing butts tells its own tale scattered in the ranks of the volunteers are a fair number of old soldiers for the company has a weakness for recruiting from the army for its guards who may in time become stationmasters a good man from the army with his papers all correct and certificates from his commanding officer can after depositing twenty pounds to pay his home passage in the event of his services being dispensed with enter the companys service on something less than one hundred rupees a month and rise in time to four hundred as a stationmaster a railway bungalowand they are as substantially built as the engineswill cost him more than oneninth of the pay of his grade and the provident fund provides for his latter end  think for a moment of the number of men that a line running from howrah to delhi must use and you will realise what an enormous amount of patronage the company holds in its hands naturally a father who has worked for the line expects the line to do something for the son and the line is not backward in meeting his wishes where possible the sons of old servants may be taken on at fifteen years of age or thereabouts as apprentices in the shops receiving twenty rupees in the first and fifty in the last year of their indentures then they come on the books as full men on perhaps rs 65 a month and the road is open to them in many ways they may become foremen of departments on rs 500 a month or drivers earning with overtime rs 370 or if they have been brought into the audit or the traffic they may control innumerable babus and draw several hundreds of rupees monthly or at eighteen or nineteen they may be ticketcollectors working up to the grade of guard etc every rank of the huge human hive has a desire to see its sons placed properly and the native workmen about three thousand in the locomotive department only are said one man making a family affair of it altogether you see all those men turning brass and looking after the machinery theyve all got relatives and a lot of em own land out monghyrway close to us they bring on their sons as soon as they are old enough to do anything and the company rather encourages it you see the father is in a way responsible for his son and hell teach him all he knows and in that way the company has a hold on them all youve no notion how sharp a native is when hes working on his own hook all the district round here right up to monghyr is more or less dependent on the railway  the babus in the traffic department in the stores issue department in all the departments where men sit through the long long indian day among ledgers and check and pencil and deal in figures and items and rupees may be counted by hundreds imagine the struggle among them to locate their sons in comfortable canebottomed chairs in front of a big pewter inkstand and stacks of paper the babus make beautiful accountants and if we could only see it a merciful providence has made the babu for figures and detail without him the dividends of any company would be eaten up by the expenses of english or citybred clerks the babu is a great man and to respect him you must see five score or so of him in a room a hundred yards long bending over ledgers ledgers and yet more ledgerssilent as the sphinx and busy as a bee he is the lubricant of the great machinery of the company whose ways and works cannot be dealt with in a single scrawl     chapter ii  the shops   the railway folk like the army and civilian castes have their own language and life which an outsider cannot hope to understand for instance when jamalpur refers to itself as being on the long siding a lengthy explanation is necessary before the visitor grasps the fact that the whole of the two hundred and thirty odd miles of the loop from luckeeserai to kanujunction via bhagalpur is thus contemptuously treated jamalpur insists that it is out of the world and makes this an excuse for being proud of itself and all its institutions but in one thing it is badly disgracefully provided at a moderate estimate there must be about two hundred europeans with their families in this place they can and do get their small supplies from calcutta but they are dependent on the tender mercies of the bazaar for their meat which seems to be hawked from door to door there is a raja who owns or has an interest in the land on which the station stands and he is averse to cowkilling for these reasons jamalpur is not too well supplied with good meat and what it wants is a decent meatmarket with cleanly controlled slaughtering arrangements the company who gives grants to the schools and builds the institute and throws the shadow of its protection all over the place might help this scheme forward  the heart of jamalpur is the shops and here a visitor will see more things in an hour than he can understand in a year steam street very appropriately leads to the forty or fifty acres that the shops cover and to the busy silence of the loco superintendents office where a man must put down his name and his business on a slip of paper before he can penetrate into the temple of vulcan about three thousand five hundred men are in the shops and ten minutes after the days work has begun the assistant superintendent knows exactly how many are in the heads of departmentssilent heavyhanded men captains of five hundred or morehave their names fairly printed on a board which is exactly like a poolmarker they star a life when they come in and their few names alone represent salaries to the extent of six thousand a month they are men worth hearing deferentially they hail from manchester and the clyde and the great ironworks of the north pleasant as cold water in a thirsty land is it to hear again the full northumbrian burr or the longdrawn yorkshire aye under their great gravity of demeanoura man who is in charge of a few lakhs worth of plant cannot afford to be riotously mirthfullurks melody and humour they can sing like northcountrymen and in their hours of ease go back to the speech of the iron countries they have left behind when ab o th yate and all ben briarlys shrewd wit shakes the warm air of bengal with deepchested laughter hear ruglan toon with a chorus as true as the fall of triphammers and fancy that you are back again in the smoky rattling ringing north  but this is the unofficial side go forward through the gates under the mango trees and set foot at once in sheds which have as little to do with mangoes as a locomotive with lakshmi the buzzer howls for it is nearly tiffin time there is a rush from every quarter of the shops a cloud of flying natives and a procession of more sedately pacing englishmen and in three short minutes you are left absolutely alone among arrested wheels and belts pulleys cranks and cranesin a silence only broken by the soft sigh of a faraway steamvalve or the cooing of pigeons you are by favour freely granted at liberty to wander anywhere you please through the deserted works walk into a huge brickbuilt tinroofed stable capable of holding twentyfour locomotives under treatment and see what must be done to the iron horse once in every three years if he is to do his work well on reflection iron horse is wrong an engine is a sheas distinctly feminine as a ship or a mine here stands the echo her wheels off resting on blocks her underside machinery taken out and her side scrawled with mysterious hieroglyphics in chalk an enormous greenpainted iron harnessrack bears her piston and eccentric rods and a neatly painted board shows that such and such englishmen are the fitter assistant and apprentice engaged in editing that echo an engine seen from the platform and an engine viewed from underneath are two very different things the one is as unimpressive as a cart the other as imposing as a manofwar in the yard  in this manner is an engine treated for navicular laminitis backsinew or whatever it is that engines most suffer from no 607 we will say goes wrong at dinapore assensole buxar or wherever it may be after three years work the place she came from is stencilled on the boiler and the foreman examines her then he fills in a hospital sheet which bears one hundred and eighty printed heads under which an engine can come into the shops no 607 needs repair in only one hundred and eighteen particulars ranging from mudholeflanges and blowercocks to leadplugs and platform brackets which have shaken loose this certificate the foreman signs and it is framed near the engine for the benefit of the three europeans and the eight or nine natives who have to mend no 607 to the ignorant the superhuman wisdom of the examiner seems only equalled by the audacity of the two men and the boy who are to undertake what is frivolously called the job no 607 is in a sorely mangled condition but 403 is much worse she is reduced to a shellis a very ellewoman of an engine bearing only her funnel the iron frame and the saddle that supports the boiler  fourandtwenty engines in every stage of decomposition stand in one huge shop a travelling crane runs overhead and the men have hauled up one end of a bright vermilion loco the effect is the silence of a scornful starejust such a look as a colonels portly wife gives through her pincenez at the audacious subaltern engines are the livest things that man ever made they glare through their spectacleplates they tilt their noses contemptuously and when their insides are gone they adorn themselves with red lead and leer like decayed beauties and in the jamalpur works there is no escape from them the shops can hold fifty without pressure and on occasion as many again everywhere there are engines and everywhere brass domes lie about on the ground like huge helmets in a pantomime the silence is the weirdest touch of all some sprightly soulan apprentice be surehas daubed in red lead on the end of an iron toolbox a caricature of some friend who is evidently a riveter the picture has all the interest of an egyptian cartouche for it shows that men have been here and that the engines do not have it all their own way  and so out in the open away from the three great sheds between and under more engines till we strike a wilderness of lines all converging to one turntable here be elephantstalls ranged round a halfcircle and in each stall stands one engine and each engine stares at the turntable a stolid and disconcerting company is this ringofeyes monsters 324 432 and 8 are shining like toys they are ready for their turn of duty and are as spruce as hansoms lacquered chocolate picked out with black red and white is their dress and delicate lemon graces the ceilings of the cabs the driver should be a gentleman in evening dress with white kid gloves and there should be goldheaded champagne bottles in the spick and span tenders huckleberry finn says of a timber raft it amounted to something being captain of that raft thrice enviable is the man who drawing rs 220 a month is allowed to make rs 150 overtime out of locos nos 324 432 or 8 fifty yards beyond this gorgeous trinity are ten to twelve engines who have put in to jamalpur to bait they are alive their fires are lighted and they are swearing and purring and growling one at another as they stand alone here is evidently one of the newest typeno 25 a giant who has just brought the mail in and waits to be cleaned up preparatory to going out afresh  the tiffin hour has ended the buzzer blows and with a roar a rattle and a clang the shops take up their toil the hubbub that followed on the princes kiss to the sleeping beauty was not so loud or sudden experience with a footrule in his pocket authority in his port and a merry twinkle in his eye comes up and catches ignorance walking gingerly round no 25 thats one of the best we have says experience a fourwheeled coupled bogie they call her shes by dobbs shes done her hundred and fifty miles today and shell run in to rampore haut this afternoon then shell rest a day and be cleaned up roughly she does her three hundred miles in the fourandtwenty hours shes a beauty shes out from home but we can build our own enginesall except the wheels were building ten locos now and weve got a dozen boilers ready if you care to look at them how long does a loco last thats just as may be she will do as much as her driver lets her some men play the mischief with a loco and some handle em properly our drivers prefer hawthornes old fourwheeled coupled engines because they give the least bother there is one in that shed and its a good un to travel but eighty thousand miles generally sees the gloss off an engine and she goes into the shops to be overhauled and refitted and replaned and a lot of things that you wouldnt understand if i told you about them no 1 the first loco on the line is running still but very little of the original engine must be left by this time that one there came out in the mutiny year shes by slaughter and grunning and shes built for speed in front of a light load frenchlooking sort of thing isnt she thats because her cylinders are on a tilt we used her for the mail once but the mail has grown heavier and heavier and now we use sixwheeled coupled eighteeninch inside cylinder 45ton locos to shift thousandton trains no all locos arent alike it isnt merely pulling a lever the company likes its drivers to know their locos and a man will keep his hawthorne for two or three years the more mileage he gets out of her before she has to be overhauled the better man he is it pays to let a man have his fancy engine a man must take an interest in his loco and that means she must belong to him some locos wont do anything even if you coax and humour them i dont think there are any unlucky ones now but some years ago no 31 wasnt popular the drivers went sick or took leave when they were told off for her she killed her driver on the jubbulpore line she left the rails at kajra she did something or other at rampur haut and lord knows what she didnt do or try to do in other places all the drivers fought shy of her and in the end she disappeared they said she was condemned but i shouldnt wonder if the company changed her number quietly and changed the luck at the same time you see the government inspector comes and looks at our stock now and again and when an engines condemned he puts his dhobimark on her and shes broken up well no 31 was condemned but there was a whisper that they only shifted her number and ran her out again when the drivers didnt know there were no accidents i dont think weve got an unlucky one running now some are different from others but there are no maneaters yes a driver of the mail is somebody he can make rs 370 a month if hes a covenanted man we get a lot of our drivers in the country and we dont import from england as much as we did stands to reason that now theres more competition both among lines and in the labour market the company cant afford to be as generous as it used to be it doesnt cheat a man though its this way with the drivers a native driver gets about rs 20 a month and in his way hes supposed to be good enough for branch work and shunting and such well an english driverll get from rs 80 to rs 220 and overtime the english driver knows what the native gets and in time they tell the driver that the nativell improve the driver has that to think of you see thats competition  experience returns to the enginesheds now full of clamour and enlarges on the beauties of sick locomotives the fitters and the assistants and the apprentices are hammering and punching and gauging and otherwise technically disporting themselves round their enormous patients and their language as caught in snatches is beautifully unintelligible  but one flying sentence goes straight to the heart it is the cry of humanity over the task of life done into unrefined english an apprentice grimed to his eyebrows his cloth cap well on the back of his curly head and his hands deep in his pockets is sitting on the edge of a toolbox ruefully regarding the very much disorganised engine whose slave is he a handsome boy this apprentice and well made he whistles softly between his teeth and his brow puckers then he addresses the engine half in expostulation and half in despair oh you condemned old female dog he puts the sentence more crisplymuch more crisplyand ignorance chuckles sympathetically  ignorance also is puzzled over these engines     chapter iii  vulcans forge   in the wilderness of the railway shopsand machinery that planes and shaves and bevels and stamps and punches and hoists and nipsthe first idea that occurs to an outsider when he has seen the men who people the place is that it must be the birthplace of inventionsa pastureground of fat patents if a writingman who plays with shadows and dresses dolls that others may laugh at their antics draws help and comfort and new methods of working old ideas from the stored shelves of a library how in the name of commonsense his god can a doingman whose mind is set upon things that snatch a few moments from flying time or put power into weak hands refrain from going forward and adding new inventions to the hundreds among which he daily moves  appealed to on this subject experience who had served the e i r loyally for many years held his peace we dont go in much for patents but he added with a praiseworthy attempt to turn the conversation we can build you any mortal thing you like weve got the bradford leslie steamer for the sahibgunge ferry come and see the brasswork for her bows its in the castingshed  it would have been cruel to have pressed experience further and ignorance to foredate matters a little went about to discover why experience shied off this question and why the men of jamalpur had not each and all invented and patented something he won his information in the end but did not come from jamalpur that must be clearly understood it was found anywhere you please between howrah and hoti mardan and here it is that all the world may admire a prudent and farsighted board of directors once upon a time as every one in the profession knows two men invented the d and o sleepercast iron of five pieces very serviceable the men were in the companys employ and their masters said your brains are ours hand us over those sleepers being of pay and position d and o made some sort of resistance and got a royalty or a bonus at any rate the company had to pay for its sleepers but thereafter and the condition exists to this day they caused it to be written in each servants covenant that if by chance he invented aught his invention was to belong to the company providence has mercifully arranged that no man or syndicate of men can buy the holy spirit of man outright without suffering in some way or another just as much as the purchase america fully and germany in part recognises this law the e i railways breach of it is thoroughly english they say or it is said of them that they say we are afraid of our men who belong to us wasting their time on trying to invent  is it wholly impossible then for men of mechanical experience and large sympathies to check the mere patenthunter and bring forward the man with an idea is there no supervision in the shops or have the men who play tennis and billiards at the institute not a minute which they can rightly call their very own would it ruin the richest company in india to lend their modelshop and their lathes to half a dozen or for the matter of that half a hundred abortive experiments a massachusetts organ factory a racine buggy shop an oregon lumberyard would laugh at the notion an american toymaker might swindle an employé after the invention but he would in his own interests help the man to see what comes of the thing surely a wealthy a powerful and as all jamalpur bears witness a considerate company might cut that clause out of the covenant and await the issue there would be quite enough jealousy between man and man grade and grade to keep down all but the keenest souls and with due respect to the steamhammer and the rollingmill we have not yet made machinery perfect the shops are not likely to spawn unmanageable stephensons or grasping brunels but in the minor turns of mechanical thought that find concrete expressions in links axleboxes joint packings valves and springstirrups something mightsomething wouldbe done were the practical prohibition removed will a north countryman give you anything but warm hospitality for nothing or if you claim from him overtime service as a right will he work zealously onything but t brass is his motto and his ideas are his brass  gentlemen in authority if this should meet your august eyes spare it a minutes thought and clearing away the floridity get to the heart of the mistake and see if it cannot be rationally put right above all remember that jamalpur supplied no information it was as mute as an oyster there is no one within your jurisdiction toahemdrop upon  let us after this excursion into the offices return to the shops and only ask experience such questions as he can without disloyalty answer  we used once says he leading to the foundry to sell our old rails and import new ones even when we used em for roof beams and so on we had more than we knew what to do with now we have got rollingmills and we use the rails to make tiebars for the d and o sleepers and all sorts of things we turn out five hundred d and o sleepers a day altogether we use about seventyfive tons of our own iron a month here iron in calcutta costs about fiveeight a hundredweight ours costs between threefour and threeeight and on that item alone we save three thousand a month dont ask me how many miles of rails we own there are fifteen hundred miles of line and you can make your own calculation all those things like babies graves down in that shed are the moulds for the d and o sleepers we test them by dropping three hundredweight and three hundred quarters of iron on top of them from a height of seven feet or eleven sometimes they dont often smash we have a notion here that our iron is as good as the home stuff  a sleek white and brindled pariah thrusts himself into the conversation his house appears to be on the warm ashes of the boltmaker this is a horrible machine which chews redhot iron bars and spits them out perfect bolts its manners are disgusting and it gobbles over its food  hi jack says experience stroking the interloper youve been trying to break your leg again thats the dog of the works at least he makes believe that the works belong to him hell follow any one of us about the shops as far as the gate but never a step further you can see hes in firstclass condition the boys give him his ticket and one of these days hell try to get on to the companys books as a regular worker hes too clever to live jack heads the procession as far as the walls of the rollingshed and then returns to his machinery room he waddles with fatness and despises strangers  how would you like to be hotpotted there says experience who has read and who is enthusiastic over she as he points to the great furnaces whence the slag is being dragged out by hooks here is the old material going into the furnace in that big iron bucket look at the scraps of iron theres an old d and o sleeper theres a lot of clips from a cylinder theres a lot of snippedup rails theres a drivingwheel block theres an old hook and a sprinkling of boilerplates and rivets  the bucket is tipped into the furnace with a thunderous roar and the slag below pours forth more quickly an engine says experience reflectively can run over herself so to say after shes broken up she is made into sleepers for the line youll see how shes broken up later a few paces further on seminude demons are capering over strips of glowing hot iron which are put into a mill as rails and emerge as thin shapely tiebars the natives wear rough sandals and some pretence of aprons but the greater part of them is all face as i said before says experience a natives cuteness when hes working on ticket is something startling beyond occasionally hanging on to a redhot bar too long and so letting their pincers be drawn through the mills these men take precious good care not to go wrong our machinery is fenced and guardrailed as much as possible and these men dont get caught up by the belting in the first place theyre carefulthe father warns the son and so onand in the second theres nothing about em for the belting to catch on unless the man shoves his hand in oh a natives no fool he knows that it doesnt do to be foolish when hes dealing with a crane or a drivingwheel youre looking at all those chopped rails we make our iron as they blend baccy we mix up all sorts to get the required quality those rails have just been chopped by this tobaccocutter thing experience bends down and sets a viciouslooking parrotheaded beam to work there is a quivera snapand a dull smash and a heavy rail is nipped in two like a stick of barleysugar  elsewhere a bullnosed hydraulic cutter is railcutting as if it enjoyed the fun in another shed stand the steamhammers the unemployed ones murmuring and muttering to themselves as is the uncanny custom of all steamsouled machinery experience with his hand on a long lever makes one of the monsters perform and though ignorance knows that a man designed and men do continually build steamhammers the effect is as though experience were maddening a chained beast the massive block slides down the guides only to pause hungrily an inch above the anvil or restlessly throb through a foot and a half of space each motion being controlled by an almost imperceptible handling of the levers when these things are newly overhauled you can regulate your blow to within an eighth of an inch says experience we had a foreman here once who could work em beautifully he had the touch one day a visitor no end of a swell in a tall white hat came round the works and our foreman borrowed the hat and brought the hammer down just enough to press the nap and no more how wonderful said the visitor putting his hand carelessly upon this lever rod here experience suits the action to the word and the hammer thunders on the anvil well you can guess for yourself next minute there wasnt enough left of that tall white hat to make a postagestamp of steamhammers arent things to play with now well go over to the stores   whatever apparent disorder there might have been in the works the store department is as clean as a new pin and stupefying in its naval order copper plates bar angle and rod iron duplicate cranks and slide bars the piston rods of the bradford leslie steamer engine grease files and hammerheadsevery conceivable article from leather laces of beltings to headlamps necessary for the due and proper working of a long line is stocked stacked piled and put away in appropriate compartments in the midst of it all neck deep in ledgers and indent forms stands the manyhanded babu the steam of the engine whose power extends from howrah to ghaziabad  the company does everything and knows everything the gallant apprentice may be a wild youth with an earnest desire to go occasionally upon the bend but three times a week between 7 and 8 pm he must attend the nightschool and sit at the feet of m bonnaud who teaches him mechanics and statics so thoroughly that even the awful government inspector is pleased and when there is no nightschool the company will by no means wash its hands of its men out of workinghours no man can be violently restrained from going to the bad if he insists upon it but in the service of the company a man has every warning his escapades are known and a judiciously arranged transfer sometimes keeps a good fellow clear of the downgrade no one can flatter himself that in the multitude he is overlooked or believe that between 4 pm and 9 am he is at liberty to misdemean himself sooner or later but generally sooner his goingson are known and he is reminded that britons never shall be slavesto things that destroy good work as well as souls maybe the company acts only in its own interest but the result is good  best and prettiest of the many good and pretty things in jamalpur is the institute of a saturday when the volunteer band is playing and the tennis courts are full and the babydom of jamalpurfat sturdy childrenfrolic round the bandstand the people dancebut big as the institute is it is getting too small for their dancesthey act they play billiards they study their newspapers they play cards and everything else and they flirt in a sumptuous building and in the hot weather the gallant apprentice ducks his friend in the big swimmingbath decidedly the railway folk make their lives pleasant  let us go down southward to the big giridih collieries and see the coal

company badahur the east indian railway     the giridih coalfields     chapter i  on the surface   southward always southward and easterly runs the calcutta mail from luckeeserai till she reaches madapur in the sonthal parganas from madapur a train largely made up of coaltrucks heads westward into the hazaribagh district and toward giridih a week would not have exhausted jamalpur and its environs as the guidebooks say but since time drives and man must een be driven the weird echoing bund in the hills above jamalpur where the owls hoot at night and hyenas come down to laugh over the grave of quilem roberts who died from the effects of an encounter with a tiger near this place ad 1864 goes undescribed nor is it possible to deal with monghyr the headquarters of the district where one sees for the first time the age of old bengal in the sleepy creepy station built in a timeeaten fort which runs out into the ganges and is full of quaint houses with fatlegged balustrades on the roofs pensioners certainly and probably a score of ghosts live in monghyr all the country seems haunted is there not at pir bahar a lonely house on a bluff the grave of a young lady who thirty years ago rode her horse down the cliff and perished has not monghyr a haunted house in which tradition says sceptics have seen much more than they could account for and is it not notorious throughout the countryside that the seven miles of road between jamalpur and monghyr are nightly paraded by tramping battalions of spectres phantoms of an oldtime army massacred who knows how long ago the common voice attests all these things and an eerie cemetery packed with blackened lichened candleextinguisher tombstones persuades the listener to believe all that he hears bengal is secondor third is itin order of seniority among the provinces and like an old nurse she tells many witchtales  but ghosts have nothing to do with collieries and that everpresent company the e i r has more or less made giridihprincipally more before the e i r came say the people we had one meal a day now we have two stomachs do not tell fibs whatever mouths may say that company in the course of business throws about five lakhs a year into the hazaribagh district in the form of wages alone and giridih bazaar has to supply the wants of twelve thousand men women and children but we have now the authority of a number of highsouled and intelligent native prints that the sahib of all grades spends his time in sucking the blood out of the country and flying to england to spend his illgotten gains  giridih is perfectly madquite insane geologically the country is in the metamorphic higher grounds that rise out of the alluvial flats of lower bengal between the osri and the barakar rivers translated this sentence means that you can twist your ankle on pieces of pure white pinky and yellowish granite slip over weatherworn sandstone grievously cut your boots over flakes of trap and throw hornblende pebbles at the dogs never was such a place for stonethrowing as giridih the general aspect of the country is falsely parklike because it swells and sinks in a score of grasscovered undulations and is adorned with plantationlike jungle there are low hills on every side and twelve miles away bearing south the blue bulk of the holy hill of parasnath greatest of the jain tirthankars overlooks the world in bengal they consider four thousand five hundred feet good enough for a dagshai or kasauli and once upon a time they tried to put troops on parasnath there was a scarcity of water and thomas of those days found the silence and seclusion prey upon his spirits since twenty years therefore parasnath has been abandoned by her majestys army  as to giridih itself the last few miles of train

rest or try to pigstick in harness are not traphorses worthy of endearing names but things to be poleaxed their feelings are hurt when you say this sit tight say the men of giridih were insured we cant be hurt  and now with grey hairs dry mouth and chattering teeth to the collieries the e i r estate bought or leased in perpetuity from the serampore raja may be about four miles long and between one and two miles across it is in two pieces the serampore field being separated from the karharbari or kurhurballi or kabarbari field by the property of the bengal coal company the raneegunge coal association lies to the east of all other workings so we have three companies at work on about eleven square miles of land  there is no such thing as getting a full view of the whole place a short walk over a grassy down gives on to an outcrop of very dirty sandstone which in the excessive innocence of his heart the visitor naturally takes to be the coal lying neatly on the surface up to this sandstone the path seems to be made of crushed sugar so white and shiny is the quartz over the brow of the down comes in sight the old familiar pithead wheel spinning for the dear life and the eye loses itself in a maze of pumping sheds redtiled mudwalled miners huts dotted all over the landscape and railway lines that run on every kind of gradient there are lines that dip into valleys and disappear round the shoulders of slopes and lines that career on the tops of rises and disappear over the brow of the slopes along these lines whistle and pant metregauge engines some with trucks at their tail and others rattling back to the pitbank with the absurd air of a boy late for school that an unemployed engine always assumes there are six engines in all and as it is easiest to walk along the lines one sees a good deal of them they bear not altogether unfamiliar names here for instance passes the cockburn whistling down a grade with thirty tons of coal at her heels while the whitly and the olpherts are waiting for their complement of trucks now a mr t f cockburn was superintendent of these mines nearly thirty years ago in the days before the chordlines from kanu to luckeeserai were built and all the coal was carted to the latter place and surely mr olpherts was an engineer who helped to think out a new sleeper what may these things mean  apotheosis of the manager is the reply christen the engines after the managers youll find cockburn dunn whitly abbott olpherts and saise knocking about the place sounds funny doesnt it doesnt sound so funny when one of these idiots does his best to derail saise though by putting a line down anyhow look at that line laid out in knotsby jove to the unprofessional eye the rails seem all correct but there must be something wrong because one of those idiots is asked why in the name of all he considers sacred he does not ram the ballast properly  what would happen if you threw an engine off the line cant say that i know exactly you see our business is to keep them on and we do that heres rather a curiosity you see that pointsman they say hes an old mutineer and when he relaxes he boasts of the sahibs he has killed hes glad enough to eat the companys salt now such a withered old face was the face of the pointsman at no 11 point the information suggested a host of questions and the answers were these you wont be able to understand till youve been down into a mine we work our men in two ways some by direct paymentunder our own hand and some by contractors the contractor undertakes to deliver us the coal supplying his own men tools and props hes responsible for the safety of his men and of course the company knows and sees his work just fancy among these five thousand people what sort of effect the news of an accident would produce it would go all through the sonthal parganas we have any amount of sonthals besides mahometans and hindus of every possible caste down to those musahers who eat pig they dont require much administering in the civilian sense of the word on sundays as a rule if any man has had his daughter eloped with or anything of that kind he generally comes up to the managers bungalow to get the matter put straight if a man is disabled through accident he knows that as long as hes in the hospital he gets full wages and the company pays for the food of any of his womenfolk who come to look after him one of course not the whole clan that makes our service popular with the people dont you believe that a native is a fool you can train him to everything except responsibility theres a rule in the workings that if there is any dangerous workwe havent chokedamp i will show you when we get downno gang must work without an englishman to look after them a native wouldnt be wise enough to understand what the danger was or where it came in even if he did hed shirk the responsibility we cant afford to risk a single life all our output is just as much as the company wantabout a thousand tons per working day three hundred thousand in the year we could turn out more yesa little well yes twice as much i wont go on because you wouldnt believe me theres the coal under us and we work it at any depth from following up an outcrop down to six hundred feet that is our deepest shaft we have no necessity to go deeper at home the mines are sometimes fifteen hundred feet down well the thickness of this coal here varies from anything you please to anything you please theres enough of it to last your time and one or two hundred years longer perhaps even longer than that look at that stuff thats big coal from the pit  it was aristocraticlooking coal just like the picked lumps that are stacked in baskets of coal agencies at home with the printed legend atop only 23s a ton but there was no picking in this case the great piled banks were all equal to sample and beyond them lay piles of small broken smithy coal the company doesnt sell to the public this small broken coal is an exception that is sold but the big stuff is for the engines and the shops it doesnt cost much to get out as you say but our men can earn as much as twelve rupees a month very often when theyve earned enough to go on with they retire from the concern till theyve spent their money and then come on again its piecework and they are improvident if some of them only lived like other natives they would have enough to buy land and cows with when theres a press of work they make a good deal by overtime but they dont seem to keep it you should see giridih bazaar on a sunday if you want to know where the money goes about ten thousand rupees change hands once a week there if you want to get at the number of people who are indirectly dependent or profit by the e i r youll have to conduct a census of your own after sunday is over the men generally lie off on monday and take it easy on tuesday then they work hard for the next four days and make it up of course theres nothing in the wide world to prevent a man from resigning and going away to wherever he came frombehind those hills if hes a sonthal he loses his employment thats all but they have their own point of honour a man hates to be told by his friends that he has been guilty of shirking and now well go to breakfast you shall be pitted tomorrow to any depth you like     chapter ii  in the depths   pitted to any extent you please the only difficulty was for joseph to choose his pit giridih was full of them there was an arch in the side of a little hill a blackened brick arch leading into thick night a stationary engine was hauling a procession of coalladen truckstubs is the technical wordout of its depths the tubs were neither pretty nor clean we are going down in those when they are emptied put on your helmet and keep it on and keep your head down  there is nothing mirthprovoking in going down a coalmineeven though it be only a shallow incline running to one hundred and forty feet vertical below the earth get into the tub and lie down hang it no this is not a railway carriage you cant see the country out of the windows lie down in the dust and dont lift your head let her go  the tubs strain on the wire rope and slide down fourteen hundred feet of incline at first through a chastened gloom and then through darkness an absurd sentence from a trial report rings in the head about this time prisoner expressed a desire for the consolations of religion a hand with a reeking flarelamp hangs over the edge of the tub and there is a glimpse of a blackened hat near it for those accustomed to the pits have a merry trick of going down sitting or crouching on the coupling of the rear tub the noise is deafening and the roof is very close indeed the tubs bump and the occupant crouches lovingly in the coal dust what would happen if the train went off the line the desire for the consolations of religion grows keener and keener as the air grows closer and closer the tubs stop in darkness spangled by the light of the flarelamps which many black devils carry underneath and on both sides is the greasy blackness of the coal and above a roof of grey sandstone smooth as the flow of a river at evening now remember that if you dont keep your hat on youll get your head broken because you will forget to stoop if you hear any tubs coming up behind you step off to one side theres a tramway under your feet be careful not to trip over it  the miner has a gait as peculiarly his own as tommys measured pace or the bluejackets roll big men who slouch in the light of day become almost things of beauty underground their foot is on their native heather and the slouch is a very necessary act of homage to the great earth which if a man observe not he shall without doubt have his hatbless the man who invented pith hatsgrievously cut  the road turns and winds and the roof becomes lower but those accursed tubs still rattle by on the tramways the roof throws back their noises and when all the place is full of a grumbling and a growling how under earth is one to know whence danger will turn up next the air brings to the unacclimatised a singing in the ears a hotness of the eyeballs and a jumping of the heart thats because the pressure here is different from the pressure up above itll wear off in a minute we dont notice it wait till you get down a fourhundredfoot pit then your ears will begin to sing if you like  most people know the one night of each hot weatherthat still clouded night just before the rains break when there seems to be no more breathable air under the bowl of the pitiless skies and all the weight of the silent dark house lies on the chest of the sleephunter this is the feeling in a coalmineonly more somuch more so for the darkness is the gross darkness of the inner sepulchre it is hard to see which is the black coal and which the passage driven through it from far away down the side galleries comes the regular beat of the pickthick and muffled as the beat of the labouring heart six men to a gang and they arent allowed to work alone they make sixfoot drives through the coaltwo and sometimes three men working together the rest clear away the stuff and load it into the tubs we have no props in this gallery because we have a roof as good as a ceiling the coal lies under the sandstone here its beautiful sandstone it was beautiful sandstoneas hard as a billiard table and devoid of any nasty little bumps and jags  there was a roaring down one roadthe roaring of infernal fires this is not a pleasant thing to hear in the dark it is too suggestive thats our ventilating shaft cant you feel the air getting brisker come and look  imagine a great ironbound crate of burning coal hanging over a gulf of darkness faintly showing the brickwork of the base of a chimney were at the bottom of the shaft that fire makes a draught that sucks up the foul air from the bottom of the pit theres another downdraw shaft in another part of the mine where the clean air comes in we arent going to set the mines on fire theres an earth and brick floor at the bottom of the pit the crate hangs over it isnt so deep as you think then a devila naked devilcame in with a pitchfork and fed the spouting flames this was perfectly in keeping with the landscape  more trucks more muffled noises more darkness made visible and more devilsmale and femalecoming out of darkness and vanishing then a picture to be remembered a great hall of eblis twenty feet from inkyblack floor to grey roof upheld by huge pillars of shining coal and filled with flitting and passing devils on a shattered pillar near the roof stood a naked man his flesh olivecoloured in the light of the lamps hewing down a mass of coal that still clove to the roof behind him was the wall of darkness and when the lamps shifted he disappeared like a ghost the devils were shouting directions and the man howled in reply resting on his pick and wiping the sweat from his brow when he smote the coal crushed and slid and rumbled from the darkness into the darkness and the devils cried shabash the man stood erect like a bronze statue he twisted and bent himself like a japanese grotesque and anon threw himself on his side after the manner of the dying gladiator then spoke the still small voice of fact a firstclass workman if he would only stick to it but as soon as he makes a little money he lies off and spends it thats the last of a pillar that weve knocked out see here these pillars of coal are square about thirty feet each way as you can see we make the pillar first by cutting out all the coal between then we drive two square tunnels about seven feet wide through and across the pillar propping it with balks theres one fresh cut  two tunnels crossing at right angles had been driven through a pillar which in its undercut condition seemed like the rough draft of a statue for an elephant when the pillar stands only on four legs we chip away one leg at a time from a square to an hourglass shape and then either the whole of the pillar crashes down from the roof or else a quarter or a half if the coal lies against the sandstones it carries away clear but in some places it brings down stone and rubbish with it the chippedaway legs of the pillars are called stooks  who has to make the last cut that breaks a leg through  oh englishmen of sorts we cant trust natives for the job unless its very easy the natives take kindly to the pillarwork though they are paid just as much for their coal as though they had hewed it out of the solid of course we take very good care to see that the roof doesnt come in on us you would never understand how and why we prop our roofs with those piles of sleepers anyway you can see that we cannot take out a whole line of pillars we work em en echelon and those big beams you see running from floor to roof are our indicators they show when the roof is going to give oh dear no theres no dramatic effect about it no splash you know our roofs give plenty of warning by cracking and then collapse slowly the parts of the work that we have cleared out and allowed to fall in are called goafs youre on the edge of a goaf now all that darkness there marks the limit of the mine we have worked that out piecemeal and the props are gone and the place is down the roof of any pillarworking is tested every morning by tappingpretty hard tapping  hi yi yi shout all the devils in chorus and the hall of eblis is full of rolling sound the olive man has brought down an avalanche of coal it is a sight to see the whole of one of the pillars come away they make an awful noise it would startle you out of your wits but theres not an atom of risk  not an atom of risk oh genial and courteous host when you turned up next day blacker than any sweep that ever swept with a neat halfinch gash on your foreheadwon by cutting a stook and getting caught by a bounding coalknobhow long and earnestly did you endeavour to show that stookcutting was an employment as harmless and unexciting as woolsamplering  our ways are rather primitive but theyre cheap and safe as houses doms and bauris kols and beldars dont understand refinements in mining theyd startle an english pit where there was firedamp do you know its a solemn fact that if you drop a davy lamp or snatch it quickly you can blow a whole english pit inside out with all the miners good for us that we dont know what firedamp is here we can use flarelamps  after the first feeling of awe and wonder is worn out a mine becomes monotonous there is only the humming palpitating darkness the rumble of the tubs and the endless procession of galleries to arrest the attention and one pit to the uninitiated is as like to another as two peas tell a miner this and he laughsslowly and softly to him the pits have each distinct personalities and each must be dealt with differently     chapter iii  the perils of the pits   an engineer who has built a bridge can strike you nearly dead with professional facts the captain of a seventyhorsepower ganges riversteamer can in one hour tell legends of the sandheads and the james and mary shoal sufficient to fill half a pioneer but a couple of days spent on above and in a coalmine yields more mixed information than two engineers and three captains it is hopeless to pretend to understand it all  when your host says ah such an one is a thundering good faultreader you smile hazily and by way of keeping up the conversation adventure on the statement that faultreading and palmistry are very popular amusements then men explain  every one knows that coalstrata in common with women horses and official superiors have faults caused by some colic of the earth in the days when things were settling into their places a coalseam is suddenly sliced off as a pencil is cut through with one slanting blow of the penknife and onehalf is either pushed up or pushed down any number of feet the miners work the seam till they come to this breakoff and then call for an expert to read the fault it is sometimes very hard to discover whether the slicedoff seam has gone up or down theoretically the end of the broken piece should show the direction practically its indications are not always clear then a good faultreader who must more than know geology is a useful man and is much prized for the giridih fields are full of faults and dykes tongues of what was once molten lava thrust themselves sheer into the coal and the disgusted miner finds that for about twenty feet on each side of the tongue all coal has been burnt away  the head of the mine is supposed to foresee these things and more he can tell you without looking at the map what is the geological formation of any thousand square miles of india he knows as much about brickwork and the building of houses arches and shafts as an average p w d man he has not only to know the intestines of a pumping or winding engine but must be able to take them to pieces with his own hands indicate on the spot such parts as need repair and make drawings of anything that requires renewal he knows how to lay out and build railways with a grade of one in twentyseven he has to carry in his head all the signals and points between and over which his locomotive engines work he must be an electrician capable of controlling the apparatus that fires the dynamite charges in the pits and must thoroughly understand boring operations with thousandfoot drills he must know by name at least one thousand of the men on the works and must fluently speak the vernaculars of the low castes if he has sonthali which is more elaborate than greek so much the better for him he must know how to handle men of all grades and while holding himself aloof must possess sufficient grip of the mens private lives to be able to see at once the merits of a charge of attempted abduction preferred by a clucking croaking kol against a fluent englishspeaking brahmin for he is literally the light of justice and to him the injured husband and the wrathful father look for redress he must be on the spot and take all responsibility when any specially risky job is under way in the pit and he can claim no single hour of the day or the night for his own from eight in the morning till one in the afternoon he is coated with coaldust and oil from one till eight in the evening he has office work after eight oclock he is free to attend to anything that he may be wanted for  this is a soberly drawn picture of a life that sahibs on the mines actually enjoy they are spared all private socioofficial worry for the company in its mixture of state and private interest is as perfectly coldblooded and devoid of bias as any great department of the empire if certain things be done well and good if certain things be not done the defaulter goes and his place is filled by another the conditions of service are graven on stone there may be generosity there undoubtedly is justice but above all there is freedom within broad limits no irrepressible shareholder cripples the executive arm with suggestions and restrictions and no private piques turn mens blood to gall within them they work like horses and are happy  when he can snatch a free hour the grimy sweating cardiganjacketed ammunitionbooted pickbearing ruffian turns into a wellkept english gentleman who plays a good game of billiards and has a batch of new books from england every week the change is sudden but in giridih nothing is startling it is right and natural that a man should be alternately valentine and orson specially orson it is right and natural to drivealways behind a mad horseaway and away towards the lonely hills till the flaming coke ovens become glowworms on the dark horizon and in the wilderness to find a lovely english maiden teaching squat filthy sonthal girls how to become christians nothing is strange in giridih and the stories of the pits the raffle of conversation that a man picks up as he passes are quite in keeping with the place thanks to the law which enacts that an englishman must look after the native miners and if any one be killed must explain satisfactorily that the accident was not due to preventable causes the deathroll is kept astoundingly low in one bad halfyear six men out of the five thousand were killed in another four and in another none at all as has been said before a big accident would scare off the workers for in spite of the age of the minesnearly thirty yearsthe hereditary pitman has not yet been evolved but to small accidents the men are orientally apathetic read of a death among the five thousand  a gang has been ordered to cut clay for the luting of the coke furnaces the clay is piled in a huge bank in the open sunlight a coolie hacks and hacks till he has hewn out a small cave with twenty foot of clay above him why should he trouble to climb up the bank and bring down the eave of the cave it is easier to cut in the sirdar of the gang is watching round the shoulder of the bank the coolie cuts lazily as he stands sunday is very near and he will get gloriously drunk in giridih bazaar with his weeks earnings he digs his own grave stroke by stroke for he has not sense enough to see that undercut clay is dangerous he is a sonthal from the hills there is a smash and a dull thud and his grave has shut down upon him in an avalanche of heavycaked clay  the sirdar calls to the babu of the ovens and with the promptitude of his race the babu loses his head he runs puffily without giving orders anywhere everywhere finally he runs to the sahibs house the sahib is at the other end of the collieries he runs back the sahib has gone home to wash then his indiscretion strikes him he should have sent runnersfleetfooted boys from the coalscreening gangs he sends them and they fly one catches the sahib just changed after his bath there is a man dead at such a placehe gasps omitting to say whether it is a surface or a pit accident on goes the grimy pitkit and in three minutes the sahibs dogcart is flying to the place indicated  they have dug out the sonthal his head is smashed in spine and breastbone are broken and the gangsirdar bowing double throws the blame of the accident on the poor shapeless battered dead i had warned him but he would not listen twice i warned him these men are witnesses  the babu is shaking like a jelly oh sar i have never seen a man killed before look at that eye sar i should have sent runners i ran everywhere i ran to your house you were not in i was running for hours it was not my fault it was the fault of the gangsirdar he wrings his hands and gurgles the best of accountants but the poorest of coroners is he no need to ask how the accident happened no need to listen to the sirdar and his witnesses the sonthal had been a fool but it was the sirdars business to protect him against his own folly has he any people here  yes his ruknihis keptwomanand his sisters brotherinlaw his home is faroff  the sisters brotherinlaw breaks through the crowd howling for vengeance on the sirdar he will send for the police he will have the price of his brothers blood full tale the windmill arms and the angry eyes fall for the sahib is making the report of the death  will the government give me pensin i am his wife a woman clamours stamping her pewterankleted feet he was killed in your service where is his pensin i am his wife  you lie youre his rukni keep quiet go the pension comes to us  the sisters brotherinlaw is not a refined man but the rukni is his match they are silenced the sahib takes the report and the body is borne away before tomorrows sun rises the gangsirdar may find himself a simple surfacecoolie earning nine pice a day and in a week some sonthal woman behind the hills may discover that she is entitled to draw monthly great wealth from the coffers of the sirkar but this will not happen if the sisters brotherinlaw can prevent it he goes off swearing at the rukni  in the meantime what have the rest of the dead mans gang been doing they have if you please abating not one stroke dug out all the clay and would have it verified they have seen their comrade die he is dead bus17 will the sirdar take the tale of clay and yet were twenty men to be crushed by their own carelessness in the pit these same impassive workers would scatter like panicstricken horses  17 enough  turning from this sketch let us set in order a few stories of the pits in some of the mines the coal is blasted out by the dynamite which is fired by electricity from a battery on the surface two men place the charges and then signal to be drawn up in the cage which hangs in the piteye once two natives were intrusted with the job they performed their parts beautifully till the end when the vaster idiot of the two scrambled into the cage gave signal and was hauled up before his friend could follow  thirty or forty yards up the shaft all possible danger for those in the cage was over and the charge was accordingly exploded then it occurred to the man in the cage that his friend stood a very good chance of being by this time riven to pieces and choked  but the friend was wise in his generation he had missed the cage but found a coaltubone of the little iron trucksand turning this upside down crawled into it when the charge went off his shelter was battered in so much that men had to hack him out for the tub had made as it were a tinned sardine of its occupant he was absolutely unhurt but for his feelings on reaching the pitbank his first words were i do not desire to go down to the pit with that man any more his wish had been already gratified for that man had fled later on the story goes when that man found that the guilt of murder was not at his door he returned and was made a mere surfacecoolie and his brothers jeered at him as they passed to their betterpaid occupation  occasionally there are mild cyclones in the pits an old working perhaps a mile away will collapse a whole gallery sinking bodily then the displaced air rushes through the inhabited mine and to quote their own expression blows the pitmen about like dry leaves few things are more amusing than the spectacle of a burly tyneside foreman who failing to dodge round a corner in time is put down by the wind sittingfashion on a knobby lump of coal  but most impressive of all is a tale they tell of a fire in a pit many years ago the coal caught light they had to send earth and bricks down the shaft and build great dams across the galleries to choke the fire imagine the scene a few hundred feet underground with the air growing hotter and hotter each moment and the carbonic acid gas trickling through the dams after a time the rough dams gaped and the gas poured in afresh and the englishmen went down and leeped the cracks between roof and damsill with anything they could get coolies fainted and had to be taken away but no one died and behind the first dams they built great masonry ones and bested that fire though for a long time afterwards whenever they pumped water into it the steam would puff out from crevices in the ground above  it is a queer life that they lead these men of the coalfields and a big life to boot to describe onehalf of their labours would need a week at the least and would be incomplete then if you want to see anything they say you should go over to the baragunda coppermines you should look at the barakar ironworks you should see our boring operations five miles away you should see how we sink pits you should above all see giridih bazaar on a sunday why you havent seen anything theres no end of a sonthal mission hereabouts all the little devdears have gone on a picnic wait till they come back and see em learning to read  alas one cannot wait at the most one can but thrust an impertinent pen skindeep into matters only properly understood by specialists    the country life press  garden city n y
