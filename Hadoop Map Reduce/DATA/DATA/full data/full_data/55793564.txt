among the pinetrees and junipers the cypresses and olives of that odyssean coast we came one afternoon on a pink house bearing the legend osteria di tranquillita and partly because of the name and partly because we did not expect to find a house at all in those goathaunted groves above the waves we tarried for contemplation  to the familiar simplicity of that italian building there were not lacking signs of a certain spiritual change for out of the olivegrove which grew to its very doors a skittlealley had been formed and two baby cypresstrees were cut into the effigies of a cock and hen the song of a gramophone too was breaking forth into the air as it were the presiding voice of a high and cosmopolitan mind  and lost in admiration we became conscious of the odour of a fullflavoured cigar yesin the skittlealley a gentleman was standing who wore a bowler hat a bright brown suit pink tie and very yellow boots  his head was round his cheeks fat and wellcoloured his lips red and full under a black moustache and he was regarding us through very thick and halfclosed eyelids  perceiving him to be the proprietor of the high and cosmopolitan mind we accosted him  goodday he replied i spik english  been in amurrica yes  you have a lovely place here  sweeping a glance over the skittlealley he sent forth a long puff of smoke then turning to my companion of the politer sex with the air of one who has made himself perfect master of a foreign tongue he smiled and spoke  tooquiet  precisely the name of your inn perhaps suggests  i change all thatsoon i call it angloamerican hotel  ah yes you are very uptodate already  he closed one eye and smiled  having passed a few more compliments we saluted and walked on and coming presently to the edge of the cliff lay down on the thyme and the crumbled leafdust  all the small singing birds had long been shot and eaten there came to us no sound but that of the waves swimming in on a gentle south wind  the wanton creatures seemed stretching out white arms to the land flying desperately from a sea of such stupendous serenity and over their bare shoulders their hair floated back pale in the sunshine  if the air was void of sound it was full of scentthat delicious and enlivening perfume of mingled gum and herbs and sweet wood being burned somewhere a long way off and a silky golden warmth slanted on to us through the olives and umbrella pines  large winered violets were growing near  on such a cliff might theocritus have lain spinning his songs on that divine sea odysseus should have passed  and we felt that presently the goatgod must put his head forth from behind a rock  it seemed a little queer that our friend in the bowler hat should move and breathe within one short flight of a cuckoo from this home of pan one could not but at first feelingly remember the old boer saying o god what things man sees when he goes out without a gun but soon the infinite incongruity of this juxtaposition began to produce within one a curious eagerness a sort of halfphilosophical delight it began to seem too good almost too romantic to be true to think of the gramophone wedded to the thin sweet singing of the olive leaves in the evening wind to remember the scent of his rank cigar marrying with this wild incense to read that enchanted name inn of tranquillity and hear the bland and affable remark of the gentleman who owned itsuch were indeed phenomena to stimulate souls to speculation  and all unconsciously one began to justify them by thoughts of the other incongruities of existencethe strange the passionate incongruities of youth and age wealth and poverty life and death the wonderful odd bedfellows of this world all those lurid contrasts which haunt a mans spirit till sometimes he is ready to cry out rather than live where such things can be let me die  like a wild bird tracking through the air ones meditation wandered on following that trail of thought till the chance encounter became spiritually luminous  that italian gentleman of the world with his bowler hat his skittlealley his gramophone who had planted himself down in this temple of wild harmony was he not progress itselfthe blind figure with the stomach full of new meats and the brain of raw notions  was he not the very embodiment of the wonderful child civilisation so possessed by a new toy each day that she has no time to master its usenaive creature lost amid her own discoveries  was he not the very symbol of that which was making economists thin thinkers pale artists haggard statesmen baldthe symbol of indigestion incarnate did he not delicious gross unconscious man personify beneath his americoitalian polish all those rank and primitive instincts whose satisfaction necessitated the million miseries of his fellows all those thick rapacities which stir the hatred of the humane and thinskinned and yet ones meditation could not stop thereit was not convenient to the heart  a little above us among the olivetrees two blueclothed peasants man and woman were gathering the fruitfrom some such couple no doubt our friend in the bowler hat had sprung more virile and adventurous than his brothers he had not stayed in the home groves but had gone forth to drink the waters of hustle and commerce and come backwhat he was  and he in turn would beget children and having made his pile out of his angloamerican hotel would place those children beyond the coarser influences of life till they became perhaps even as our selves the salt of the earth and despised him  and i thought i do not despise those peasantsfar from it  i do not despise myselfno more than reason why then despise my friend in the bowler hat who is after all but the necessary link between them and me  i did not despise the olivetrees the warm sun the pine scent all those material things which had made him so thick and strong i did not despise the golden tenuous imaginings which the trees and rocks and sea were starting in my own spirit  why then despise the skittlealley the gramophone those expressions of the spirit of my friend in the billycock hat  to despise them was ridiculous  and suddenly i was visited by a sensation only to be described as a sort of smiling certainty emanating from and as it were still tingling within every nerve of myself but yet vibrating harmoniously with the world around  it was as if i had suddenly seen what was the truth of things not perhaps to anybody else but at all events to me  and i felt at once tranquil and elated as when something is met with which rouses and fascinates in a man all his faculties  for i thought if it is ridiculous in me to despise my friendthat perfect marvel of disharmonyit is ridiculous in me to despise anything if he is a little bit of continuity as perfectly logical an expression of a necessary phase or mood of existence as i myself am then surely there is nothing in all the world that is not a little bit of continuity the expression of a little necessary mood yes i thought he and i and those olivetrees and this spider on my hand and everything in the universe which has an individual shape are all fit expressions of the separate moods of a great underlying mood or principle which must be perfectly adjusted volving and revolving on itself  for if it did not volve and revolve on itself it would peter out at one end or the other and the image of this petering out no man with his mental apparatus can conceive therefore one must conclude it to be perfectly adjusted and everlasting  but if it is perfectly adjusted and everlasting we are all little bits of continuity and if we are all little bits of continuity it is ridiculous for one of us to despise another  so i thought i have now proved it from my friend in the billycock hat up to the universe and from the universe down back again to my friend  and i lay on my back and looked at the sky  it seemed friendly to my thought with its smile and few white clouds saffrontinged like the plumes of a white duck in sunlight  and yet i wondered though my friend and i may be equally necessary i am certainly irritated by him and shall as certainly continue to be irritated not only by him but by a thousand other men and so with a light heart you may go on being irritated with your friend in the bowler hat you may go on loving those peasants and this sky and sea  but since you have this theory of life you may not despise any one or any thing not even a skittlealley for they are all threaded to you and to despise them would be to blaspheme against continuity and to blaspheme against continuity would be to deny eternity  love you cannot help and hate you cannot help but contempt isfor youthe sovereign idiocy the irreligious fancy  there was a bee weighing down a blossom of thyme close by and underneath the stalk a very ugly little centipede  the wild bee with his little dark body and his busy bears legs was lovely to me and the creepy centipede gave me shudderings but it was a pleasant thing to feel so sure that he no less than the bee was a little mood expressing himself out in harmony with designs tiny thread on the miraculous quilt  and i looked at him with a sudden zest and curiosity it seemed to me that in the mystery of his queer little creepings i was enjoying the supreme mystery and i thought if i knew all about that wriggling beast then indeed i might despise him but truly if i knew all about him i should know all about everythingmystery would be gone and i could not bear to live  so i stirred him with my finger and he went away  but howi thought about such as do not feel it ridiculous to despise how about those whose temperaments and religions show them all things so plainly that they know they are right and others wrong  they must be in a bad way  and for some seconds i felt sorry for them and was discouraged  but then i thought not at allobviously not  for if they do not find it ridiculous to feel contempt they are perfectly right to feel contempt it being natural to them and you have no business to be sorry for them for that is after all only your euphemism for contempt  they are all right being the expressions of contemptuous moods having religions and so forth suitable to these moods and the religion of your mood would be greek to them and probably a matter for contempt  but this only makes it the more interesting  for though to you for instance it may seem impossible to worship mystery with one lobe of the brain and with the other to explain it the thought that this may not seem impossible to others should not discourage you it is but another little piece of that mystery which makes life so wonderful and sweet  the sun fallen now almost to the level of the cliff was slanting upward on to the burntred pine boughs which had taken to themselves a quaint resemblance to the great brown limbs of the wild men titian drew in his pagan pictures and down below us the seanymphs still swimming to shore seemed eager to embrace them in the enchanted groves  all was fused in that golden glow of the sun going downsea and land gathered into one transcendent mood of light and colour as if mystery desired to bless us by showing how perfect was that worshipful adjustment whose secret we could never know  and i said to myself none of those thoughts of yours are new and in a vague way even you have thought them before but all the same they have given you some little feeling of tranquillity  and at that word of fear i rose and invited my companion to return toward the town  but as we stealthy crept by the osteria di tranquillita our friend in the bowler hat came out with a gun over his shoulder and waved his hand toward the inn  you come again in two weeki change all that  and now he added i go to shoot little bird or two and he disappeared into the golden haze under the olivetrees  a minute later we heard his gun go off and returned homeward with a prayer  1910     magpie over the hill  i lay often that summer on a slope of sand and coarse grass close to the cornish sea trying to catch thoughts and i was trying very hard when i saw them coming hand in hand  she was dressed in blue linen and a little cloud of honeycoloured hair her small face had serious eyes the colour of the chicory flowers she was holding up to sniff ata clean sober little maid with a very touching upward look of trust  her companion was a strong active boy of perhaps fourteen and he too was serioushis deepset blacklashed eyes looked down at her with a queer protective wonder the while he explained in a soft voice broken up between two ages that exact process which bees adopt to draw honey out of flowers  once or twice this hoarse but charming voice became quite fervent when she had evidently failed to follow it was as if he would have been impatient only he knew he must not because she was a lady and younger than himself and he loved her  they sat down just below my nook and began to count the petals of a chicory flower and slowly she nestled in to him and he put his arm round her  never did i see such sedate sweet lovering so trusting on her part so guardianlike on his  they were like in miniaturethough more dewythose sober couples who have long lived together yet whom one still catches looking at each other with confidential tenderness and in whom one feels passion is atrophied from never having been in use  long i sat watching them in their cool communion halfembraced talking a little smiling a little never once kissing  they did not seem shy of that it was rather as if they were too much each others to think of such a thing  and then her head slid lower and lower down his shoulder and sleep buttoned the lids over those chicoryblue eyes  how careful he was then not to wake her though i could see his arm was getting stiff he still sat good as gold holding her till it began quite to hurt me to see his shoulder thus in chancery  but presently i saw him draw his arm away ever so carefully lay her head down on the grass and lean forward to stare at something  straight in front of them was a magpie balancing itself on a stripped twig of thorntree  the agitating bird painted of night and day was making a queer noise and flirting one wing as if trying to attract attention  rising from the twig it circled vivid and stealthy twice round the tree and flew to another a dozen paces off  the boy rose he looked at his little mate looked at the bird and began quietly to move toward it but uttering again its queer call the bird glided on to a third thorntree  the boy hesitated thenbut once more the bird flew on and suddenly dipped over the hill i saw the boy break into a run and getting up quickly i ran too  when i reached the crest there was the black and white bird flying low into a dell and there the boy with hair streaming back was rushing helterskelter down the hill  he reached the bottom and vanished into the dell  i too ran down the hill  for all that i was prying and must not be seen by bird or boy i crept warily in among the trees to the edge of a pool that could know but little sunlight so thickly arched was it by willows birchtrees and wild hazel  there in a swing of boughs above the water was perched no pied bird but a young darkhaired girl with dangling bare brown legs  and on the brink of the black water goldened with fallen leaves the boy was crouching gazing up at her with all his soul she swung just out of reach and looked down at him across the pool how old was she with her brown limbs and her gleaming slanting eyes  or was she only the spirit of the dell this elfthing swinging there entwined with boughs and the dark water and covered with a shift of wet birch leaves  so strange a face she had wild almost wicked yet so tender a face that i could not take my eyes from  her bare toes just touched the pool and flicked up drops of water that fell on the boys face  from him all the sober steadfastness was gone already he looked as wild as she and his arms were stretched out trying to reach her feet  i wanted to cry to him go back boy go back but could not her elf eyes held me dumbthey looked so lost in their tender wildness  and then my heart stood still for he had slipped and was struggling in deep water beneath her feet  what a gaze was that he was turning up to hernot frightened but so longing so desperate and hers how triumphant and how happy  and then he clutched her foot and clung and climbed and bending down she drew him up to her all wet and clasped him in the swing of boughs  i took a long breath then  an orange gleam of sunlight had flamed in among the shadows and fell round those two where they swung over the dark water with lips close together and spirits lost in one anothers and in their eyes such drowning ecstasy  and then they kissed  all round me pool and leaves and air seemed suddenly to swirl and melti could see nothing plain        what time passedi do not knowbefore their faces slowly again became visible  his face the sober boyswas turned away from her and he was listening for above the whispering of leaves a sound of weeping came from over the hill  it was to that he listened  and even as i looked he slid down from out of her arms back into the pool and began struggling to gain the edge  what grief and longing in her wild face then  but she did not wail  she did not try to pull him back that elfish heart of dignity could reach out to what was coming it could not drag at what was gone  unmoving as the boughs and water she watched him abandon her  slowly the struggling boy gained land and lay there breathless and still that sound of lonely weeping came from over the hill  listening but looking at those wild mourning eyes that never moved from him he lay  once he turned back toward the water but fire had died within him his hands dropped nervelesshis young face was all bewilderment  and the quiet darkness of the pool waited and the trees and those lost eyes of hers and my heart  and ever from over the hill came the little fair maidens lonely weeping  then slowly dragging his feet stumbling halfblinded turning and turning to look back the boy groped his way out through the trees toward that sound and as he went that dark spiritelf abandoned clasping her own lithe body with her arms never moved her gaze from him  i too crept away and when i was safe outside in the pale evening sunlight peered back into the dell  there under the dark trees she was no longer but round and round that cage of passion fluttering and wailing through the leaves over the black water was the magpie flighting on its twilight wings  i turned and ran and ran till i came over the hill and saw the boy and the little fair sober maiden sitting together once more on the open slope under the high blue heaven  she was nestling her tearstained face against his shoulder and speaking already of indifferent things and hehe was holding her with his arm and watching over her with eyes that seemed to see something else  and so i lay hearing their sober talk and gazing at their sober little figures till i awoke and knew i had dreamed all that little allegory of sacred and profane love and from it had returned to reason knowing no more than ever which was which  1912     sheepshearing  from early morning there had been bleating of sheep in the yard so that one knew the creatures were being sheared and toward evening i went along to see  thirty or forty nakedlooking ghosts of sheep were penned against the barn and perhaps a dozen still inhabiting their coats  into the wool of one of these bulky ewes the farmers small yellowhaired daughter was twisting her fist hustling it toward fate though pulled almost off her feet by the frightened stubborn creature she never let go till with a despairing cough the ewe had passed over the threshold and was fast in the hands of a shearer  at the far end of the barn close by the doors i stood a minute or two before shifting up to watch the shearing  into that dim beautiful home of age with its great rafters and mellow stone archways the june sunlight shone through loopholes and chinks in thin glamour powdering with its very strangeness the dark cathedraled air where high up clung a fog of old grey cobwebs so thick as ever were the stalactites of a huge cave  at this end the scent of sheep and wool and men had not yet routed that home essence of the barn like the savour of acorns and withering beech leaves  they were shearing by hand this year nine of them counting the postman who though farmbred didn putt much to the shearin but had come to round the sheep up and give general aid  sitting on the creatures or with a leg firmly crooked over their heads each shearer even the two boys had an air of going at it in his own way  in their white canvas shearing suits they worked very steadily almost in silence as if drowsed by the clickclip clickclip of the shears  and the sheep but for an occasional wriggle of legs or head lay quiet enough having an inborn sense perhaps of the fitness of things even when once in a way they lost more than wool glad too mayhap to be rid of their matted vestments  from time to time the little damsel offered each shearer a jug and glass but no man drank till he had finished his sheep then he would get up stretch his cramped muscles drink deep and almost instantly sit down again on a fresh beast  and always there was the buzz of flies swarming in the sunlight of the open doorway the dry rustle of the pollarded limetrees in the sharp wind outside the bleating of some released ewe upset at her own nakedness the scrape and shuffle of heels and sheeps limbs on the floor together with the clickclip clickclip of the shears  as each ewe finished with struggled up helped by a friendly shove and bolted out dazedly into the pen i could not help wondering what was passing in her headin the heads of all those unceremoniously treated creatures and moving nearer to the postman i said  theyre really very good on the whole  he looked at me i thought queerly  yaas he answered mr moltons the best of them  i looked askance at mr molton but with his knee crooked round a young ewe he was shearing calmly  yes i admitted he is certainly good  yaas replied the postman  edging back into the darkness away from that uncomprehending youth i escaped into the air and passing the remains of last years stacks under the tall toppling elms sat down in a field under the bank it seemed to me that i had food for thought  in that little misunderstanding between me and the postman was all the essence of the difference between that state of civilisation in which sheep could prompt a sentiment and that state in which sheep could not  the heat from the dropping sun not far now above the moorline struck full into the ferns and long grass of the bank where i was sitting and the midges rioted on me in this last warmth  the wind was barred out so that one had the full sweetness of the clover fast becoming hay over which the swallows were wheeling and swooping after flies  and far up as it were the crown of natures beautiful devouring circle a buzzard hawk almost stationary on the air floated intent on something pleasant below him  a number of little hens crept through the gate one by one and came round me  it seemed to them that i was there to feed them and they held their neat red or yellow heads to one side and the other inquiring with their beady eyes surprised at my stillness  they were pretty with their speckled feathers and as it seemed to me plump and young so that i wondered how many of them would in time feed me finding however that i gave them nothing to eat they went away and there arose in place of their clucking the thin singing of air passing through some long tube  i knew it for the whining of my dog who had nosed me out but could not get through the padlocked gate  and as i lifted him over i was glad the postman could not see mefor i felt that to lift a dog over a gate would be against the principles of one for whom the connection of sheep with good behaviour had been too strange a thought and it suddenly rushed into my mind that the time would no doubt come when the conduct of apples being plucked from the mother tree would inspire us and we should say theyre really very good  and i wondered were those future watchers of applegathering farther from me than i watching sheepshearing from the postman  i thought too of the pretty dreams being dreamt about the land and of the people who dreamed them  and i looked at that land covered with the sweet pinkishgreen of the clover and considered how much of it through the medium of sheep would find its way into me to enable me to come out here and be eaten by midges and speculate about things and conceive the sentiment of how good the sheep were and it all seemed queer  i thought too of a world entirely composed of people who could see the sheen rippling on that clover and feel a sort of sweet elation at the scent of it and i wondered how much clover would be sown then  many things i thought of sitting there till the sun sank below the moor line the wind died off the clover and the midges slept  here and there in the iriscoloured sky a star crept out the softhooting owls awoke  but still i lingered watching how one after another shapes and colours died into twilight and i wondered what the postman thought of twilight that inconvenient state when things were neither dark nor light and i wondered what the sheep were thinking this first night without their coats  then slinking along the hedge noiseless unheard by my sleeping spaniel i saw a tawny dog stealing by  he passed without seeing us licking his lean chops  yes friend i thought you have been after something very unholy you have been digging up buried lamb or some desirable person of that kind  sneaking past in this sweet night which stirred in one such sentiment that ghoulish cur was like the omnivorousness of nature and it came to me how wonderful and queer was a world which embraced within it not only this red gloating dog fresh from his feast on the decaying flesh of lamb but all those hundreds of beings in whom the sight of a fly with one leg shortened produced a quiver of compassion  for in this savage slinking shadow i knew that i had beheld a manifestation of divinity no less than in the smile of the sky each minute growing more starry  with what harmonyi thoughtcan these two be enwrapped in this round world so fast that it cannot be moved  what secret marvellous allpervading principle can harmonise these things  and the old words good and evil seemed to me more than ever quaint  it was almost dark and the dew falling fast i roused my spaniel to go in  over the highwalled yard the barns the moonwhite porch dusk had brushed its velvet  through an open window came a roaring sound mr molton was singing the happy warrior to celebrate the finish of the shearing  the big doors into the garden passed through cut off the full sweetness of that song for there the owls were already masters of night with their music  on the dewwhitened grass of the lawn we came on a little dark beast my spaniel liking its savour stood with his nose at point but being called off i could feel him obedient still quivering under my hand  in the field a wan huddle in the blackness the dismantled sheep lay under a holly hedge  the wind had died it was mistwarm 1910     evolution  coming out of the theatre we found it utterly impossible to get a taxicab and though it was raining slightly walked through leicester square in the hope of picking one up as it returned down piccadilly numbers of hansoms and fourwheelers passed or stood by the curb hailing us feebly or not even attempting to attract our attention but every taxi seemed to have its load  at piccadilly circus losing patience we beckoned to a fourwheeler and resigned ourselves to a long slow journey  a souwesterly air blew through the open windows and there was in it the scent of change that wet scent which visits even the hearts of towns and inspires the watcher of their myriad activities with thought of the restless force that forever cries on on  but gradually the steady patter of the horses hoofs the rattling of the windows the slow thudding of the wheels pressed on us so drowsily that when at last we reached home we were more than half asleep  the fare was two shillings and standing in the lamplight to make sure the coin was a halfcrown before handing it to the driver we happened to look up this cabman appeared to be a man of about sixty with a long thin face whose chin and drooping grey moustaches seemed in permanent repose on the upturned collar of his old blue overcoat  but the remarkable features of his face were the two furrows down his cheeks so deep and hollow that it seemed as though that face were a collection of bones without coherent flesh among which the eyes were sunk back so far that they had lost their lustre  he sat quite motionless gazing at the tail of his horse and almost unconsciously one added the rest of ones silver to that halfcrown  he took the coins without speaking but as we were turning into the garden gate we heard him say  thank you youve saved my life  not knowing either of us what to reply to such a curious speech we closed the gate again and came back to the cab  are things so very bad  they are replied the cabman  its done withis this job  were not wanted now  and taking up his whip he prepared to drive away  how long have they been as bad as this  the cabman dropped his hand again as though glad to rest it and answered incoherently  thirtyfive year ive been drivin a cab  and sunk again in contemplation of his horses tail he could only be roused by many questions to express himself having as it seemed no knowledge of the habit  i dont blame the taxis i dont blame nobody  its come on us thats what it has  i left the wife this morning with nothing in the house she was saying to me only yesterday what have you brought home the last four months  put it at six shillings a week i said  no she said seven  well thats rightshe enters it all down in her book  you are really going short of food  the cabman smiled and that smile between those two deep hollows was surely as strange as ever shone on a human face  you may say that he said  well what does it amount to  before i picked you up i had one eighteenpenny fare today and yesterday i took five shillings  and ive got seven bob a day to pay for the cab and thats low too  theres many and many a proprietor thats broke and goneevery bit as bad as us  they let us down as easy as ever they can you cant get blood from a stone can you  once again he smiled  im sorry for them too and im sorry for the horses though they come out best of the three of us i do believe  one of us muttered something about the public  the cabman turned his face and stared down through the darkness  the public he said and his voice had in it a faint surprise well they all want the taxis  its natural  they get about faster in them and times money  i was seven hours before i picked you up and then you was lookin for a taxi  them as take us because they cant get better theyre not in a good temper as a rule  and theres a few old ladies thats frightened of the motors but old ladies arent never very free with their moneycant afford to be the most of them i expect  everybodys sorry for you one would have thought that  he interrupted quietly sorrow dont buy bread         i never had nobody ask me about things before  and slowly moving his long face from side to side he added besides what could people do  they cant be expected to support you and if they started askin you questions theyd feel it very awkward  they know that i suspect of course theres such a lot of us the hansoms are pretty nigh as bad off as we are  well were gettin fewer every day thats one thing  not knowing whether or no to manifest sympathy with this extinction we approached the horse  it was a horse that stood over a good deal at the knee and in the darkness seemed to have innumerable ribs  and suddenly one of us said many people want to see nothing but taxis on the streets if only for the sake of the horses  the cabman nodded  this old fellow he said never carried a deal of flesh  his grub dont put spirit into him nowadays its not up to much in quality but he gets enough of it  and you dont  the cabman again took up his whip  i dont suppose he said without emotion any one could ever find another job for me now  ive been at this too long  itll be the workhouse if its not the other thing  and hearing us mutter that it seemed cruel he smiled for the third time  yes he said slowly its a bit ard on us because weve done nothing to deserve it  but things are like that so far as i can see  one thing comes pushin out another and so you go on  ive thought about ityou get to thinkin and worryin about the rights o things sittin up here all day  no i dont see anything for it itll soon be the end of us nowcant last much longer  and i dont know that ill be sorry to have done with it  its pretty well broke my spirit  there was a fund got up  yes it helped a few of us to learn the motordrivin but whats the good of that to me at my time of life  sixty thats my age im not the only onetheres hundreds like me  were not fit for it thats the fact we havent got the nerve now  itd want a mint of money to help us  and what you says the truthpeople want to see the end of us they want the taxisour days over  im not complaining you asked me about it yourself  and for the third time he raised his whip  tell me what you would have done if you had been given your fare and just sixpence over  the cabman stared downward as though puzzled by that question  done  why nothing  what could i have done  but you said that it had saved your life  yes i said that he answered slowly i was feelin a bit low you cant help it sometimes its the thing comin on you and no way out of itthats what gets over you  we try not to think about it as a rule  and this time with a thank you kindly he touched his horses flank with the whip  like a thing aroused from sleep the forgotten creature started and began to draw the cabman away from us  very slowly they travelled down the road among the shadows of the trees broken by lamplight  above us white ships of cloud were sailing rapidly across the dark river of sky on the wind which smelled of change  and after the cab was lost to sight that wind still brought to us the dying sound of the slow wheels  1910     riding in mist  wet and hot having her winter coat the mare exactly matched the drenched foxcoloured beechleaf drifts  as was her wont on such misty days she danced along with head held high her neck a little arched her ears pricked pretending that things were not what they seemed and now and then vigorously trying to leave me planted on the air  stones which had rolled out of the lane banks were her especial goblins for one such had maltreated her nerves before she came into this ballroom world and she had not forgotten  there was no wind that day  on the beechtrees were still just enough of coppery leaves to look like fires lighted highup to air the eeriness but most of the twigs pearled with water were patterned very naked against universal grey  berries were few except the pink spindle one so far the most beautiful of which there were more than earth generally vouchsafes  there was no sound in the deep lanes none of that sweet overhead sighing of yesterday at the same hour but there was a quality of silencea dumb mist murmuration  we passed a tree with a proud pigeon sitting on its top spire quite too heavy for the twig delicacy below undisturbed by the mares hoofs or the creaking of saddle leather he let us pass absorbed in his world of tranquil turtledoves  the mist had thickened to a white infinitesimal raindust and in it the trees began to look strange as though they had lost one another  the world seemed inhabited only by quick soundless wraiths as one trotted past  close to a farmhouse the mare stood still with that extreme suddenness peculiar to her at times and four black pigs scuttled by and at once became white air  by now we were both hot and inclined to cling closely together and take liberties with each other i telling her about her nature name and appearance together with comments on her manners and she giving forth that sterterous sweet snuffle which begins under the star on her forehead  on such days she did not sneeze reserving those expressions of her joy for sunny days and the crisp winds  at a forking of the ways we came suddenly on one grey and three brown ponies who shied round and flung away in front of us a vision of pretty heads and haunches tangled in the thin lane till conscious that they were beyond their beat they faced the bank and one by one scrambled over to join the other ghosts out on the dim common  dipping down now over the road we passed hounds going home  pied dumbfooted shapes padding along in that softeyed remote world of theirs with a tall riding splash of red in front and a tall splash of riding red behind  then through a gate we came on to the moor amongst whitened furze  the mist thickened  a curlew was whistling on its invisible way far up and that wistful wild calling seemed the very voice of the day  keeping in view the glint of the road we galloped rejoicing both of us to be free of the jog jog of the lanes  and first the voice of the curlew died then the glint of the road vanished and we were quite alone  even the furze was gone no shape of anything left only the black peaty ground and the thickening mist  we might as well have been that lonely bird crossing up there in the blind white nothingness like a human spirit wandering on the undiscovered moor of its own future  the mare jumped a pile of stones which appeared as it were after we had passed over and it came into my mind that if we happened to strike one of the old quarry pits we should infallibly be killed somehow there was pleasure in this thought that we might or might not strike that old quarry pit  the blood in us being hot we had pure joy in charging its white impalpable solidity which made way and at once closed in behind us  there was great fun in this yardbyyard discovery that we were not yet dead this flying shelterless challenge to whatever might lie out there five yards in front  we felt supremely above the wish to know that our necks were safe we were happy panting in the vapour that beat against our faces from the sheer speed of our galloping suddenly the ground grew lumpy and made uphill  the mare slackened pace we stopped  before us behind to right and left white vapour no sky no distance barely the earth  no wind in our faces no wind anywhere at first we just got our breath thought nothing talked a little  then came a chillness a faint clutching over the heart  the mare snuffled we turned and made downhill  and still the mist thickened and seemed to darken ever so little we went slowly suddenly doubtful of all that was in front  there came into our minds visions so distant in that darkening vapour of a warm stall and manger of oats of tea and a log fire  the mist seemed to have fingers now long dark white crawling fingers it seemed too to have in its sheer silence a sort of muttered menace a shuddery lurkingness as if from out of it that spirit of the unknown which in hot blood we had just now so gleefully mocked were creeping up at us intent on its vengeance since the ground no longer sloped we could not go downhill there were no means left of telling in what direction we were moving and we stopped to listen  there was no sound not one tiny noise of water wind in trees or man not even of birds or the moor ponies and the mist darkened  the mare reached her head down and walked on smelling at the heather every time she sniffed ones heart quivered hoping she had found the way she threw up her head snorted and stood still and there passed just in front of us a pony and her foal shapes of scampering dusk whisked like blurred shadows across a sheet  hoofsilent in the long heatheras ever were visiting ghoststhey were gone in a flash  the mare plunged forward following  but in the feel of her gallop and the feel of my heart there was no more that ecstasy of facing the unknown there was only the cold hasty dread of loneliness  far asunder as the poles were those two sensations evoked by this same motion  the mare swerved violently and stopped  there passing within three yards from the same direction as before the soundless shapes of the pony and her foal flew by again more intangible less dusky now against the darker screen were we then to be haunted by those bewildering uncanny ones flitting past ever from the same direction  this time the mare did not follow but stood still knowing as well as i that direction was quite lost  soon with a whimper she picked her way on again smelling at the heather and the mist darkened  then out of the heart of that dusky whiteness came a tiny sound we stood not breathing turning our heads  i could see the mares eye fixed and straining at the vapour  the tiny sound grew till it became the muttering of wheels  the mare dashed forward  the muttering ceased untimely but she did not stop turning abruptly to the left she slid scrambled and dropped into a trot  the mist seemed whiter below us we were on the road  and involuntarily there came from me a sound not quite a shout not quite an oath  i saw the mares eye turn back faintly derisive as who should say alone i did it  then slowly comfortably a little ashamed we jogged on in the mood of men and horses when danger is over  so pleasant it seemed now in one short halfhour to have passed through the circleswing of the emotions from the ecstasy of hot recklessness to the clutching of chill fear  but the meetingpoint of those two sensations we had left out there on the mysterious moor  why at one moment had we thought it finer than anything on earth to risk the breaking of our necks and the next shuddered at being lost in the darkening mist with winter night fast coming on  and very luxuriously we turned once more into the lanes enjoying the past scenting the future  close to home the first little eddy of wind stirred and the song of dripping twigs began an owl hooted honeysoft in the fog  we came on two farm hands mending the lane at the turn of the avenue and curled on the top of the bank their cosy red collie pup waiting for them to finish work for the day he raised his sharp nose and looked at us dewily  we turned down padding softly in the wet foxred drifts under the beechtrees whereon the last leaves still flickered out in the darkening whiteness that now seemed so little eerie  we passed the greygreen skeleton of the farmyard gate  a hen ran across us clucking into the dusk  the maze drew her long homecoming snuffle and stood still 1910     the procession  in one of those corners of our land canopied by the fumes of blind industry there was on that day a lull in darkness  a fresh wind had split the customary heaven or roof of hell was sweeping long drifts of creamy clouds across a blue still pallid with reek  the sun even shonea sun whose face seemed white and wondering  and under that rare sun all the little town among its slag heaps and few tall chimneys had an air of living faster  in those continuous courts and alleys where the women worked smoke from each little forge rose and dispersed into the wind with strange alacrity amongst the women too there was that same eagerness for the sunshine had crept in and was making pale all those darkraftered sooted ceilings which covered them in together with their immortal comrades the small open furnaces  about their work they had been busy since seven oclock their feet pressing the leather lungs which fanned the conical heaps of glowing fuel their hands poking into the glow a thin iron rod till the end could be curved into a fiery hook snapping it with a mallet threading it with tongs on to the chain hammering closing the link and without a seconds pause thrusting the iron rod again into the glow  and while they worked they chattered laughed sometimes now and then sighed  they seemed of all ages and all types from her who looked like a peasant of provence broad brown and strong to the weariest white consumptive wisp from old women of seventy with straggling grey hair to fifteenyearold girls  in the cottage forges there would be but one worker or two at most in the shop forges four or even five little glowing heaps four or five of the grimy pale lungbellows and never a moment without a fiery hook about to take its place on the growing chains never a second when the thin smoke of the forges and of those lives consuming slowly in front of them did not escape from out of the dingy whitewashed spaces past the dark rafters away to freedom  but there had been in the air that morning something more than the white sunlight  there had been anticipation  and at two oclock began fulfilment  the forges were stilled and from court and alley forth came the women  in their ragged working clothes in their best clothesso little different in bonnets in hats bareheaded with babies born and unborn they swarmed into the high street and formed across it behind the band  a strange magpie jaylike flock black white patched with brown and green and blue shifting chattering laughing seeming unconscious of any purpose  a thousand and more of them with faces twisted and scored by those myriad deformings which a desperate towntoiling and little food fasten on human visages yet with hardly a single evil or brutal face  seemingly it was not easy to be evil or brutal on a wage that scarcely bound soul and body  a thousand and more of the poorestpaid and hardestworked human beings in the world  on the pavement alongside this strange acquiescing assembly of revolt about to march in protest against the conditions of their lives stood a young woman without a hat and in poor clothes but with a sort of beauty in her roughhaired high cheekboned darkeyed face  she was not one of them yet by a stroke of natures irony there was graven on her face alone of all those faces the true look of rebellion a haughty almost fierce uneasy lookan untamed look  on all the other thousand faces one could see no bitterness no fierceness not even enthusiasm only a halfstolid halfvivacious patience and eagerness as of children going to a party  the band played and they began to march  laughing talking waving flags trying to keep step with the same expression slowly but surely coming over every face the future was not only the presentthis happy present of marching behind the discordance of a brass band this strange present of crowded movement and laughter in open air  we otherssome dozen accidentals like myself and the tall greyhaired lady interested in the people together with those few kind spirits in charge of the showmarched too a little selfconscious desiring with a vague military sensation to hold our heads up but not too much under the eyes of the curious bystanders thesenearly all menwere wellwishers it was said though their faces pale from their own work in shop or furnace expressed nothing but apathy  they wished well very dumbly in the presence of this new thing as if they found it queer that women should be doing something for themselves queer and rather dangerous  a few indeed shuffled along between the column and the little hopeless shops and grimy factory sheds and one or two accompanied their women carrying the baby  now and then there passed us some bettertodo citizena housewife or lawyers clerk or ironmonger with lips pressed rather tightly together and an air of taking no notice of this disturbance of traffic as though the whole thing were a rather poor joke which they had already heard too often  so with laughter and a continual crack of voices our jaylike crew swung on swaying and thumping in the strange ecstasy of irreflection happy to be moving they knew not where nor greatly why under the visiting sun to the sound of murdered music whenever the band stopped playing discipline became as tatterdemalion as the very flags and garments but never once did they lose that look of essential order as if indeed they knew that being the worstserved creatures in the christian world they were the chief guardians of the inherent dignity of man  hatless in the very front row marched a tall slip of a girl arrowstraight and so thin with dirty fair hair in a blouse and skirt gaping behind ever turning her pretty face on its pretty slim neck from side to side so that one could see her blue eyes sweeping here there everywhere with a sort of flowerlike wildness as if a secret embracing of each moment forbade her to let them rest on anything and break this pleasure of just marching  it seemed that in the neverstill eyes of that anaemic happy girl the spirit of our march had elected to enshrine itself and to make thence its little excursions to each ecstatic follower  just behind her marched a little old womana maker of chains they said for forty yearswhose black slits of eyes were sparkling who fluttered a bit of ribbon and reeled with her sense of the exquisite humour of the world  every now and then she would make a rush at one of her leaders to demonstrate how immoderately glorious was life  and each time she spoke the woman next to her laden with a heavy baby went off into squeals of laughter  behind her again marched one who beat time with her head and waved a little bit of stick intoxicated by this noble music  for an hour the pageant wound through the dejected street pursuing neither method nor set route till it came to a deserted slagheap selected for the speechmaking  slowly the motley regiment swung into that grim amphitheatre under the pale sunshine and as i watched a strange fancy visited my brain  i seemed to see over every ragged head of those marching women a little yellow flame a thin flickering gleam spiring upward and blown back by the wind  a trick of the sunlight maybe  or was it that the life in their hearts the inextinguishable breath of happiness had for a moment escaped prison and was fluttering at the pleasure of the breeze  silent now just enjoying the sound of the words thrown down to them they stood unimaginably patient with that happiness of they knew not what gilding the air above them between the patchwork ribands of their poor flags  if they could not tell very much why they had come nor believe very much that they would gain anything by coming if their demonstration did not mean to the world quite all that oratory would have them think if they themselves were but the poorest humblest least learned women in the landfor all that it seemed to me that in those tattered wistful figures so still so trustful i was looking on such beauty as i had never beheld  all the elaborated glory of things made the perfected dreams of aesthetes the embroideries of romance seemed as nothing beside this sudden vision of the wild goodness native in humble hearts 1910     a christian  one day that summer i came away from a luncheon in company of an old college chum  always exciting to meet those one hasnt seen for years and as we walked across the park together i kept looking at him askance he had altered a good deal  lean he always was but now very lean and so upright that his parsons coat was overhung by the back of his long and narrow head with its dark grizzled hair which thought had not yet loosened on his forehead  his cleanshorn face so thin and oblong was remarkable only for the eyes darkbrowed and lashed and coloured like bright steel they had a fixity in them a sort of absence on one couldnt tell what business  they made me think of torture  and his mouth always gently smiling as if its pinched curly sweetness had been commanded was the mouth of a man crucifiedyes crucified  tramping silently over the parched grass i felt that if we talked we must infallibly disagree his straightup narrow forehead so suggested a nature divided within itself into compartments of iron  it was hot that day and we rested presently beside the serpentine on its bright waters were the usual young men sculling themselves to and fro with their usual sad energy the usual promenaders loitering and watching them the usual dog that swam when it did not bark and barked when it did not swim and my friend sat smiling twisting between his thin fingers the little gold cross on his silk vest  then all of a sudden we did begin to talk and not of those matters of which the wellbred naturally conversethe habits of the rarer kinds of ducks and the careers of our college friends but of something never mentioned in polite society  at lunch our hostess had told me the sad story of an unhappy marriage and i had itched spiritually to find out what my friend who seemed so far away from me felt about such things  and now i determined to find out  tell me i asked him which do you consider most importantthe letter or the spirit of christs teachings  my dear fellow he answered gently what a question  how can you separate them  well is it not the essence of his doctrine that the spirit is all important and the forms of little value  does not that run through all the sermon on the mount  certainly  if then i said christs teaching is concerned with the spirit do you consider that christians are justified in holding others bound by formal rules of conduct without reference to what is passing in their spirits  if it is for their good  what enables you to decide what is for their good  surely we are told  not to judge that ye be not judged  oh but we do not ourselves judge we are but impersonal ministers of the rules of god  ah  do general rules of conduct take account of the variations of the individual spirit  he looked at me hard as if he began to scent heresy  you had better explain yourself more fully he said  i really dont follow  well let us take a concrete instance  we know christs saying of the married that they are one flesh  but we know also that there are wives who continue to live the married life with dreadful feelings of spiritual revolt wives who have found out that in spite of all their efforts they have no spiritual affinity with their husbands  is that in accordance with the spirit of christs teaching or is it not  we are told he began  i have admitted the definite commandment they twain shall be one flesh  there could not be seemingly any more rigid law laid down how do you reconcile it with the essence of christs teaching  frankly i want to know is there or is there not a spiritual coherence in christianity or is it only a gathering of laws and precepts with no inherent connected spiritual philosophy  of course he said in his longsuffering voice we dont look at things like thatfor us there is no questioning  but how do you reconcile such marriages as i speak of with the spirit of christs teaching  i think you ought to answer me  oh  i can perfectly he answered the reconciliation is through suffering  what a poor woman in such a case must suffer makes for the salvation of her spirit  that is the spiritual fulfilment and in such a case the justification of the law  so then i said sacrifice or suffering is the coherent thread of christian philosophy  suffering cheerfully borne he answered  you do not think i said that there is a touch of extravagance in that  would you say for example that an unhappy marriage is a more christian thing than a happy one where there is no suffering but only love  a line came between his brows  well he said at last i would say i think that a woman who crucifies her flesh with a cheerful spirit in obedience to gods law stands higher in the eyes of god than one who undergoes no such sacrifice in her married life  and i had the feeling that his stare was passing through me on its way to an unseen goal  you would desire then i suppose suffering as the greatest blessing for yourself  humbly he said i would try to  and naturally for others  god forbid  but surely that is inconsistent  he murmured you see i have suffered  we were silent  at last i said yes that makes much which was dark quite clear to me  oh he asked  i answered slowly not many men you know even in your profession have really suffered  that is why they do not feel the difficulty which you feel in desiring suffering for others  he threw up his head exactly as if i had hit him on the jaw its weakness in me i know he said  i should have rather called it weakness in them  but suppose you are right and that its weakness not to be able to desire promiscuous suffering for others would you go further and say that it is christian for those who have not experienced a certain kind of suffering to force that particular kind on others  he sat silent for a full minute trying evidently to reach to the bottom of my thought  surely not he said at last except as ministers of gods laws  you do not then think that it is christian for the husband of such a woman to keep her in that state of sufferingnot being of course a minister of god  he began stammering at that ii he said  no that is i think notnot christian  no certainly  then such a marriage if persisted in makes of the wife indeed a christian but of the husbandthe reverse  the answer to that is clear he said quietly the husband must abstain  yes that is perhaps coherently christian on your theory they would then both suffer  but the marriage of course has become no marriage they are no longer one flesh  he looked at me almost impatiently as if to say do not compel me to enforce silence on you  but suppose i went on and this you know is the more frequent case the man refuses to abstain  would you then say it was more christian to allow him to become daily less christian through his unchristian conduct than to relieve the woman of her suffering at the expense of the spiritual benefit she thence derives  why in fact do you favour one case more than the other  all question of relief he replied is a matter for caesar it cannot concern me  there had come into his face a rigidityas if i might hit it with my questions till my tongue was tired and it be no more moved than the bench on which we were sitting  one more question i said and i have done  since the christian teaching is concerned with the spirit and not forms and the thread in it which binds all together and makes it coherent is that of suffering  redemption by suffering he put in  if you willin one word selfcrucifixioni must ask you and dont take it personally because of what you told me of yourself in life generally one does not accept from people any teaching that is not the result of firsthand experience on their parts  do you believe that this christian teaching of yours is valid from the mouths of those who have not themselves sufferedwho have not themselves as it were been crucified  he did not answer for a minute then he said with painful slowness christ laid hands on his apostles and sent them forth and they in turn and so on to our day  do you say then that this guarantees that they have themselves suffered so that in spirit they are identified with their teaching  he answered bravely noi do noti cannot say that in fact it is always so  is not then their teaching born of forms and not of the spirit  he rose and with a sort of deep sorrow at my stubbornness said we are not permitted to know the way of this it is so ordained we must have faith  as he stood there turned from me with his hat off and his neck painfully flushed under the sharp outcurve of his dark head a feeling of pity surged up in me as if i had taken an unfair advantage  reasoncoherencephilosophy he said suddenly  you dont understand  all that is nothing to menothingnothing 1911     wind in the rocks  though dewdark when we set forth there was stealing into the frozen air an invisible white host of the wanwinged lightborn beyond the mountains and already like a drift of doves harbouring greywhite high up on the snowy skycaves of monte cristallo and within us tramping over the valley meadows was the incredible elation of those who set out before the sun has risen every minute of the precious day before uswe had not lost one  at the mouth of that enchanted chine across which for a million years the howdahed rock elephant has marched but never yet passed from sight we crossed the stream and among the trees began our ascent  very far away the first cowbells chimed and over the dark heights we saw the thin sinking moon looking like the white horns of some devotional beast watching and waiting up there for the god of light  that god came slowly stalking across far over our heads from top to top then of a sudden his flamewhite form was seen standing in a gap of the valley walls the trees flung themselves along the ground before him and censers of pine gum began swinging in the dark aisles releasing their perfumed steam  throughout these happy ravines where no man lives he shows himself naked and unashamed the colour of pale honey on his golden hair such shining as one has not elsewhere seen his eyes like old wine on fire  and already he had swept his hand across the invisible strings for there had arisen the music of uncurling leaves and flitting things  a legend runs that driven from land to land by christians apollo hid himself in lower austria but those who ever they saw him there in the thirteenth century were wrong it was to these enchanted chines frequented only by the mountain shepherds that he certainly came  and as we were lying on the grass of the first alp with the star gentiansthose fallen drops of the skyand the burntbrown dandelions and scattered shrubs of alpenrose round us we were visited by one of these very shepherds passing with his flockthe fiercestlooking man who ever spoke in a gentle voice six feet high with an orange cloak bare knees burnt as the very dandelions a beard blacker than black and eyes more glorious than if sun and night had dived and were lying imprisoned in their depths  he spoke in an unknown tongue and could certainly not understand any word of ours but he smelled of the good earth and only through interminable watches under sun and stars could so great a gentleman have been perfected  presently while we rested outside that alpine hut which faces the three sphinxlike mountains there came back from climbing the smallest and most dangerous of those peaks one pale from heat and trembling with fatigue a tall man with long brown hands and a long thin bearded face  and as he sipped cautiously of red wine and water he looked at his little conquered mountain  his kindly screwedup eyes his kindly bearded lips even his limbs seemed smiling and not for the world would we have jarred with words that rapt smiling man enjoying the sacred hour of him who has just proved himself  in silence we watched in silence left him smiling knowing somehow that we should remember him all our days  for there was in his smile the glamour of adventure just for the sake of danger all that high instinct which takes a man out of his chair to brave what he need not  between that hut and the three mountains lies a saddleastride of all beauty and all colour master of a titanic chaos of deep clefts tawny heights red domes far snow and the purple of long shadows and standing there we comprehended a little of what earth had been through in her time to have made this playground for most glorious demons mother earth  what travail undergone what long heroic throes had brought on her face such majesty  hereabout edelweiss was clinging to smoothedout rubble but a little higher even the everlasting plant was lost there was no more life and presently we lay down on the mountain side rather far apart  up here above trees and pasture the wind had a strange bare voice free from all outer influence sweeping along with a cold whiffing sound on the warm stones in full sunlight uplifted over all the beauty of italy one felt at first only delight in space and wild loveliness in the unknown valleys and the strength of the sun  it was so good to be alive so ineffably good to be living in this most wonderful world drinking air nectar  behind us from the three mountains came the frequent thud and scuffle of falling rocks loosened by rains  the wind mist and winter snow had ground the powdery stones on which we lay to a pleasant bed but once on a time they too had clung up there  and very slowly one could not say how or when the sense of joy began changing to a sense of fear  the awful impersonality of those great rockcreatures the terrible impartiality of that cold clinging wind which swept by never an inch lifted above ground  not one tiny soul the size of a midge or rock flower lived here  not one little i breathed here and loved  and we too some day would no longer love having become part of this monstrous lovely earth of that cold whiffling air  to be no longer able to love  it seemed incredible too grim to bear yet it was true to become powder and the wind no more to feel the sunlight to be loved no more  to become a whiffling noise cold without ones self  to drift on the breath of that noise homeless  up here there were not even those little velvet greywhite flowercomrades we had plucked  no life nothing but the creeping wind and those great rocky heights whence came the sound of fallingsymbols of that cold untimely state into which we too must pass never more to love nor to be loved  one could but turn to the earth and press ones face to it away from the wild loveliness of what use loveliness that must be lost of what use loveliness when one could not love  the earth was warm and firm beneath the palms of the hands but there still came the sound of the impartial wind and the careless roar of the stories falling  below in those valleys amongst the living trees and grass was the comradeship of unnumbered life so that to pass out into peace to step beyond to die seemed but a brotherly act amongst all those others but up here where no creature breathed we saw the heart of the desert that stretches before each little human soul  up here it froze the spirit even peace seemed mockinghard as a stone  yet to try and hide to tuck ones head under ones own wing was not possible in this air so crystal clear so far above incense and the narcotics of set creeds and the fevered breath of prayers and protestations  even to know that between organic and inorganic matter there is no gulf fixed was of no peculiar comfort  the jealous wind came creeping over the lifeless limestone removing even the poor solace of its warmth one turned from it desperate to look up at the sky the blue burning wide ineffable far sky  then slowly without reason that icy fear passed into a feeling not of joy not of peace but as if life and death were exalted into what was neither life nor death a strange and motionless vibration in which one had been merged and rested utterly content equipoised divested of desire endowed with life and death  but since this moment had come before its time we got up and close together marched on rather silently in the hot sun 1910     my distant relative  though i had not seen my distant relative for yearsnot in fact since he was obliged to give vancouver island up as a bad jobi knew him at once when with head a little on one side and teacup held high as if to confer a blessing he said hallo across the club smokingroom  thin as a lathnot one ounce heaviertall and very upright with his pale forehead and pale eyes and pale beard he had the air of a ghost of a man  he had always had that air  and his voicethat matteroffact and slightly nasal voice with its thin pragmatical tonewas like a wraith of optimism issuing between pale lips  i noticed too that his town habiliments still had their unspeakable pale neatness as if poor things they were trying to stare the daylight out of countenance  he brought his tea across to my bay window with that wistful sociability of his as of a man who cannot always find a listener  but what are you doing in town i said  i thought you were in yorkshire with your aunt  over his round light eyes fixed on something in the street the lids fell quickly twice as the film falls over the eyes of a parrot  im after a job he answered  must be on the spot just now  and it seemed to me that i had heard those words from him before  ah yes i said and do you think youll get it  but even as i spoke i felt sorry remembering how many jobs he had been after in his time and how soon they ended when he had got them  he answered  oh yes  they ought to give it me then added rather suddenly you never know though  people are so funny  and crossing his thin legs he went on to tell me with quaint impersonality a number of instances of how people had been funny in connection with jobs he had not been given  you see he ended the countrys in such a statecapital going out of it every day  enterprise being killed all over the place theres practically nothing to be had  ah i said you think its worse then than it used to be  he smiled in that smile there was a shade of patronage  were going downhill as fast as ever we can  national characters losing all its backbone  no wonder with all this mollycoddling going on  oh i murmured mollycoddling  isnt that excessive  well  look at the way everythings being done for them  the working classes are losing their selfrespect as fast as ever they can  their independence is gone already  you think  sure of it  ill give you an instance and he went on to describe to me the degeneracy of certain working men employed by his aunt and his eldest brother claud and his youngest brother alan  they dont do a stroke more than theyre obliged he ended they know jolly well theyve got their unions and their pensions and this insurance to fall back on  it was evidently a subject on which he felt strongly  yes he muttered the nation is being rotted down  and a faint thrill of surprise passed through me  for the affairs of the nation moved him so much more strongly than his own  his voice already had a different ring his eyes a different look  he eagerly leaned forward and his long straight backbone looked longer and straighter than ever  he was less the ghost of a man  a faint flush even had come into his pale cheeks and he moved his wellkept hands emphatically  oh yes he said the country is going to the dogs right enough but you cant get them to see it  they go on sapping and sapping the independence of the people  if the working mans to be looked after whatever he doeswhat on earths to become of his go and foresight and perseverance  in his rising voice a certain piquancy was left to its accent of the ruling class by that faint twang which came i remembered from some slight defect in his tonsils  mark my words  so long as were on these lines we shall do nothing its going against evolution  they say darwins getting oldfashioned all i know is hes good enough for me  competition is the only thing  but competition i said is bitter cruel and some people cant stand against it  and i looked at him rather hard do you object to putting any sort of floor under the feet of people like that  he let his voice drop a little as if in deference to my scruples  ah he said but if you once begin this sort of thing theres no end to it  its so insidious  the more they have the more they want and all the time theyre losing fighting power  ive thought pretty deeply about this  its shortsighted it really doesnt do  but i said surely youre not against saving people from being knocked out of time by old age and accidents like illness and the fluctuations of trade  oh he said im not a bit against charity  aunt emmas splendid about that  and clauds awfully good  i do what i can myself  he looked at me so queerly deprecating that i quite liked him at that moment  at hearti felt he was a good fellow  all i think is he went on that to give them something that they can rely on as a matter of course apart from their own exertions is the wrong principle altogether and suddenly his voice began to rise again and his eyes to stare  im convinced that all this doing things for other people and bolstering up the weak is rotten  it stands to reason that it must be  he had risen to his feet so preoccupied with the wrongness of that principle that he seemed to have forgotten my presence  and as he stood there in the window the light was too strong for him  all the thin incapacity of that shadowy figure was pitilessly displayed the desperate narrowness in that long pale face the wambling look of those pale wellkept handsall that made him such a ghost of a man but his nasal dogmatic voice rose and rose  theres nothing for it but bracing up  we must cut away all this state support we must teach them to rely on themselves  its all sheer pauperisation  and suddenly there shot through me the fear that he might burst one of those little blue veins in his pale forehead so vehement had he become and hastily i changed the subject  do you like living up there with your aunt i asked isnt it a bit quiet  he turned as if i had awakened him from a dream  oh well he said its only till i get this job  let me seehow long is it since you  four years  shes very glad to have me of course  and hows your brother claud  oh  all right thanks a bit worried with the estate  the poor old govnor left it in rather a mess you know  ah  yes  does he do other work  oh  always busy in the parish  and your brother richard  hes all right  came home this year  got just enough to live on with his pensionhasnt saved a rap of course  and willie  is he still delicate  yes  im sorry  easy job his you know  and even if his health does give out his college pals will always find him some sort of sinecure  so jolly popular old willie  and alan  i havent heard anything of him since his peruvian thing came to grief  he married didnt he  rather  one of the burleys  nice girlheiress lot of property in hampshire  he looks after it for her now  doesnt do anything else i suppose  keeps up his antiquarianism  i had exhausted the members of his family  then as though by eliciting the good fortunes of his brothers i had cast some slur upon himself he said suddenly if the railway had come as it ought to have while i was out there i should have done quite well with my fruit farm  of course i agreed it was bad luck  but after all youre sure to get a job soon andso long as you can live up there with your auntyou can afford to wait and not bother  yes he murmured  and i got up  well its been very jolly to hear about you all  he followed me out  awfully glad old man he said to have seen you and had this talk i was feeling rather low  waiting to know whether i get that jobits not lively  he came down the club steps with me  by the door of my cab a loafer was standing a tall tatterdemalion with a pale bearded face  my distant relative fended him away and leaning through the window murmured awful lot of these chaps about now  for the life of me i could not help looking at him very straight but no flicker of apprehension crossed his face  well goodby again he said youve cheered me up a lot  i glanced back from my moving cab  some monetary transaction was passing between him and the loafer but shortsighted as i am i found it difficult to decide which of those tall pale bearded figures was giving the other one a penny and by some strange freak an awful vision shot up before meof myself and my distant relative and claud and richard and willie and alan all suddenly relying on ourselves  i took out my handkerchief to mop my brow but a thought struck me and i put it back was it possible for me and my distant relatives and their distant relatives and so on to infinity of those who be longed to a class provided by birth with a certain position raised by providence on to a platform made up of money inherited of interest of education fitting us for certain privileged pursuits of friends similarly endowed of substantial homes and substantial relatives of some sort or other on whom we could fall backwas it possible for any of us ever to be in the position of having to rely absolutely on ourselves  for several minutes i pondered that question and slowly i came to the conclusion that short of crime or that unlikely event marooning it was not possible  never nevertry as we mightcould any single one of us be quite in the position of one of those whose approaching pauperisation my distant relative had so vehemently deplored  we were already pauperised  if we served our country we were pensioned  if we inherited land it could not be taken from us if we went into the church we were there for life whether we were suitable or no  if we attempted the more hazardous occupations of the law medicine the arts or business there were always those homes those relations those friends of ours to fall back on if we failed  no  we could never have to rely entirely on ourselves we could never be pauperised more than we were already  and a light burst in on me  that explained why my distant relative felt so keenly  it bit him for he saw of course how dreadful it would be for these poor people of the working classes when legislation had succeeded in placing them in the humiliating position in which we already werethe dreadful position of having something to depend on apart from our own exertions some sort of security in our lives i saw it now  it was his secret pride gnawing at him all the time that made him so rabid on the point  he was longing doubtless day and night not to have had a father who had land and had left a sister well enough off to keep him while he was waiting for his job he must be feeling how horribly degrading was the position of claudinheriting that land and of richard who just because he had served in the indian civil service had got to live on a pension all the rest of his days and of willie who was in danger at any moment if his healthalways delicategave out of having a sinecure found for him by his college friends and of alan whose educated charm had enabled him to marry an heiress and live by managing her estates all all sapped of go and foresight and perseverance by a cruel providence  that was what he was really feeling and concealing be cause he was too wellbred to show his secret grief and i felt suddenly quite warm toward him now that i saw how he was suffering i understood how bound he felt in honour to combat with all his force this attempt to place others in his own distressing situation at the same time i was honest enough to confess to myself sitting there in the cabthat i did not personally share that pride of his or feel that i was being rotted by my own position i even felt some dim gratitude that if my powers gave out at any time and i had not saved anything i should still not be left destitute to face the prospect of a bleak and impoverished old age and i could not help a weak pleasure in the thought that a certain relative security was being guaranteed to those people of the working classes who had never had it before  at the same moment i quite saw that to a prouder and stronger heart it must indeed be bitter to have to sit still under your own security and even more bitter to have to watch that pauperising security coming closer and closer to othersfor the generous soul is always more concerned for others than for himself no doubt i thought if truth were known my distant relative is consumed with longing to change places with that loafer who tried to open the door of my cabfor surely he must see as i do that that is just what he himselfhaving failed to stand the pressure of competition in his lifewould be doing if it were not for the accident of his birth which has so lamentably insured him against coming to that  yes i thought you have learnt something today it does not do you see hastily to despise those distant relatives of yours who talk about pauperising and mollycoddling the lower classes  no no  one must look deeper than that  one must have generosity  and with that i stopped the cab and got out for i wanted a breath of air 1911     the black godmother  sitting out on the lawn at tea with our friend and his retriever we had been discussing those massacres of the helpless which had of late occurred and wondering that they should have been committed by the soldiery of so civilised a state when in a momentary pause of our astonishment our friend who had been listening in silence crumpling the drooping soft ear of his dog looked up and said the cause of atrocities is generally the violence of fear  panics at the back of most crimes and follies  knowing that his philosophical statements were always the result of concrete instance and that he would not tell us what that instance was if we asked himsuch being his naturewe were careful not to agree  he gave us a look out of those eyes of his so like the eyes of a mild eagle and said abruptly what do you say to this then    i was out in the dogdays last year with this fellow of mine looking for osmunda and stayed some days in a villagenever mind the name coming back one evening from my tramp i saw some boys stoning a mealycoloured dog  i went up and told the young devils to stop it  they only looked at me in the injured way boys do and one of them called out its mad guvnor i told them to clear off and they took to their heels  the dog followed me  it was a young leggy mild looking mongrel crossi should saybetween a brown retriever and an irish terrier  there was froth about its lips and its eyes were watery it looked indeed as if it might be in distemper  i was afraid of infection for this fellow of mine and whenever it came too close shooed it away till at last it slunk off altogether  well about nine oclock when i was settling down to write by the open window of my sittingroomstill daylight and very quiet and warmthere began that most maddening sound the barking of an unhappy dog  i could do nothing with that continual yap yap going on and it was too hot to shut the window so i went out to see if i could stop it the men were all at the pub and the women just finished with their gossip there was no sound at all but the continual barking of this dog somewhere away out in the fields  i travelled by ear across three meadows till i came on a haystack by a pool of water  there was the dog sure enoughthe same mealycoloured mongrel tied to a stake yapping and making frantic little runs on a bit of rusty chain whirling round and round the stake then standing quite still and shivering  i went up and spoke to it but it backed into the haystack and there it stayed shrinking away from me with its tongue hanging out  it had been heavily struck by something on the head the cheek was cut one eye halfclosed and an ear badly swollen  i tried to get hold of it but the poor thing was beside itself with fear  it snapped and flew round so that i had to give it up and sit down with this fellow here beside me to try and quiet ita strange dog you know will generally form his estimate of you from the way it sees you treat another dog  i had to sit there quite half an hour before it would let me go up to it pull the stake out and lead it away  the poor beast though it was so feeble from the blows it had received was still halffrantic and i didnt dare to touch it and all the time i took good care that this fellow here didnt come too near  then came the question what was to be done  there was no vet of course and id no place to put it except my sittingroom which didnt belong to me  but looking at its battered head and its halfmad eyes i thought no trusting you with these bumpkins youll have to come in here for the night well i got it in and heaped two or three of those hairy little red rugs landladies are so fond of up in a corner and got it on to them and put down my bread and milk  but it wouldnt eatits sense of proportion was all gone fairly destroyed by terror  it lay there moaning and every now and then it raised its head with a yap of sheer fright dreadful to hear and bit the air as if its enemies were on it again and this fellow of mine lay in the opposite corner with his head on his paw watching it  i sat up for a long time with that poor beast sick enough and wondering how it had come to be stoned and kicked and battered into this state and next day i made it my business to find out  our friend paused scanned us a little angrily and then went on it had made its first appearance it seems following a bicyclist there are men you knowsave the markwho when their beasts get ill or too expensive jump on their bicycles and take them for a quick run taking care never to look behind them  when they get back home they say hallo wheres fido  fido is nowhere and theres an end  well this poor puppy gave up just as it got to our village and roaming shout in search of water attached itself to a farm labourer  the man with excellent intentionsas he told me himselftried to take hold of it but too abruptly so that it was startled and snapped at him  whereon he kicked it for a dangerous cur and it went drifting back toward the village and fell in with the boys coming home from school  it thought no doubt that they were going to kick it too and nipped one of them who took it by the collar thereupon they hullabalooed and stoned it down the road to where i found them  then i put in my little bit of torture and drove it away through fear of infection to my own dog  after that it seems to have fallen in with a man who told me well you see he came sneakin round my house with the children playin and snapped at them when they went to stroke him so that they came running in to their mother an she called to me in a fine takin about a mad dog i ran out with a shovel and gave im one and drove him out  im sorry if he wasnt mad he looked it right enough you cant be too careful with strange dogs  its next acquaintance was an old stonebreaker a very decent sort  well you see the old man explained to me the dog came smellin round my stones an it wouldn come near an it wouldn go away it was all froth and blood about the jaw and its eyes glared green at me  i thought to meself bein the dogdaysi dont like the look o you you look funny  so i took a stone an got it here just on the ear an it fell over  and i thought to meself well youve got to finish it or itll go bitin somebody for sure  but when i come to it with my hammer the dog it got upan you know how it is when theres somethin youve alf killed and you feel sorry and yet you feel you must finish it an you hit at it blind you hit at it agen an agen the poor thing it wriggled and snapped an i was terrified itd bite me an someow it got away  again our friend paused and this time we dared not look at him  the next hospitality it was shown he went on presently was by a farmer who seeing it all bloody drove it off thinking it had been digging up a lamb that hed just buried  the poor homeless beast came sneaking back so he told his men to get rid of it  well they got hold of it somehowthere was a hole in its neck that looked as if theyd used a pitchforkand mortally afraid of its biting them but not liking as they told me to drown it for fear the owner might come on them they got a stake and a chain and fastened it up and left it in the water by the haystack where i found it  i had some conversation with that farmer  thats right he said but who was to know  i couldnt have my sheep worried  the brute had blood on his muzzle  these curs do a lot of harm when theyve once been blooded  you cant run risks  our friend cut viciously at a dandelion with his stick  run risks he broke out suddenly that was it from beginning to end of that poor beasts sufferings fear  from that fellow on the bicycle afraid of the worry and expense as soon as it showed signs of distemper to myself and the man with the pitch forknot one of us i daresay would have gone out of our way to do ita harm  but we felt fear and so by the law of selfpreservation or what ever you likeit all began till there the poor thing was with a battered head and a hole in its neck ravenous with hunger and too distraught even to lap my bread and milk  yes and theres something uncanny about a suffering animalwe sat watching it and again we were afraid looking at its eyes and the way it bit the air fear  its the black godmother of all damnable things  our friend bent down crumpling and crumpling at his dogs ears  we too gazed at the ground thinking of that poor lost puppy and the horrible inevitability of all that happens seeing men are what they are thinking of all the foul doings in the world whose black godmother is fear  and what became of the poor dog one of us asked at last  when said our friend slowly id had my fill of watching i covered it with a rug took this fellow away with me and went to bed  there was nothing else to do  at dawn i was awakened by three dreadful criesnot like a dogs at all  i hurried down  there was the poor beastwriggled out from under the rugstretched on its side dead  this fellow of mine had followed me in and he went and sat down by the body  when i spoke to him he just looked round and wagged his tail along the ground but would not come away and there he sat till it was buried very interested but not sorry at all  our friend was silent looking angrily at something in the distance  and we too were silent seeing in spirit that vigil of early morning the thin lifeless sandycoloured body stretched on those red mats and this black creaturenow lying at our feetpropped on its haunches like the dog in the death of procris patient curious ungrieved staring down at it with his bright interested eyes 1912     studies and essays  by john

extreme youth because he made my fathers boots inhabiting with his elder brother two little shops let into one in a small bystreetnow no more but then most fashionably placed in the west end  that tenement had a certain quiet distinction there was no sign upon its face that he made for any of the royal familymerely his own german name of gessler brothers and in the window a few pairs of boots  i remember that it always troubled me to account for those unvarying boots in the window for he made only what was ordered reaching nothing down and it seemed so inconceivable that what he made could ever have failed to fit had he bought them to put there  that too seemed inconceivable  he would never have tolerated in his house leather on which he had not worked himself  besides they were too beautifulthe pair of pumps so inexpressibly slim the patent leathers with cloth tops making water come into ones mouth the tall brown riding boots with marvellous sooty glow as if though new they had been worn a hundred years  those pairs could only have been made by one who saw before him the soul of bootso truly were they prototypes incarnating the very spirit of all footgear these thoughts of course came to me later though even when i was promoted to him at the age of perhaps fourteen some inkling haunted me of the dignity of himself and brother  for to make bootssuch boots as he madeseemed to me then and still seems to me mysterious and wonderful  i remember well my shy remark one day while stretching out to him my youthful foot  isnt it awfully hard to do mr gessler  and his answer given with a sudden smile from out of the sardonic redness of his beard id is an ardt  himself he was a little as if made from leather with his yellow crinkly face and crinkly reddish hair and beard and neat folds slanting down his cheeks to the corners of his mouth and his guttural and onetoned voice for leather is a sardonic substance and stiff and slow of purpose  and that was the character of his face save that his eyes which were greyblue had in them the simple gravity of one secretly possessed by the ideal  his elder brother was so very like himthough watery paler in every way with a great industrythat sometimes in early days i was not quite sure of him until the interview was over then i knew that it was he if the words i will ask my brudder had not been spoken and that if they had it was his elder brother  when one grew old and wild and ran up bills one somehow never ran them up with gessler brothers  it would not have seemed becoming to go in there and stretch out ones foot to that blue ironspectacled glance owing him for more thansaytwo pairs just the comfortable reassurance that one was still his client  for it was not possible to go to him very oftenhis boots lasted terribly having something beyond the temporarysome as it were essence of boot stitched into them  one went in not as into most shops in the mood of please serve me and let me go but restfully as one enters a church and sitting on the single wooden chair waitedfor there was never anybody there soon over the top edge of that sort of wellrather dark and smelling soothingly of leatherwhich formed the shop there would be seen his face or that of his elder brother peering down  a guttural sound and the tiptap of bast slippers beating the narrow wooden stairs and he would stand before one without coat a little bent in leather apron with sleeves turned back blinkingas if awakened from some dream of boots or like an owl surprised in daylight and annoyed at this interruption  and i would say how do you do mr gessler  could you make me a pair of russia leather boots  without a word he would leave me retiring whence he came or into the other portion of the shop and i would continue to rest in the wooden chair inhaling the incense of his trade  soon he would come back holding in his thin veined hand a piece of goldbrown leather with eyes fixed on it he would remark what a beaudiful biece when i too had admired it he would speak again  when do you wand dem  and i would answer oh  as soon as you conveniently can and he would say tomorrow fordnighd  or if he were his elder brother i will ask my brudder  then i would murmur thank you  goodmorning mr  gessler gootmorning he would reply still looking at the leather in his hand and as i moved to the door i would hear the tiptap of his bast slippers restoring him up the stairs to his dream of boots  but if it were some new kind of footgear that he had not yet made me then indeed he would observe ceremonydivesting me of my boot and holding it long in his hand looking at it with eyes at once critical and loving as if recalling the glow with which he had created it and rebuking the way in which one had disorganized this masterpiece then placing my foot on a piece of paper he would two or three times tickle the outer edges with a pencil and pass his nervous fingers over my toes feeling himself into the heart of my requirements  i cannot forget that day on which i had occasion to say to him mr gessler that last pair of town walkingboots creaked you know  he looked at me for a time without replying as if expecting me to withdraw or qualify the statement then said  id shouldnd ave greaked  it did im afraid  you goddem wed before dey found demselves  i dont think so  at that he lowered his eyes as if hunting for memory of those boots and i felt sorry i had mentioned this grave thing  zend dem back he said i will look at dem  a feeling of compassion for my creaking boots surged up in me so well could i imagine the sorrowful long curiosity of regard which he would bend on them  zome boods he said slowly are bad from birdt  if i can do noding wid dem i dake dem off your bill  once once only i went absentmindedly into his shop in a pair of boots bought in an emergency at some large firms  he took my order without showing me any leather and i could feel his eyes penetrating the inferior integument of my foot  at last he said  dose are nod my boods  the tone was not one of anger nor of sorrow not even of contempt but there was in it something quiet that froze the blood  he put his hand down and pressed a finger on the place where the left boot endeavouring to be fashionable was not quite comfortable  id urds you dere he said  dose big virms ave no selfrespect drash  and then as if something had given way within him he spoke long and bitterly  it was the only time i ever heard him discuss the conditions and hardships of his trade  dey get id all he said dey get id by adverdisement nod by work dey dake it away from us who lofe our boods  id gomes to thisbresently i haf no work  every year id gets less you will see  and looking at his lined face i saw things i had never noticed before bitter things and bitter struggleand what a lot of grey hairs there seemed suddenly in his red beard  as best i could i explained the circumstances of the purchase of those illomened boots  but his face and voice made so deep impression that during the next few minutes i ordered many pairs nemesis fell  they lasted more terribly than ever  and i was not able conscientiously to go to him for nearly two years  when at last i went i was surprised to find that outside one of the two little windows of his shop another name was painted also that of a bootmakermaking of course for the royal family  the old familiar boots no longer in dignified isolation were huddled in the single window  inside the now contracted well of the one little shop was more scented and darker than ever  and it was longer than usual too before a face peered down and the tiptap of the bast slippers began  at last he stood before me and gazing through those rusty iron spectacles said  mr isnd it  ah  mr  gessler i stammered but your boots are really too good you know  see these are quite decent still  and i stretched out to him my foot  he looked at it  yes he said beople do nod wand good hoods id seems  to get away from his reproachful eyes and voice i hastily remarked what have you done to your shop  he answered quietly id was too exbensif  do you wand some boods  i ordered three pairs though i had only wanted two and quickly left  i had i do not know quite what feeling of being part in his mind of a conspiracy against him or not perhaps so much against him as against his idea of boot  one does not i suppose care to feel like that for it was again many months before my next visit to his shop paid i remember with the feeling oh well i cant leave the old boyso here goes perhaps itll be his elder brother  for his elder brother i knew had not character enough to reproach me even dumbly  and to my relief in the shop there did appear to be his elder brother handling a piece of leather  well mr  gessler i said how are you  he came close and peered at me  i am breddy well he said slowly but my elder brudder is dead  and i saw that it was indeed himselfbut how aged and wan  and never before had i heard him mention his brother  much shocked i murmured oh  i am sorry  yes he answered he was a good man he made a good bood but he is dead  and he touched the top of his head where the hair had suddenly gone as thin as it had been on that of his poor brother to indicate i suppose the cause of death  he could nod ged over losing de oder shop do you wand any hoods  and he held up the leather in his hand ids a beaudiful biece  i ordered several pairs  it was very long before they camebut they were better than ever  one simply could not wear them out  and soon after that i went abroad  it was over a year before i was again in london  and the first shop i went to was my old friends  i had left a man of sixty i came back to one of seventyfive pinched and worn and tremulous who genuinely this time did not at first know me  oh  mr gessler i said sick at heart how splendid your boots are see ive been wearing this pair nearly all the time ive been abroad and theyre not half worn out are they  he looked long at my bootsa pair of russia leather and his face seemed to regain steadiness  putting his hand on my instep he said  do dey vid you here  i ad drouble wid dat bair i remember  i assured him that they had fitted beautifully  do you wand any boods he said  i can make dem quickly id is a slack dime  i answered please please  i want boots all roundevery kind  i will make a vresh model  your food must be bigger  and with utter slowness he traced round my foot and felt my toes only once looking up to say  did i dell you my brudder was dead  to watch him was painful so feeble had he grown i was glad to get away  i had given those boots up when one evening they came  opening the parcel i set the four pairs out in a row  then one by one i tried them on  there was no doubt about it  in shape and fit in finish and quality of leather they were the best he had ever made me  and in the mouth of one of the town walkingboots i found his bill  the amount was the same as usual but it gave me quite a shock  he had never before sent it in till quarter day  i flew downstairs and wrote a cheque and posted it at once with my own hand  a week later passing the little street i thought i would go in and tell him how splendidly the new boots fitted  but when i came to where his shop had been his name was gone  still there in the window were the slim pumps the patent leathers with cloth tops the sooty riding boots  i went in very much disturbed  in the two little shopsagain made into onewas a young man with an english face  mr gessler in i said  he gave me a strange ingratiating look  no sir he said no  but we can attend to anything with pleasure weve taken the shop over  youve seen our name no doubt next door we make for some very good people  yes yes i said but mr gessler  oh he answered dead  dead  but i only received these boots from him last wednesday week  ah he said a shockin go  poor old man starved imself  good god  slow starvation the doctor called it  you see he went to work in such a way  would keep the shop on wouldnt have a soul touch his boots except himself  when he got an order it took him such a time people wont wait  he lost everybody  and there hed sit goin on and oni will say that for him not a man in london made a better boot  but look at the competition  he never advertised  would ave the best leather too and do it all imself  well there it is what could you expect with his ideas  but starvation  that may be a bit flowery as the sayin isbut i know myself he was sittin over his boots day and night to the very last  you see i used to watch him  never gave imself time to eat never had a penny in the house  all went in rent and leather  how he lived so long i dont know he regular let his fire go out  he was a character  but he made good boots  yes i said he made good boots  and i turned and went out quickly for i did not want that youth to know that i could hardly see 1911     the grand juryin two panels and a frame  read that piece of paper which summoned me to sit on the grand jury at the approaching sessions lying in a scoop of the shore close to the great rollers of the seathat span of eternal freedom deprived just there of too great liberty by the word atlantic  and i remember thinking as i read that in each breaking wave was some particle which had visited every shore in all the worldthat in each sparkle of hot sunlight stealing that bright water up into the sky was the microcosm of all change and of all unity   panel i  in answer to that piece of paper i presented myself at the proper place in due course and with a certain trepidation  what was it that i was about to do  for i had no experience of these things  and being too early i walked a little to and fro looking at all those my partners in this matter of the purification of society prosecutors witnesses officials policemen detectives undetected pressmen barristers loafers clerks cadgers jurymen  and i remember having something of the feeling that one has when one looks into a sink without holding ones nose  there was such uneasy hurry so strange a disenchanted look a sort of spiritual dirt about all that place and there werefaces  and i thought to them my face must seem as their faces seem to me  soon i was taken with my accomplices to have my name called and to be sworn  i do not remember much about that process too occupied with wondering what these companions of mine were like but presently we all came to a long room with a long table where nineteen lists of indictments and nineteen pieces of blotting paper were set alongside nineteen pens  we did not i recollect speak much to one another but sat down and studied those nineteen lists  we had eightyseven cases on which to pronounce whether the bill was true or no and the clerk assured us we should get through them in two days at most over the top of these indictments i regarded my eighteen fellows there was in me a hunger of inquiry as to what they thought about this business and a sort of sorrowful affection for them as if we were all a ships company bound on some strange and awkward expedition  i wondered till i thought my wonder must be coming through my eyes whether they had the same curious sensation that i was feeling of doing something illegitimate which i had not been born to do together with a sense of selfimportance a sort of unholy interest in thus dealing with the lives of my fellow men  and slowly watching them i came to the conclusion that i need not wonder all with the exception perhaps of two a painter and a jew looked such good citizens  i became gradually sure that they were not troubled with the lap and wash of speculation unclogged by any devastating sense of unity pure of doubt and undefiled by an uneasy conscience  but now they began to bring us in the evidence  they brought it quickly and at first we looked at it whatever it was with a sort of solemn excitement  were we not arbiters of mens fates purifiers of society more important by far than judge or common jury  for if we did not bring in a true bill there was an end the accused would be discharged  we set to work slowly at first then faster and still faster bringing in true bills and after every one making a mark in our lists so that we might know where we were  we brought in true bills for burglary and false pretences larceny and fraud we brought them in for manslaughter rape and arson  when we had ten or so two of us would get up and bear them away down to the court below and lay them before the judge  thank you gentlemen he would say or words to that effect and we would go up again and go on bringing in true bills  i noticed that at the evidence of each fresh bill we looked with a little less excitement and a little less solemnity making every time a shorter tick and a shorter note in the margin of our lists  all the bills we hadfiftysevenwe brought in true and the morning and the afternoon made that day till we rested and went to our homes  next day we were all back in our places at the appointed hour and not greeting each other much at once began to bring in bills  we brought them in not quite so fast as though some lurking megrim some microbe of dissatisfaction with ourselves was at work within us it was as if we wanted to throw one out as if we felt our work too perfect  and presently it came  a case of defrauding one sophie liebermann or laubermann or some such foreign name by giving her one of those fivepound christmascard banknotes just then in fashion and receiving from her as she alleged three real sovereigns change  there was a certain piquancy about the matter and i well remember noticing how we sat a little forward and turned in our seats when they brought in the prosecutrix to give evidence pale selfpossessed dressed in black and rather comely neither brazen nor furtive speaking but poor english her broad matteroffact face with its wideset grey eyes and thickish nose and lips made on me i recollect an impression of rather stupid honesty  i do not think they had told us in so many words what her calling was nor do i remember whether she actually disclosed it but by our demeanour i could tell that we had all realized what was the nature of the service rendered to the accused in return for which he had given her this worthless note  in her rather guttural but pleasant voice she answered all our questionsnot very far from tears i think but saved by native stolidity and perhaps a little by the fear that purifiers of society might not be the proper audience for emotion  when she had left us we recalled the detective and still as it were touching the delicate matter with the tips of our tongues so as not being men of the world to seem biassed against anything we definitely elicited from him her profession and these words if shes speaking the truth gentlemen but as you know these women they dont always specially the foreign ones  when he too had gone we looked at each other in unwonted silence  none of us quite liked it seemed to be first to speak  then our foreman said theres no doubt i think that he gave her the notemean trick of course but we cant have him on that alonebit too irregularno consideration in law i take it  he smiled a little at our smiles and then went on the question gentlemen really seems to be are we to take her word that she actually gave him change  again for quite half a minute we were silent and then the fattest one of us said suddenly very dangerousgoin on the word of these women  and at once as if he had released something in our souls we all save two or three broke out  it wouldnt do  it wasnt safe  seeing what these women were  it was exactly as if without word said we had each been swearing the other to some secret compact to protect society  as if we had been whispering to each other something like this these womenof course we need them but for all that we cant possibly recognise them as within the law we cant do that without endangering the safety of every one of us  in this matter we are trustees for all menindeed even for ourselves for who knows at what moment we might not ourselves require their services and it would be exceedingly awkward if their word were considered the equal of our own  not one of us certainly said anything so crude as this none the less did many of us feel it then the foreman looking slowly round the table said well gentlemen i think we are all agreed to throw out this bill and all except the painter the jew and one other murmured yes and as though in throwing out this bill we had cast some trouble off our minds we went on with the greater speed bringing in true bills  about two oclock we finished and trooped down to the court to be released  on the stairway the jew came close and having examined me a little sharply with his velvety slits of eyes as if to see that he was not making a mistake said ith fonnywe bring in eighty thix bills true and one we throw out and the one we throw out we know it to be true and the dirtieth job of the whole lot ith fonny  yes i answered him our sense of respectability does seem excessive  but just then we reached the court where in his red robe and grey wig with his clearcut handsome face the judge seemed to shine and radiate like sun through gloom  i thank you gentlemen he said in a voice courteous and a little mocking as though he had somewhere seen us before i thank you for the way in which you have performed your duties  i have not the pleasure of assigning to you anything for your services except the privilege of going over a prison where you will be able to see what sort of existence awaits many of those to whose cases you have devoted so much of your valuable time  you are released gentlemen  looking at each other a little hurriedly and not taking too much farewell for fear of having to meet again we separated  i was then freefree of the injunction of that piece of paper reposing in my pocket  yet its influence was still upon me  i did not hurry away but lingered in the courts fascinated by the notion that the fate of each prisoner had first passed through my hands  at last i made an effort and went out into the corridor  there i passed a woman whose figure seemed familiar  she was sitting with her hands in her lap looking straight before her palefaced and not uncomely with thickish mouth and nosethe woman whose bill we had thrown out  why was she sitting there  had she not then realised that we had quashed her claim or was she like myself kept here by mere attraction of the law following i know not what impulse i said your case was dismissed wasnt it  she looked up at me stolidly and a tear which had evidently been long gathering dropped at the movement  i do nod know i waid to see she said in her thick voice i tink there has been mistake  my face no doubt betrayed something of my sentiments about her case for the thick tears began rolling fast down her pasty cheeks and her pentup feeling suddenly flowed forth in words i work ard gott how i work hard  and there gomes dis liddle beastly man and rob me  and they say ah yes but you are a bad woman we don trust youyou speak lie  but i speak druth i am nod a bad womani gome from hamburg  yes yes i murmured yes yes  i do not know this country well sir  i speak bad english  is that why they do not drust my word  she was silent for a moment searching my face then broke out again it is all ard work in my profession i make very liddle i cannot afford to be rob  without the men i cannod make my living i must drust themand they rob me like this it is too ard  and the slow tears rolled faster and faster from her eyes on to her hands and her black lap  then quietly and looking for a moment singularly like a big unhappy child she asked will you blease dell me sir why they will not give me the law of that dirty little man  i knewand too well but i could not tell her  you see i said its just a case of your word against his  oh no but she said eagerly he give me the notei would not have taken it if i ad not thought it good would i  that is sure isnt it  but five pounds it is not my price  it must that i give im change  those gentlemen that heard my case they are men of business they must know that it is not my price  if i could tell the judgei think he is a man of business too he would know that too for sure  i am not so young  i am not so veree beautiful as all that he must see mustnt he sir  at my wits end how to answer that most strange question i stammered out but you know your profession is outside the law  at that a slow anger dyed her face  she looked down then suddenly lifting one of her dirty ungloved hands she laid it on her breast with the gesture of one baring to me the truth in her heart  i am not a bad woman she said dat beastly little man he do the same as mei am freewoman i am not a slave bound to do the same tomorrow night no more than he  such like him make me what i am he have all the pleasure i have all the work  he give me nodinghe rob my poor money and he make me seem to strangers a bad woman  oh dear  i am not happy  the impulse i had been having to press on her the money died within me i felt suddenly it would be another insult  from the movement of her fingers about her heart i could not but see that this grief of hers was not about the money  it was the inarticulate outburst of a bitter sense of deep injustice of all the dumb wondering at her own fate that went about with her behind that broad stolid face and bosom  this loss of the money was but a symbol of the furtive hopeless insecurity she lived with day and night now forced into the light for herself and all the world to see  she felt it suddenly a bitter unfair thing  this beastly little man did not share her insecurity  none of us shared itnone of us who had brought her down to this  and quite unable to explain to her how natural and proper it all was i only murmured i am sorry awfully sorry and fled away   panel ii  it was just a week later when having for passport my grand jury summons i presented myself at that prison where we had the privilege of seeing the existence to which we had assisted so many of the eightysix  im afraid i said to the guardian of the gate that i am rather late in availing myselfthe others no doubt  not at all sir he said smiling  youre the first and if youll excuse me i think youll be the last  will you wait in here while i send for the chief warder to take you over  he showed me then to what he called the warders libraryan ironbarred room more bare and brown than any i had seen since i left school  while i stood there waiting and staring out into the prison courtyard there came rolling and rumbling in a black maria  it drew up with a clatter and i saw through the barred door the single prisonera young girl of perhaps eighteendressed in rusty black she was resting her forehead against a bar and looking out her quick narrow dark eyes taking in her new surroundings with a sort of sharp restless indifference and her pale thinupped oval face quite expressionless  behind those bars she seemed to me for all the world like a little animal of the cat tribe being brought in to her zoo  me she did not see but if she had i felt she would not shrinkonly give me the same sharp indifferent look she was giving all else  the policeman on the step behind had disappeared at once and the driver now got down from his perch and coming round began to gossip with her  i saw her slink her eyes and smile at him and he smiled back a large man not unkindly  then he returned to his horses and she stayed as before with her forehead against the bars just staring out  watching her like that unseen i seemed to be able to see right through that tightlipped lynxeyed mask  i seemed to know that little creature through and through as one knows anything that one surprises off its guard sunk in its most private moods  i seemed to see her little restless furtive utterly unmoral soul so stripped of all defence as if she had taken it from her heart and handed it out to me i saw that she was one of those whose hands slip as indifferently into others pockets as into their own incapable of fidelity and incapable of trusting quick as cats and as devoid of application ready to scratch ready to purr ready to scratch again quick to change and secretly as unchangeable as a little pebble  and i thought here we are taking her to the zoo by no means for the first time if demeanour be any guide and we shall put her in a cage and make her sew and give her good books which she will not read and she will sew and walk up and down until we let her out then she will return to her old haunts and at once go prowling and do exactly the same again what ever it was until we catch her and lock her up once more  and in this way we shall go on purifying society until she dies  and i thought if indeed she had been created cat in body as well as in soul we should not have treated her thus but should have said go on little cat you scratch us sometimes you steal often you are as sensual as the night  all this we cannot help  it is your nature  so were you madewe know you cannot changeyou amuse us  go on little cat would it not then be better and less savoury of humbug if we said the same to her whose catsoul has chanced into this human shape  for assuredly she will but pilfer and scratch a little and be mildly vicious in her little life and do no desperate harm having but poor capacity for evil behind that petty thinupped mask  what is the good of all this padlock business for such as she are we not making mountains out of her mole hills  where is our sense of proportion and our sense of humour  why try to alter the make and shape of nature with our petty chisels  or if we must take care of her to save ourselves in the name of heaven let us do it in a better way than this  and suddenly i remembered that i was a grand juryman a purifier of society who had brought her bill in true and that i might not think these thoughts unworthy of a good citizen i turned my eyes away from her and took up my list of indictments  yes there she was at least so i decided number 42 pilson jenny larceny pocketpicking and i turned my memory back to the evidence about her case but i could not remember a single word  in the margin i had noted incorrigible from a child up bad surroundings  and a mad impulse came over me to go back to my window and call through the bars to her jenny pilson  jenny pilson  it was i who bred you and surrounded you with evil  it was i who caught you for being what i made you  i brought your bill in true i judged you and i caged you  jenny pilson  jenny pilson but just as i reached the window the door of my waitingroom was fortunately opened and a voice said now sir at your service  i sat again in that scoop of the shore by the long rolling seas burying in the sand the piece of paper which had summoned me away to my grand jury and the same thoughts came to me with the breaking of the waves that had come to me before how in every wave was a particle that had known the shore of every land and in each sparkle of the hot sunlight stealing up that bright water into the sky the microcosm of all change and of all unity 1912     gone  not possible to conceive of rarer beauty than that which clung about the summer day three years ago when first we had the news of the poor herds loveliness was a net of golden filaments in which the world was caught it was gravity itself so tranquil and it was a sort of intoxicating laughter  from the top field that we crossed to go down to their cottage all the far sweep of those outstretched wings of beauty could be seen  very wonderful was the poise of the sacred bird that moved nowhere but in our hearts  the limetree scent was just stealing out into air for some days already bereft of the scent of hay and the sun was falling to his evening home behind our pines and beeches  it was no more than radiant warm  and as we went we wondered why we had not been told before that mrs herd was so very ill  it was foolish to wonderthese people do not speak of suffering till it is late  to speak when it means what this meant loss of wife and motherwas to flatter reality too much  to be healthy ordie  that is their creed to go on till they dropthen very soon pass away  what room for states betweenon their poor wage in their poor cottages  we crossed the millstream in the hollowto their white thatched dwelling silent already awed almost resentful of this sovarying scheme of things  at the gateway herd himself was standing just in from his work  for work in the country does not wait on illnesseven death claims from its onlookers but a few hours birth none at all and it is as well for what must be must and in work alone man rests from grief sorrow and anxiety had made strange alteration already in herds face through every crevice of the rough stolid mask the spirit was peeping a sort of quivering suppliant that seemed to ask all the time is it true  a regular cottagers figure this of herdsa labourer of these partsstrong slow but active with just a touch of the untamed somewhere about the swing and carriage of him about the strong jaw and wide thicklipped mouth just that something independent which in great variety clings to the natives of these still remote halfpagan valleys by the moor  we all moved silently to the lee of the outer wall so that our voices might not carry up to the sick woman lying there under the eaves almost within hand reach  yes sir  no sir  yes maam  this and the constant unforgettable supplication of his eyes was all that came from him yet he seemed loath to let us go as though he thought we had some mysterious power to help himthe magic perhaps of money to those who have none  grateful at our promise of another doctor a specialist he yet seemed with his eyes to say that he knew that such were only embroideries of fate  and when we had wrung his hand and gone we heard him coming after us his wife had said she would like to see us please would we come up  an old woman and mrs herds sister were in the sittingroom they showed us to the crazy narrow stairway  though we lived distant but four hundred yards of a crows flight we had never seen mrs herd before for that is the way of things in this land of minding ones own businessa slight dark girlishlooking woman almost quite refined away and with those eyes of the dying where the spirit is coming through as it only does when it knows that all is over except just the passing  she lay in a double bed with clean white sheets a whitewashed room so low that the ceiling almost touched our heads some flowers in a bowl the small lattice window open  though it was hot in there it was better far than the rooms of most families in towns living on a wage of twice as much for here was no sign of defeat in decency or cleanliness  in her face as in poor herds was that same strange mingling of resigned despair and almost eager appeal so terrible to disappoint  yet trying not to disappoint it one felt guilty of treachery what was the good the kindness in making this poor bird flutter still with hope against the bars when fast prison had so surely closed in round her  but what else could we do  we could not give her those glib assurances that naive souls make so easily to others concerning their after state  secretly i think we knew that her philosophy of calm reality that queer and unbidden growing tranquillity which precedes death was nearer to our own belief than would be any giltedged orthodoxy but nevertheless such is the strength of what is expected we felt it dreadful that we could not console her with the ordinary presumptions  you mustnt give up hope we kept on saying the new doctor will do a lot for you hes a specialista very clever man  and she kept on answering yes sir  yes maam  but still her eyes went on asking as if there were something else she wanted  and then to one of us came an inspiration  you mustnt let your husband worry about expense  that will be all right  she smiled then as if the chief cloud on her soul had been the thought of the arrears her illness and death would leave weighing on him with whom she had shared this bed ten years and more  and with that smile warming the memory of those spirithaunted eyes we crept downstairs again and out into the fields  it was more beautiful than ever just touched already with evening mysteryit was better than ever to be alive  and the immortal wonder that has haunted man since first he became man and haunts i think even the animalsthe unanswerable questionwhy joy and beauty must ever be walking hand in hand with ugliness and pain haunted us across those fields of life and loveliness  it was all right no doubt even reasonable since without dark there is no light  it was part of that unending sum whose answer is not given the merest little swing of the great pendulum  and yet  to accept this violent contrast without a sigh of revolt without a question  no sirs it was not so jolly as all that  that she should be dying there at thirty of a creeping malady which she might have checked perhaps if she had not had too many things to do for the children and husband to do anything for herselfif she had not been forced to hold the creed be healthy or die  this was no doubt perfectly explicable and in accordance with the supreme equation yet we enjoying life and health and ease of money felt horror and revolt on this evening of such beauty  nor at the moment did we derive great comfort from the thought that life slips in and out of sheath like sunsparks on water and that of all the cloud of summer midges dancing in the last gleam not one would be alive tomorrow  it was three evenings later that we heard uncertain footfalls on the flagstones of the verandah then a sort of brushing sound against the wood of the long open window  drawing aside the curtain one of us looked out  herd was standing there in the bright moonlight bareheaded with roughened hair  he came in and seeming not to know quite where he went took stand by the hearth and putting up his dark hand gripped the mantelshelf  then as if recollecting himself he said gude evenin sir beg pardon mm  no more for a full minute but his hand taking some little china thing turned it over and over without ceasing and down his broken face tears ran then very suddenly he said shes gone  and his hand turned over and over that little china thing and the tears went on rolling down then stumbling and swaying like a man in drink he made his way out again into the moonlight  we watched him across the lawn and path and through the gate till his footfalls died out there in the field and his figure was lost in the black shadow of the holly hedge  and the night was so beautiful so utterly glamourously beautiful with its starflowers and its silence and its trees clothed in moonlight all was tranquil as a dream of sleep  but it was long before our hearts wandering with poor herd would let us remember that she had slipped away into so beautiful a dream  the dead do not suffer from their rest in beauty  but the living 1911     threshing  when the drone of the thresher breaks through the autumn sighing of trees and wind or through that stillness of the first frost i get restless and more restless till throwing down my pen i have gone out to see for there is nothing like the sight of threshing for making one feel goodnot in the sense of comfort but at heart there under the pines and the already leafless elms and beechtrees close to the great stacks is the big busy creature with its small black puffing engine astern and there all around it is that conglomeration of unsentimental labour which invests all the crises of farm work with such fascination  the crew of the farm is only five all told but today they are fifteen and none strangers save the owners of the travelling thresher  they are working without respite and with little speech not at all as if they had been brought together for the benefit of some one elses corn but as though they one and all had a private grudge against time and a personal pleasure in finishing this job which while it lasts is bringing them extra pay and most excellent free feeding  just as after a dilatory voyage a crew will brace themselves for the run in recording with sudden energy their consciousness of triumph over the elements so on a farm the harvests of hay and corn sheepshearing and threshing will bring out in all a common sentiment a kind of sporting energy a defiant spurt as it were to score off nature for it is only a philosopher here and there among them i think who sees that nature is eager to be scored off in this fashion being anxious that some one should eat her kindly fruits  with ceremonial as grave as that which is at work within the thresher itself the tasks have been divided  at the root of all things pitchforking from the stack standsthe farmer moustached and always upright was he not in the yeomanrydignified in a hard black hat no waistcoat and his working coat so ragged that it would never cling to him but for pure affection  between him and the body of the machine are five more pitch forks directing the pale flood of raw material  there amongst them is poor herd still so sad from his summer loss plodding doggedly away  to watch him even now makes one feel how terrible is that dumb grief which has never learned to moan and there is george yeoford almost too sober and murdon plying his pitchfork with a supernatural regularity that cannot quite dim his queer brigands face of dark soft gloom shot with sudden humours his soft dark corduroys and battered hat  occasionally he stops and taking off that hat wipes his corrugated brow under black hair and seems to brood over his own regularity  down here too where i stand each separate function of the thresher has its appointed slave  here cedric rakes the chaff pouring from the side down into the chaffshed  carting the straw that streams from the thresher bows are michelmore and neckthe little man who cannot read but can milk and whistle the hearts out of his cows till they follow him like dogs  at the threshers stern is morris the driver selected because of that utter reliability which radiates from his broad handsome face  his part is to attend the sacking of the three kinds of grain for ever sieving out  he murmurs busy work sir and opens a little door to show me how the machinery does it all holding a sack between his knees and some string in his white teeth  then away goes the sackfour bushels one hundred and sixty pounds of genuines seconds or seedwheeled by cedric on a little trolley thing to where georgethegaul or jimtheearlysaxon is waiting to bear it on his back up the stone steps into the cornchamber  it has been raining in the night the ground is a churn of straw and mud and the trees still drip but now there is sunlight a sweet air and clear sky winecoloured through the red naked beechtwigs tipped with white untimely buds  nothing can be more lovely than this late autumn day so still save for the droning of the thresher and the constant tinny chuckle of the grey thinheaded guineafowl driven by this business away from their usual haunts  and soon the feeling that i knew would come begins creeping over me the sense of an extraordinary sanity in this neverceasing harmonious labour pursued in the autumn air faintly perfumed with woodsmoke with the scent of chaff and whiffs from that black puffingbilly the sense that there is nothing between this clean toilnot too hard but hard enoughand the clean consumption of its clean results the sense that nobody except myself is in the least conscious of how sane it all is the brains of these sane ones are all too busy with the real affairs of life the disposition of their wages anticipation of dinner some girl some junketing some wager the last rifle match and more than all with that pleasant rhythmic nothingness companion of the busy swing and play of muscles which of all states is secretly most akin to the deep unconsciousness of life itself thus to work in the free air for the good of all and the hurt of none without worry or the breath of acrimonysurely no phase of human life so nears the life of the truly civilised communitythe life of a hive of bees  not one of these working so sanelyunless it be morris who will spend his sunday afternoon on some high rock just watching sunlight and shadow drifting on the moorsnot one i think is distraught by perception of his own sanity by knowledge of how near he is to harmony not even by appreciation of the still radiance of this day or its innumerable fine shades of colour  it is all work and no moody consciousnessall work and will end in sleep  i leave them soon and make my way up the stone steps to the corn chamber where tranquillity is crowned  in the whitewashed room the corn lies in drifts and ridges three to four feet deep all silverydun like some remote sand desert lifeless beneath the moon  here it lies and into it staggering under the sacks georgethegaul and jimtheearly saxon tramp up to their knees spill the sacks over their heads and out again and above where their feet have plunged the patient surface closes again smooth  and as i stand there in the doorway looking at that silvery corn drift i think of the whole process from seed sown to the last sieving into this tranquil restingplace  i think of the slow dogged ploughman with the crows above him on the wind of the swing of the sowers arm dark up against grey sky on the steep field  i think of the seed snugburrowing for safety and its mysterious ferment under the warm spring rain of the soft green shoots tapering up so shyly toward the first sun and hardening in air to thin wiry stalk i think of the unnumerable tiny beasts that have jangled in that pale forest of the winged blue jewels of butterfly risen from it to hover on the wildrustling blades of that continual music played there by the wind of the chicory and poppy flowers that have been its lightso love as it grew tawny and full of life before the appointed date when it should return to its captivity  i think of that slowtravelling hum and swish which laid it low of the gathering to stack and the long waiting under the rustle and drip of the sheltering trees until yesterday the hoot of the thresher blew and there began the falling into this dun silvery peace  here it will lie with the pale sun narrowly filtering in on it and by night the pale moon till slowly week by week it is stolen away and its ridges and drifts sink and sink and the beasts have eaten it all  when the dusk is falling i go out to them again  they have nearly finished now the chaff in the chaffshed is mounting hillockhigh only the little barley stack remains unthreshed  mrs  georgethegaul is standing with a jug to give drink to the tired ones  some stars are already netted in the branches of the pines the guineafowl are silent but still the harmonious thresher hums and showers from three sides the straw the chaff the corn and the men fork and rake and cart and carry sleep growing in their muscles silence on their tongues and the tranquillity of the long day nearly ended in their souls  they will go on till it is quite dark 1911     that oldtime place  yes suhhere we are at that oldtime place  and our dark driver drew up his little victoria gently  through the open doorway into a dim cavernous ruined house of new orleans we passed  the mildew and dirt the dark denuded dankness of that old hostel rotting down with damp and time  and our guide the tall thin greyhaired dame who came forward with such native ease and moved before us touching this fungused wall that rusting stairway and telling as it were no one in her soft slow speech things that any one could seewhat a strange and fitting figure  before the smell of the deserted oozing rooms before that old creature leading us on and on negligent of all our questions and talking to the air as though we were not we felt such discomfort that we soon made to go out again into such freshness as there was on that day of dismal heat then realising it seemed that she was losing us our old guide turned for the first time looking in our faces she smiled and said in her sweet weak voice like the sound from the strings of a spinet long unplayed on don you wahnd to see the domeroom an all the other rooms right here of this oldtime place  again those words  we had not the hearts to disappoint her  and as we followed on and on along the mouldering corridors and rooms where the black peeling papers hung like stalactites the dominance of our senses gradually dropped from us and with our souls we saw its soulthe soul of this oldtime place this mustering house of the old south bereft of all but ghosts and the grey pigeons niched in the rotting gallery round a narrow courtyard open to the sky  this is the domeroom suh and lady right over the slavemarket it is here they did the business of the statesure oldtime heroes up therein the roofwashington hamilton jefferson davis leethere they are all gonenow  yes suh  a fineyea even a splendid room of great height and carved grandeur with handwrought bronze sconces and a band of metal bordering all blackened with oblivion  and the faces of those old heroes encircling that domed ceiling were blackened too and scarred with damp beyond recognition  here beneath their gaze men had banqueted and danced and ruled  the pride and might and vivid strength of things still fluttered their uneasy flags of spirit moved disherited wings  those oldtime feasts and grave discussionswe seemed to see them printed on the thick air imprisoned in this great chamber built above their dark foundations the pride and the might and the vivid strength of thingsgone all gone  we became conscious again of that soft weak voice  not hearing very well suh i have it all printed ladybeautifully told hereyes indeed  she was putting cards into our hands then impassive maintaining ever her impersonal chant the guardian of past glory led us on  now we shall see the slavemarketdownstairs underneath  its wet for the lady the water comes in now yes suh  on the crumbling black and white marble floorings the water indeed was trickling into pools  and down in the halls there came to us wanderingstrangest thing that ever strayed through deserted grandeura brown broken horse lean with a sore flank and a head of tremendous age  it stopped and gazed at us as though we might be going to give it things to eat then passed on stumbling over the ruined marbles  for a moment we had thought him ghostone of the many  but he was not since his hoofs sounded  the scrambling clatter of them had died out into silence before we came to that dark cryptlike chamber whose marble columns were ringed in iron veritable pillars of foundation  and then we saw that our old guides hands were full of newspapers  she struck a match they caught fire and blazed  holding high that torch she said see  up theres his name above where he stood  the auctioneer  oh yes indeed  heres where they sold them  below that name decaying on the wall we had the slow uncanny feeling of some one standing there in the gleam and flicker from that paper torch  for a moment the whole shadowy room seemed full of forms and faces  then the torch lied out and our old guide pointing through an archway with the blackened stump of it said  twas here they kept them indeed yes  we saw before us a sort of vault stonebuilt and low and long the light there was too dim for us to make out anything but walls and heaps of rusting scrapiron cast away there and mouldering own  but trying to pierce that darkness we became conscious as it seemed of innumerable eyes gazing not at us but through the archway where we stood innumerable white eyeballs gleaming out of blackness  from behind us came a little laugh  it floated past through the archway toward those eyes  who was that  who laughed in there  the old south itselfthat incredible fine lost soul  that oldtime thing of old ideals blindfolded by its own history  that queer proud blend of simple chivalry and tyranny of piety and the abhorrent thing  who was it laughed there in the old slavemarketlaughed at these white eyeballs glaring from out of the blackness of their dark cattlepen  what poor departed soul in this house of melancholy  but there was no ghost when we turned to lookonly our old guide with her sweet smile  yes suh  here they all cametwas the finest hotelbefore the wartime old southern familiesbuyin an sellin their property yes maam very interesting  this way  and here were the bells to all the rooms  broken you seeall broken  and rather quickly we passed away out of that oldtime place where something had laughed and the drip drip drip of water down the walls was as the sound of a spirit grieving 1912     romancethree gleams  on that new years morning when i drew up the blind it was still nearly dark but for the faintest pink flush glancing out there on the horizon of black water  the far shore of the rivers mouth was just soft dusk and the dim trees below me were in perfect stillness there was no lap of water  and theni saw her drifting in on the tidethe little ship passaging below me a happy ghost  like no thing of this world she came ending her flight with sailwings closing and her glowing lantern eyes there was i know not what of stealthy joy about her thus creeping in to the unexpecting land  and i wished she would never pass  but go on gliding by down there for ever with her dark ropes and her bright lanterns and her mysterious felicity so that i might have for ever in my heart the blessed feeling she brought me coming like this out of that great mystery the sea  if only she need not change to solidity but ever be this visitor from the unknown this sacred bird telling with her halfseen trailingdown plumesails the story of uncharted wonder  if only i might go on trembling as i was with the rapture of all i did not know and could not see yet felt pressing against me and touching my face with its lips  to think of her at anchor in cold light was like flingingto a door in the face of happiness  and just then she struck her bell the faint silvery fardown sound fled away before her and to every side out into the utter hush to discover echo but nothing answered as if fearing to break the spell of her coming to brush with reality the dark sea dew from her sailwings  but within me in response there began the song of all unknown things the song so tenuous so ecstatic that seems to sweep and quiver across such thin golden strings and like an eager dream dies too soon  the song of the secretknowing wind that has peered through so great forests and over such wild sea blown on so many faces and in the jungles of the grass the song of all that the wind has seen and felt  the song of lives that i should never live of the loves that i should never love singlng to me as though i should  and suddenly i felt that i could not bear my little ship of dreams to grow hard and grey her bright lanterns drowned in the cold light her dark ropes spidery and taut her seawan sails all furled and she no more en chanted and turning away i let fall the curtain   ii  then what happens to the moon  she who shy and veiled slips out before dusk to take the air of heaven wandering timidly among the columned clouds and fugitive from the staring of the sun she who when dusk has come rules the sentient night with such chaste and icy spellwhither and how does she retreat  i came on her one morningi surprised her  she was stealing into a dark wintry wood and five little stars were chasing her  she was orangehooded a lightolove dismissedunashamed and unfatigued having takenall  and she was looking back with her almond eyes across her darkivory shoulder at night where he still lay drowned in the sleep she had brought him  what a strange slow mocking look  so might aphrodite herself have looked back at some weary lover remembering the fire of his first embrace  insatiate smiling creature slipping down to the rim of the world to her bath in the sweet waters of dawn whence emerging pure as a water lily she would float in the cool sky till evening came again  and just then she saw me looking and hid behind a holmoak tree but i could still see the gleam of one shoulder and her long narrow eyes pursuing me i went up to the tree and parted its dark boughs to take her but she had slipped behind another  i called to her to stand if only for one moment  but she smiled and went slip ping on and i ran thrusting through the wet bushes leaping the fallen trunks the scent of rotting leaves disturbed by my feet leaped out into the darkness and birds surprised fluttered away  and still i ranshe slipping ever further into the grove and ever looking back at me and i thought but i will catch you yet you nymph of perdition  the wood will soon be passed you will have no cover then  and from her eyes and the scanty gleam of her flying limbs i never looked away not even when i stumbled or ran against tree trunks in my blind haste  and at every clearing i flew more furiously thinking to seize all of her with my gaze before she could cross the glade but ever she found some little low tree some bush of birch ungrown or the far top branches of the next grove to screen her flying body and preserve allurement  and all the time she was dipping dipping to the rim of the world  and then i tripped but as i rose i saw that she had lingered for me her long sliding eyes were full it seemed to me of pity as if she would have liked for me to have enjoyed the sight of her  i stood still breathless thinking that at last she would consent but flinging back up into the air one darkivory arm she sighed and vanished  and the breath of her sigh stirred all the birchtree twigs just coloured with the dawn  long i stood in that thicket gazing at the spot where she had leapt from me over the edge of the worldmy heart quivering   iii  we embarked on the estuary steamer that winter morning just as daylight came full  the sun was on the wing scattering little white clouds as an eagle might scatter doves  they scurried up before him with their broken feathers tipped and tinged with gold  in the air was a touch of frost and a smoky mistdrift clung here and there above the reeds blurring the shores of the lagoon so that we seemed to be steaming across boundless water till some clump of trees would fling its top out of the fog then fall back into whiteness  and then in that thick vapour rounding i suppose some curve we came suddenly into we knew not whatall white and moving it was as if the mist were crazed murmuring too with a sort of restless beating  we seemed to be passing through a ghostthe ghost of all the life that had sprung from this water and its shores we seemed to have left reality to be travelling through live wonder  and the fantastic thought sprang into my mind i have died  this is the voyage of my soul in the wild  i am in the final wilderness of spiritslost in the ghost robe that wraps the earth  there seemed in all this white murmuration to be millions of tiny hands stretching out to me millions of whispering voices of wistful eyes  i had no fear but a curious baked eagerness the strangest feeling of having lost myself and become part of this around me exactly as if my own hands and voice and eyes had left me and were groping and whispering and gazing out there in the eeriness  i was no longer a man on an estuary steamer but part of sentient ghostliness  nor did i feel unhappy it seemed as though i had never been anything but this bedouin spirit wandering  we passed through again into the stillness of plain mist and all those eerie sensations went leaving nothing but curiosity to know what this was that we had traversed  then suddenly the sun came flaring out and we saw behind us thousands and thousands of white gulls dipping wheeling brushing the water with their wings bewitched with sun and mist  that was all  and yet that whitewinged legion through whom we had ploughed our way were not could never be to me just gullsthere was more than mere sunglamour gilding their misty plumes there was the wizardry of my past wonder the enchantment of romance 1912     memories  we set out to meet him at waterloo station on a dull day of februaryi who had owned his impetuous mother knowing a little what to expect while to my companion he would be all original  we stood there waiting for the salisbury train was late and wondering with a warm halffearful eagerness what sort of new thread life was going to twine into our skein  i think our chief dread was that he might have light eyesthose yellow chinese eyes of the common particoloured spaniel and each new minute of the trains tardiness increased our anxious compassion his first journey his first separation from his mother this black twomonths baby  then the train ran in and we hastened to look for him  have you a dog for us  a dog  not in this van  ask the rearguard  have you a dog for us  thats right  from salisbury  heres your wild beast sir  from behind a wooden crate we saw a long black muzzled nose poking round at us and heard a faint hoarse whimpering  i remember my first thought  isnt his nose too long  but to my companions heart it went at once because it was swollen from crying and being pressed against things that he could not see through we took him outsoft wobbly tearful set him down on his four as yet not quite simultaneous legs and regarded him  or rather my companion did having her head on one side and a quavering smile and i regarded her knowing that i should thereby get a truer impression of him  he wandered a little round our legs neither wagging his tail nor licking at our hands then he looked up and my companion said hes an angel  i was not so certain  he seemed hammerheaded with no eyes at all and little connection between his head his body and his legs  his ears were very long as long as his poor nose and gleaming down in the blackness of him i could see the same white star that disgraced his mothers chest  picking him up we carried him to a fourwheeled cab and took his muzzle off  his little darkbrown eyes were resolutely fixed on distance and by his refusal to even smell the biscuits we had brought to make him happy we knew that the human being had not yet come into a life that had contained so far only a mother a woodshed and four other soft wobbly black hammerheaded angels smelling of themselves and warmth and wood shavings  it was pleasant to feel that to us he would surrender an untouched love that is if he would surrender anything  suppose he did not take to us  and just then something must have stirred in him for he turned up his swollen nose and stared at my companion and a little later rubbed the dry pinkness of his tongue against my thumb  in that look and that unconscious restless lick he was trying hard to leave unhappiness behind trying hard to feel that these new creatures with stroking paws and queer scents were his mother yet all the time he knew i am sure that they were something bigger more permanently desperately his  the first sense of being owned perhaps who knows of owning had stirred in him  he would never again be quite the same unconscious creature  a little way from the end of our journey we got out and dismissed the cab  he could not too soon know the scents and pavements of this london where the chief of his life must pass  i can see now his first bumble down that wide backwater of a street how continually and suddenly he sat down to make sure of his own legs how continually he lost our heels he showed us then in full perfection what was afterwards to be an inconvenientif endearingcharacteristic at any call or whistle he would look in precisely the opposite direction  how many times all through his life have i not seen him at my whistle start violently and turn his tail to me then with nose thrown searchingly from side to side begin to canter toward the horizon  in that first walk we met fortunately but one vehicle a brewers dray he chose that moment to attend to the more serious affairs of life sitting quietly before the horses feet and requiring to be moved by hand  from the beginning he had his dignity and was extremely difficult to lift owing to the length of his middle distance  what strange feelings must have stirred in his little white soul when he first smelled carpet  but it was all so strange to him that dayi doubt if he felt more than i did when i first travelled to my private school reading tales of a grandfather and plied with tracts and sherry by my fathers man of business  that night indeed for several nights he slept with me keeping me too warm down my back and waking me now and then with quaint sleepy whimperings  indeed all through his life he flew a good deal in his sleep fighting dogs and seeing ghosts running after rabbits and thrown sticks and to the last one never quite knew whether or no to rouse him when his four black feet began to jerk and quiver  his dreams were like our dreams both good and bad happy sometimes sometimes tragic to weeping point  he ceased to sleep with me the day we discovered that he was a perfect little colony whose settlers were of an active species which i have never seen again  after that he had many beds for circumstance ordained that his life should be nomadic and it is to this i trace that philosophic indifference to place or property which marked him out from most of his own kind  he learned early that for a black dog with long silky ears a feathered tail and head of great dignity there was no home whatsoever away from those creatures with special scents who took liberties with his name and alone of all created things were privileged to smack him with a slipper  he would sleep anywhere so long as it was in their room or so close outside it as to make no matter for it was with him a principle that what he did not smell did not exist  i would i could hear again those long rubberlipped snufflings of recognition underneath the door with which each morning he would regale and reassure a spirit that grew with age more and more nervous and delicate about this matter of propinquity  for he was a dog of fixed ideas things stamped on his mind were indelible as for example his duty toward cats for whom he had really a perverse affection which had led to that first disastrous moment of his life when he was brought up poor bewildered puppy from a brief excursion to the kitchen with one eye closed and his cheek torn  he bore to his grave that jagged scratch across the eye  it was in dread of a repetition of this tragedy that he was instructed at the word cats to rush forward with a special towrowrowing which he never used toward any other form of creature  to the end he cherished a hope that he would reach the cat but never did and if he had we knew he would only have stood and wagged his tail but i well remember once when he returned important from some such sally how dreadfully my companion startled a catloving friend by murmuring in her most honeyed voice well my darling have you been killing pussies in the garden  his eye and nose were impeccable in their sense of form indeed he was very english in that matter people must be just so things smell properly and affairs go on in the one right way  he could tolerate neither creatures in ragged clothes nor children on their hands and knees nor postmen because with their bags they swelledup on one side and carried lanterns on their stomachs  he would never let the harmless creatures pass without religious barks  naturally a believer in authority and routine and distrusting spiritual adventure he yet had curious fads that seemed to have nested in him quite outside of all principle  he would for instance follow neither carriages nor horses and if we tried to make him at once left for home where he would sit with nose raised to heaven emitting through it a most lugubrious shrill noise  then again one must not place a stick a slipper a glove or anything with which he could play upon ones headsince such an action reduced him at once to frenzy  for so conservative a dog his environment was sadly anarchistic  he never complained in words of our shifting habits but curled his head round over his left paw and pressed his chin very hard against the ground whenever he smelled packing  what necessity he seemed continually to be saying what real necessity is there for change of any kind whatever  here we were all together and one day was like another so that i knew where i wasand now you only know what will happen next and ii cant tell you whether i shall be with you when it happens  what strange grieving minutes a dog passes at such times in the underground of his subconsciousness refusing realisation yet all the time only too well divining  some careless word some unmuted compassion in voice the stealthy wrapping of a pair of boots the unaccustomed shutting of a door that ought to be open the removal from a downstair room of an object always thereone tiny thing and he knows for certain that he is not going too  he fights against the knowledge just as we do against what we cannot bear he gives up hope but not effort protesting in the only way he knows of and now and then heaving a great sigh those sighs of a dog  they go to the heart so much more deeply than the sighs of our own kind because they are utterly unintended regardless of effect emerging from one who heaving them knows not that they have escaped him  the words yesgoing too spoken in a certain tone would call up in his eyes a stillquestioning halfhappiness and from his tail a quiet flutter but did not quite serve to put to rest either his doubt or his feeling that it was all unnecessaryuntil the cab arrived  then he would pour himself out of door or window and be found in the bottom of the vehicle looking severely away from an admiring cabman  once settled on our feet he travelled with philosophy but no digestion  i think no dog was ever more indifferent to an outside world of human creatures yet few dogs have made more conquestsespecially among strange women through whom however he had a habit of lookingvery discouraging  he had natheless one or two particular friends such as him to whom this book is dedicated and a few persons whom he knew he had seen before but broadly speaking there were in his world of men only his mistress andthe almighty  each august till he was six he was sent for health and the assuagement of his hereditary instincts up to a scotch shooting where he carried many birds in a very tender manner  once he was compelled by fate to remain there nearly a year and we went up ourselves to fetch him home down the long avenue toward the keepers cottage we walked it was high autumn there had been frost already for the ground was fine with red and yellow leaves and presently we saw himself coming professionally questing among those leaves and preceding his dear keeper with the businesslike selfcontainment of a sportsman not too fat glossy as a ravens wing swinging his ears and sporran like a little highlander  we approached him silently  suddenly his nose went up from its imagined trail and he came rushing at our legs  from him as a garment drops from a man dropped all his strange soberness he became in a single instant one fluttering eagerness  he leaped from life to life in one bound without hesitation without regret  not one sigh not one look back not the faintest token of gratitude or regret at leaving those good people who had tended him for a whole year buttered oatcake for him allowed him to choose each night exactly where he would sleep  no he just marched out beside us as close as ever he could get drawing us on in spirit and not even attending to the scents until the lodge gates were passed  it was strictly in accordance with the perversity of things and something in the nature of calamity that he had not been ours one year when there came over me a dreadful but overmastering aversion from killing those birds and creatures of which he was so fond as soon as they were dead  and so i never knew him as a sportsman for during that first year he was only an unbroken puppy tied to my waist for fear of accidents and carefully pulling me off every shot they tell me he developed a lovely nose and perfect mouth large enough to hold gingerly the biggest hare  i well believe it remembering the qualities of his mother whose character however in stability he far surpassed  but as he grew every year more devoted to dead grouse and birds and rabbits i liked them more and more alive it was the only real breach between us and we kept it out of sight  ah well it is consoling to reflect that i should infallibly have ruined his sporting qualities lacking that peculiar habit of meaning what one says so necessary to keep dogs virtuous  but surely to have had him with me quivering and alert with his solemn eager face would have given a new joy to those crisp mornings when the hope of wings coming to the gun makes poignant in the sports man as nothing else will an almost sensual love of nature a fierce delight in the soft glow of leaves in the white birch stems and tracery of sparse twigs against blue sky in the scents of sap and grass and gum and heather flowers stivers the hair of him with keenness for interpreting each sound and fills the very fern or moss he kneels on the very trunk he leans against with strange vibration  slowly fate prepares for each of us the religion that lies coiled in our most secret nerves with such we cannot trifle we do not even try  but how shall a man grudge any one sensations he has so keenly felt  let such as have never known those curious delights uphold the hand of horrorfor me there can be no such luxury  if i could i would still perhaps be knowing them but when once the joy of life in those winged and furry things has knocked at the very portals of ones spirit the thought that by pressing a little iron twig one will rive that joy out of their vitals is too hard to bear  call it aestheticism squeamishness nambypamby sentimentalism what you will it is stronger than oneself  yes after one had once watched with an eye that did not merely see the thirsty gaping of a slowly dying bird or a rabbit dragging a broken leg to a hole where he would lie for hours thinking of the fern to which he should never more come forthafter that there was always the following little matter of arithmetic given that all those who had been shooting were goodfair shotswhich heaven knew they never werethey yet missed one at least in four and did not miss it very much so that if seventyfive things were slain there were also twentyfive that had been fired at and of those twentyfive twelve and a half had gotten it somewhere in their bodies and would likely die at their great leisure  this was the sum that brought about the only cleavage in our lives and so as he grew older and trying to part from each other we no longer could he ceased going to scotland  but after that i often felt and especially when we heard guns how the best and most secret instincts of him were being stifled  but what was to be done  in that which was left of a clay pigeon he would take not the faintest interestthe scent of it was paltry  yet always even in his most cosseted and idle days he managed to preserve the grave preoccupation of one professionally concerned with retrieving things that smell and consoled himself with pastimes such as cricket which he played in a manner highly specialised following the ball up the moment it left the bowlers hand and sometimes retrieving it before it reached the batsman  when remonstrated with he would consider a little hanging out a pink tongue and looking rather too eagerly at the ball then canter slowly out to a sort of forward short leg  why he always chose that particular position it is difficult to say possibly he could lurk there better than anywhere else the batsmans eye not being on him and the bowlers not too much  as a fieldsman he was perfect but for an occasional belief that he was not merely short leg but slip point midoff and wicketkeep and perhaps a tendency to make the ball a little jubey  but he worked tremendously watching every movement for he knew the game thoroughly and seldom delayed it more than three minutes when he secured the ball  and if that ball were really lost then indeed he took over the proceedings with an intensity and quiet vigour that destroyed many shrubs and the solemn satisfaction which comes from being in the very centre of the stage  but his most passionate delight was swimming in anything except the sea for which with its unpleasant noise and habit of tasting salt he had little affection  i see him now cleaving the serpentine with his air of the world well lost striving to reach my stick before it had touched water  being only a large spaniel too small for mere heroism he saved no lives in the water but his ownand that on one occasion before our very eyes from a dark trout stream which was trying to wash him down into a black hole among the boulders  the call of the wildspring runningwhatever it isthat besets men and dogs seldom attained full mastery over him but one could often see it struggling against his devotion to the scent of us and watching that dumb contest i have time and again wondered how far this civilisation of ours was justifiably imposed on him how far the love for us that we had so carefully implanted could ever replace in him the satisfaction of his primitive wild yearnings he was like a man naturally polygamous married to one loved woman  it was surely not for nothing that rover is dogs most common name and would be ours but for our too tenacious fear of losing something to admit even to ourselves that we are hankering  there was a man who said strange that two such queerly opposite qualities as courage and hypocrisy are the leading characteristics of the anglosaxon  but is not hypocrisy just a product of tenacity which is again the lower part of courage  is not hypocrisy but an active sense of property in ones good name the clutching close of respectability at any price the feeling that one must not part even at the cost of truth with what he has sweated so to gain  and so we anglosaxons will not answer to the name of rover and treat our dogs so that they too hardly know their natures  the history of his one wandering for which no respectable reason can be assigned will never of course be known  it was in london of an october evening when we were told he had slipped out and was not anywhere  then began those four distressful hours of searching for that black needle in that blacker bundle of hay  hours of real dismay and suffering for it is suffering indeed to feel a loved thing swallowed up in that hopeless haze of london streets  stolen or run over  which was worst  the neighbouring police stations visited the dogs home notified an order of five hundred lost dog bills placed in the printers hands the streets patrolled  and then in a lull snatched for food and still endeavouring to preserve some aspect of assurance we heard the bark which meant here is a door i cannot open  we hurried forth and there he was on the top doorstepbusy unashamed giving no explanations asking for his supper and very shortly after him came his five hundred lost dog bills  long i sat looking at him that night after my companion had gone up thinking of the evening some years before when there followed as that shadow of a spaniel who had been lost for eleven days  and my heart turned over within me but he  he was asleep for he knew not remorse  ah and there was that other time when it was reported to me returning home at night that he had gone out to find me and i went forth again disturbed and whistling his special call to the empty fields  suddenly out of the darkness i heard a rushing and he came furiously dashing against my heels from he alone knew where he had been lurking and saying to himself i will not go in till he comes  i could not scold there was something too lyrical in the return of that live lonely rushing piece of blackness through the blacker night  after all the vagary was but a variation in his practice when one was away at bedtime of passionately scratching up his bed in protest till it resembled nothing for in spite of his long and solemn face and the silkiness of his ears there was much in him yet of the cave bearhe dug graves on the smallest provocations in which he never buried anything  he was not a clever dog and guiltless of all tricks  nor was he ever shown  we did not even dream of subjecting him to this indignity  was our dog a clown a hobby a fad a fashion a feather in our caps that we should subject him to periodic pennings in stuffy halls that we should harry his faithful soul with such tomfoolery  he never even heard us talk about his lineage deplore the length of his nose or call him cleverlooking we should have been ashamed to let him smell about us the tarbrush of a sense of property to let him think we looked on him as an asset to earn us pelf or glory  we wished that there should be between us the spirit that was between the sheep dog and that farmer who when asked his dogs age touched the old creatures head and answered thus teresa his daughter was born in november and this one in august  that sheep dog had seen eighteen years when the great white day came for him and his spirit passed away up to cling with the woodsmoke round the dark rafters of the kitchen where he had lain so vast a time beside his masters boots  no no  if a man does not soon pass beyond the thought by what shall this dog profit me into the large state of simple gladness to be with dog he shall never know the very essence of that companion ship which depends not on the points of dog but on some strange and subtle mingling of mute spirits  for it is by muteness that a dog becomes for one so utterly beyond value with him one is at peace where words play no torturing tricks when he just sits loving and knows that he is being loved those are the moments that i think are precious to a dog when with his adoring soul coming through his eyes he feels that you are really thinking of him  but he is touchingly tolerant of ones other occupations  the subject of these memories always knew when one was too absorbed in work to be so close to him as he thought proper yet he never tried to hinder or distract or asked for attention  it dinged his mood of course so that the red under his eyes and the folds of his crumply cheekswhich seemed to speak of a touch of bloodhound introduced a long way back into his breedingdrew deeper and more manifest  if he could have spoken at such times he would have said i have been a long time alone and i cannot always be asleep but you know best and i must not criticise  he did not at all mind ones being absorbed in other humans he seemed to enjoy the sounds of conversation lifting round him and to know when they were sensible  he could not for instance stand actors or actresses giving readings of their parts perceiving at once that the same had no connection with the minds and real feelings of the speakers and having wandered a little to show his disapproval he would go to the door and stare at it till it opened and let him out  once or twice it is true when an actor of large voice was declaiming an emotional passage he so far relented as to go up to him and pant in his face  music too made him restless inclined to sigh and to ask questions  sometimes at its first sound he would cross to the window and remain there looking for her at others he would simply go and lie on the loud pedal and we never could tell whether it was from sentiment or because he thought that in this way he heard less  at one special nocturne of chopins he always whimpered  he was indeed of rather polish temperamentvery gay when he was gay dark and brooding when he was not  on the whole perhaps his life was uneventful for so fartravelling a dog though it held its moments of eccentricity as when he leaped through the window of a fourwheeler into kensington or sat on a dartmoor adder  but that was fortunately of a sunday afternoonwhen adder and all were torpid so nothing happened till a friend who was following lifted him off the creature with his large boot  if only one could have known more of his private lifemore of his relations with his own kind  i fancy he was always rather a dark dog to them having so many thoughts about us that he could not share with any one and being naturally fastidious except with ladies for whom he had a chivalrous and catholic taste so that they often turned and snapped at him  he had however but one lasting love affair for a livercoloured lass of our village not quite of his own caste but a wholesome if somewhat elderly girl with loving and sphinxlike eyes  their children alas were not for this world and soon departed  nor was he a fighting dog but once attacked he lacked a sense of values being unable to distinguish between dogs that he could beat and dogs with whom he had no earthly  it was in fact as well to interfere at once especially in the matter of retrievers for he never forgot having in his youth been attacked by a retriever from behind  no he never forgot and never forgave an enemy  only a month before that day of which i cannot speak being very old and ill he engaged an irish terrier on whose impudence he had long had his eye and routed him  and how a battle cheered his spirit  he was certainly no christian but allowing for essential dog he was very much a gentleman  and i do think that most of us who live on this earth these days would rather leave it with that label on us than the other  for to be a christian as tolstoy understood the wordand no one else in our time has had logic and love of truth enough to give it coherent meaningis to be quite sincere not suited to men of western blood  whereasto be a gentleman  it is a far cry but perhaps it can be done  in him at all events there was no pettiness no meanness and no cruelty and though he fell below his ideal at times this never altered the true look of his eyes nor the simple loyalty in his soul  but what a crowd of memories come back bringing with them the perfume of fallen days  what delights and glamour what long hours of effort discouragements and secret fears did he not watch overour black familiar and with the sight and scent and touch of him deepen or assuage  how many thousand walks did we not go together so that we still turn to see if he is following at his padding gait attentive to the invisible trails  not the least hard thing to bear when they go from us these quiet friends is that they carry away with them so many years of our own lives  yet if they find warmth therein who would grudge them those years that they have so guarded  nothing else of us can they take to lie upon with outstretched paws and chin pressed to the ground and whatever they take be sure they have deserved  do they know as we do that their time must come  yes they know at rare moments  no other way can i interpret those pauses of his latter life when propped on his forefeet he would sit for long minutes quite motionlesshis head drooped utterly withdrawn then turn those eyes of his and look at me  that look said more plainly than all words could yes i know that i must go  if we have spirits that persistthey have  if we know after our departure who we were they do  no one i think who really longs for truth can ever glibly say which it will be for dog and man persistence or extinction of our consciousness  there is but one thing certainthe childishness of fretting over that eternal question  whichever it be it must be right the only possible thing he felt that too i know but then like his master he was what is called a pessimist  my companion tells me that since he left us he has once come back it was old years night and she was sad when he came to her in visible shape of his black body passing round the diningtable from the windowend to his proper place beneath the table at her feet she saw him quite clearly she heard the padding taptap of his paws and very toenails she felt his warmth brushing hard against the front of her skirt  she thought then that he would settle down upon her feet but something disturbed him and he stood pausing pressed against her then moved out toward where i generally sit but was not sitting that night  she saw him stand there as if considering then at some sound or laugh she became selfconscious and slowly very slowly he was no longer there  had he some message some counsel to give something he would say that last night of the last year of all those he had watched over us  will he come back again  no stone stands over where he lies  it is on our hearts that his life is engraved 1912     felicity  when god is so good to the fields of what use are wordsthose poor husks of sentiment  there is no painting felicity on the wing  no way of bringing on to the canvas the flying glory of things  a single buttercup of the twenty million in one field is worth all these dry symbolsthat can never body forth the very spirit of that froth of may breaking over the hedges the choir of birds and bees the losttravelling down of the wind flowers the whitethroated swallows in their odysseys  just here there are no skylarks but what joy of song and leaf of lanes lighted with bright trees the few oaks still golden brown and the ashes still spiritual  only the blackbirds and thrushes can singup this day and cuckoos over the hill  the year has flown so fast that the appletrees have dropped nearly all their bloom and in long meadow the daggers are out early beside the narrow bright streams  orpheus sits there on a stone when nobody is by and pipes to the ponies and pan can often be seen dancing with his nymphs in the raised beechgrove where it is always twilight if you lie still enough against the far bank  who can believe in growing old so long as we are wrapped in this cloak of colour and wings and song so long as this unimaginable vision is here for us to gaze atthe softfaced sheep about us and the woolbags drying out along the fence and great numbers of tiny ducks so trustful that the crows have taken several  blue is the colour of youth and all the blue flowers have a fey look everything seems young too young to work  there is but one thing busy a starling fetching grubs for its little family above my headit must take that flight at least two hundred times a day the children should be very fat  when the sky is so happy and the flowers so luminous it does not seem possible that the bright angels of this day shall pass into dark night that slowly these wings shall close and the cuckoo praise himself to sleep mad midges dancein the evening the grass shiver with dew wind die and no bird sing         yet so it is  day has gonethe song and glamour and swoop of wings slowly has passed the daily miracle  it is night  but felicity has not withdrawn she has but changed her robe for silence velvet and the pearl fan of the moon  everything is sleeping save only a single star and the pansies  why they should be more wakeful than the other flowers i do not know  the expressions of their faces if one bends down into the dusk are sweeter and more cunning than ever they have some compact no doubt in hand  what a number of voices have given up the ghost to this night of but one voicethe murmur of the stream out there in darkness  with what religion all has been done  not one buttercup open the yewtrees already with shadows flung down  no moths are abroad yet it is too early in the year for nightjars and the owls are quiet but who shall say that in this silence in this hovering wan light in this air bereft of wings and of all scent save freshness there is less of the ineffable less of that before which words are dumb  it is strange how this tranquillity of night that seems so final is inhabited if one keeps still enough  a lamb is bleating out there on the dim moor a bird somewhere a little one about three fields away makes the sweetest kind of chirruping some cows are still cropping there is a scent too underneath the freshnesssweetbrier i think and our dutch honeysuckle nothing else could so delicately twine itself with air  and even in this darkness the roses have colour more beautiful perhaps than ever  if colour be as they say but the effect of light on various fibre one may think of it as a tune the song of thanksgiving that each form puts forth to sun

with its seven pale worlds it has adventured very high and far tonightwith a company of others remoter still     this serenity of night  what could seem less likely ever more to move and change again to day  surely now the world has found its long sleep and the pearly glimmer from the moon will last and the precious silence never again yield to clamour the grapebloom of this mystery never more pale out into gold         and yet it is not so  the nightly miracle has passed  it is dawn faint light has come  i am waiting for the first sound  the sky as yet is like nothing but grey paper with the shadows of wild geese passing  the trees are phantoms  and then it comesthat first call of a bird startled at discovering day  just one calland now here there on all the trees the sudden answers swelling of that most sweet and careless choir  was irresponsibility ever so divine as this of birds waking thensaffron into the sky and once more silence  what is it birds do after the first chorale  think of their sins and business  or just sleep again  the trees are fast dropping unreality and the cuckoos begin calling  colour is burning up in the flowers already the dew smells of them  the miracle is ended for the starling has begun its job and the sun is fretting those dark busy wings with gold  full day has come again  but the face of it is a little strange it is not like yesterday  queerto think no day is like to a day thats past and no night like a night thats coming  why then fear death which is but night  why care if next day have different face and spirit  the sun has

concerning drama           meditation on finality           wantedschooling           on our dislike of things as they are           the windlestraw     a novelists allegory  once upon a time the prince of felicitas had occasion to set forth on a journey  it was a late autumn evening with few pale stars and a moon no larger than the paring of a fingernail  and as he rode through the purlieus of his city the white mane of his ambercoloured steed was all that he could clearly see in the dusk of the high streets  his way led through a quarter but little known to him and he was surprised to find that his horse instead of ambling forward with his customary gentle vigour stepped carefully from side to side stopping now and then to curve his neck and prick his earsas though at some thing of fear unseen in the darkness while on either hand creatures could be heard rustling and scuttling and little cold draughts as of wings fanned the riders cheeks  the prince at last turned in his saddle but so great was the darkness that he could not even see his escort  what is the name of this street he said  sire it is called the vita publica  it is very dark even as he spoke his horse staggered but recovering its foothold with an effort stood trembling violently nor could all the incitements of its master induce the beast again to move forward  is there no one with a lanthorn in this street asked the prince  his attendants began forthwith to call out loudly for any one who had a lanthorn  now it chanced that an old man sleeping in a hovel on a pallet of straw was awakened by these cries  when he heard that it was the prince of felicitas himself he came hastily carrying his lanthorn and stood trembling beside the princes horse  it was so dark that the prince could not see him  light your lanthorn old man he said  the old man laboriously lit his lanthorn  its pale rays fled out on either hand beautiful but grim was the vision they disclosed  tall houses fair courtyards and a palm grown garden in front of the princes horse a deep cesspool on whose jagged edges the good beasts hoofs were planted and as far as the glimmer of the lanthorn stretched both ways down the rutted street paving stones displaced and smooth tesselated marble pools of mud the hanging fruit of an orange tree and dark scurrying shapes of monstrous rats bolting across from house to house  the old man held the lanthorn higher and instantly bats flying against it would have beaten out the light but for the thin protection of its horn sides  the prince sat still upon his horse looking first at the rutted space that he had traversed and then at the rutted space before him  without a light he said this thoroughfare is dangerous  what is your name old man  my name is cethru replied the aged churl  cethru said the prince  let it be your duty henceforth to walk with your lanthorn up and down this street all night and every nightand he looked at cethru do you understand old man what it is you have to do  the old man answered in a voice that trembled like a rusty flute  aye ayeto walk up and down and hold my lanthorn so that folk can see where they be going  the prince gathered up his reins but the old man lurching forward touched his stirrup  how long be i to go on wi thiccy job  until you die  cethru held up his lanthorn and they could see his long thin face like a sandwich of dried leather jerk and quiver and his thin grey hairs flutter in the draught of the bats wings circling round the light  twill be main hard he groaned an my lanthorns nowt but a poor thing  with a high look the prince of felicitas bent and touched the old mans forehead  until you die old man he repeated and bidding his followers to light torches from cethrus lanthorn he rode on down the twisting street  the clatter of the horses hoofs died out in the night and the scuttling and the rustling of the rats and the whispers of the bats wings were heard again  cethru left alone in the dark thoroughfare sighed heavily then spitting on his hands he tightened the old girdle round his loins and slinging the lanthorn on his staff held it up to the level of his waist and began to make his way along the street  his progress was but slow for he had many times to stop and rekindle the flame within his lanthorn which the bats wings his own stumbles and the jostlings of footpads or of revellers returning home were for ever extinguishing  in traversing that long street he spent half the night and half the night in traversing it back again  the saffron swan of dawn slow swimming up the skyriver between the high roofbanks bent her neck down through the dark airwater to look at him staggering below her with his still smoking wick  no sooner did cethru see that sunlit bird than with a great sigh of joy he sat him down and at once fell asleep  now when the dwellers in the houses of the vita publica first gained knowledge that this old man passed every night with his lanthorn up and down their street and when they marked those pallid gleams gliding over the motley prospect of cesspools and garden gates over the sightless hovels and the richcarved frontages of their palaces or saw them stay their journey and remain suspended like a handful of daffodils held up against the black stuffs of secrecythey said  it is good that the old man should pass like thiswe shall see better where were going and if the watch have any job on hand or want to put the pavements in order his lanthorn will serve their purpose well enough  and they would call out of their doors and windows to him passing  hola old man cethru  alls well with our house and with the street before it  but for answer the old man only held his lanthorn up so that in the ring of its pale light they saw some sight or other in the street  and his silence troubled them one by one for each had expected that he would reply  aye aye  alls well with your house sirs and with the street before it  thus they grew irritated with this old man who did not seem able to do anything but just hold his lanthorn up  and gradually they began to dislike his passing by their doors with his pale light by which they could not fail to see not only the richcarved frontages and scrolled gates of courtyards and fair gardens but things that were not pleasing to the eye  and they murmured amongst themselves what is the good of this old man and his silly lanthorn  we can see all we want to see without him in fact we got on very well before he came  so as he passed rich folk who were supping would pelt him with orangepeel and empty the dregs of their wine over his head and poor folk sleeping in their hutches turned over as the rays of the lanthorn fell on them and cursed him for that disturbance  nor did revellers or footpads treat the old man civilly but tied him to the wall where he was constrained to stay till a kind passerby released him  and ever the bats darkened his lanthorn with their wings and tried to beat the flame out  and the old man thought this be a terrible hard job i dont seem to please nobody  but because the prince of felicitas had so commanded him he continued nightly to pass with his lanthorn up and down the street and every morning as the saffron swan came swimming overhead to fall asleep  but his sleep did not last long for he was compelled to pass many hours each day in gathering rushes and melting down tallow for his lanthorn so that his lean face grew more than ever like a sandwich of dried leather  now it came to pass that the town watch having had certain complaints made to them that persons had been bitten in the vita publica by rats doubted of their duty to destroy these ferocious creatures and they held investigation summoning the persons bitten and inquiring of them how it was that in so dark a street they could tell that the animals which had bitten them were indeed rats  howbeit for some time no one could be found who could say more than what he had been told and since this was not evidence the town watch had good hopes that they would not after all be forced to undertake this tedious enterprise  but presently there came before them one who said that he had himself seen the rat which had bitten him by the light of an old mans lanthorn  when the town watch heard this they were vexed for they knew that if this were true they would now be forced to prosecute the arduous undertaking and they said  bring in this old man  cethru was brought before them trembling  what is this we hear old man about your lanthorn and the rat  and in the first place what were you doing in the vita publica at that time of night  cethru answered i were just passin with my lanthorn  tell usdid you see the rat  cethru shook his head my lanthorn seed the rat maybe he muttered  old owl said the captain of the watch be careful what you say  if you saw the rat why did you then not aid this unhappy citizen who was bitten by itfirst to avoid that rodent and subsequently to slay it thereby relieving the public of a pestilential danger  cethru looked at him and for some seconds did not reply then he said slowly i were just passin with my lanthorn  that you have already told us said the captain of the watch it is no answer  cethrus leathern cheeks became winecoloured so desirous was he to speak and so unable  and the watch sneered and laughed saying  this is a fine witness  but of a sudden cethru spoke  what would i be duinkillin rats tidden my business to kill rats  the captain of the watch caressed his beard and looking at the old man with contempt said  it seems to me brothers that this is an idle old vagabond who does no good to any one  we should be well advised i think to prosecute him for vagrancy  but that is not at this moment the matter in hand  owing to the accidentscarcely fortunateof this old mans passing with his lanthorn it would certainly appear that citizens have been bitten by rodents  it is then i fear our duty to institute proceedings against those poisonous and violent animals  and amidst the sighing of the watch it was so resolved  cethru was glad to shuffle away unnoticed from the court and sitting down under a cameldate tree outside the city wall he thus reflected  they were rough with me  i done nothin so fars i can see  and a long time he sat there with the bunches of the cameldates above him golden as the sunlight  then as the scent of the lyricflowers released by evening warned him of the night dropping like a flight of dark birds on the plain he rose stiffly and made his way as usual toward the vita publica  he had traversed but little of that black thoroughfare holding his lanthorn at the level of his breast when the sound of a splash and cries for help smote his long thin ears  remembering how the captain of the watch had admonished him he stopped and peered about but owing to his proximity to the light of his own lanthorn he saw nothing  presently he heard another splash and the sound of blowings and of puffings but still unable to see clearly whence they came he was forced in bewilderment to resume his march  but he had no sooner entered the next bend of that obscure and winding avenue than the most lamentable lusty cries assailed him  again he stood still blinded by his own light  somewhere at hand a citizen was being beaten for vague quickmoving forms emerged into the radiance of his lanthorn out of the deep violet of the night air the cries swelled and died away and swelled and the mazed cethru moved forward on his way  but very near the end of his first traversage the sound of a long deep sighing as of a fat man in spiritual pain once more arrested him  drat me he thought this time i will see what tis and he spun round and round holding his lanthorn now high now low and to both sides  the devil an alls in it tonight he murmured to himself theres someat here fetchin of its breath awful loud  but for his life he could see nothing only that the higher he held his lanthorn the more painful grew the sound of the fat but spiritual sighing  and desperately he at last resumed his progress  on the morrow while he still slept stretched on his straw pallet there came to him a member of the watch  old man you are wanted at the court house rouse up and bring your lanthorn  stiffly cethru rose  what be they wantin me fur now mester  ah replied the watchman they are about to see if they cant put an end to your goingson  cethru shivered and was silent  now when they reached the court house it was patent that a great affair was forward for the judges were in their robes and a crowd of advocates burgesses and common folk thronged the careen lofty hall of justice  when cethru saw that all eyes were turned on him he shivered still more violently fixing his fascinated gaze on the three judges in their emerald robes  this then is the prisoner said the oldest of the judges proceed with the indictment  a little advocate in snuffcoloured clothes rose on little legs and commenced to read  forasmuch as on the seventeenth night of august fifteen hundred years since the messiahs death one celestine a maiden of this city fell into a cesspool in the vita publica and while being quietly drowned was espied of the burgess pardonix by the light of a lanthorn held by the old man cethru and forasmuch as plunging in the said pardonix rescued her not without grave risk of life and the ruin of his clothes and today lies ill of fever and forasmuch as the old man cethru was the cause of these misfortunes to the burgess pardonix by reason of his wandering lanthorns showing the drowning maiden the watch do hereby indict accuse and otherwise place charge upon this cethru of vagabondage without serious occupation  and forasmuch as on this same night the watchman filepo made aware by the light of this said cethrus lanthorn of three sturdy footpads went to arrest them and was set on by the rogues and wellnigh slain the watch do hereby indict accuse and otherwise charge upon cethru complicity in this assault by reasons namely first that he discovered the footpads to the watchman and the watchman to the footpads by the light of his lanthorn and second that having thus discovered them he stood idly by and gave no assistance to the law  and forasmuch as on this same night the wealthy burgess pranzo who having prepared a banquet was standing in his doorway awaiting the arrival of his guests did see by the light of the said cethrus lanthorn a beggar woman and her children grovelling in the gutter for garbage whereby his appetite was lost completely and forasmuch as he pranzo has lodged a complaint against the constitution for permitting women and children to go starved the watch do hereby indict accuse and otherwise make charge on cethru of rebellion and of anarchy in that wilfully he doth disturb good citizens by showing to them without provocation disagreeable sights and doth moreover endanger the laws by causing persons to desire to change them  these be the charges reverend judges so please you  and having thus spoken the little advocate resumed his seat  then said the oldest of the judges  cethru you have heard what answer do you make  but no word only the chattering of teeth came from cethru  have you no defence said the judge these are grave accusations  then cethru spoke  so please your highnesses he said can i help what my lanthorn sees  and having spoken these words to all further questions he remained more silent than a headless man  the judges took counsel of each other and the oldest of them thus addressed himself to cethru  if you have no defence old man and there is no one will say a word for you we can but proceed to judgment  then in the main aisle of the court there rose a youthful advocate  most reverend judges he said in a mellifluous voice clearer than the fluting of a bellbird it is useless to look for words from this old man for it is manifest that he himself is nothing and that his lanthorn is alone concerned in this affair  but reverend judges bethink you well  would you have a lanthorn ply a trade or be concerned with a profession or do aught indeed but pervade the streets at night shedding its light which if you will is vagabondage  and sirs upon the second count of this indictment would you have a lanthorn dive into cesspools to rescue maidens  would you have a lanthorn to beat footpads or indeed to be any sort of partisan either of the law or of them that break the law  sure sirs i think not  and as to this third charge of fostering anarchy let me but describe the trick of this lanthorns flame it is distilled most reverend judges of oil and wick together with that sweet secret heat of whose birth no words of mine can tell  and when sirs this pale flame has sprung into the air swaying to every wind it brings vision to the human eye  and if it be charged on this old man cethru that he and his lanthorn by reason of their showing not only the good but the evil bring no pleasure into the world i ask sirs what in the world is so dear as this power to see whether it be the beautiful or the foul that is disclosed  need i indeed tell you of the way this flame spreads its feelers and delicately darts and hovers in the darkness conjuring things from nothing  this mechanical summoning sirs of visions out of blackness is benign by no means of malevolent intent no more than if a man passing two donkeys in the road one lean and the other fat could justly be arraigned for malignancy because they were not both fat  this reverend judges is the essence of the matter concerning the rich burgess pranzo who on account of the sight he saw by cethrus lanthorn has lost the equilibrium of his stomach for sirs the lanthorn did but show that which was there both fair and foul no more no less and though it is indeed true that pranzo is upset it was not because the lanthorn maliciously produced distorted images but merely caused to be seen in due proportions things which pranzo had not seen before  and surely reverend judges being just men you would not have this lanthorn turn its light away from what is ragged and ugly because there are also fair things on which its light may fall how indeed being a lanthorn could it if it would  and i would have you note this sirs that by this impartial discovery of the proportions of one thing to another this lanthorn must indeed perpetually seem to cloud and sadden those things which are fair because of the deep instincts of harmony and justice planted in the human breast  however unfair and cruel then this lanthorn may seem to those who deficient in these instincts desire all their lives to see naught but what is pleasant lest they like pranzo should lose their appetitesit is not consonant with equity that this lanthorn should even if it could be prevented from thus mechanically buffeting the holiday cheek of life  i would think sirs that you should rather blame the queazy state of pranzos stomach  the old man has said that he cannot help what his lanthorn sees  this is a just saying  but if reverend judges you deem this equipoised indifferent lanthorn to be indeed blameworthy for having shown in the same moment side by side the skull and the fair face the burdock and the tigerlily the butterfly and toad then most reverend judges punish it but do not punish this old man for he himself is but a flume of smoke thistle down dispersednothing  so saying the young advocate ceased  again the three judges took counsel of each other and after much talk had passed between them the oldest spoke  what this young advocate has said seems to us to be the truth  we cannot punish a lanthorn  let the old man go  and cethru went out into the sunshine         now it came to pass that the prince of felicitas returning from his journey rode once more on his ambercoloured steed down the vita publica  the night was dark as a rooks wing but far away down the street burned a little light like a red star truant from heaven  the prince riding by descried it for a lanthorn with an old man sleeping beside it  how is this friend said the prince  you are not walking as i bade you carrying your lanthorn  but cethru neither moved nor answered  lift him up said the prince  they lifted up his head and held the lanthorn to his closed eyes  so lean was that brown face that the beams from the lanthorn would not rest on it but slipped past on either side into the night  his eyes did not open  he was dead  and the prince touched him saying farewell old man  the lanthorn is still alight  go fetch me another one and let him carry it 1909     some platitudes concerning drama  a drama must be shaped so as to have a spire of meaning  every grouping of life and character has its inherent moral and the business of the dramatist is so to pose the group as to bring that moral poignantly to the light of day  such is the moral that exhales from plays like lear hamlet and macbeth  but such is not the moral to be found in the great bulk of contemporary drama  the moral of the average play is now and probably has always been the triumph at all costs of a supposed immediate ethical good over a supposed immediate ethical evil  the vice of drawing these distorted morals has permeated the drama to its spine discoloured its art humanity and significance infected its creators actors audience critics too often turned it from a picture into a caricature  a drama which lives under the shadow of the distorted moral forgets how to be free fair and fineforgets so completely that it often prides itself on having forgotten  now in writing plays there are in this matter of the moral three courses open to the serious dramatist  the first is to definitely set before the public that which it wishes to have set before it the views and codes of life by which the public lives and in which it believes this way is the most common successful and popular  it makes the dramatists position sure and not too obviously authoritative  the second course is to definitely set before the public those views and codes of life by which the dramatist himself lives those theories in which he himself believes the more effectively if they are the opposite of what the public wishes to have placed before it presenting them so that the audience may swallow them like powder in a spoonful of jam  there is a third course to set before the public no cutanddried codes but the phenomena of life and character selected and combined but not distorted by the dramatists outlook set down without fear favour or prejudice leaving the public to draw such poor moral as nature may afford  this third method requires a certain detachment it requires a sympathy with a love of and a curiosity as to things for their own sake it requires a far view together with patient industry for no immediately practical result  it was once said of shakespeare that he had never done any good to any one and never would  this unfortunately could not in the sense in which the word good was then meant be said of most modern dramatists in truth the good that shakespeare did to humanity was of a remote and shall we say eternal nature something of the good that men get from having the sky and the sea to look at  and this partly because he was in his greater plays at all events free from the habit of drawing a distorted moral  now the playwright who supplies to the public the facts of life distorted by the moral which it expects does so that he may do the public what he considers an immediate good by fortifying its prejudices and the dramatist who supplies to the public facts distorted by his own advanced morality does so because he considers that he will at once benefit the public by substituting for its wornout ethics his own  in both cases the advantage the dramatist hopes to confer on the public is immediate and practical  but matters change and morals change men remainand to set men and the facts about them down faithfully so that they draw for us the moral of their natural actions may also possibly be of benefit to the community  it is at all events harder than to set men and facts down as they ought or ought not to be  this however is not to say that a dramatist should or indeed can keep himself and his temperamental philosophy out of his work  as a man lives and thinks so will he write but it is certain that to the making of good drama as to the practice of every other art there must be brought an almost passionate love of discipline a whiteheat of selfrespect a desire to make the truest fairest best thing in ones power and that to these must be added an eye that does not flinch such qualities alone will bring to a drama the selfless character which soaks it with inevitability  the word pessimist is frequently applied to the few dramatists who have been content to work in this way  it has been applied among others to euripides to shakespeare to ibsen it will be applied to many in the future  nothing however is more dubious than the way in which these two words pessimist and optimist are used for the optimist appears to be he who cannot bear the world as it is and is forced by his nature to picture it as it ought to be and the pessimist one who cannot only bear the world as it is but loves it well enough to draw it faithfully the true lover of the human race is surely he who can put up with it in all its forms in vice as well as in virtue in defeat no less than in victory the true seer he who sees not only joy but sorrow the true painter of human life one who blinks nothing  it may be that he is also incidentally its true benefactor  in the whole range of the social fabric there are only two impartial persons the scientist and the artist and under the latter heading such dramatists as desire to write not only for today but for tomorrow must strive to come  but dramatists being as they are madepast remedy it is perhaps more profitable to examine the various points at which their qualities and defects are shown  the plot  a good plot is that sure edifice which slowly rises out of the interplay of circumstance on temperament and temperament on circumstance within the enclosing atmosphere of an idea  a human being is the best plot there is it may be impossible to see why he is a good plot because the idea within which he was brought forth cannot be fully grasped but it is plain that he is a good plot  he is organic  and so it must be with a good play  reason alone produces no good plots they come by original sin sure conception and instinctive afterpower of selecting what benefits the germ  a bad plot on the other hand is simply a row of stakes with a character impaled on eachcharacters who would have liked to live but came to untimely grief who started bravely but fell on these stakes placed beforehand in a row and were transfixed one by one while their ghosts stride on squeaking and gibbering through the play  whether these stakes are made of facts or of ideas according to the nature of the dramatist who planted them their effect on the unfortunate characters is the same the creatures were begotten to be staked and staked they are  the demand for a good plot not unfrequently heard commonly signifies tickle my sensations by stuffing the play with arbitrary adventures so that i need not be troubled to take the characters seriously  set the persons of the play to action regardless of time sequence atmosphere and probability  now true dramatic action is what characters do at once contrary as it were to expectation and yet because they have already done other things  no dramatist should let his audience know what is coming but neither should he suffer his characters to act without making his audience feel that those actions are in harmony with temperament and arise from previous known actions together with the temperaments and previous known actions of the other characters in the play  the dramatist who hangs his characters to his plot instead of hanging his plot to his characters is guilty of cardinal sin  the dialogue  good dialogue again is character marshalled so as continually to stimulate interest or excitement  the reason good dialogue is seldom found in plays is merely that it is hard to write for it requires not only a knowledge of what interests or excites but such a feeling for character as brings misery to the dramatists heart when his creations speak as they should not speakashes to his mouth when they say things for the sake of saying themdisgust when they are smart  the art of writing true dramatic dialogue is an austere art denying itself all license grudging every sentence devoted to the mere machinery of the play suppressing all jokes and epigrams severed from character relying for fun and pathos on the fun and tears of life  from start to finish good dialogue is handmade like good lace clear of fine texture furthering with each thread the harmony and strength of a design to which all must be subordinated  but good dialogue is also spiritual action  in so far as the dramatist divorces his dialogue from spiritual actionthat is to say from progress of events or toward events which are significant of characterhe is stultifying the thing done he may make pleasing disquisitions he is not making drama  and in so far as he twists character to suit his moral or his plot he is neglecting a first principle that truth to nature which alone invests art with handmade quality  the dramatists license in fact ends with his design  in conception alone he is free  he may take what character or group of characters he chooses see them with what eyes knit them with what idea within the limits of his temperament but once taken seen and knitted he is bound to treat them like a gentleman with the tenderest consideration of their mainsprings  take care of character action and dialogue will take care of themselves  the true dramatist gives full rein to his temperament in the scope and nature of his subject having once selected subject and characters he is just gentle restrained neither gratifying his lust for praise at the expense of his offspring nor using them as puppets to flout his audience  being himself the nature that brought them forth he guides them in the course predestined at their conception so only have they a chance of defying time which is always lying in wait to destroy the false topical or fashionable allin a wordthat is not based on the permanent elements of human nature  the perfect dramatist rounds up his characters and facts within the ringfence of a dominant idea which fulfils the craving of his spirit having got them there he suffers them to live their own lives  plot action character dialogue  but there is yet another subject for a platitude  flavour  an impalpable quality less easily captured than the scent of a flower the peculiar and most essential attribute of any work of art  it is the thin poignant spirit which hovers up out of a play and is as much its differentiating essence as is caffeine of coffee  flavour in fine is the spirit of the dramatist projected into his work in a state of volatility so that no one can exactly lay hands on it here there or anywhere  this distinctive essence of a play marking its brand is the one thing at which the dramatist cannot work for it is outside his consciousness a man may have many moods he has but one spirit and this spirit he communicates in some subtle unconscious way to all his work  it waxes and wanes with the currents of his vitality but no more alters than a chestnut changes into an oak  for in truth dramas are very like unto trees springing from seedlings shaping themselves inevitably in accordance with the laws fast hidden within themselves drinking sustenance from the earth and air and in conflict with the natural forces round them  so they slowly come to full growth until warped stunted or risen to fair and gracious height they stand open to all the winds  and the trees that spring from each dramatist are of different race he is the spirit of his own sacred grove into which no stray tree can by any chance enter  one more platitude  it is not unfashionable to pit one form of drama against anotherholding up the naturalistic to the disadvantage of the epic the epic to the belittlement of the fantastic the fantastic to the detriment of the naturalistic  little purpose is thus served  the essential meaning truth beauty and irony of things may be revealed under all these forms  vision over life and human nature can be as keen and just the revelation as true inspiring delightgiving and thoughtprovoking whatever fashion be employedit is simply a question of doing it well enough to uncover the kernel of the nut  whether the violet come from russia from parma or from england matters little close by the greek temples at paestum there are violets that seem redder and sweeter than any ever seenas though they have sprung up out of the footprints of some old pagan goddess but under the april sun in a devonshire lane the little blue scentless violets capture every bit as much of the spring  and so it is with dramano matter what its form it need only be the real thing need only have caught some of the precious fluids revelation or delight and imprisoned them within a chalice to which we may put our lips and continually drink  and yet starting from this last platitude one may perhaps be suffered to speculate as to the particular forms that our renascent drama is likely to assume  for our drama is renascent and nothing will stop its growth  it is not renascent because this or that man is writing but because of a new spirit  a spirit that is no doubt in part the gradual outcome of the impact on our homegrown art of russian french and scandinavian influences but which in the main rises from an awakened humanity in the conscience of our time  what then are to be the main channels down which the renascent english drama will float in the coming years  it is more than possible that these main channels will come to be two in number and situate far apart  the one will be the broad and clearcut channel of naturalism down which will course a drama poignantly shaped and inspired with high intention but faithful to the seething and multiple life around us drama such as some are inclined to term photographic deceived by a seeming simplicity into forgetfulness of the old proverb ars est celare artem and oblivious of the fact that to be vital to grip such drama is in every respect as dependent on imagination construction selection and eliminationthe main laws of artistryas ever was the romantic or rhapsodic play the question of naturalistic technique will bear indeed much more study than has yet been given to it  the aim of the dramatist employing it is obviously to create such an illusion of actual life passing on the stage as to compel the spectator to pass through an experience of his own to think and talk and move with the people he sees thinking talking and moving in front of him  a false phrase a single word out of tune or time will destroy that illusion and spoil the surface as surely as a stone heaved into a still pool shatters the image seen there  but this is only the beginning of the reason why the naturalistic is the most exacting and difficult of all techniques it is easy enough to reproduce the exact conversation and movements of persons in a room it is desperately hard to produce the perfectly natural conversation and movements of those persons when each natural phrase spoken and each natural movement made has not only to contribute toward the growth and perfection of a dramas soul but also to be a revelation phrase by phrase movement by movement of essential traits of character to put it another way naturalistic art when alive indeed to be alive at all is simply the art of manipulating a procession of most delicate symbols  its service is the swaying and focussing of mens feelings and thoughts in the various departments of human life  it will be like a steady lamp held up from time to time in whose light things will be seen for a space clearly and in due proportion freed from the mists of prejudice and partisanship  and the other of these two main channels will i think be a twisting and delicious stream which will bear on its breast new barques of poetry shaped it may be like prose but a prose incarnating through its fantasy and symbolism all the deeper aspirations yearning doubts and mysterious stirrings of the human spirit a poetic prosedrama emotionalising us by its diversity and purity of form and invention and whose province will be to disclose the elemental soul of man and the forces of nature not perhaps as the old tragedies disclosed them not necessarily in the epic mood but always with beauty and in the spirit of discovery  such will i think be the two vital forms of our drama in the coming generation  and between these two forms there must be no crude unions they are too far apart the cross is too violent  for where there is a seeming blend of lyricism and naturalism it will on examination be found i think to exist only in plays whose subjects or settingsas in synges playboy of the western world or in mr masefields nanare so removed from our ken that we cannot really tell and therefore do not care whether an absolute illusion is maintained  the poetry which may and should exist in naturalistic drama can only be that of perfect rightness of proportion rhythm shapethe poetry in fact that lies in all vital things  it is the illmating of forms that has killed a thousand plays  we want no more bastard drama no more attempts to dress out the simple dignity of everyday life in the peacocks feathers of false lyricism no more strawstuffed heroes or heroines no more rabbits and goldfish from the conjurers pockets nor any limelight  let us have starlight moonlight sunlight and the light of our own selfrespects 1909     meditation on finality  in the grand canyon of arizona that most exhilarating of all natural phenomena nature has for once so focussed her effects that the result is a framed and final work of art  for there between two high lines of plateau level as the sea are sunk the wrought thrones of the innumerable gods couchant and for ever revering in their million moods of light and colour the master mystery  having seen this culmination i realize why many people either recoil before it and take the first train home or speak of it as a remarkable formation  for though mankind at large craves finality it does not crave the sort that bends the knee to mystery in nature in religion in art in life the common cry is tell me precisely where i am what doing and where going  let me be free of this fearful untidiness of not knowing all about it  the favoured religions are always those whose message is most finite  the fashionable professionsthey that end us in assured positions  the most popular works of fiction such as leave nothing to our imagination  and to this craving after prose who would not be lenient that has at all known life with its usual predominance of our lower and less courageous selves our constant hankering after the cosey closed door and line of least resistance  we are continually begging to be allowed to know for certain though if our prayer were granted and mystery no longer hovered made blue the hills and turned day into night we should as surely wail at once to be delivered of that ghastliness of knowing things for certain  now in art i would never quarrel with a certain living writer who demands of it the kind of finality implied in what he calls a moral discoveryusing no doubt the words in their widest sense  i would maintain however that such finality is not confined to positively discovering the true conclusion of premises laid down but that it may also distil gradually negatively from the whole work in a moral discovery as it were of author  in other words that permeation by an essential point of view by emanation of author may so unify and vitalize a work as to give it all the finality that need be required of art  for the finality that is requisite to art be it positive or negative is not the finality of dogma nor the finality of fact it is ever the finality of feelingof a spiritual light subtly gleaned by the spectator out of that queer luminous haze which one mans nature must ever be to others  and herein incidentally it is that art acquires also that quality of mystery more needful to it even than finality for the mystery that wraps a work of art is the mystery of its maker and the mystery of its maker is the difference between that makers soul and every other soul  but let me take an illustration of what i mean by these two kinds of finality that art may have and show that in essence they are but two halves of the same thing  the term a work of art will not be denied i think to that early novel of m anatole france le lys rouge  now that novel has positive finality since the spiritual conclusion from its premises strikes one as true  but neither will the term a work of art be denied to the same writers four bergeret volumes whose negative finality consists only in the temperamental atmosphere wherein they are soaked  now if the theme of le lys rouge had been treated by tolstoy meredith or turgenev we should have had spiritual conclusions from the same factual premises so different from m frances as prunes from prisms and yet being the work of equally great artists they would doubtless have struck us as equally true  is not then the positive finality of le lys rouge though expressed in terms of a different craftsmanship the same in essence as the negative finality of the bergeret volumes  are not both in fact merely flower of author true to himself  so long as the scent colour form of that flower is strong and fine enough to affect the senses of our spirit then all the rest surely is academici would say immaterial  but here in regard to art is where mankind at large comes on the field flower of author it says senses of the spirit phew  give me something i can understand  let me know where i am getting to  in a word it wants a finality different from that which art can give  it will ask the artist with irritation what his solution or his lesson or his meaning really is having omitted to notice that the poor creature has been giving all the meaning that he can in every sentence it will demand to know why it was not told definitely what became of charles or mary in whom it had grown so interested and will be almost frightened to learn that the artist knows no more than itself  and if by any chance it be required to dip its mind into a philosophy that does not promise it a defined position both in this world and the next it will assuredly recoil and with a certain contempt say no sir  this means nothing to me and if it means anything to youwhich i very much doubti am sorry for you  it must have facts and again facts not only in the present and the past but in the future  and it demands facts of that which alone cannot glibly give it facts  it goes on asking facts of art or rather such facts as art cannot givefor after all even flower of author is fact in a sort of way  consider for instance synges masterpiece the playboy of the western world there is flower of author  what is it for mankind at large  an attack on the irish character  a pretty piece of writing  an amusing farce  enigmatic cynicism leading nowhere  a puzzling fellow wrote it mankind at large has little patience with puzzling fellows  few in fact want flower of author  moreover it is a quality that may well be looked for where it does not exist  to say that the finality which art requires is merely an enwrapping mood or flower of author is not by any means to say that any robust fellow slamming his notions down in ink can give us these  indeed no  so long as we see the authors proper person in his work we do not see the flower of him  let him retreat himself if he pretend to be an artist  there is no less of subtle skill no less impersonality in the bergeret volumes than in le lys rouge  no less labour and mental torturing went to their making page by page in order that they might exhale their perfume of mysterious finality their withdrawn but implicit judgment  flower of author is not quite so common as the buttercup the californian poppy or the gay texan gaillardia and for that very reason the finality it gives off will never be robust enough for a mankind at large that would have things cut and dried and labelled in thick letters  for considerto take one phase alone of this demand for factual finalityhow continual and insistent is the cry for characters that can be worshipped how intense and persistent the desire to be told that charles was a real hero and how bitter the regret that mary was no better than she should be  mankind at large wants heroes that are heroes and heroines that are heroinesand nothing so inappropriate to them as unhappy endings  travelling away i remember from that grand canyon of arizona were a young man and a young woman evidently in love  he was sitting very close to her and reading aloud for her pleasure from a papercovered novel heroically oblivious of us all  sir robert she murmured lifting her beauteous eyes i may not tempt you for you are too dear to me sir robert held her lovely face between his two strong hands  farewell he said and went out into the night but something told them both that when he had fulfilled his duty sir robert would return         he had not returned before we reached the junction but there was finality about that baronet and we well knew that he ultimately would  and long after the sound of that young mans faithful reading had died out of our ears we meditated on sir robert and compared him with the famous characters of fiction slowly perceiving that they were none of them so final in their heroism as he  no none of them reached that apex  for hamlet was a most unfinished fellow and lear extremely violent  pickwick addicted to punch and sam weller to lying bazarof actually a nihilist and

not even so virtuous as mary who failed of being what she should be  and coming to more familiar persons joseph and moses david and elijah all of them lacked his finality of true heroismnone could quite pass muster beside sir robert        long we meditated and reflecting that an author must ever be superior to the creatures of his brain were refreshed to think that there were so many living authors capable of giving birth to sir robert for indeed sir robert and finality like hisno doubtful heroes no flower of author and no mystery is what mankind at large has always wanted from letters and will always want  as truly as that oil and water do not mix there are two kinds of men the main cleavage in the whole tale of life is this subtle all pervading division of mankind into the man of facts and the man of feeling  and not by what they are or do can they be told one from the other but just by their attitude toward finality  fortunately most of us are neither quite the one nor quite the other  but between the pureblooded of each kind there is real antipathy far deeper than the antipathies of race politics or religionan antipathy that not circumstance love goodwill or necessity will ever quite get rid of  sooner shall the panther agree with the bull than that other one with the man of facts there is no bridging the gorge that divides these worlds  nor is it so easy to tell of each to which world he belongs as it was to place the lady who held out her finger over that gorge called grand canyon and said  it doesnt look thirteen miles but they measured it just there  excuse my pointing 1912     wantedschooling  et nous jongleurs inutiles frivoles joueurs de luth    useless jugglers frivolous players on the lute  must we so describe ourselves we the producers season by season of so many hundreds of remarkable works of fictionfor though when we take up the remarkable works of our fellows we really cannot read them the press and the advertisements of our publishers tell us that they are remarkable  a story goes that once in the twilight undergrowth of a forest of nutbearing trees a number of little purblind creatures wandered singing for nuts  on some of these purblind creatures the nuts fell heavy and full extremely indigestible and were quickly swallowed on others they fell light and contained nothing because the kernel had already been eaten up above and these light and kernelless nuts were accompanied by sibilations or laughter  on others again no nuts at all empty or full came down  but nuts or no nuts full nuts or empty nuts the purblind creatures below went on wandering and singing  a traveller one day stopped one of these creatures whose voice was peculiarly disagreeable and asked why do you sing like this  is it for pleasure that you do it or for pain  what do you get out of it  is it for the sake of those up there  is it for your own sakefor the sake of your familyfor whose sake  do you think your songs worth listening to  answer  the creature scratched itself and sang the louder  ah  cacoethes  i pity but do not blame you said the traveller  he left the creature and presently came to another which sang a squeaky treble song  it wandered round in a ring under a grove of stunted trees and the traveller noticed that it never went out of that grove  is it really necessary he said for you to express yourself thus  and as he spoke showers of tiny hard nuts came down on the little creature who ate them greedily  the traveller opened one it was extremely small and tasted of dry rot  why at all events he said need you stay under these trees the nuts are not good here  but for answer the little creature ran round and round and round and round  i suppose said the traveller small bad nuts are better than no bread if you went out of this grove you would starve  the purblind little creature shrieked  the traveller took the sound for affirmation and passed on  he came to a third little creature who under a tall tree was singing very loudly indeed while all around was a great silence broken only by sounds like the snuffling of small noses the creature stopped singing as the traveller came up and at once a storm of huge nuts came down the traveller found them sweetish and very oily  why he said to the creature did you sing so loud  you cannot eat all these nuts  you really do sing louder than seems necessary come answer me  but the purblind little creature began to sing again at the top of its voice and the noise of the snuffling of small noses became so great that the traveller hastened away  he passed many other purblind little creatures in the twilight of this forest till at last he came to one that looked even blinder than the rest but whose song was sweet and low and clear breaking a perfect stillness and the traveller sat down to listen  for a long time he listened to that song without noticing that not a nut was falling  but suddenly he heard a faint rustle and three little oval nuts lay on the ground  the traveller cracked one of them  it was of delicate flavour  he looked at the little creature standing with its face raised and said  tell me little blind creature whose song is so charming where did you learn to sing  the little creature turned its head a trifle to one side as though listening for the fall of nuts  ah indeed said the traveller you whose voice is so clear is this all you get to eat  the little blind creature smiled         it is a twilight forest in which we writers of fiction wander and once in a way though all this has been said before we may as well remind ourselves and others why the light is so dim why there is so much bad and false fiction why the demand for it is so great living in a world where demand creates supply we writers of fiction furnish the exception to this rule  for consider how as a class we come into existence unlike the followers of any other occupation nothing whatever compels any one of us to serve an apprenticeship  we go to no school have to pass no examination attain no standard receive no diploma  we need not study that which should be studied we are at liberty to flood our minds with all that should not be studied  like mushrooms in a single sight we spring upa pen in our hands very little in our brains and whoknowswhat in our hearts  few of us sit down in cold blood to write our first stories we have something in us that we feel we must express  this is the beginning of the vicious circle  our first books often have some thing in them  we are sincere in trying to express that something  it is true we cannot express it not having learnt how but its ghost haunts the pages the ghost of real experience and real lifejust enough to attract the untrained intelligence just enough to make a generous press remark this shows promise  we have tasted blood we pant for more  those of us who had a carking occupation hasten to throw it aside those who had no occupation have now found one some few of us keep both the old occupation and the new whichever of these courses we pursue the hurry with which we pursue it undoes us for often we have only that one book in us which we did not know how to write and having expressed that which we have felt we are driven in our second our third our fourth to warm up variations like those dressed remains of last nights dinner which are served for lunch or to spin from our usually commonplace imaginations thin extravagances which those who do not try to think for themselves are ever ready to accept as full of inspiration and vitality anything for a book we sayanything for a book  from time immemorial we have acted in this immoral manner till we have accustomed the press and public to expect it  from time immemorial we have allowed ourselves to be driven by those powerful drivers bread and praise and cared little for the quality of either  sensibly or insensibly we tune our songs to earn the nuts of our twilight forest we tune them not to the key of is it good but to the key of will it pay and at each tuning the nuts fall fast  it is all so natural how can we help it seeing that we are undisciplined and standardless seeing that we started without the backbone that schooling gives  here and there among us is a genius here and there a man of exceptional stability who trains himself in spite of all the forces working for his destruction  but those who do not publish until they can express and do not express until they have something worth expressing are so rare that they can be counted on the fingers of three or perhaps four hands mercifully we allor nearly all believe ourselves of that company  it is the fashion to say that the public will have what it wants certainly the public will have what it wants if what it wants is given to the public  if what it now wants were suddenly withdrawn the public the big public would by an obvious natural law take the lowest of what remained if that again were withdrawn it would take the next lowest until by degrees it took a relatively good article the public the big public is a mechanical and helpless consumer at the mercy of what is supplied to it and this must ever be so  the public then is not to blame for the supply of bad false fiction the press is not to blame for the press like the public must take what is set before it their critics for the most part like ourselves have been to no school passed no test of fitness received no certificate they cannot lead us it is we who lead them for without the critics we could live but without us the critics would die  we cannot therefore blame the press  nor is the publisher to blame for the publisher will publish what is set before him  it is true that if he published no books on commission he would deserve the praise of the state but it is quite unreasonable for us to expect him to deserve the praise of the state since it is we who supply him with these books and incite him to publish them  we cannot therefore lay the blame on the publisher  we must lay the blame where it clearly should be laid on ourselves we ourselves create the demand for bad and false fiction  very many of us have private means for such there is no excuse  very many of us have none for such once started on this journey of fiction there is much often tragic excusethe less reason then for not having trained ourselves before setting out on our way  there is no getting out of it the fault is ours  if we will not put ourselves to school when we are young if we must rush into print before we can spell if we will not repress our natural desires and walk before we run if we will not learn at least what not to dowe shall go on wandering through the forest singing our foolish songs  and since we cannot train ourselves except by writing let us write and burn what we write then shall we soon stop writing or produce what we need not burn  for as things are now without compass without map we set out into the twilight forest of fiction without path without trackand we never emerge  yes with the french writer we must say  et nous jongleurs inutiles frivoles joueurs de luth      1906     reflections on our dislike of things as they are  yes  why is this the chief characteristic of our art  what secret instincts are responsible for this inveterate distaste  but first is it true that we have it  to stand still and look at a thing for the joy of looking without reference to any material advantage and personal benefit either to ourselves or our neighbours just simply to indulge our curiosity  is that a british habit  i think not  if on some november afternoon we walk into kensington gardens where they join the park on the bayswater side and crossing in front of the ornamental fountain glance at the semicircular seat let into a dismal little temple of the sun we shall see a halfmoon of apathetic figures there enjoying a moment of lugubrious idleness may be sitting an old countrywoman with steady eyes in a lean dustyblack dress and an old pokebonnet by her side some ginfaced creature of the town all blousy and draggled a holloweyed foreigner far gone in consumption a bronzed young navvy asleep with his muddy boots jutting straight out a bearded dreary being chin on chest and more consumptives and more vagabonds and more people deadtired speechless and staring before them from that crescentshaped haven where there is no draught at their backs and the sun occasionally shines  and as we look at them according to the state of our temper we think poor creatures i wish i could do something for them or revolting  they oughtnt to allow it but do we feel any pleasure in just watching them any of that intimate sensation a cat entertains when its back is being rubbed are we curiously enjoying the sight of these people simply as manifestations of life as objects fashioned by the ebb and flow of its tides  again i think not  and why  either because we have instantly felt that we ought to do something that here is a danger in our midst which one day might affect our own security and at all events a sight revolting to us who came out to look at this remarkably fine fountain  or because we are too humane  though very possibly that frequent murmuring of ours ah  its too sad is but another way of putting the words stand aside please youre too depressing  or again is it that we avoid the sight of things as they are avoid the unedifying because of what may be called the uncreative instinct that safeguard and concomitant of a civilisation which demands of us complete efficiency practical and thorough employment of every second of our time and every inch of our space  we know of course that out of nothing nothing can be made that to create anything a man must first receive impressions and that to receive impressions requires an apparatus of nerves and feelers exposed and quivering to every vibration round it an apparatus so entirely opposed to our national spirit and traditions that the bare thought of it causes us to blush  a robust recognition of this a steadfast resolve not to be forced out of the current of strenuous civilisation into the sleepy backwater of pure impression ism makes us distrustful of attempts to foster in ourselves that receptivity and subsequent creativeness the microbes of which exist in every man to watch a thing simply because it is a thing entirely without considering how it can affect us and without even seeing at the moment how we are to get anything out of it jars our consciences jars that inner feeling which keeps secure and makes harmonious the whole concert of our lives for we feel it to be a waste of time dangerous to the community contributing neither to our meat and drink our clothes and comfort nor to the stability and order of our lives  of these three possible reasons for our dislike of things as they are the first two are perhaps contained within the third  but to whatever our dislike is due we have itoh we have it  with the possible exception of hogarth in his nonpreaching pictures and constable in his sketches of the skyi speak of dead men onlyhave we produced any painter of reality like manet or millet any writer like flaubert or maupassant like turgenev or tchekov  we are i think too deeply civilised so deeply civilised that we have come to look on nature as indecent  the acts and emotions of life undraped with ethics seem to us anathema  it has long been and still is the fashion among the intellectuals of the continent to regard us as barbarians in most aesthetic matters  ah  if they only knew how infinitely barbarous they seem to us in their naive contempt of our barbarism and in what we regard as their infantine concern with things as they are  how far have we not gone past all thatwe of the oldest settled western country who have so veneered our lives that we no longer know of what wood they are made  whom generations have so soaked with the preserve good form that we are impervious to the claims and clamour of that illbred creaturelife  who think it either dreadful or vieux jeu that such things as the crude emotions and the raw struggles of fate should be even mentioned much less presented in terms of art  for whom an artist is suspect if he is not in his work a sportsman and a gentleman  who shake a solemn head over writers who will treat of sex and with the remark worst of it is theres so much truth in those fellows close the book  ah well  i suppose we have been too long familiar with the unprofitableness of speculation have surrendered too definitely to actionto the material side of things retaining for what relaxation our spirits may require a habit of sentimental aspiration carefully divorced from things as they are  we seem to have decided that things are not or if they are ought not to beand what is the good of thinking of things like that  in fact our national ideal has become the will to health to material efficiency and to it we have sacrificed the will to sensibility  it is a point of view  and yetto the philosophy that craves perfection to the spirit that desires the golden mean and hankers for the serene and balanced seat in the centre of the seesaw it seems a little pitiful and constricted a confession of defeat a hedging and limitation of the soul  need we put up with this must we for ever turn our eyes away from things as they are stifle our imaginations and our sensibilities for fear that they should become our masters and destroy our sanity  this is the eternal question that confronts the artist and the thinker  because of the inevitable decline after full floweringpoint is reached the inevitable fading of the fire that follows the full flame and glow are we to recoil from striving to reach the perfect and harmonious climacteric  better to have loved and lost i think than never to have loved at all better to reach out and grasp the fullest expression of the individual and the national soul than to keep for ever under the shelter of the wall i would even think it possible to be sensitive without neurasthenia to be sympathetic without insanity to be alive to all the winds that blow without getting influenza  god forbid that our letters and our arts should decade into beardsleyism but between that and their present health there lies full floweringpoint not yet by a long way reached  to flower like that i suspect we must see things just a little moreas they are 19051912     the windlestraw  a certain writer returning one afternoon from rehearsal of his play sat down in the hall of the hotel where he was staying  no he reflected this play of mine will not please the public it is gloomy almost terrible  this very day i read these words in my morning paper no artist can afford to despise his public for whether he confesses it or not the artist exists to give the public what it wants  i have then not only done what i cannot afford to do but i have been false to the reason of my existence  the hall was full of people for it was the hour of tea and looking round him the writer thought and this is the publicthe public that my play is destined not to please  and for several minutes he looked at them as if he had been hypnotised  presently between two tables he noticed a waiter standing lost in his thoughts  the mask of the mans professional civility had come awry and the expression of his face and figure was curiously remote from the faces and forms of those from whom he had been taking orders he seemed like a bird discovered in its own haunts all unconscious as yet of human eyes and the writer thought but if those people at the tables are the public what is that waiter how if i was mistaken and not they but he were the real public  and testing this thought his mind began at once to range over all the people he had lately seen  he thought of the founders day dinner of a great school which he had attended the night before  no he mused i see very little resemblance between the men at that dinner and the men in this hall still less between them and the waiter  how if they were the real public and neither the waiter nor these people here  but no sooner had he made this reflection than he bethought him of a gathering of workers whom he had watched two days ago  again he mused i do not recollect any resemblance at all between those workers and the men at the dinner and certainly they are not like any one here  what if those workers are the real public not the men at the dinner nor the waiter nor the people in this hall  and thereupon his mind flew off again and this time rested on the figures of his own immediate circle of friends they seemed very different from the four real publics whom he had as yet discovered yes he considered when i come to think of it my associates painters and writers and critics and all that kind of persondo not seem to have anything to speak of in common with any of these people  perhaps my own associates then are the real public and not these others  perceiving that this would be the fifth real public he felt discouraged  but presently he began to think the past is the past and cannot be undone and with this play of mine i shall not please the public but there is always the future  now i do not wish to do what the artist cannot afford to do i earnestly desire to be true to the reason of my existence and since the reason of that existence is to give the public what it wants it is really vital to discover who and what the public is  and he began to look very closely at the faces around him hoping to find out from types what he had failed to ascertain from classes  two men were sitting near one on each side of a woman  the first who was all crumpled in his armchair had curly lips and wrinkles round the eyes cheeks at once rather fat and rather shadowy and a dimple in his chin  it seemed certain that he was humourous and kind sympathetic rather diffident speculative moderately intelligent with the rudiments perhaps of an imagination  and he looked at the second man who was sitting very upright as if he had a particularly fine backbone of which he was not a little proud  he was extremely big and handsome with pronounced and regular nose and chin firm wellcut lips beneath a smooth moustache direct and rather insolent eyes a some what receding forehead and an air of mastery over all around  it was obvious that he possessed a complete knowledge of his own mind some brutality much practical intelligence great resolution no imagination and plenty of conceit and he looked at the woman  she was pretty but her face was vapid and seemed to have no character at all  and from one to the other he looked and the more he looked the less resemblance he saw between them till the objects of his scrutiny grew restive  then ceasing to examine them an idea came to him  no  the public is not this or that class this or that type the public is an hypothetical average human being endowed with average human qualitiesa distillation in fact of all the people in this hall the people in the street outside the people of this country everywhere  and for a moment he was pleased but soon he began again to feel uneasy  since he reflected it is necessary for me to supply this hypothetical average human being with what he wants i shall have to find out how to distil him from all the ingredients around me now how am i to do that  it will certainly take me more than all my life to collect and boil the souls of all of them which is necessary if i am to extract the genuine article and i should then apparently have no time left to supply the precipitated spirit when i had obtained it with what it wanted  yet this hypothetical average human being must be found or i must stay for ever haunted by the thought that i am not supplying him with what he wants  and the writer became more and more discouraged for to arrogate to himself knowledge of all the heights and depths and even of all the virtues and vices tastes and dislikes of all the people of the country without having first obtained it seemed to him to savour of insolence  and still more did it appear impertinent having taken this mass of knowledge which he had not got to extract from it a golden mean man in order to supply him with what he wanted  and yet this was what every artist did who justified his existenceor it would not have been so stated in a newspaper  and he gaped up at the lofty ceiling as if he might perchance see the public flying up there in the faint bluish mist of smoke  and suddenly he thought suppose by some miracle my goldenmean bird came flying to me with its beak open for the food with which it is my duty to supply itwould it after all be such a very strangelooking creature would it not be extremely like my normal self  am i not in fact myself the public  for without the strongest and most reprehensible conceit can i claim for my normal self a single attribute or quality not possessed by an hypothetical average human being  yes i am myself the public or at all events all that my consciousness can ever know of it for certain and he began to consider deeply  for sitting there in cold blood with his nerves at rest and his brain and senses normal the play he had written did seem to him to put an unnecessary strain upon the faculties ah he thought in future i must take good care never to write anything except in cold blood with my nerves well clothed and my brain and senses quiet  i ought only to write when i feel as normal as i do now  and for some minutes he remained motionless looking at his boots then there crept into his mind an uncomfortable thought  but have i ever written anything without feeling a littleabnormal at the time have i ever even felt inclined to write anything until my emotions had been unduly excited my brain immoderately stirred my senses unusually quickened or my spirit extravagantly roused  never  alas never  i am then a miserable renegade false to the whole purpose of my beingnor do i see the slightest hope of becoming a better man a less unworthy artist  for i literally cannot write without the stimulus of some feeling exaggerated at the expense of other feelings  what has been in the past will be in the future i shall never be taking up my pen when i feel my comfortable and normal self never be satisfying that self which is the public  and he thought i am lost  for to satisfy that normal self to give the public what it wants is i am told and therefore must believe what all artists exist for  aeschylus in his choephorae and his prometheus sophocles in his oedipus tyrannus euripides when he wrote the trojan women medeaand hippolytus shakespeare in his leer goethe in his faust ibsen in his ghosts and his peer gynt tolstoy in the powers of darkness allall in those great works must have satisfied their most comfortable and normal selves allall must have given to the average human being to the public what it wants for to do that we know was the reason of their existence and who shall say those noble artists were not true to it  that is surely unthinkable and yetand yetwe are assured and indeed it is true that there is no real public in this country for just those plays  therefore aeschylus sophocles euripides shakespeare goethe ibsen tolstoy in their greatest works did not give the public what it wants did not satisfy the average human being their more comfortable and normal selves and as artists were not true to the reason of their existence therefore they were not artists which is unthinkable therefore i have not yet found the public  and perceiving that in this impasse his last hope of discovery had foundered the writer let his head fall on his chest  but even as he did so a gleam of light like a faint moonbeam stole out into the garden of his despair  is it possible he thought that by a writer until his play has been performed when alas it is too late the public is inconceivablein fact that for him there is no such thing  but if there be no such thing i cannot exist to give it what it wants  what then is the reason of my existence  am i but a windlestraw  and wearied out with his perplexity he fell into a doze and while he dozed he dreamed that he saw the figure of a woman standing in darkness from whose face and form came a misty refulgence such as steals out into the dusk from white campion flowers along summer hedgerows  she was holding her pale hands before her wide apart with the palms turned down quivering as might doves about to settle and for all it was so dark her grey eyes were visiblefull of light with black rims round the irises  to gaze at those eyes was almost painful for though they were beautiful they seemed to see right through his soul to pass him by as though on a far discovering voyage and forbidden to rest  the dreamer spoke to her who are you standing there in the darkness with those eyes that i can hardly bear to look at  who are you  and the woman answered friend i am your conscience i am the truth as best it may be seen by you  i am she whom you exist to serve with those words she vanished and the writer woke  a boy was standing before him with the evening papers  to cover his confusion at being caught asleep he purchased one and began to read a leading article  it commenced with these words there are certain playwrights taking themselves very seriously might we suggest to them that they are in danger of becoming ridiculous         the writer let fall his hand and the paper fluttered to the ground the public he thought i am not able to take seriously because i cannot conceive what it may be myself my conscience i am told i must not take seriously or i become ridiculous  yes i am indeed lost  and with a feeling of elation as of a straw blown on every wind he arose 1910     studies and essays  by john galsworthy            je vous dirai que lexces est toujours un mal

country of free institutions that the great majority of our fellowcountrymen consider the only censorship that now obtains amongst us namely the censorship of plays a bulwark for the preservation of their comfort and sensibility against the spiritual researches and speculations of bolder and too active spiritsit has become time to consider whether we should not seriously extend a principle so grateful to the majority to all our institutions  for no one can deny that in practice the censorship of drama works with a smooth swiftnessa lack of delay and friction unexampled in any public office  no troublesome publicity and tedious postponement for the purpose of appeal mar its efficiency  it is neither hampered by the law nor by the slow process of popular election  welcomed by the overwhelming majority of the public objected to only by such persons as suffer from it and a negligible faction who wedded pedantically to liberty of the subject are resentful of summary powers vested in a single person responsible only to his own conscienceit is amazingly triumphantly successful  why then in a democratic state is so valuable a protector of the will the interests and pleasure of the majority not bestowed on other branches of the public being  opponents of the censorship of plays have been led by the absence of such other censorships to conclude that this office is an archaic survival persisting into times that have outgrown it  they have been known to allege that the reason of its survival is simply the fact that dramatic authors whose reputation and means of livelihood it threatens have ever been few in number and poorly organisedthat the reason in short is the helplessness and weakness of the interests concerned  we must all combat with force such an aspersion on our legislature  can it even for a second be supposed that a state which gives trial by jury to the meanest poorest most helpless of its citizens and concedes to the greatest criminals the right of appeal could have debarred a body of reputable men from the ordinary rights of citizenship for so cynical a reason as that their numbers were small their interests unjoined their protests feeble  such a supposition were intolerable  we do not in this country deprive a class of citizens of their ordinary rights we do not place their produce under the irresponsible control of one not amenable to law by any sort of political accident  that would indeed be to laugh at justice in this kingdom  that would indeed be cynical and unsound  we must never admit that there is no basic justice controlling the edifice of our civic rights  we do we must conclude that a just and wellconsidered principle underlies this despotic institution for surely else it would not be suffered to survive for a single moment  pom  pom  if then the censorship of plays be just beneficent and based on a wellconsidered principle we must rightly inquire what good and logical reason there is for the absence of censorship in other departments of the national life  if censorship of the drama be in the real interests of the people or at all events in what the censor for the time being conceives to be their interestthen censorships of art literature religion science and politics are in the interests of the people unless it can be proved that there exists essential difference between the drama and these other branches of the public being  let us consider whether there is any such essential difference  it is fact beyond dispute that every year numbers of books appear which strain the average readers intelligence and sensibilities to an unendurable extent books whose speculations are totally unsuited to normal thinking powers books which contain views of morality divergent from the customary and discussions of themes unsuited to the young person books which in fine provide the greater public with no pleasure whatsoever and either by harrowing their feelings or offending their good taste cause them real pain  it is true that precisely as in the case of plays the public are protected by a vigilant and critical press from works of this description that further they are protected by the commercial instinct of the libraries who will not stock an article which may offend their customersjust as in the case of plays the public are protected by the commonsense of theatrical managers that finally they are protected by the police and the common law of the land  but despite all these protections it is no uncommon thing for an average citizen to purchase one of these disturbing or dubious books  has he on discovering its true nature the right to call on the bookseller to refund its value  he has not  and thus he runs a danger obviated in the case of the drama which has the protection of a prudential censorship  for this reason alone how much better then that there should exist a paternal authority some no doubt will call it grandmaternalbut sneers must not be confounded with argument to suppress these books before appearance and safeguard us from the danger of buying and possibly reading undesirable or painful literature  a specious reason however is advanced for exempting literature from the censorship accorded to plays  heit is saidwho attends the performance of a play attends it in public where his feelings may be harrowed and his taste offended cheek by jowl with boys or women of all ages it may even chance that he has taken to this entertainment his wife or the young persons of his household  heon the other handwho reads a book reads it in privacy  true but the wielder of this argument has clasped his fingers round a twoedged blade  the very fact that the book has no mixed audience removes from literature an element which is ever the greatest check on licentiousness in drama  no manager of a theatrea man of the world engaged in the acquisition of his livelihood unless guaranteed by the license of the censor dare risk the presentment before a mixed audience of that which might cause an emeute among his clients  it has indeed always been observed that the theatrical manager almost without exception thoughtfully recoils from the responsibility that would be thrust on him by the abolition of the censorship  the fear of the mixed audience is ever suspended above his head  no such fear threatens the publisher who displays his wares to one man at a time  and for this very reason of the mixed audience perpetually and perversely cited to the contrary by such as have no firm grasp of this matter there is a greater necessity for a censorship on literature than for one on plays  further if there were but a censorship of literature no matter how dubious the books that were allowed to pass the conscience of no reader need ever be troubled  for that the perfect rest of the public conscience is the first result of censorship is proved to certainty by the protected drama since many dubious plays are yearly put before the playgoing public without tending in any way to disturb a complacency engendered by the security from harm guaranteed by this beneficent if despotic institution  pundits who to the discomfort of the populace foster this exemption of literature from discipline cling to the oldfashioned notion that ulcers should be encouraged to discharge themselves upon the surface instead of being quietly and decently driven into the system and allowed to fester there  the remaining plea for exempting literature from censorship put forward by unreflecting persons that it would require too many censorsbesides being unworthy is on the face of it erroneous special tests have never been thought necessary in appointing examiners of plays  they would indeed not only be unnecessary but positively dangerous seeing that the essential function of censorship is protection of the ordinary prejudices and forms of thought  there would then be no difficulty in securing tomorrow as many censors of literature as might be necessary say twenty or thirty since all that would be required of each one of them would be that he should secretly exercise in his uncontrolled discretion his individual taste  in a word this free literature of ours protects advancing thought and speculation and those who believe in civic freedom subject only to common law and espouse the cause of free literature are championing a system which is essentially undemocratic essentially inimical to the will of the majority who have certainly no desire for any such things as advancing thought and speculation  such persons indeed merely hold the faith that the people as a whole unprotected by the despotic judgments of single persons have enough strength and wisdom to know what is and what is not harmful to themselves  they put their trust in a public press and a common law which deriving from the conscience of the country is openly administered and within the reach of all  how absurd how inadequate this all is we see from the existence of the censorship on drama  having observed that there is no reason whatever for the exemption of literature let us now turn to the case of art  every picture hung in a gallery every statue placed on a pedestal is exposed to the public stare of a mixed company  why then have we no censorship to protect us from the possibility of encountering works that bring blushes to the cheek of the young person  the reason cannot be that the proprietors of galleries are more worthy of trust than the managers of theatres this would be to make an odious distinction which those very managers who uphold the censorship of plays would be the first to resent  it is true that societies of artists and the proprietors of galleries are subject to the prosecution of the law if they offend against the ordinary standards of public decency but precisely the same liability attaches to theatrical managers and proprietors of theatres in whose case it has been found necessary and beneficial to add the censorship  and in this connection let it once more be noted how much more easily the ordinary standards of public decency can be assessed by a single person responsible to no one than by the clumsy if more open process of public protest what then in the light of the proved justice and efficiency of the censorship of drama is the reason for the absence of the censorship of art  the more closely the matter is regarded the more plain it is that there is none  at any moment we may have to look upon some painting or contemplate some statue as tragic heartrending and dubiously delicate in theme as that censured play the cenci by one shelley as dangerous to prejudice and suggestive of new thought as the censured ghosts by one ibsen  let us protest against this peril suspended over our heads and demand the immediate appointment of a single person not selected for any pretentiously artistic feelings but endowed with summary powers of prohibiting the exhibition in public galleries or places of such works as he shall deem in his uncontrolled discretion unsuited to average intelligence or sensibility  let us demand it in the interest not only of the young person but of those whole sections of the community which cannot be expected to take an interest in art and to whom the purpose speculations and achievements of great artists working not only for today but for tomorrow must naturally be dark riddles  let us even require that this official should be empowered to order the destruction of the works which he has deemed unsuited to average intelligence and sensibility lest their creators should by private sale make a profit out of them such as in the nature of the case dramatic authors are debarred from making out of plays which having been censured cannot be played for money  let us ask this with confidence for it is not compatible with common justice that there should be any favouring of painter over playwright  they are both artistslet them both be measured by the same last  but let us now consider the case of science  it will not indeed cannot be contended that the investigations of scientific men whether committed to writing or to speech are always suited to the taste and capacities of our general public  there was for example the wellknown doctrine of evolution the teachings of charles darwin and alfred russet wallace who gathered up certain facts hitherto but vaguely known into presentments irreverent and startling which at the time profoundly disturbed every normal mind  not only did religion as then accepted suffer in this cataclysm but our taste and feeling were inexpressibly shocked by the discovery so emphasised by thomas henry huxley of mans descent from apes  it was felt and is felt by many to this day that the advancement of that theory grossly and dangerously violated every canon of decency what pain then might have been averted what farreaching consequences and incalculable subversion of primitive faiths checked if some judicious censor of scientific thought had existed in those days to demand in accordance with his private estimate of the will and temper of the majority the suppression of the doctrine of evolution  innumerable investigations of scientists on subjects such as the date of the worlds creation have from time to time been summarised and inconsiderately sprung on a public shocked and startled by the revelation that facts which they were accustomed to revere were conspicuously at fault  so too in the range of medicine it would be difficult to cite any radical discovery such as the preventive power of vaccination whose unchecked publication has not violated the prejudices and disturbed the immediate comfort of the common mind  had these discoveries been judiciously suppressed or pared away to suit what a censorship conceived to be the popular palate of the time all this disturbance and discomfort might have been avoided  it will doubtless be contended for there are no such violent opponents of censorship as those who are threatened with the same that to compare a momentous disclosure such as the doctrine of evolution to a mere drama were unprofitable  the answer to this ungenerous contention is fortunately plain  had a judicious censorship existed over our scientific matters such as for two hundred years has existed over our drama scientific discoveries would have been no more disturbing and momentous than those which we are accustomed to see made on our nicely pruned and tutored stage for not only would the more dangerous and penetrating scientific truths have been carefully destroyed at birth but scientists aware that the results of investigations offensive to accepted notions would be suppressed would long have ceased to waste their time in search of a knowledge repugnant to average intelligence and thus foredoomed and have occupied themselves with services more agreeable to the public taste such as the rediscovery of truths already known and published  indissolubly connected with the desirability of a censorship of science is the need for religious censorship  for in this assuredly not the least important department of the nations life we are witnessing week by week and year by year what in the light of the security guaranteed by the censorship of drama we are justified in terming an alarming spectacle  thousands of men are licensed to proclaim from their pulpits sunday after sunday their individual beliefs quite regardless of the settled convictions of the masses of their congregations  it is true indeed that the vast majority of sermons like the vast majority of plays are and will always be harmonious with the feelingsof the average citizen for neither priest nor playwright have customarily any such peculiar gift of spiritual daring as might render them unsafe mentors of their fellows and there is not wanting the deterrent of commonsense to keep them in bounds  yet it can hardly be denied that there spring up at times menlike john wesley or general boothof such incurable temperament as to be capable of abusing their freedom by the promulgation of doctrine or procedure divergent from the current traditions of religion  nor must it be forgotten that sermons like plays are addressed to a mixed audience of families and that the spiritual teachings of a lifetime may be destroyed by ten minutes of uncensored pronouncement from a pulpit the while parents are sitting not as in a theatre vested with the right of protest but dumb and excoriated to the soul watching their children perhaps of tender age eagerly drinking in words at variance with that which they themselves have been at such pains to instil  if a set of censorsfor it would as in the case of literature indubitably require more than one perhaps one hundred and eighty but for reasons already given there should be no difficulty whatever in procuring them endowed with the swift powers conferred by freedom from the dull tedium of responsibility and not remarkable for religious temperament were appointed to whom all sermons and public addresses on religious subjects must be submitted before delivery and whose duty after perusal should be to excise all portions not conformable to their private ideas of what was at the moment suitable to the publics ears we should be far on the road toward that proper preservation of the status quo so desirable if the faiths and ethical standards of the less exuberantly spiritual masses are to be maintained in their full bloom as things now stand the nation has absolutely nothing to safeguard it against religious progress  we have seen then that censorship is at least as necessary over literature art science and religion as it is over our drama  we have now to call attention to the crowning needthe want of a censorship in politics  if censorship be based on justice if it be proved to serve the public and to be successful in its lonely vigil over drama it should and logically must be extended to all parallel cases it cannot it dare not stop short atpolitics  for precisely in this supreme branch of the public life are we most menaced by the rule and license of the leading spirit  to appreciate this fact we need only examine the constitution of the house of commons  six hundred and seventy persons chosen from a population numbering four and forty millions must necessarily whatever their individual defects be citizens of more than average enterprise resource and resolution they are elected for a period that may last five years  many of them are ambitious some uncompromising not a few enthusiastically eager to do something for their country filled with designs and aspirations for national or social betterment with which the masses sunk in the immediate pursuits of life can in the nature of things have little sympathy  and yet we find these men licensed to pour forth at pleasure before mixed audiences checked only by common law and common sense political utterances which may have the gravest the most terrific consequences utterances which may at any moment let loose revolution or plunge the country into war which often as a fact excite an utter detestation terror and mistrust or shock the most sacred domestic and proprietary convictions in the breasts of vast majorities of their fellowcountrymen  and we incur this appalling risk for the want of a single or at the most a handful of censors invested with a simple but limitless discretion to excise or to suppress entirely such political utterances as may seem to their private judgments calculated to cause pain or moral disturbance in the average man  the masses it is true have their protection and remedy against injudicious or inflammatory politicians in the law and the socalled democratic process of election but we have seen that theatre audiences have also the protection of the law and the remedy of boycott and that in their case this protection and this remedy are not deemed enough  what then shall we say of the case of politics where the dangers attending inflammatory or subversive utterance are greater a million fold and the remedy a thousand times less expeditious  our legislators have laid down censorship as the basic principle of justice underlying the civic rights of dramatists  then let censorship for all be their motto and this country no longer be ridden and destroyed by free institutions  let them not only establish forthwith censorships of literature art science and religion but also place themselves beneath the regimen with which they have calmly fettered dramatic authors  they cannot deem it becoming to their regard for justice to their honour to their sense of humour to recoil from a restriction which in a parallel case they have imposed on others  it is an old and homely saying that good officers never place their men in positions they would not themselves be willing to fill  and we are not entitled to believe that our legislators having set dramatic authors where they have been set willnow that their duty is made plainfor a moment hesitate to step down and stand alongside  but if by any chance they should recoil and thus make answer we are ready at all times to submit to the law and the peoples will and to bow to their demands but we cannot and must not be asked to place our calling our duty and our honour beneath the irresponsible rule of an arbitrary autocrat however sympathetic with the generality he may chance to be  then we would ask sirs did you ever hear of that great saying do unto others as ye would they should do unto you  for it is but fair presumption that the dramatists whom our legislators have placed in bondage to a despot are no less than those legislators proud of their calling conscious of their duty and jealous of their honour 1909     vague thoughts on art  it was on a day of rare beauty that i went out into the fields to try and gather these few thoughts  so golden and sweetly hot it was that they came lazily and with a flight no more coherent or responsible than the swoop of the very swallows and as in a play or poem the result is conditioned by the conceiving mood so i knew would be the nature of my diving dipping palethroated forktailed words  but after alli thought sitting therei need not take my critical pronouncements seriously  i have not the firm soul of the critic  it is not my profession to know things for certain and to make others feel that certainty  on the contrary i am often wronga luxury no critic can afford  and so invading as i was the realm of others i advanced with a light pen feeling that none and least of all myself need expect me to be right  what theni thoughtis art  for i perceived that to think about it i must first define it and i almost stopped thinking at all before the fearsome nature of that task  then slowly in my mind gathered this group of words  art is that imaginative expression of human energy which through technical concretion of feeling and perception tends to reconcile the individual with the universal by exciting in him impersonal emotion and the greatest art is that which excites the greatest impersonal emotion in an hypothecated perfect human being  impersonal emotion  and whati thought do i mean by that  surely i mean that is not art which while i am contemplating it inspires me with any active or directive impulse that is art when for however brief a moment it replaces within me interest in myself by interest in itself  for let me suppose myself in the presence of a carved marble bath  if my thoughts be what could i buy that for impulse of acquisition or from what quarry did it come  impulse of inquiry or which would be the right end for my head  mixed impulse of inquiry and acquisitioni am at that moment insensible to it as a work of art  but if i stand before it vibrating at sight of its colour and forms if ever so little and for ever so short a time unhaunted by any definite practical thought or impulseto that extent and for that moment it has stolen me away out of myself and put itself there instead has linked me to the universal by making me forget the individual in me  and for that moment and only while that moment lasts it is to me a work of art  the word impersonal then is but used in this my definition to signify momentary forgetfulness of ones own personality and its active wants  so arti thoughtis that which heard read or looked on while producing no directive impulse warms one with unconscious vibration nor can i imagine any means of defining what is the greatest art without hypothecating a perfect human being  but since we shall never see or know if we do see that desirable creaturedogmatism is banished academy is dead to the discussion deader than even tolstoy left it after his famous treatise what is art  for having destroyed all the old judges and academies tolstoy by saying that the greatest art was that which appealed to the greatest number of living human beings raised up the masses of mankind to be a definite new judge or academy as tyrannical and narrow as ever were those whom he had destroyed  this at all eventsi thought is as far as i dare go in defining what art is  but let me try to make plain to myself what is the essential quality that gives to art the power of exciting this unconscious vibration this impersonal emotion  it has been called beauty  an awkward worda perpetual begging of the question too current in use too ambiguous altogether now too narrow now too widea word in fact too glib to know at all what it means  and how dangerous a wordoften misleading us into slabbing with extraneous floridities what would otherwise on its own plane be art  to be decorative where decoration is not suitable to be lyrical where lyricism is out of place is assuredly to spoil art not to achieve it  but this essential quality of art has also and more happily been called rhythm  and what is rhythm if not that mysterious harmony between part and part and part and whole which gives what is called life that exact proportion the mystery of which is best grasped in observing how life leaves an animate creature when the essential relation of part to whole has been sufficiently disturbed  and i agree that this rhythmic relation of part to part and part to wholein short vitalityis the one quality inseparable from a work of art  for nothing which does not seem to a man possessed of this rhythmic vitality can ever steal him out of himself  and having got thus far in my thoughts i paused watching the swallows for they seemed to me the symbol in their swift sure curvetting all daring and balance and surprise of the delicate poise and motion of art that visits no two men alike in a world where no two things of all the things there be are quite the same  yesi thoughtand this art is the one form of human energy in the whole world which really works for union and destroys the barriers between man and man  it is the continual unconscious replacement however fleeting of oneself by another the real cement of human life the everlasting refreshment and renewal  for what is grievous dompting grim about our lives is that we are shut up within ourselves with an itch to get outside ourselves  and to be stolen away from ourselves by art is a momentary relaxation from that itching a minutes profound and as it were secret enfranchisement the active amusements and relaxations of life can only rest certain of our faculties by indulging others the whole self is never rested save through that unconsciousness of self which comes through rapt contemplation of nature or of art  and suddenly i remembered that some believe that art does not produce unconsciousness of self but rather very vivid selfrealisation  ah buti thoughthat is not the first and instant effect of art the new impetus is the after effect of that momentary replacement of oneself by the self of the work before us it is surely the result of that brief span of enlargement enfranchisement and rest  yes art is the great and universal refreshment  for art is never dogmatic holds no brief for itself you may take it or you may leave it it does not force itself rudely where it is not wanted  it is reverent to all tempers to all points of view  but it is wilfulthe very wind in the comings and goings of its influence an uncapturable fugitive visiting our hearts at vagrant sweet moments since we often stand even before the greatest works of art without being able quite to lose ourselves  that restful oblivion comes we never quite know whenand it is gone  but when it comes it is a spirit hovering with cool wings blessing us from least to greatest according to our powers a spirit deathless and varied as human life itself  and in what sort of agei thoughtare artists living now  are conditions favourable  life is very multiple full of movements facts and news with the limelight terribly turned onand all this is adverse to the artist  yet leisure is abundant the facilities for study great liberty is respectedmore or less  but there is one great reason why in this age of ours art it seems must flourish  for just as crossbreeding in natureif it be not too violentoften gives an extra vitality to the offspring so does crossbreeding of philosophies make for vitality in art  i cannot help thinking that historians looking back from the far future will record this age as the third renaissance  we who are lost in it working or looking on can neither tell what we are doing nor where standing but we cannot help observing that just as in the greek renaissance wornout pagan orthodoxy was penetrated by new philosophy just as in the italian renaissance pagan philosophy reasserting itself fertilised again an already too inbred christian creed so now orthodoxy fertilised by science is producing a fresh and fuller conception of lifea love of perfection not for hope of reward not for fear of punishment but for perfections sake slowly under our feet beneath our consciousness is forming that new philosophy and it is in times of new philosophies that art itself in essence always a discovery must flourish  those whose sacred suns and moons are ever in the past tell us that our art is going to the dogs and it is indeed true that we are in confusion  the waters are broken and every nerve and sinew of the artist is strained to discover his own safety  it is an age of stir and change a season of new wine and old bottles  yet assuredly in spite of breakages and waste a wine worth the drinking is all the time being made  i ceased again to think for the sun had dipped low and the midges were biting me and the sounds of evening had begun those innumerable fartravelling sounds of man and bird and beastso clear and intimateof remote countrysides at sunset  and for long i listened too vague to move my pen  new philosophya vigorous art  are there not all the signs of it  in music sculpture painting in fictionand drama in dancing in criticism itself if criticism be an art  yes we are reaching out to a new faith not yet crystallised to a new art not yet perfected the forms still to findthe flowers still to fashion  and how has it come this slowly growing faith in perfection for perfections sake  surely like this the western world awoke one day to find that it no longer believed corporately and for certain in future life for the individual consciousness  it began to feel i cannot say more than that there may bedeath may be the end of man or death may be nothing  and it began to ask itself in this uncertainty do i then desire to go on living  now since it found that it desired to go on living at least as earnestly as ever it did before it began to inquire why  and slowly it perceived that there was inborn within it a passionate instinct of which it had hardly till then been consciousa sacred instinct to perfect itself now as well as in a possible hereafter to perfect itself because perfection was desirable a vision to be adored and striven for a dream motive fastened within the universe the very essential cause of everything  and it began to see that this perfection cosmically was nothing but perfect equanimity and harmony and in human relations nothing but perfect love and justice and perfection began to glow before the eyes of the western world like a new star whose light touched with glamour all things as they came forth from mystery till to mystery they were ready to return  thisi thought is surely what the western world has dimly been rediscovering  there has crept into our minds once more the feeling that the universe is all of a piece equipoise supreme and all things equally wonderful and mysterious and valuable  we have begun in fact to have a glimmering of the artists creed that nothing may we despise or neglectthat everything is worth the doing well the making fairthat our god perfection is implicit everywhere and the revelation of him the business of our art  and as i jotted down these words i noticed that some real stars had crept up into the sky so gradually darkening above the pollard limetrees cuckoos who had been calling on the thorntrees all the afternoon were silent the swallows no longer flirted past but a bat was already in career over the holly hedge and round me the buttercups were closing the whole form and feeling of the world had changed so that i seemed to have before me a new picture hanging  ah  i thought art must indeed be priest of this new faith in perfection whose motto is harmony proportion balance  for by art alone can true harmony in human affairs be fostered true proportion revealed and true equipoise preserved  is not the training of an artist a training in the due relation of one thing with another and in the faculty of expressing that relation clearly and even more a training in the faculty of disengaging from self the very essence of selfand passing that essence into other selves by so delicate means that none shall see how it is done yet be insensibly unified  is not the artist of all men foe and nullifier of partisanship and parochialism of distortions and extravagance the discoverer of that jackolanterntruth for if truth be not spiritual proportion i know not what it is  truth it seems to meis no absolute thing but always relative the essential symmetry in the varying relationships of life and the most perfect truth is but the concrete expression of the most penetrating vision  life seen throughout as a countless show of the finest works of art life shaped and purged of the irrelevant the gross and the extravagant life as it were spiritually selectedthat is truth a thing as multiple and changing as subtle and strange as life itself and as little to be bound by dogma  truth admits but the one rule no deficiency and no excess  disobedient to that rulenothing attains full vitality  and secretly fettered by that rule is art whose business is the creation of vital things  that aesthete to be sure was right when he said it is style that makes one believe in a thing nothing but style  for what is style in its true and broadest sense save fidelity to idea and mood and perfect balance in the clothing of them  and i thought can one believe in the decadence of art in an age which however unconsciously as yet is beginning to worship that which art worshipsperfectionstyle  the faults of our arts today are the faults of zeal and of adventure the faults and crudities of pioneers the errors and mishaps of the explorer  they must pass through many fevers and many times lose their way but at all events they shall not go dying in their beds and be buried at kensal green  and here and there amid the disasters and wreckage of their voyages of discovery they will find something new some fresh way of embellishing life or of revealing the heart of things that characteristic of todays artthe striving of each branch of art to burst its own boundarieswhich to many spells destruction is surely of happy omen  the novel straining to become the play the play the novel both trying to paint music striving to become story poetry gasping to be music painting panting to be philosophy forms canons rules all melting in the pot stagnation broken up  in all this havoc there is much to shock and jar even the most eager and adventurous  we cannot stand these newfangled fellows  they have no form  they rush in where angels fear to tread  they have lost all the good of the old and given us nothing in its place  and yetonly out of stir and change is born new salvation  to deny that is to deny belief in man to turn our backs on courage  it is well indeed that some should live in closed studies with the paintings and the books of yesterdaysuch devoted students serve art in their own way  but the freshair world will ever want new forms  we shall not get them without faith enough to risk the old  the good will live the bad will die and tomorrow only can tell us which is which  yesi thoughtwe naturally take a too impatient view of the art of our own time since we can neither see the ends toward which it is almost blindly groping nor the few perfected creations that will be left standing amidst the rubble of abortive effort  an age must always decry itself and extol its forbears  the unwritten history of every art will show us that  consider the novelthat most recent form of art  did not the age which followed fielding lament the treachery of authors to the picaresque tradition complaining that they were not as fielding and smollett were  be sure they did  very slowly and in spite of opposition did the novel attain in this country the fulness of that biographical form achieved under thackeray  very slowly and in face of condemnation it has been losing that form in favour of a greater vividness which places before the readers brain not historical statements as it were of motives and of facts but wordpaintings of things and persons so chosen and arranged that the reader may see as if at first hand the spirit of life at work before him  the new novel has as many bemoaners as the old novel had when it was new  it is no question of better or worse but of differing formsof change dictated by gradual suitability to the changing conditions of our social life and to the ever fresh discoveries of craftsmen in the intoxication of which old and equally worthy craftsmanship isby the waytoo often for the moment mislaid the vested interests of life favour the line of least resistancedisliking and revolting against disturbance but one must always remember that a spurious glamour is inclined to gather around what is new  and because of these two deflecting factors those who break through old forms must well expect to be dead before the new forms they have unconsciously created have found their true level high or low in the world of art  when a thing is new how shall it be judged  in the fluster of meeting novelty we have even seen coherence attempting to bind together two personalities so fundamentally opposed as those of ibsen and bernard shaw dramatists with hardly a quality in common no identity of tradition or belief not the faintest resemblance in methods of construction or technique yet contemporary estimate talks of them often in the same breath they are new  it is enough  and others as utterly unlike them both  they too are new  they have as yet no label of their own then put on some one elses  and soi thought it must always be for time is essential to the proper placing and estimate of all art  and is it not this feeling that contemporary judgments are apt to turn out a little ludicrous which has converted much criticism of late from judgment pronounced into impression recordedrecreative statementa kind in fact of expression of the critics self elicited through contemplation of a book a play a symphony a picture  for this kind of criticism there has even recently been claimed an actual identity with creation  esthetic judgment and creative power identical  that is a hard saying  for however sympathetic one may feel toward this new criticism however one may recognise that the recording of impression has a wider more elastic and more lasting value than the delivery of arbitrary judgment based on rigid laws of taste however one may admit that it approaches the creative gift in so far as it demands the qualities of receptivity and reproductionis there not still lacking to this new critic something of that thirsting spirit of discovery which precedes the creationhitherto socalledof anything  criticism taste aesthetic judgment by the very nature of their task wait till life has been focussed by the artists before they attempt to reproduce the image which that imprisoned fragment of life makes on the mirror of their minds  but a thing created springs from a germ unconsciously implanted by the direct impact of unfettered life on the whole range of the creators temperament and round the germ thus engendered the creative artistever penetrating discovering selectinggoes on building cell on cell gathered from a million little fresh impacts and visions  and to say that this is also exactly what the recreative critic does is to say that the interpretative musician is creator in the same sense as is the composer of the music that he interprets  if indeed these processes be the same in kind they are in degree so far apart that one would think the word creative unfortunately used of both  but this speculationi thoughtis going beyond the bounds of vagueness let there be some thread of coherence in your thoughts as there is in the progress of this evening fast fading into night return to the consideration of the nature and purposes of art  and recognize that much of what you have thought will seem on the face of it heresy to the school whose doctrine was incarnated by oscar wilde in that admirable apotheosis of halftruths the decay of the art of lying  for therein he said no great artist ever sees things as they really are  yet that halftruth might also be put thus the seeing of things as they really arethe seeing of a proportion veiled from other eyes together with the power of expression is what makes a man an artist  what makes him a great artist is a high fervour of spirit which produces a superlative instead of a comparative clarity of vision  close to my house there is a group of pines with gnarled red limbs flanked by beechtrees  and there is often a very deep blue sky behind generally that is all i see  but once in a way in those trees against that sky i seem to see all the passionate life and glow that titian painted into his pagan pictures  i have a vision of mysterious meaning of a mysterious relation between that sky and those trees with their gnarled red limbs and life as i know it  and when i have had that vision i always feel this is reality and all those other times when i have no such vision simple unreality  if i were a painter it is for such fervent vision i should wait before moving brush this so intimate inner vision of reality indeed seems in duller moments wellnigh grotesque and hence that other glib halftruth art is greater than life itself  art is indeed greater than life in the sense that the power of art is the disengagement from life of its real spirit and significance  but in any other sense to say that art is greater than life from which it emerges and into which it must remerge can but suspend the artist over life with his feet in the air and his head in the cloudsprig masquerading as demigod  nature is no great mother who has borne us  she is our creation  it is in our brain that she quickens to life  such is the highest hyperbole of the aesthetic creed but what is creative instinct if not an incessant living sympathy with nature a constant craving like that of natures own to fashion something new out of all that comes within the grasp of those faculties with which nature has endowed us  the qualities of vision of fancy and of imaginative power are no more divorced from nature than are the qualities of commonsense and courage  they are rarer that is all  but in truth no one holds such views  not even those who utter them  they are the rhetoric the overstatement of halftruths by such as wish to condemn what they call realism without being temperamentally capable of understanding what realism really is  and whati thoughtis realism  what is the meaning of that word so wildly used  is it descriptive of technique or descriptive of the spirit of the artist or both or neither  was turgenev a realist  no greater poet ever wrote in prose nor any one who more closely brought the actual shapes of men and things before us  no more fervent idealists than ibsen and tolstoy ever lived and none more careful to make their people real  were they realists  no more deeply fantastic writer can i conceive than dostoievsky nor any who has described actual situations more vividly  was he a realist  the late stephen crane was called a realist  than whom no more impressionistic writer ever painted with words  what then is the heart of this term still often used as an expression almost of abuse  to me at all eventsi thoughtthe words realism realistic have no longer reference to technique for which the words naturalism naturalistic serve far better  nor have they to do with the question of imaginative poweras much demanded by realism as by romanticism  for me a realist is by no means tied to naturalistic techniquehe may be poetic idealistic fantastic impressionistic anything butromantic that in so far as he is a realist he cannot be the word in fact characterises that artist whose temperamental preoccupation is with revelation of the actual interrelating spirit of life character and thought with a view to enlighten himself and others as distinguished from that artist whom i call romanticwhose tempera mental purpose is invention of tale or design with a view to delight himself and others  it is a question of temperamental antecedent motive in the artist and nothing more  realistromanticist  enlightenmentdelight  that is the true apposition  to make a revelationto tell a fairytale  and either of these artists may use what form he likesnaturalistic fantastic poetic impressionistic  for it is not by the form but by the purpose and mood of his art that he shall be known as one or as the other realists indeedincluding the half of shakespeare that was realist not being primarily concerned to amuse their audience are still comparatively unpopular in a world made up for the greater part of men of action who instinctively reject all art that does not distract them without causing them to think  for thought makes demands on an energy already in full use thought causes introspection and introspection causes discomfort and disturbs the grooves of action  to say that the object of the realist is to enlighten rather than to delight is not to say that in his art the realist is not amusing himself as much as ever is the teller of a fairytale though he does not deliberately start out to do so he is amusing too a large part of mankind  for admitted that the abject and the test of art is always the awakening of vibration of impersonal emotion it is still usually forgotten that men fall roughly speaking into two flocks those whose intelligence is uninquiring in the face of art and does not demand to be appeased before their emotions can be stirred and those who having a speculative bent of mind must first be satisfied by an enlightening quality in a work of art before that work of art can awaken in them feeling  the audience of the realist is drawn from this latter type of man the much larger audience of the romantic artist from the former together with in both cases those fastidious few for whom all art is style and only style and who welcome either kind so long as it is good enough  to me theni thoughtthis division into realism and romance so understood is the main cleavage in all the arts but it is hard to find pure examples of either kind  for even the most determined realist has more than a streak in him of the romanticist and the most resolute romanticist finds it impossible at times to be quite unreal  guido reni watteau leighton were they not perhaps somewhat pure romanticists rembrandt hogarth manet mainly realists botticelli titian raphael a blend  dumas pere and scott surely romantic flaubert and tolstoy as surely realists dickens and cervantes blended  keats and swinburne romantic browning and whitmanrealistic shakespeare and goethe both the greek dramatistsrealists  the arabian nights and malory romantic the iliad the odyssey and the old testament both realism and romance and if in the vagueness of my thoughts i were to seek for illustration less general and vague to show the essence of this temperamental cleavage in all art i would take the two novelists turgenev and stevenson  for turgenev expressed himself in stories that must be called romances and stevenson employed almost always a naturalistic technique  yet no one would ever call turgenev a romanticist or stevenson a realist  the spirit of the first brooded over life found in it a perpetual voyage of spiritual adventure was set on discovering and making clear to himself and all the varying traits and emotions of human characterthe varying moods of nature and though he couched all this discovery in caskets of engaging story it was always clear as day what mood it was that drove him to dip pen in ink  the spirit of the second i think almost dreaded to discover he felt life i believe too keenly to want to probe into it he spun his gossamer to lure himself and all away from life that was his driving mood but the craftsman in him longing to be clear and poignant made him more natural more actual than most realists  so how thin often is the hedge  and how poor a business the partisan abuse of either kind of art in a world where each sort of mind has full right to its own due expression and grumbling lawful only when due expression is not attained  one may not care for a rembrandt portrait of a plain old woman a graceful watteau decoration may leave another cold but foolish will he be who denies that both are faithful to their conceiving moods and so proportioned part to part and part to whole as to have each in its own way that inherent rhythm or vitality which is the hallmark of art  he is but a poor philosopher who holds a view so narrow as to exclude forms not to his personal taste  no realist can love romantic art so much as he loves his own but when that art fulfils the laws of its peculiar being if he would be no blind partisan he must admit it the romanticist will never be amused by realism but let him not for that reason be so parochial as to think that realism when it achieves vitality is not art  for what is art but the perfected expression of self in contact with the world and whether that self be of enlightening or of fairytelling temperament is of no moment whatsoever  the tossing of abuse from realist to romanticist and back is but the swordplay of two oneeyed men with their blind side turned toward each other  shall not each attempt be judged on its own merits if found not shoddy faked or forced but true to itself true to its conceiving mood and fairproportioned part to whole so that it livesthen realistic or romantic in the name of fairness let it pass of all kinds of human energy art is surely the most free the least parochial and demands of us an essential tolerance of all its forms shall we waste breath and ink in condemnation of artists because their temperaments are not our own  but the shapes and colours of the day were now all blurred every tree and stone entangled in the dusk  how different the world seemed from that in which i had first sat down with the swallows flirting past  and my mood was different for each of those worlds had brought to my heart its proper feelingpainted on my eyes the just picture  and night that was coming would bring me yet another mood that would frame itself with consciousness at its own fair moment and hang before me  a quiet owl stole by in the geld below and vanished into the heart of a tree  and suddenly above the moorline i saw the large moon rising cinnamoncoloured it made all things swim made me uncertain of my thoughts vague with mazy feeling shapes seemed but drifts of moondust and true reality nothing save a sort of still listening to the wind  and for long i sat just watching the moon creep up and hearing the thin dry rustle of the leaves along the holly hedge  and there came to me this thought what is this universethat never had beginning and will never have an endbut a myriad striving to perfect pictures never the same so blending and fading one into another that all form one great perfected picture  and what are weripples on the tides of a birthless deathless equipoised creativepurposebut little works of art  trying to record that thought i noticed that my notebook was damp with dew  the cattle were lying down  it was too dark to see 1911
