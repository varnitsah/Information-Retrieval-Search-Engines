green gables anne of avonlea anne of the island chronicles of avonlea kilmeny of the orchard etc    introduction  it is no exaggeration to say that what longfellow did for acadia miss montgomery has done for prince edward island  more than a million readers young people as well as their parents and uncles and aunts possess in the picturegalleries of their memories the exquisite landscapes of avonlea limned with as poetic a pencil as longfellow wielded when he told the evermoving story of grand pre  only genius of the first water has the ability to conjure up such a character as anne shirley the heroine of miss montgomerys first novel anne of green gables and to surround her with people so distinctive so real so true to psychology  anne is as lovable a child as lives in all fiction  natasha in count tolstois great novel war and peace dances into our ken with something of the same buoyancy and naturalness but into what a commonplace young woman she develops  anne whether as the gay little orphan in her conquest of the master and mistress of green gables or as the maturing and selfforgetful maiden of avonlea keeps up to concertpitch in her charm and her winsomeness  there is nothing in her to disappoint hope or imagination  part of the power of miss montgomeryand the largest partis due to her skill in compounding humor and pathos  the humor is honest and golden it never wearies the reader the pathos is never sentimentalized never degenerates into bathos is never morbid  this combination holds throughout all her works longer or shorter and is particularly manifest in the present collection of fifteen short stories which together with those in the first volume of the chronicles of avonlea present a series of piquant and fascinating pictures of life in prince edward island  the humor is shown not only in the presentation of quaint and unique characters but also in the words which fall from their mouths  aunt cynthia always gave you the impression of a fullrigged ship coming gallantly on before a favorable wind no further description is neededonly one such personage could be found in avonlea  you would recognize her at sight  ismay meades disposition is summed up when we are told that she is good at having presentimentsafter things happen  what cleverer embodiment of innate obstinacy than in isabella spencera wisp of a woman who looked as if a breath would sway her but was so set in her ways that a tornado would hardly have caused her to swerve an inch from her chosen path or than in mrs eben andrews in saras way who looked like a woman whose opinions were always very decided and warranted to wear  this gift of characterization in a few words is lavished also on material objects as for instance what more is needed to describe the forlornness of the home from which anne was rescued than the statement that even the trees around it looked like orphans  the poetic touch too never fails in the right place and is never too frequently introduced in her descriptions  they throw a glamor over that northern land which otherwise you might imagine as rather cold and barren  what charming springs they must have there  one sees all the fruittrees clad in bridal garments of pink and white and what a translucent sky smiles down on the ponds and the reaches of bay and cove  the eastern sky was a great arc of crystal smitten through with auroral crimsonings  she was as slim and lithe as a young whitestemmed birchtree her hair was like a soft dusky cloud and her eyes were as blue as avonlea harbor in a fair twilight when all the sky is abloom over it  sentiment with a humorous touch to it prevails in the first two stories of the present book  the one relates to the disappearance of a valuable white persian cat with a blue spot in its tail  fatima is like the apple of her eye to the rich old aunt who leaves her with two nieces with a stern injunction not to let her out of the house  of course both sue and ismay detest cats ismay hates them sue loathes them but aunt cynthias favor is worth preserving  you become as much interested in fatimas fate as if she were your own pet and the climax is no less unexpected than it is natural especially when it is made also the last act of a pretty comedy of love  miss montgomery delights in depicting the romantic episodes hidden in the hearts of elderly spinsters as for instance in the case of charlotte holmes whose maid nancy would have sent for the doctor and subjected her to a porous plaster while waiting for him had she known that up stairs there was a notebook full of original poems  rather than bear the stigma of never having had a loveaffair this sentimental lady invents one to tell her mocking young friends  the dramatic and unexpected denouement is delightful fun  another notebook reveals a deeper romance in the case of miss emily this is related by anne of green gables who once or twice flashes across the scene though for the most part her friends and neighbors at white sands or newbridge or grafton as well as at avonlea are the persons involved  in one story the last tannis of the flats the secret of elinor blairs spinsterhood is revealed in an episode which carries the reader from avonlea to saskatchewan and shows the unselfish devotion of a halfbreed indian girl  the story is both poignant and dramatic  its one touch of humor is where jerome carey curses his fate in being compelled to live in that desolate land in the picturesque language permissible in the far northwest  selfsacrifice as the real basis of happiness is a favorite theme in miss montgomerys fiction  it is raised to the nth power in the story entitled in her selfless mood where an ugly misshapen girl devotes her life and renounces marriage for the sake of looking after her weak and selfish halfbrother  the same spirit is found in only a common fellow who is haloed with a certain splendor by renouncing the girl he was to marry in favor of his old rival supposed to have been killed in france but happily delivered from that tragic fate  miss montgomery loves to introduce a little child or a baby as a solvent of old feuds or domestic quarrels  in the dream child a foundling boy drifting in through a storm in a dory saves a heartbroken mother from insanity  in janes baby a babycousin brings reconciliation between the two sisters rosetta and carlotta who had not spoken for twenty years because the slacktwisted jacob married the younger of the two  happiness generally lights up the end of her stories however tragic they may set out to be  in the son of his mother thyra is a stern woman as immovable as a stone image  she had only one son whom she worshipped she never wanted a daughter but she pitied and despised all sonless women  she demanded absolute obedience from chesternot only obedience but also utter affection and she hated his dog because the boy loved him she could not share her love even with a dumb brute  when chester falls in love she is relentless toward the beautiful young girl and forces chester to give her up  but a terrible sorrow brings the old woman and the young girl into sympathy and unspeakable joy is born of the trial  happiness also comes to the brother who failed  the monroes had all been successful in the eyes of the world except robert one is a millionaire another a college president another a famous singer  robert overhears the old aunt isabel call him a total failure but at the family dinner one after another stands up and tells how roberts quiet influence and unselfish aid had started them in their brilliant careers and the old aunt wiping the tears from her eyes exclaims i guess theres a kind of failure thats the best success  in one story there is an element of the supernatural when hester the hard older sister comes between margaret and her lover and dying makes her promise never to become hugh blairs wife but she comes back and unites them  in this margaret just like the delightful anne lives up to the dictum that nothing matters in all gods universe except love  the story of the revival at avonlea has also a good moral  there is something in these continued chronicles of avonlea like the delicate art which has made cranford a classic the characters are so homely and homelike and yet tinged with beautiful romance  you feel that you are made familiar with a real town and its real inhabitants you learn to love them and sympathize with them  further chronicles of avonlea is a book to read and to know                                              nathan

xiv only a common fellow    xv tannis of the flats    further chronicles of avonlea    i aunt cynthias persian cat  max always blesses the animal when it is referred to and i dont deny that things have worked together for good after all  but when i think of the anguish of mind which ismay and i underwent on account of that abominable cat it is not a blessing that arises uppermost in my thoughts  i never was fond of cats although i admit they are well enough in their place and i can worry along comfortably with a nice matronly old tabby who can take care of herself and be of some use in the world  as for ismay she hates cats and always did  but aunt cynthia who adored them never could bring herself to understand that any one could possibly dislike them  she firmly believed that ismay and i really liked cats deep down in our hearts but that owing to some perverse twist in our moral natures we would not own up to it but willfully persisted in declaring we didnt  of all cats i loathed that white persian cat of aunt cynthias and indeed as we always suspected and finally proved aunt herself looked upon the creature with more pride than affection she would have taken ten times the comfort in a good common puss that she did in that spoiled beauty  but a persian cat with a recorded pedigree and a market value of one hundred dollars tickled aunt cynthias pride of possession to such an extent that she deluded herself into believing that the animal was really the apple of her eye  it had been presented to her when a kitten by a missionary nephew who had brought it all the way home from persia and for the next three years aunt cynthias household existed to wait on that cat hand and foot  it was snowwhite with a bluishgray spot on the tip of its tail and it was blueeyed and deaf and delicate aunt cynthia was always worrying lest it should take cold and die  ismay and i used to wish that it wouldwe were so tired of hearing about it and its whims  but we did not say so to aunt cynthia  she would probably never have spoken to us again and there was no wisdom in offending aunt cynthia  when you have an unencumbered aunt with a fat bank account it is just as well to keep on good terms with her if you can  besides we really liked aunt cynthia very muchat times  aunt cynthia was one of those rather exasperating people who nag at and find fault with you until you think you are justified in hating them and who then turn round and do something so really nice and kind for you that you feel as if you were compelled to love them dutifully instead  so we listened meekly when she discoursed on fatimathe cats name was fatimaand if it was wicked of us to wish for the latters decease we were well punished for it later on  one day in november aunt cynthia came sailing out to spencervale  she really came in a phaeton drawn by a fat gray pony but somehow aunt cynthia always gave you the impression of a full rigged ship coming gallantly on before a favorable wind  that was a jonah day for us all through  everything had gone wrong  ismay had spilled grease on her velvet coat and the fit of the new blouse i was making was hopelessly askew and the kitchen stove smoked and the bread was sour  moreover huldah jane keyson our tried and trusty old family nurse and cook and general boss had what she called the realagy in her shoulder and though huldah jane is as good an old creature as ever lived when she has the realagy other people who are in the house want to get out of it and if they cant feel about as comfortable as st lawrence on his gridiron  and on top of this came aunt cynthias call and request  dear me said aunt cynthia sniffing dont i smell smoke you girls must manage your range very badly  mine never smokes but it is no more than one might expect when two girls try to keep house without a man about the place  we get along very well without a man about the place i said loftily  max hadnt been in for four whole days and though nobody wanted to see him particularly i couldnt help wondering why  men are nuisances  i dare say you would like to pretend you think so said aunt cynthia aggravatingly  but no woman ever does really think so you know  i imagine that pretty anne shirley who is visiting ella kimball doesnt  i saw her and dr irving out walking this afternoon looking very well satisfied with themselves  if you dillydally much longer sue you will let max slip through your fingers yet  that was a tactful thing to say to me who had refused max irving so often that i had lost count  i was furious and so i smiled most sweetly on my maddening aunt  dear aunt how amusing of you i said smoothly  you talk as if i wanted max  so you do said aunt cynthia  if so why should i have refused him time and again i asked smilingly right well aunt cynthia knew i had  max always told her  goodness alone knows why said aunt cynthia but you may do it once too often and find yourself taken at your word  there is something very fascinating about this anne shirley  indeed there is i assented  she has the loveliest eyes i ever saw  she would be just the wife for max and i hope he will marry her  humph said aunt cynthia  well i wont entice you into telling any more fibs  and i didnt drive out here today in all this wind to talk sense into you concerning max  im going to halifax for two months and i want you to take charge of fatima for me while i am away  fatima i exclaimed  yes  i dont dare to trust her with the servants  mind you always warm her milk before you give it to her and dont on any account let her run out of doors  i looked at ismay and ismay looked at me  we knew we were in for it  to refuse would mortally offend aunt cynthia  besides if i betrayed any unwillingness aunt cynthia would be sure to put it down to grumpiness over what she had said about max and rub it in for years  but i ventured to ask what if anything happens to her while you are away  it is to prevent that im leaving her with you said aunt cynthia  you simply must not let anything happen to her  it will do you good to have a little responsibility  and you will have a chance to find out what an adorable creature fatima really is  well that is all settled  ill send fatima out tomorrow  you can take care of that horrid fatima beast yourself said ismay when the door closed behind aunt cynthia  i wont touch her with a yardstick  you had no business to say wed take her  did i say we would take her i demanded crossly  aunt cynthia took our consent for granted  and you know as well as i do we couldnt have refused  so what is the use of being grouchy  if anything happens to her aunt cynthia will hold us responsible said ismay darkly  do you think anne shirley is really engaged to gilbert blythe i asked curiously  ive heard that she was said ismay absently  does she eat anything but milk  will it do to give her mice  oh i guess so  but do you think max has really fallen in love with her  i dare say  what a relief it will be for you if he has  oh of course i said frostily  anne shirley or anne anybody else is perfectly welcome to max if she wants him  i certainly do not  ismay meade if that stove doesnt stop smoking i shall fly into bits  this is a detestable day  i hate that creature  oh you shouldnt talk like that when you dont even know her protested ismay  every one says anne shirley is lovely  i was talking about fatima i cried in a rage  oh said ismay  ismay is stupid at times  i thought the way she said oh was inexcusably stupid  fatima arrived the next day  max brought her out in a covered basket lined with padded crimson satin  max likes cats and aunt cynthia  he explained how we were to treat fatima and when ismay had gone out of the roomismay always went out of the room when she knew i particularly wanted her to remainhe proposed to me again  of course i said no as usual but i was rather pleased max had been proposing to me about every two months for two years  sometimes as in this case he went three months and then i always wondered why  i concluded that he could not be really interested in anne shirley and i was relieved  i didnt want to marry max but it was pleasant and convenient to have him around and we would miss him dreadfully if any other girl snapped him up  he was so useful and always willing to do anything for usnail a shingle on the roof drive us to town put down carpetsin short a very present help in all our troubles  so i just beamed on him when i said no  max began counting on his fingers  when he got as far as eight he shook his head and began over again  what is it i asked  im trying to count up how many times i have proposed to you he said  but i cant remember whether i asked you to marry me that day we dug up the garden or not  if i did it makes  no you didnt i interrupted  well that makes it eleven said max reflectively  pretty near the limit isnt it  my manly pride will not allow me to propose to the same girl more than twelve times  so the next time will be the last sue darling  oh i said a trifle flatly  i forgot to resent his calling me darling  i wondered if things wouldnt be rather dull when max gave up proposing to me  it was the only excitement i had  but of course it would be bestand he couldnt go on at it forever so by the way of gracefully dismissing the subject i asked him what miss shirley was like  very sweet girl said max  you know i always admired those grayeyed girls with that splendid titian hair  i am dark with brown eyes  just then i detested max  i got up and said i was going to get some milk for fatima  i found ismay in a rage in the kitchen  she had been up in the garret and a mouse had run across her foot  mice always get on ismays nerves  we need a cat badly enough she fumed but not a useless pampered thing like fatima  that garret is literally swarming with mice  youll not catch me going up there again  fatima did not prove such a nuisance as we had feared  huldah jane liked her and ismay in spite of her declaration that she would have nothing to do with her looked after her comfort scrupulously  she even used to get up in the middle of the night and go out to see if fatima was warm  max came in every day and being around gave us good advice  then one day about three weeks after aunt cynthias departure fatima disappearedjust simply disappeared as if she had been dissolved into thin air  we left her one afternoon curled up asleep in her basket by the fire under huldah janes eye while we went out to make a call  when we came home fatima was gone  huldah jane wept and was as one whom the gods had made mad  she vowed that she had never let fatima out of her sight the whole time save once for three minutes when she ran up to the garret for some summer savory  when she came back the kitchen door had blown open and fatima had vanished  ismay and i were frantic  we ran about the garden and through the outhouses and the woods behind the house like wild creatures calling fatima but in vain  then ismay sat down on the front doorsteps and cried  she has got out and shell catch her death of cold and aunt cynthia will never forgive us  im going for max i declared  so i did through the spruce woods and over the field as fast as my feet could carry me thanking my stars that there was a max to go to in such a predicament  max came over and we had another search but without result days passed but we did not find fatima  i would certainly have gone crazy had it not been for max  he was worth his weight in gold during the awful week that followed  we did not dare advertise lest aunt cynthia should see it but we inquired far and wide for a white persian cat with a blue spot on its tail and offered a reward for it but nobody had seen it although people kept coming to the house night and day with every kind of a cat in baskets wanting to know if it was the one we had lost  we shall never see fatima again i said hopelessly to max and ismay one afternoon  i had just turned away an old woman with a big yellow tommy which she insisted must be ourscause it kem to our place mem ayowling fearful mem and it dont belong to nobody not down grafton way mem  im afraid you wont said max  she must have perished from exposure long ere this  aunt cynthia will never forgive us said ismay dismally  i had a presentiment of trouble the moment that cat came to this house  we had never heard of this presentiment before but ismay is good at having presentimentsafter things happen  what shall we do i demanded helplessly  max cant you find some way out of this scrape for us  advertise in the charlottetown papers for a white persian cat suggested max  some one may have one for sale  if so you must buy it and palm it off on your good aunt as fatima  shes very shortsighted so it will be quite possible  but fatima has a blue spot on her tail i said  you must advertise for a cat with a blue spot on its tail said max  it will cost a pretty penny said ismay dolefully  fatima was valued at one hundred dollars  we must take the money we have been saving for our new furs i said sorrowfully  there is no other way out of it  it will cost us a good deal more if we lose aunt cynthias favor  she is quite capable of believing that we have made away with fatima deliberately and with malice aforethought  so we advertised  max went to town and had the notice inserted in the most important daily  we asked any one who had a white persian cat with a blue spot on the tip of its tail to dispose of to communicate with m i care of the enterprise  we really did not have much hope that anything would come of it so we were surprised and delighted over the letter max brought home from town four days later  it was a typewritten screed from halifax stating that the writer had for sale a white persian cat answering to our description  the price was a hundred and ten dollars and if m i cared to go to halifax and inspect the animal it would be found at 110 hollis street by inquiring for persian  temper your joy my friends said ismay gloomily  the cat may not suit  the blue spot may be too big or too small or not in the right place  i consistently refuse to believe that any good thing can come out of this deplorable affair  just at this moment there was a knock at the door and i hurried out  the postmasters boy was there with a telegram  i tore it open glanced at it and dashed back into the room  what is it now cried ismay beholding my face  i held out the telegram  it was from aunt cynthia  she had wired us to send fatima to halifax by express immediately  for the first time max did not seem ready to rush into the breach with a suggestion  it was i who spoke first  max i said imploringly youll see us through this wont you  neither ismay nor i can rush off to halifax at once  you must go tomorrow morning  go right to 110 hollis street and ask for persian  if the cat looks enough like fatima buy it and take it to aunt cynthia  if it doesntbut it must  youll go wont you  that depends said max  i stared at him  this was so unlike max  you are sending me on a nasty errand he said coolly  how do i know that aunt cynthia will be deceived after all even if she be shortsighted  buying a cat in a joke is a huge risk  and if she should see through the scheme i shall be in a pretty mess  oh max i said on the verge of tears  of course said max looking meditatively into the fire if i were really one of the family or had any reasonable prospect of being so i would not mind so much  it would be all in the days work then  but as it is  ismay got up and went out of the room  oh max please i said  will you marry me sue demanded max sternly  if you will agree ill go to halifax and beard the lion in his den unflinchingly  if necessary i will take a black street cat to aunt cynthia and swear that it is fatima  ill get you out of the scrape if i have to prove that you never had fatima that she is safe in your possession at the present time and that there never was such an animal as fatima anyhow  ill do anything say anythingbut it must be for my future wife  will nothing else content you i said helplessly  nothing  i thought hard  of course max was acting abominablybutbut he was really a dear fellowand this was the twelfth timeand there was anne shirley  i knew in my secret soul that life would be a dreadfully dismal thing if max were not around somewhere besides i would have married him long ago had not aunt cynthia thrown us so pointedly at each others heads ever since he came to spencervale  very well i said crossly  max left for halifax in the morning  next day we got a wire saying it was all right  the evening of the following day he was back in spencervale  ismay and i put him in a chair and glared at him impatiently  max began to laugh and laughed until he turned blue  i am glad it is so amusing said ismay severely  if sue and i could see the joke it might be more so  dear little girls have patience with me implored max  if you knew what it cost me to keep a straight face in halifax you would forgive me for breaking out now  we forgive youbut for pitys sake tell us all about it i cried  well as soon as i arrived in halifax i hurried to 110 hollis street butsee here  didnt you tell me your aunts address was 10 pleasant street  so it is  t isnt  you look at the address on a telegram next time you get one  she went a week ago to visit another friend who lives at 110 hollis  max  its a fact  i rang the bell and was just going to ask the maid for persian when your aunt cynthia herself came through the hall and pounced on me  max she said have you brought fatima  no i answered trying to adjust my wits to this new development as she towed me into the library  no iijust came to halifax on a little matter of business  dear me said aunt cynthia crossly i dont know what those girls mean  i wired them to send fatima at once  and she has not come yet and i am expecting a call every minute from some one who wants to buy her  oh i murmured mining deeper every minute  yes went on your aunt there is an advertisement in the charlottetown enterprise for a persian cat and i answered it fatima is really quite a charge you knowand so apt to die and be a dead lossdid your aunt mean a pun girlsand so although i am considerably attached to her i have decided to part with her  by this time i had got my second wind and i promptly decided that a judicious mixture of the truth was the thing required  well of all the curious coincidences i exclaimed  why miss ridley it was i who advertised for a persian caton sues behalf  she and ismay have decided that they want a cat like fatima for themselves  you should have seen how she beamed  she said she knew you always really liked cats only you would never own up to it  we clinched the dicker then and there  i passed her over your hundred and ten dollarsshe took the money without turning a hairand now you are the joint owners of fatima  good luck to your bargain  mean old thing sniffed ismay  she meant aunt cynthia and remembering our shabby furs i didnt disagree with her  but there is no fatima i said dubiously  how shall we account for her when aunt cynthia comes home  well your aunt isnt coming home for a month yet  when she comes you will have to tell her that the catis lostbut you neednt say when it happened  as for the rest fatima is your property now so aunt cynthia cant grumble  but she will have a poorer opinion than ever of your fitness to run a house alone  when max left i went to the window to watch him down the path he was really a handsome fellow and i was proud of him  at the gate he turned to wave me goodby and as he did he glanced upward  even at that distance i saw the look of amazement on his face  then he came bolting back  ismay the house is on fire i shrieked as i flew to the door  sue cried max i saw fatima or her ghost at the garret window a moment ago  nonsense i cried  but ismay was already half way up the stairs and we followed  straight to the garret we rushed  there sat fatima sleek and complacent sunning herself in the window  max laughed until the rafters rang  she cant have been up here all this time i protested half tearfully  we would have heard her meowing  but you didnt said max  she would have died of the cold declared ismay  but she hasnt said max  or starved i cried  the place is alive with mice said max  no girls there is no doubt the cat has been here the whole fortnight  she must have followed huldah jane up here unobserved that day  its a wonder you didnt hear her cryingif she did cry  but perhaps she didnt and of course you sleep downstairs  to think you never thought of looking here for her  it has cost us over a hundred dollars said ismay with a malevolent glance at the sleek fatima  it has cost me more than that i said as i turned to the stairway  max held me back for an instant while ismay and fatima pattered down  do you think it has cost too much sue he whispered  i looked at him sideways  he was really a dear niceness fairly exhaled from him  nooo i said but when we are married you will have to take care of fatima i wont  dear fatima said max gratefully    ii the materalizing of cecil  it had never worried me in the least that i wasnt married although everybody in avonlea pitied old maids but it did worry me and i frankly confess it that i had never had a chance to be  even nancy my old nurse and servant knew that and pitied me for it  nancy is an old maid herself but she has had two proposals  she did not accept either of them because one was a widower with seven children and the other a very shiftless goodfornothing fellow but if anybody twitted nancy on her single condition she could point triumphantly to those two as evidence that she could an she would  if i had not lived all my life in avonlea i might have had the benefit of the doubt but i had and everybody knew everything about meor thought they did  i had really often wondered why nobody had ever fallen in love with me  i was not at all homely indeed years ago george adoniram maybrick had written a poem addressed to me in which he praised my beauty quite extravagantly that didnt mean anything because george adoniram wrote poetry to all the goodlooking girls and never went with anybody but flora king who was crosseyed and redhaired but it proves that it was not my appearance that put me out of the running  neither was it the fact that i wrote poetry myselfalthough not of george adonirams kindbecause nobody ever knew that  when i felt it coming on i shut myself up in my room and wrote it out in a little blank book i kept locked up  it is nearly full now because i have been writing poetry all my life  it is the only thing i have ever been able to keep a secret from nancy  nancy in any case has not a very high opinion of my ability to take care of myself but i tremble to imagine what she would think if she ever found out about that little book  i am convinced she would send for the doctor posthaste and insist on mustard plasters while waiting for him  nevertheless i kept on at it and what with my flowers and my cats and my magazines and my little book i was really very happy and contented  but it did sting that adella gilbert across the road who has a drunken husband should pity poor charlotte because nobody had ever wanted her  poor charlotte indeed  if i had thrown myself at a mans head the way adella gilbert did at but there there i must refrain from such thoughts  i must not be uncharitable  the sewing circle met at mary gillespies on my fortieth birthday  i have given up talking about my birthdays although that little scheme is not much good in avonlea where everybody knows your ageor if they make a mistake it is never on the side of youth  but nancy who grew accustomed to celebrating my birthdays when i was a little girl never gets over the habit and i dont try to cure her because after all its nice to have some one make a fuss over you  she brought me up my breakfast before i got up out of beda concession to my laziness that nancy would scorn to make on any other day of the year  she had cooked everything i like best and had decorated the tray with roses from the garden and ferns from the woods behind the house  i enjoyed every bit of that breakfast and then i got up and dressed putting on my second best muslin gown  i would have put on my really best if i had not had the fear of nancy before my eyes but i knew she would never condone that even on a birthday  i watered my flowers and fed my cats and then i locked myself up and wrote a poem on june  i had given up writing birthday odes after i was thirty  in the afternoon i went to the sewing circle  when i was ready for it i looked in my glass and wondered if i could really be forty  i was quite sure i didnt look it  my hair was brown and wavy my cheeks were pink and the lines could hardly be seen at all though possibly that was because of the dim light  i always have my mirror hung in the darkest corner of my room  nancy cannot imagine why  i know the lines are there of course but when they dont show very plain i forget that they are there  we had a large sewing circle young and old alike attending  i really cannot say i ever enjoyed the meetingsat least not up to that timealthough i went religiously because i thought it my duty to go  the married women talked so much of their husbands and children and of course i had to be quiet on those topics and the young girls talked in corner groups about their beaux and stopped it when i joined them as if they felt sure that an old maid who had never had a beau couldnt understand at all  as for the other old maids they talked gossip about every one and i did not like that either  i knew the minute my back was turned they would fasten into me and hint that i used hairdye and declare it was perfectly ridiculous for a woman of fifty to wear a pink muslin dress with lacetrimmed frills  there was a full attendance that day for we were getting ready for a sale of fancy work in aid of parsonage repairs  the young girls were merrier and noisier than usual  wilhelmina mercer was there and she kept them going  the mercers were quite new to avonlea having come here only two months previously  i was sitting by the window and wilhelmina mercer maggie henderson susette cross and georgie hall were in a little group just before me  i wasnt listening to their chatter at all but presently georgie exclaimed teasingly  miss charlotte is laughing at us  i suppose she thinks we are awfully silly to be talking about beaux  the truth was that i was simply smiling over some very pretty thoughts that had come to me about the roses which were climbing over mary gillespies sill  i meant to inscribe them in the little blank book when i went home  georgies speech brought me back to harsh realities with a jolt  it hurt me as such speeches always did  didnt you ever have a beau miss holmes said wilhelmina laughingly  just as it happened a silence had fallen over the room for a moment and everybody in it heard wilhelminas question  i really do not know what got into me and possessed me  i have never been able to account for what i said and did because i am naturally a truthful person and hate all deceit  it seemed to me that i simply could not say no to wilhelmina before that whole roomful of women  it was too humiliating  i suppose all the prickles and stings and slurs i had endured for fifteen years on account of never having had a lover had what the new doctor calls a cumulative effect and came to a head then and there  yes i had one once my dear i said calmly  for once in my life i made a sensation  every woman in that room stopped sewing and stared at me  most of them i saw didnt believe me but wilhelmina did  her pretty face lighted up with interest  oh wont you tell us about him miss holmes she coaxed and why didnt you marry him  that is right miss mercer said josephine cameron with a nasty little laugh  make her tell  were all interested  its news to us that charlotte ever had a beau  if josephine had not said that i might not have gone on  but she did say it and moreover i caught mary gillespie and adella gilbert exchanging significant smiles  that settled it and made me quite reckless  in for a penny in for a pound thought i and i said with a pensive smile  nobody here knew anything about him and it was all long long ago  what was his name asked wilhelmina  cecil fenwick i answered promptly  cecil had always been my favorite name for a man it figured quite frequently in the blank book  as for the fenwick part of it i had a bit of newspaper in my hand measuring a hem with try fenwicks porous plasters printed across it and i simply joined the two in sudden and irrevocable matrimony  where did you meet him asked georgie  i hastily reviewed my past  there was only one place to locate cecil fenwick  the only time i had ever been far enough away from avonlea in my life was when i was eighteen and had gone to visit an aunt in new brunswick  in blakely new brunswick i said almost believing that i had when i saw how they all took it in unsuspectingly  i was just eighteen and he was twentythree  what did he look like susette wanted to know  oh he was very handsome  i proceeded glibly to sketch my ideal  to tell the dreadful truth i was enjoying myself i could see respect dawning in those girls eyes and i knew that i had forever thrown off my reproach  henceforth i should be a woman with a romantic past faithful to the one love of her lifea very very different thing from an old maid who had never had a lover  he was tall and dark with lovely curly black hair and brilliant piercing eyes  he had a splendid chin and a fine nose and the most fascinating smile  what was he asked maggie  a young lawyer i said my choice of profession decided by an enlarged crayon portrait of mary gillespies deceased brother on an easel before me  he had been a lawyer  why didnt you marry him demanded susette  we quarreled i answered sadly  a terribly bitter quarrel oh we were both so young and so foolish  it was my fault  i vexed cecil by flirting with another manwasnt i coming on and he was jealous and angry  he went out west and never came back  i have never seen him since and i do not even know if he is alive  butbuti could never care for any other man  oh how interesting sighed wilhelmina  i do so love sad love stories  but perhaps he will come back some day yet miss holmes  oh no never now i said shaking my head  he has forgotten all about me i dare say  or if he hasnt he has never forgiven me  mary gillespies susan jane announced tea at this moment and i was thankful for my imagination was giving out and i didnt know what question those girls would ask next  but i felt already a change in the mental atmosphere surrounding me and all through supper i was thrilled with a secret exultation repentant  ashamed  not a bit of it  id have done the same thing over again and all i felt sorry for was that i hadnt done it long ago  when i got home that night nancy looked at me wonderingly and said  you look like a girl tonight miss charlotte  i feel like one i said laughing and i ran to my room and did what i had never done beforewrote a second poem in the same day  i had to have some outlet for my feelings  i called it in summer days of long ago and i worked mary gillespies roses and cecil fenwicks eyes into it and made it so sad and reminiscent and minormusicky that i felt perfectly happy  for the next two months all went well and merrily  nobody ever said anything more to me about cecil fenwick but the girls all chattered freely to me of their little love affairs and i became a sort of general confidant for them  it just warmed up the cockles of my heart and i began to enjoy the sewing circle famously  i got a lot of pretty new dresses and the dearest hat and i went everywhere i was asked and had a good time  but there is one thing you can be perfectly sure of  if you do wrong you are going to be punished for it sometime somehow and somewhere  my punishment was delayed for two months and then it descended on my head and i was crushed to the very dust  another new family besides the mercers had come to avonlea in the springthe maxwells  there were just mr and mrs maxwell they were a middleaged couple and very well off  mr maxwell had bought the lumber mills and they lived up at the old spencer place which had always been the place of avonlea  they lived quietly and mrs maxwell hardly ever went anywhere because she was delicate  she was out when i called and i was out when she returned my call so that i had never met her  it was the sewing circle day againat sarah gardiners this time  i was late everybody else was there when i arrived and the minute i entered the room i knew something had happened although i couldnt imagine what  everybody looked at me in the strangest way  of course wilhelmina mercer was the first to set her tongue going  oh miss holmes have you seen him yet she exclaimed  seen whom i said nonexcitedly getting out my thimble and patterns  why cecil fenwick  hes herein avonleavisiting his sister mrs maxwell  i suppose i did what they expected me to do  i dropped everything i held and josephine cameron said afterwards that charlotte holmes would never be paler when she was in her coffin if they had just known why i turned so pale  its impossible i said blankly  its really true said wilhelmina delighted at this development as she supposed it of my romance  i was up to see mrs maxwell last night and i met him  itcant bethe samececil fenwick i said faintly because i had to say something  oh yes it is  he belongs in blakely new brunswick and hes a lawyer and hes been out west twentytwo years  hes oh so handsome and just as you described him except that his hair is quite gray  he has never marriedi asked mrs maxwellso you see he has never forgotten you miss holmes  and oh i believe everything is going to come out all right  i couldnt exactly share her cheerful belief  everything seemed to me to be coming out most horribly wrong  i was so mixed up i didnt know what to do or say  i felt as if i were in a bad dreamit must be a dreamthere couldnt really be a cecil fenwick  my feelings were simply indescribable  fortunately every one put my agitation down to quite a different cause and they very kindly left me alone to recover myself  i shall never forget that awful afternoon  right after tea i excused myself and went home as fast as i could go  there i shut myself up in my room but not to write poetry in my blank book  no indeed i felt in no poetical mood  i tried to look the facts squarely in the face  there was a cecil fenwick extraordinary as the coincidence was and he was here in avonlea  all my friendsand foesbelieved that he was the estranged lover of my youth  if he stayed long in avonlea one of two things was bound to happen  he would hear the story i had told about him and deny it and i would be held up to shame and derision for the rest of my natural life or else he would simply go away in ignorance and everybody would suppose he had forgotten me and would pity me maddeningly  the latter possibility was bad enough but it wasnt to be compared to the former and oh how i prayedyes i did pray about itthat he would go right away  but providence had other views for me  cecil fenwick didnt go away  he stayed right on in avonlea and the maxwells blossomed out socially in his honor and tried to give him a good time  mrs maxwell gave a party for him  i got a cardbut you may be very sure i didnt go although nancy thought i was crazy not to  then every one else gave parties in honor of mr fenwick and i was invited and never went wilhelmina mercer came and pleaded and scolded and told me if i avoided mr fenwick like that he would think i still cherished bitterness against him and he wouldnt make any advances towards a reconciliation  wilhelmina means well but she hasnt a great deal of sense  cecil fenwick seemed to be a great favorite with everybody young and old  he was very rich too and wilhelmina declared that half the girls were after him  if it wasnt for you miss holmes i believe id have a try for him myself in spite of his gray hair and quick temperfor mrs maxwell says he has a pretty quick temper but its all over in a minute said wilhelmina half in jest and wholly in earnest  as for me i gave up going out at all even to church  i fretted and pined and lost my appetite and never wrote a line in my blank book  nancy was half frantic and insisted on dosing me with her favorite patent pills  i took them meekly because it is a waste of time and energy to oppose nancy but of course they didnt do me any good  my trouble was too deepseated for pills to cure  if ever a woman was punished for telling a lie i was that woman  i stopped my subscription to the weekly advocate because it still carried that wretched porous plaster advertisement and i couldnt bear to see it  if it hadnt been for that i would never have thought of fenwick for a name and all this trouble would have been averted  one evening when i was moping in my room nancy came up  theres a gentleman in the parlor asking for you miss charlotte  my heart gave just one horrible bounce  whatsort of a gentleman nancy i faltered  i think its that fenwick man that theres been such a time about said nancy who didnt know anything about my imaginary escapades and he looks to be mad clean through about something for such a scowl i never seen  tell him ill be down directly nancy i said quite calmly  as soon as nancy had clumped downstairs again i put on my lace fichu and put two hankies in my belt for i thought id probably need more than one  then i hunted up an old advocate for proof and down i went to the parlor  i know exactly how a criminal feels going to execution and ive been opposed to capital punishment ever since  i opened the parlor door and went in carefully closing it behind me for nancy has a deplorable habit of listening in the hall then my legs gave out completely and i couldnt have walked another step to save my life  i just stood there my hand on the knob trembling like a leaf  a man was standing by the south window looking out he wheeled around as i went in and as nancy said he had a scowl on and looked angry clear through  he was very handsome and his gray hair gave him such a distinguished look  i recalled this afterward but just at the moment you may be quite sure i wasnt thinking about it at all  then all at once a strange thing happened  the scowl went right off his face and the anger out of his eyes  he looked astonished and then foolish  i saw the color creeping up into his cheeks  as for me i still stood there staring at him not able to say a single word  miss holmes i presume he said at last in a deep thrilling voice  iioh confound it  i have calledi heard some foolish stories and i came here in a rage  ive been a fooli know now they werent true  just excuse me and ill go away and kick myself  no i said finding my voice with a gasp you mustnt go until youve heard the truth  its dreadful enough but not as dreadful as you might otherwise think  thosethose storiesi have a confession to make  i did tell them but i didnt know there was such a person as cecil fenwick in existence  he looked puzzled as well he might  then he smiled took my hand and led me away from the doorto the knob of which i was still holding with all my mightto the sofa  lets sit down and talk it over comfy he said  i just confessed the whole shameful business  it was terribly humiliating but it served me right  i told him how people were always twitting me for never having had a beau and how i had told them i had and then i showed him the porous plaster advertisement  he heard me right through without a word and then he threw back his big curly gray head and laughed  this clears up a great many mysterious hints ive been receiving ever since i came to avonlea he said and finally a mrs gilbert came to my sister this afternoon with a long farrago of nonsense about the love affair i had once had with some charlotte holmes here  she declared you had told her about it yourself  i confess i flamed up  im a peppery chap and i thoughti thoughtoh confound it it might as well out i thought you were some lank old maid who was amusing herself telling ridiculous stories about me  when you came into the room i knew that whoever was to blame you were not  but i was i said ruefully  it wasnt right of me to tell such a storyand it was very silly too  but who would ever have supposed that there could be real cecil fenwick who had lived in blakely  i never heard of such a coincidence  its more than a coincidence said mr fenwick decidedly its predestination that is what it is  and now lets forget it and talk of something else  we talked of something elseor at least mr fenwick did for i was too ashamed to say muchso long that nancy got restive and clumped through the hall every five minutes but mr fenwick never took the hint  when he finally went away he asked if he might come again  its time we made up that old quarrel you know he said laughing  and i an old maid of forty caught myself blushing like a girl but i felt like a girl for it was such a relief to have that explanation all over  i couldnt even feel angry with adella gilbert  she was always a mischief maker and when a woman is born that way she is more to be pitied than blamed  i wrote a poem in the blank book before i went to sleep i hadnt written anything for a month and it was lovely to be at it once more  mr fenwick did come againthe very next evening but one  and he came so often after that that even nancy got resigned to him one day i had to tell her something  i shrank from doing it for i feared it would make her feel badly  oh ive been expecting to hear it she said grimly  i felt the minute that man came into the house he brought trouble with him  well miss charlotte i wish you happiness  i dont know how the climate of california will agree with me but i suppose ill have to put up with it  but nancy i said i cant expect you to go away out there with me  its too much to ask of you  and where else would i be going demanded nancy in genuine astonishment  how under the canopy could you keep house without me  im not going to trust you to the mercies of a yellow chinee with a pigtail  where you go i go miss charlotte and theres an end of it  i was very glad for i hated to think of parting with nancy even to go with cecil  as for the blank book i havent told my husband about it yet but i mean to some day  and ive subscribed for the weekly advocate again    iii her fathers daughter  we must invite your aunt jane of course said mrs spencer  rachel made a protesting movement with her large white shapely handshands which were so different from the thin dark twisted ones folded on the table opposite her  the difference was not caused by hard work or the lack of it rachel had worked hard all her life  it was a difference inherent in temperament  the spencers no matter what they did or how hard they labored all had plump smooth white hands with firm supple fingers the chiswicks even those who toiled not neither did they spin had hard knotted twisted ones  moreover the contrast went deeper than externals and twined itself with the innermost fibers of life and thought and action  i dont see why we must invite aunt jane said rachel with as much impatience as her soft throaty voice could express  aunt jane doesnt like me and i dont like aunt jane  im sure i dont see why you dont like her said mrs spencer its ungrateful of you  she has always been very kind to you  she has always been very kind with one hand smiled rachel  i remember the first time i ever saw aunt jane  i was six years old  she held out to me a small velvet pincushion with beads on it  and then because i did not in my shyness thank her quite as promptly as i should have done she rapped my head with her bethimbled finger to teach me better manners  it hurt horriblyive always had a tender head  and that has been aunt janes way ever since  when i grew too big for the thimble treatment she used her tongue insteadand that hurt worse  and you know mother how she used to talk about my engagement  she is able to spoil the whole atmosphere if she happens to come in a bad humor  i dont want her  she must be invited  people would talk so if she wasnt  i dont see why they should  shes only my greataunt by marriage  i wouldnt mind in the least if people did talk theyll talk anywayyou know that mother  oh we must have her said mrs spencer with the indifferent finality that marked all her words and decisionsa finality against which it was seldom of any avail to struggle  people who knew rarely attempted it strangers occasionally did misled by the deceit of appearances  isabella spencer was a wisp of a woman with a pale pretty face uncertainlycolored longlashed grayish eyes and great masses of dull soft silky brown hair  she had delicate aquiline features and a small babyish red mouth  she looked as if a breath would sway her  the truth was that a tornado would hardly have caused her to swerve an inch from her chosen path  for a moment rachel looked rebellious then she yielded as she generally did in all differences of opinion with her mother  it was not worth while to quarrel over the comparatively unimportant matter of aunt janes invitation  a quarrel might be inevitable later on rachel wanted to save all her resources for that  she gave her shoulders a shrug and wrote aunt janes name down on the wedding list in her large somewhat untidy handwritinga handwriting which always seemed to irritate her mother  rachel never could understand this irritation  she could never guess that it was because her writing looked so much like that in a certain packet of faded letters which mrs spencer kept at the bottom of an old horsehair trunk in her bedroom  they were postmarked from seaports all over the world  mrs spencer never read them or looked at them but she remembered every dash and curve of the handwriting  isabella spencer had overcome many things in her life by the sheer force and persistency of her will  but she could not get the better of heredity  rachel was her fathers daughter at all points and isabella spencer escaped hating her for it only by loving her the more fiercely because of it  even so there were many times when she had to avert her eyes from rachels face because of the pang of the more subtle remembrances and never since her child was born could isabella spencer bear to gaze on that childs face in sleep  rachel was to be married to frank bell in a fortnights time mrs spencer was pleased with the match  she was very fond of frank and his farm was so near to her own that she would not lose rachel altogether  rachel fondly believed that her mother would not lose her at all but isabella spencer wiser by olden experience knew what her daughters marriage must mean to her and steeled her heart to bear it with what fortitude she might  they were in the sittingroom deciding on the wedding guests and other details  the september sunshine was coming in through the waving boughs of the apple tree that grew close up to the low window  the glints wavered over rachels face as white as a wood lily with only a faint dream of rose in the cheeks  she wore her sleek golden hair in a quaint arch around it  her forehead was very broad and white  she was fresh and young and hopeful  the mothers heart contracted in a spasm of pain as she looked at her  how like the girl was tototo the spencers those easy curving outlines those large mirthful blue eyes that finely molded chin isabella spencer shut her lips firmly and crushed down some unbidden unwelcome memories  there will be about sixty guests all told she said as if she were thinking of nothing else  we must move the furniture out of this room and set the suppertable here  the diningroom is too small  we must borrow mrs bells forks and spoons  she offered to lend them  id never have been willing to ask her the damask table cloths with the ribbon pattern must be bleached tomorrow  nobody else in avonlea has such tablecloths  and well put the little diningroom table on the hall landing upstairs for the presents  rachel was not thinking about the presents or the housewifely details of the wedding  her breath was coming quicker and the faint blush on her smooth cheeks had deepened to crimson  she knew that a critical moment was approaching  with a steady hand she wrote the last name on her list and drew a line under it  well have you finished asked her mother impatiently  hand it here and let me look over it to make sure that you havent left anybody out that should be in  rachel passed the paper across the table in silence  the room seemed to her to have grown very still  she could hear the flies buzzing on the panes the soft purr of the wind about the low eaves and through the apple boughs the jerky beating of her own heart  she felt frightened and nervous but resolute  mrs spencer glanced down the list murmuring the names aloud and nodding approval at each but when she came to the last name she did not utter it  she cast a black glance at rachel and a spark leaped up in the depths of the pale eyes  on her face were anger amazement incredulity the last predominating  the final name on the list of wedding guests was the name of david spencer  david spencer lived alone in a little cottage down at the cove  he was a combination of sailor and fisherman he was also isabella spencers husband and rachels father  rachel spencer have you taken leave of your senses  what do you mean by such nonsense as this  i simply mean that i am going to invite my father to my wedding answered rachel quietly  not in my house cried mrs spencer her lips as white as if her fiery tone had scathed them  rachel leaned forward folded her large capable hands deliberately on the table and gazed unflinchingly into her mothers bitter face  her fright and nervousness were gone  now that the conflict was actually on she found herself rather enjoying it  she wondered a little at herself and thought that she must be wicked  she was not given to selfanalysis or she might have concluded that it was the sudden assertion of her own personality so long dominated by her mothers which she was finding so agreeable  then there will be no wedding mother she said  frank and i will simply go to the manse be married and go home  if i cannot invite my father to see me married no one else shall be invited  her lips narrowed tightly  for the first time in her life isabella spencer saw a reflection of herself looking back at her from her daughters facea strange indefinable resemblance that was more of soul and spirit than of flesh and blood  in spite of her anger her heart thrilled to it  as never before she realized that this girl was her own and her husbands child a living bond between them wherein their conflicting natures mingled and were reconciled  she realized too that rachel so long sweetly meek and obedient meant to have her own way in this caseand would have it  i must say that i cant see why you are so set on having your father see you married she said with a bitter sneer  he has never remembered that he is your father  he cares nothing about younever did care  rachel took no notice of this taunt  it had no power to hurt her its venom being neutralized by a secret knowledge of her own in which her mother had no share  either i shall invite my father to my wedding or i shall not have a wedding she repeated steadily adopting her mothers own effective tactics of repetition undistracted by argument  invite him then snapped mrs spencer with the ungraceful anger of a woman long accustomed to having her own way compelled for once to yield  itll be like chips in porridge anyhowneither good nor harm  he wont come  rachel made no response  now that the battle was over and the victory won she found herself tremulously on the verge of tears she rose quickly and went upstairs to her own room a dim little place shadowed by the white birches growing thickly outsidea virginal room where everything bespoke the maiden  she lay down on the blue and white patchwork quilt on her bed and cried softly and bitterly  her heart at this crisis in her life yearned for her father who was almost a stranger to her  she knew that her mother had probably spoken the truth when she said that he would not come rachel felt that her marriage vows would be lacking in some indefinable sacredness if her father were not by to hear them spoken  twentyfive years before this david spencer and isabella chiswick had been married  spiteful people said there could be no doubt that isabella had married david for love since he had neither lands nor money to tempt her into a match of bargain and sale  david was a handsome fellow with the blood of a seafaring race in his veins  he had been a sailor like his father and grandfather before him but when he married isabella she induced him to give up the sea and settle down with her on a snug farm her father had left her isabella liked farming and loved her fertile acres and opulent orchards  she abhorred the sea and all that pertained to it less from any dread of its dangers than from an inbred conviction that sailors were low in the social scalea species of necessary vagabonds  in her eyes there was a taint of disgrace in such a calling  david must be transformed into a respectable homeabiding tiller of broad lands  for five years all went well enough  if at times davids longing for the sea troubled him he stifled it and listened not to its luring voice  he and isabella were very happy the only drawback to their happiness lay in the regretted fact that they were childless  then in the sixth year came a crisis and a change  captain barrett an old crony of davids wanted him to go with him on a voyage as mate  at the suggestion all davids longrepressed craving for the wide blue wastes of the ocean and the wind whistling through the spars with the salt foam in its breath broke forth with a passion all the more intense for that very repression  he must go on that voyage with james barretthe must  that over he would be contented again but go he must his soul struggled within him like a fettered thing  isabella opposed the scheme vehemently and unwisely with mordant sarcasm and unjust reproaches  the latent obstinacy of davids character came to the support of his longinga longing which isabella with five generations of landloving ancestry behind her could not understand at all  he was determined to go and he told isabella so  im sick of plowing and milking cows he said hotly  you mean that you are sick of a respectable life sneered isabella  perhaps said david with a contemptuous shrug of his shoulders  anyway im going  if you go on this voyage david spencer you need never come back here said isabella resolutely  david had gone he did not believe that she meant it  isabella believed that he did not care whether she meant it or not  david spencer left behind him a woman calm outwardly inwardly a seething volcano of anger wounded pride and thwarted will  he found precisely the same woman when he came home tanned joyous tamed for a while of his wanderlust ready with something of real affection to go back to the farm fields and the stockyard  isabella met him at the door smileless coldeyed setlipped  what do you want here she said in the tone she was accustomed to use to tramps and syrian peddlers  want davids surprise left him at a loss for words  want why iiwant my wife  ive come home  this is not your home  im no wife of yours  you made your choice when you went away isabella had replied  then she had gone in shut the door and locked it in his face  david had stood there for a few minutes like a man stunned  then he had turned and walked away up the lane under the birches  he said nothingthen or at any other time  from that day no reference to his wife or her concerns ever crossed his lips  he went directly to the harbor and shipped with captain barrett for another voyage  when he came back from that in a months time he bought a small house and had it hauled to the cove a lonely inlet from which no other human habitation was visible between his sea voyages he lived there the life of a recluse fishing and playing his violin were his only employments  he went nowhere and encouraged no visitors  isabella spencer also had adopted the tactics of silence  when the scandalized chiswicks aunt jane at their head tried to patch up the matter with argument and entreaty isabella met them stonily seeming not to hear what they said and making no response  she worsted them totally  as aunt jane said in disgust what can you do with a woman who wont even talk  five months after david spencer had been turned from his wifes door rachel was born  perhaps if david had come to them then with due penitence and humility isabellas heart softened by the pain and joy of her long and ardently desired motherhood might have cast out the rankling venom of resentment that had poisoned it and taken him back into it  but david had not come he gave no sign of knowing or caring that his once longedfor child had been born  when isabella was able to be about again her pale face was harder than ever and had there been about her any one discerning enough to notice it there was a subtle change in her bearing and manner  a certain nervous expectancy a fluttering restlessness was gone  isabella had ceased to hope secretly that her husband would yet come back  she had in her secret soul thought he would and she had meant to forgive him when she had humbled him sufficiently and when he had abased himself as she considered he should  but now she knew that he did not mean to sue for her forgiveness and the hate that sprang out of her old love was a rank and speedy and persistent growth  rachel from her earliest recollection had been vaguely conscious of a difference between her own life and the lives of her playmates  for a long time it puzzled her childish brain finally she reasoned it out that the difference consisted in the fact that they had fathers and she rachel spencer had nonenot even in the graveyard as carrie bell and lilian boulter had why was this  rachel went straight to her mother put one little dimpled hand on isabella spencers knee looked up with great searching blue eyes and said gravely  mother why havent i got a father like the other little girls  isabella spencer laid aside her work took the seven year old child on her lap and told her the whole story in a few direct and bitter words that imprinted themselves indelibly on rachels remembrance  she understood clearly and hopelessly that she could never have a fatherthat in this respect she must always be unlike other people  your father cares nothing for you said isabella spencer in conclusion  he never did care  you must never speak of him to anybody again  rachel slipped silently from her mothers knee and ran out to the springtime garden with a full heart  there she cried passionately over her mothers last words  it seemed to her a terrible thing that her father should not love her and a cruel thing that she must never talk of him  oddly enough rachels sympathies were all with her father in as far as she could understand the old quarrel  she did not dream of disobeying her mother and she did not disobey her  never again did the child speak of her father but isabella had not forbidden her to think of him and thenceforth rachel thought of him constantlyso constantly that in some strange way he seemed to become an unguessedof part of her inner lifethe unseen everpresent companion in all her experiences  she was an imaginative child and in fancy she made the acquaintance of her father  she had never seen him but he was more real to her than most of the people she had seen  he played and talked with her as her mother never did he walked with her in the orchard and field and garden he sat by her pillow in the twilight to him she whispered secrets she told to none other  once her mother asked her impatiently why she talked so much to herself  i am not talking to myself  i am talking to a very dear friend of mine rachel answered gravely  silly child laughed her mother half tolerantly half disapprovingly  two years later something wonderful had happened to rachel  one summer afternoon she had gone to the harbor with several of her little playmates  such a jaunt was a rare treat to the child for isabella spencer seldom allowed her to go from home with anybody but herself  and isabella was not an entertaining companion  rachel never particularly enjoyed an outing with her mother  the children wandered far along the shore at last they came to a place that rachel had never seen before  it was a shallow cove where the waters purred on the yellow sands  beyond it the sea was laughing and flashing and preening and alluring like a beautiful coquettish woman  outside the wind was boisterous and rollicking here it was reverent and gentle  a white boat was hauled up on the skids and there was a queer little house close down to the sands like a big shell tossed up by the waves rachel looked on it all with secret delight she too loved the lonely places of sea and shore as her father had done  she wanted to linger awhile in this dear spot and revel in it  im tired girls she announced  im going to stay here and rest for a spell  i dont want to go to gull point  you go on yourselves ill wait for you here  all alone asked carrie bell wonderingly  im not so afraid of being alone as some people are said rachel with dignity  the other girls went on leaving rachel sitting on the skids in the shadow of the big white boat  she sat there for a time dreaming happily with her blue eyes on the far pearly horizon and her golden head leaning against the boat  suddenly she heard a step behind her  when she turned her head a man was standing beside her looking down at her with big merry blue eyes  rachel was quite sure that she had never seen him before yet those eyes seemed to her to have a strangely familiar look  she liked him  she felt no shyness nor timidity such as usually afflicted her in the presence of strangers  he was a tall stout man dressed in a rough fishing suit and wearing an oilskin cap on his head  his hair was very thick and curly and fair his cheeks were tanned and red his teeth when he smiled were very even and white  rachel thought he must be quite old because there was a good deal of gray mixed with his fair hair  are you watching for the mermaids he said  rachel nodded gravely  from any one else she would have scrupulously hidden such a thought  yes i am she said  mother says there is no such thing as a mermaid but i like to think there is  have you ever seen one  the big man sat down on a bleached log of driftwood and smiled at her  no im sorry to say that i havent  but i have seen many other very wonderful things  i might tell you about some of them if you would come over here and sit by me  rachel went unhesitatingly  when she reached him he pulled her down on his knee and she liked it  what a nice little craft you are he said  do you suppose now that you could give me a kiss  as a rule rachel hated kissing  she could seldom be prevailed upon to kiss even her uncleswho knew it and liked to tease her for kisses until they aggravated her so terribly that she told them she couldnt bear men  but now she promptly put her arms about this strange mans neck and gave him a hearty smack  i like you she said frankly  she felt his arms tighten suddenly about her  the blue eyes looking into hers grew misty and very tender  then all at once rachel knew who he was  he was her father  she did not say anything but she laid her curly head down on his shoulder and felt a great happiness as of one who had come into some longedfor haven  if david spencer realized that she understood he said nothing instead he began to tell her fascinating stories of far lands he had visited and strange things he had seen  rachel listened entranced as if she were hearkening to a fairy tale  yes he was just as she had dreamed him  she had always been sure he could tell beautiful stories  come up to the house and ill show you some pretty things he said finally  then followed a wonderful hour  the little lowceilinged room with its square window into which he took her was filled with the flotsam and jetsam of his roving lifethings beautiful and odd and strange beyond all telling  the things that pleased rachel most were two huge shells on the chimney piecepale pink shells with big crimson and purple spots  oh i didnt know there could be such pretty things in the world she exclaimed  if you would like began the big man then he paused for a moment  ill show you something prettier still  rachel felt vaguely that he meant to say something else when he began but she forgot to wonder what it was when she saw what he brought out of a little corner cupboard  it was a teapot of some fine glistening purple ware coiled over by golden dragons with gilded claws and scales  the lid looked like a beautiful golden flower and the handle was a coil of a dragons tail  rachel sat and looked at it rapteyed  thats the only thing of any value i have in the worldnow he said  rachel knew there was something very sad in his eyes and voice she longed to kiss him again and comfort him  but suddenly he began to laugh and then he rummaged out some goodies for her to eat sweetmeats more delicious than she had ever imagined  while she nibbled them he took down an old violin and played music that made her want to dance and sing  rachel was perfectly happy she wished she might stay forever in that low dim room with all its treasures  i see your little friends coming around the point he said finally  i suppose you must go  put the rest of the goodies in your pocket  he took her up in his arms and held her tightly against his breast for a single moment  she felt him kissing her hair  there run along little girl  goodby he said gently  why dont you ask me to come and see you again cried rachel half in tears  im coming anyhow  if you can come come he said  if you dont come i shall know it is because you cantand that is much to know  im very very very glad little woman that you have come once  rachel was sitting demurely on the skids when her companions came back  they had not seen her leaving the house and she said not a word to them of her experiences  she only smiled mysteriously when they asked her if she had been lonesome  that night for the first time she mentioned her fathers name in her prayers  she never forgot to do so afterwards  she always said bless motherand father with an instinctive pause between the two namesa pause which indicated new realization of the tragedy which had sundered them  and the tone in which she said father was softer and more tender than the one which voiced mother  rachel never visited the cove again  isabella spencer discovered that the children had been there and although she knew nothing of rachels interview with her father she told the child that she must never again go to that part of the shore  rachel shed many a bitter tear in secret over this command but she obeyed it  thenceforth there had been no communication between her and her father save the unworded messages of soul to soul across whatever may divide them  david spencers invitation to his daughters wedding was sent with the others and the remaining days of rachels maidenhood slipped away in a whirl of preparation and excitement in which her mother reveled but which was distasteful to the girl  the wedding day came at last breaking softly and fairly over the great sea in a sheen of silver and pearl and rose a september day as mild and beautiful as june  the ceremony was to be performed at eight oclock in the evening at seven rachel stood in her room fully dressed and alone  she had no bridesmaid and she had asked her cousins to leave her to herself in this last solemn hour of girlhood  she looked very fair and sweet in the sunsetlight that showered through the birches  her wedding gown was a fine sheer organdie simply and daintily made  in the loose waves of her bright hair she wore her bridegrooms flowers roses as white as a virgins dream she was very happy but her happiness was faintly threaded with the sorrow inseparable from all change  presently her mother came in carrying a small basket  here is something for you rachel  one of the boys from the harbor brought it up  he was bound to give it into your own handssaid that was his orders  i just took it and sent him to the rightabouttold him id give it to you at once and that that was all that was necessary  she spoke coldly  she knew quite well who had sent the basket and she resented it but her resentment was not quite strong enough to overcome her curiosity  she stood silently by while rachel unpacked the basket  rachels hands trembled as she took off the cover  two huge pinkspotted shells came first  how well she remembered them beneath them carefully wrapped up in a square of foreignlooking strangely scented silk was the dragon teapot she held it in her hands and gazed at it with tears gathering thickly in her eyes  your father sent that said isabella spencer with an odd sound in her voice  i remember it well  it was among the things i packed up and sent after him  his father had brought it home from china fifty years ago and he prized it beyond anything they used to say it was worth a lot of money  mother please leave me alone for a little while said rachel imploringly  she had caught sight of a little note at the bottom of the basket and she felt that she could not read it under her mothers eyes  mrs spencer went out with unaccustomed acquiescence and rachel went quickly to the window where she read her letter by the fading gleams of twilight  it was very brief and the writing was that of a man who holds a pen but seldom      my dear little girl it ran im sorry i cant go to your     wedding  it was like you to ask mefor i know it was your     doing  i wish i could see you married but i cant go to the     house i was turned out of  i hope you will be very happy  i     am sending you the shells and teapot you liked so much  do     you remember that day we had such a good time  i would liked     to have seen you again before you were married but it cant     be                                             your loving father                                            david spencer  rachel resolutely blinked away the tears that filled her eyes  a fierce desire for her father sprang up in her heartan insistent hunger that would not be denied  she must see her father she must have his blessing on her new life  a sudden determination took possession of her whole beinga determination to sweep aside all conventionalities and objections as if they had not been  it was now almost dark  the guests would not be coming for half an hour yet  it was only fifteen minutes walk over the hill to the cove  hastily rachel shrouded herself in her new raincoat and drew a dark protecting hood over her gay head  she opened the door and slipped noiselessly downstairs  mrs spencer and her assistants were all busy in the back part of the house  in a moment rachel was out in the dewy garden  she would go straight over the fields  nobody would see her  it was quite dark when she reached the cove  in the crystal cup of the sky over her the stars were blinking  flying flakes of foam were scurrying over the sand like elfin things  a soft little wind was crooning about the eaves of the little gray house where david spencer was sitting alone in the twilight his violin on his knee  he had been trying to play but could not his heart yearned after his daughteryes and after a longestranged bride of his youth  his love of the sea was sated forever his love for wife and child still cried for its own under all his old anger and stubbornness  the door opened suddenly and the very rachel of whom he was dreaming came suddenly in flinging off her wraps and standing forth in her young beauty and bridal adornments a splendid creature almost lighting up the gloom with her radiance  father she cried brokenly and her fathers eager arms closed around her  back in the house she had left the guests were coming to the wedding  there were jests and laughter and friendly greeting the bridegroom came too a slim darkeyed lad who tiptoed bashfully upstairs to the spare room from which he presently emerged to confront mrs spencer on the landing  i want to see rachel before we go down he said blushing  mrs spencer deposited a wedding present of linen on the table which was already laden with gifts opening the door of rachels room and called her  there was no reply the room was dark and still  in sudden alarm isabella spencer snatched the lamp from the hall table and held it up  the little white room was empty no blushing whiteclad bride tenanted it  but david spencers letter was lying on the stand  she caught it up and read it  rachel is gone she gasped  a flash of intuition had revealed to her where and why the girl had gone  gone echoed frank his face blanching  his pallid dismay recalled mrs spencer to herself  she gave a bitter ugly little laugh  oh you neednt look so scared frank  she hasnt run away from you  hush come in hereshut the door  nobody must know of this  nice gossip it would make  that little fool has gone to the cove to see herher father  i know she has  its just like what she would do  he sent her those presentslookand this letter  read it  she has gone to coax him to come and see her married  she was crazy about it  and the minister is here and it is halfpast seven  shell ruin her dress and shoes in the dust and dew  and what if some one has seen her  was there ever such a little fool  franks presence of mind had returned to him  he knew all about rachel and her father  she had told him everything  ill go after her he said gently  get me my hat and coat ill slip down the back stairs and over to the cove  you must get out of the pantry window then said mrs spencer firmly mingling comedy and tragedy after her characteristic fashion  the kitchen is full of women  i wont have this known and talked about if it can possibly be helped  the bridegroom wise beyond his years in the knowledge that it was well to yield to women in little things crawled obediently out of the pantry window and darted through the birch wood  mrs spencer had stood quakingly on guard until he had disappeared  so rachel had gone to her father  like had broken the fetters of years and fled to like  it isnt much use fighting against nature i guess she thought grimly  im beat  he must have thought something of her after all when he sent her that teapot and letter  and what does he mean about the day they had such a good time  well it just means that shes been to see him before sometime i suppose and kept me in ignorance of it all  mrs spencer shut down the pantry window with a vicious thud  if only shell come quietly back with frank in time to prevent gossip ill forgive her she said as she turned to the kitchen  rachel was sitting on her fathers knee with both her white arms around his neck when frank came in  she sprang up her face flushed and appealing her eyes bright and dewy with tears frank thought he had never seen her look so lovely  oh frank is it very late  oh are you angry she exclaimed timidly  no no dear  of course im not angry  but dont you think youd better come back now  its nearly eight and everybody is waiting  ive been trying to coax father to come up and see me married said rachel  help me frank  youd better come sir said frank heartily id like it as much as rachel would  david spencer shook his head stubbornly  no i cant go to that house  i was locked out of it  never mind me  ive had my happiness in this half hour with my little girl  id like to see her married but it isnt to be  yes it is to beit shall be said rachel resolutely  you shall see me married  frank im going to be married here in my fathers house  that is the right place for a girl to be married  go back and tell the guests so and bring them all down  frank looked rather dismayed  david spencer said deprecatingly little girl dont you think it would be  im going to have my own way in this said rachel with a sort of tender finality  go frank  ill obey you all my life after but you must do this for me  try to understand she added beseechingly  oh i understand frank reassured her  besides i think you are right  but i was thinking of your mother  she wont come  then you tell her that if she doesnt come i shant be married at all said rachel  she was betraying unsuspected ability to manage people  she knew that ultimatum would urge frank to his best endeavors  frank much to mrs spencers dismay marched boldly in at the front door upon his return  she pounced on him and whisked him out of sight into the supper room  wheres rachel  what made you come that way  everybody saw you  it makes no difference  they will all have to know anyway rachel says she is going to be married from her fathers house or not at all  ive come back to tell you so  isabellas face turned crimson  rachel has gone crazy  i wash my hands of this affair  do as you please  take the gueststhe supper too if you can carry it  well all come back here for supper said frank ignoring the sarcasm  come mrs spencer lets make the best of it  do you suppose that i am going to david spencers house said isabella spencer violently  oh you must come mrs spencer cried poor frank desperately he began to fear that he would lose his bride past all finding in this maze of triple stubbornness  rachel says she wont be married at all if you dont go too  think what a talk it will make  you know she will keep her word  isabella spencer knew it  amid all the conflict of anger and revolt in her soul was a strong desire not to make a worse scandal than must of necessity be made  the desire subdued and tamed her as nothing else could have done  i will go since i have to she said icily  what cant be cured must be endured  go and tell them  five minutes later the sixty wedding guests were all walking over the fields to the cove with the minister and the bridegroom in the front of the procession  they were too amazed even to talk about the strange happening  isabella spencer walked behind fiercely alone  they all crowded into the little room of the house at the cove and a solemn hush fell over it broken only by the purr of the seawind around it and the croon of the waves on the shore david spencer gave his daughter away but when the ceremony was concluded isabella was the first to take the girl in her arms she clasped her and kissed her with tears streaming down her pale face all her nature melted in a mothers tenderness  rachel  rachel  my child i hope and pray that you may be happy she said brokenly  in the surge of the suddenly merry crowd of wellwishers around the bride and groom isabella was pushed back into a shadowy corner behind a heap of sails and ropes  looking up she found herself crushed against david spencer  for the first time in twenty years the eyes of husband and wife met  a strange thrill shot to isabellas heart she felt herself trembling  isabella  it was davids voice in her eara voice full of tenderness and pleadingthe voice of the young wooer of her girlhoodis it too late to ask you to forgive me  ive been a stubborn foolbut there hasnt been an hour in all these years that i havent thought about you and our baby and longed for you  isabella spencer had hated this man yet her hate had been but a parasite growth on a nobler stem with no abiding roots of its own  it withered under his words and lo there was the old love fair and strong and beautiful as ever  ohdavidiwasalltoblame she murmured brokenly  further words were lost on her husbands lips  when the hubbub of handshaking and congratulating had subsided isabella spencer stepped out before the company  she looked almost girlish and bridal herself with her flushed cheeks and bright eyes  lets go back now and have supper and be sensible she said crisply  rachel your father is coming too  he is coming to staywith a defiant glance around the circle  come everybody  they went back with laughter and raillery over the quiet autumn fields faintly silvered now by the moon that was rising over the hills  the young bride and groom lagged behind they were very happy but they were not so happy after all as the old bride and groom who walked swiftly in front  isabellas hand was in her husbands and sometimes she could not see the moonlit hills for a mist of glorified tears  david she whispered as he helped her over the fence how can you ever forgive me  theres nothing to forgive he said  were only just married who ever heard of a bridegroom talking of forgiveness everything is beginning over new for us my girl    iv janes baby  miss rosetta ellis with her front hair in curlpapers and her back hair bound with a checked apron was out in her breezy side yard under the firs shaking her parlor rugs when mr nathan patterson drove in  miss rosetta had seen him coming down the long red hill but she had not supposed he would be calling at that time of the morning  so she had not run  miss rosetta always ran if anybody called and her front hair was in curlpapers and though the errand of the said caller might be life or death he or she had to wait until miss rosetta had taken her hair out  everybody in avonlea knew this because everybody in avonlea knew everything about everybody else  but mr patterson had wheeled into the lane so quickly and unexpectedly that miss rosetta had had no time to run so twitching off the checked apron she stood her ground as calmly as might be under the disagreeable consciousness of curlpapers  good morning miss ellis said mr patterson so somberly that miss rosetta instantly felt that he was the bearer of bad news usually mr pattersons face was as broad and beaming as a harvest moon  now his expression was very melancholy and his voice positively sepulchral  good morning returned miss rosetta crisply and cheerfully she at any rate would not go into eclipse until she knew the reason therefor  it is a fine day  a very fine day assented mr patterson solemnly  i have just come from the wheeler place miss ellis and i regret to say  charlotte is sick cried miss rosetta rapidly  charlotte has got another spell with her heart  i knew it  ive been expecting to hear it  any woman that drives about the country as much as she does is liable to heart disease at any moment  i never go outside of my gate but i meet her gadding off somewhere goodness knows who looks after her place  i shouldnt like to trust as much to a hired man as she does  well it is very kind of you mr patterson to put yourself out to the extent of calling to tell me that charlotte is sick but i dont really see why you should take so much troublei really dont  it doesnt matter to me whether charlotte is sick or whether she isnt  you know that perfectly well mr patterson if anybody does  when charlotte went and got married on the sly to that goodfornothing jacob wheeler  mrs wheeler is quite well interrupted mr patterson desperately  quite well  nothing at all the matter with her in fact  i only  then what do you mean by coming here and telling me she wasnt and frightening me half to death demanded miss rosetta indignantly  my own heart isnt very strongit runs in our familyand my doctor warned me to avoid all shocks and excitement  i dont want to be excited mr patterson  i wont be excited not even if charlotte has another spell  its perfectly useless for you to try to excite me mr patterson  bless the woman im not trying to excite anybody declared mr patterson in exasperation  i merely called to tell you  to tell me what said miss rosetta  how much longer do you mean to keep me in suspense mr patterson  no doubt you have abundance of spare time butihave not  that your sister mrs wheeler has had a letter from a cousin of yours and shes in charlottetown  mrs roberts i think her name is  jane roberts broke in miss rosetta  jane ellis she was before she was married  what was she writing to charlotte about not that i want to know of course  im not interested in charlottes correspondence goodness knows  but if jane had anything in particular to write about she should have written to me  i am the oldest  charlotte had no business to get a letter from jane roberts without consulting me  its just like her underhanded ways  she got married the same way  never said a word to me about it but just sneaked off with that unprincipled jacob wheeler  mrs roberts is very ill i understand persisted mr patterson nobly resolved to do what he had come to do dying in fact and  jane ill  jane dying exclaimed miss rosetta  why she was the healthiest girl i ever knew  but then ive never seen her nor heard from her since she got married fifteen years ago  i dare say her husband was a brute and neglected her and shes pined away by slow degrees  ive no faith in husbands  look at charlotte  everybody knows how jacob wheeler used her  to be sure she deserved it but  mrs roberts husband is dead said mr patterson  died about two months ago i understand and she has a little baby six months old and she thought perhaps mrs wheeler would take it for old times sake  did charlotte ask you to call and tell me this demanded miss rosetta eagerly  no she just told me what was in the letter  she didnt mention you but i thought perhaps you ought to be told  i knew it said miss rosetta in a tone of bitter assurance  i could have told you so  charlotte wouldnt even let me know that jane was ill  charlotte would be afraid i would want to get the baby seeing that jane and i were such intimate friends long ago and who has a better right to it than me i should like to know aint i the oldest  and havent i had experience in bringing up babies  charlotte neednt think she is going to run the affairs of our family just because she happened to get married  jacob wheeler  i must be going said mr patterson gathering up his reins thankfully  i am much obliged to you for coming to tell me about jane said miss rosetta even though you have wasted a lot of precious time getting it out  if it hadnt been for you i suppose i should never have known it at all  as it is i shall start for town just as soon as i can get ready  youll have to hurry if you want to get ahead of mrs wheeler advised mr patterson  shes packing her trunk and going on the morning train  ill pack a valise and go on the afternoon train retorted miss rosetta triumphantly  ill show charlotte she isnt running the ellis affairs  she married out of them into the wheelers  she can attend to them  jacob wheeler was the most  but mr patterson had driven away  he felt that he had done his duty in the face of fearful odds and he did not want to hear anything more about jacob wheeler  rosetta ellis and charlotte wheeler had not exchanged a word for ten years  before that time they had been devoted to each other living together in the little ellis cottage on the white sands road as they had done ever since their parents death  the trouble began when jacob wheeler had commenced to pay attention to charlotte the younger and prettier of two women who had both ceased to be either very young or very pretty  rosetta had been bitterly opposed to the match from the first  she vowed she had no use for jacob wheeler  there were not lacking malicious people to hint that this was because the aforesaid jacob wheeler had selected the wrong sister upon whom to bestow his affections be that as it might miss rosetta certainly continued to render the course of jacob wheelers true love exceedingly rough and tumultuous  the end of it was that charlotte had gone quietly away one morning and married jacob wheeler without miss rosettas knowing anything about it  miss rosetta had never forgiven her for it and charlotte had never forgiven the things rosetta had said to her when she and jacob returned to the ellis cottage since then the sisters had been avowed and open foes the only difference being that miss rosetta aired her grievances publicly in season and out of season while charlotte was never heard to mention rosettas name  even the death of jacob wheeler five years after the marriage had not healed the breach  miss rosetta took out her curlpapers packed her valise and caught the late afternoon train for charlottetown as she had threatened  all the way there she sat rigidly upright in her seat and held imaginary dialogues with charlotte in her mind running something like this on her part  no charlotte wheeler you are not going to have janes baby and youre very much mistaken if you think so  oh all rightwell see  you dont know anything about babies even if you are married  i do  didnt i take william elliss baby when his wife died  tell me that charlotte wheeler  and didnt the little thing thrive with me and grow strong and healthy  yes even you have to admit that it did charlotte wheeler  and yet you have the presumption to think that you ought to have janes baby  yes it is presumption charlotte wheeler  and when william ellis got married again and took the baby didnt the child cling to me and cry as if i was its real mother  you know it did charlotte wheeler  im going to get and keep janes baby in spite of you charlotte wheeler and id like to see you try to prevent meyou that went and got married and never so much as let your own sister know of it  if i had got married in such a fashion charlotte wheeler id be ashamed to look anybody in the face for the rest of my natural life  miss rosetta was so interested in thus laying down the law to charlotte and in planning out the future life of janes baby that she didnt find the journey to charlottetown so long or tedious as might have been expected considering her haste  she soon found her way to the house where her cousin lived  there to her dismay and real sorrow she learned that mrs roberts had died at four oclock that afternoon  she seemed dreadful anxious to live until she heard from some of her folks out in avonlea said the woman who gave miss rosetta the information  she had written to them about her little girl she was my sisterinlaw and she lived with me ever since her husband died  ive done my best for her but ive a big family of my own and i cant see how im to keep the child  poor jane looked and longed for some one to come from avonlea but she couldnt hold out  a patient suffering creature she was  im her cousin said miss rosetta wiping her eyes and i have come for the baby  ill take it home with me after the funeral and if you please mrs gordon let me see it right away so it can get accustomed to me  poor jane  i wish i could have got here in time to see her she and i were such friends long ago we were far more intimate and confidential than ever her and charlotte was  charlotte knows that too  the vim with which miss rosetta snapped this out rather amazed mrs gordon who couldnt understand it at all  but she took miss rosetta upstairs to the room where the baby was sleeping  oh the little darling cried miss rosetta all her old maidishness and oddity falling away from her like a garment and all her innate and denied motherhood shining out in her face like a transforming illumination  oh the sweet dear pretty little thing  the baby was a darlinga sixmonths old beauty with little golden ringlets curling and glistening all over its tiny head as miss rosetta hung over it it opened its eyes and then held out its tiny hands to her with a gurgle of confidence  oh you sweetest said miss rosetta rapturously gathering it up in her arms  you belong to me darlingnever never to that underhanded charlotte  what is its name mrs gordon  it wasnt named said mrs gordon  guess youll have to name it yourself miss ellis  camilla jane said miss rosetta without a moments hesitation jane after its mother of course and i have always thought camilla the prettiest name in the world  charlotte would be sure to give it some perfectly heathenish name  i wouldnt put it past her calling the poor innocent mehitable  miss rosetta decided to stay in charlottetown until after the funeral  that night she lay with the baby on her arm listening with joy to its soft little breathing  she did not sleep or wish to sleep  her waking fancies were more alluring than any visions of dreamland  moreover she gave a spice to them by occasionally snapping some vicious sentences out loud at charlotte  miss rosetta fully expected charlotte along on the following morning and girded herself for the fray but no charlotte appeared  night came no charlotte  another morning and no charlotte  miss rosetta was hopelessly puzzled  what had happened  dear dear had charlotte taken a bad heart spell on hearing that she rosetta had stolen a march on her to charlottetown  it was quite likely  you never knew what to expect of a woman who had married jacob wheeler  the truth was that the very evening miss rosetta had left avonlea mrs jacob wheelers hired man had broken his leg and had had to be conveyed to his distant home on a feather bed in an express wagon  mrs wheeler could not leave home until she had obtained another hired man  consequently it was the evening after the funeral when mrs wheeler whisked up the steps of the gordon house and met miss rosetta coming out with a big white bundle in her arms  the eyes of the two women met defiantly  miss rosettas face wore an air of triumph chastened by a remembrance of the funeral that afternoon  mrs wheelers face except for eyes was as expressionless as it usually was  unlike the tall fair fat miss rosetta mrs wheeler was small and dark and thin with an eager careworn face  how is jane she said abruptly breaking the silence of ten years in saying it  jane is dead and buried poor thing said miss rosetta calmly i am taking her baby little camilla jane home with me  the baby belongs to me cried mrs wheeler passionately  jane wrote to me about her  jane meant that i should have her  ive come for her  youll go back without her then said miss rosetta serene in the possession that is nine points of the law  the child is mine and she is going to stay mine  you can make up your mind to that charlotte wheeler  a woman who eloped to get married isnt fit to be trusted with a baby anyhow  jacob wheeler  but mrs wheeler had rushed past into the house  miss rosetta composedly stepped into the cab and drove to the station  she fairly bridled with triumph and underneath the triumph ran a queer undercurrent of satisfaction over the fact that charlotte had spoken to her at last  miss rosetta would not look at this satisfaction or give it a name but it was there  miss rosetta arrived safely back in avonlea with camilla jane and within ten hours everybody in the settlement knew the whole story and every woman who could stand on her feet had been up to the ellis cottage to see the baby  mrs wheeler arrived home twentyfour hours later and silently betook herself to her farm when her avonlea neighbors sympathized with her in her disappointment she said nothing but looked all the more darkly determined  also a week later mr william j blair the carmody storekeeper had an odd tale to tell  mrs wheeler had come to the store and bought a lot of fine flannel and muslin and valenciennes  now what in the name of time did mrs wheeler want with such stuff  mr william j blair couldnt make head or tail of it and it worried him  mr blair was so accustomed to know what everybody bought anything for that such a mystery quite upset him   miss rosetta had exulted in the possession of little camilla jane for a month and had been so happy that she had almost given up inveighing against charlotte  her conversations instead of tending always to jacob wheeler now ran camilla janeward and this folks thought was an improvement  one afternoon miss rosetta leaving camilla jane snugly sleeping in her cradle in the kitchen had slipped down to the bottom of the garden to pick her currants  the house was hidden from her sight by the copse of cherry trees but she had left the kitchen window open so that she could hear the baby if it awakened and cried  miss rosetta sang happily as she picked her currants for the first time since charlotte had married jacob wheeler miss rosetta felt really happyso happy that at there was no room in her heart for bitterness  in fancy she looked forward to the coming years and saw camilla jane growing up into girlhood fair and lovable  shell be a beauty reflected miss rosetta complacently  jane was a handsome girl  she shall always be dressed as nice as i can manage it and ill get her an organ and have her take painting and music lessons  parties too  ill give her a real comingout party when shes eighteen and the very prettiest dress thats to be had  dear me i can hardly wait for her to grow up though shes sweet enough now to make one wish she could stay a baby forever  when miss rosetta returned to the kitchen her eyes fell on an empty cradle  camilla jane was gone  miss rosetta promptly screamed  she understood at a glance what had happened  six months old babies do not get out of their cradles and disappear through closed doors without any assistance  charlotte has been here gasped miss rosetta  charlotte has stolen camilla jane  i might have expected it  i might have known when i heard that story about her buying muslin and flannel  its just like charlotte to do such an underhand trick but ill go after her  ill show her  shell find out she has got rosetta ellis to deal with and no wheeler  like a frantic creature and wholly forgetting that her hair was in curlpapers miss rosetta hurried up the hill and down the shore road to the wheeler farma place she had never visited in her life before  the wind was offshore and only broke the bays surface into long silvery ripples and sent sheeny shadows flying out across it from every point and headland like transparent wings  the little gray house so close to the purring waves that in storms their spray splashed over its very doorstep seemed deserted  miss rosetta pounded lustily on the front door  this producing no result she marched around to the back door and knocked  no answer  miss rosetta tried the door  it was locked  guilty conscience sniffed miss rosetta  well i shall stay here until i see that perfidious charlotte if i have to camp in the yard all night  miss rosetta was quite capable of doing this but she was spared the necessity walking boldly up to the kitchen window and peering through it she felt her heart swell with anger as she beheld charlotte sitting calmly by the table with camilla jane on her knee  beside her was a befrilled and bemuslined cradle and on a chair lay the garments in which miss rosetta had dressed the baby  it was clad in an entirely new outfit and seemed quite at home with its new possessor  it was laughing and cooing and making little dabs at her with its dimpled hands  charlotte wheeler cried miss rosetta rapping sharply on the windowpane  ive come for that child  bring her out to me at onceat once i say  how dare you come to my house and steal a baby  youre no better than a common burglar  give me camilla jane i say  charlotte came over to the window with the baby in her arms and triumph glittering in her eyes  there is no such child as camilla jane here she said  this is barbara jane  she belongs to me  with that mrs wheeler pulled down the shade  miss rosetta had to go home  there was nothing else for her to do  on her way she met mr patterson and told him in full the story of her wrongs  it was all over avonlea by night and created quite a sensation  avonlea had not had such a toothsome bit of gossip for a long time  mrs wheeler exulted in the possession of barbara jane for six weeks during which miss rosetta broke her heart with loneliness and longing and meditated futile plots for the recovery of the baby  it was hopeless to think of stealing it back or she would have tried to  the hired man at the wheeler place reported that mrs wheeler never left it night or day for a single moment  she even carried it with her when she went to milk the cows  but my turn will come said miss rosetta grimly  camilla jane is mine and if she was called barbara for a century it wouldnt alter that fact  barbara indeed  why not have called her methusaleh and have done with it  one afternoon in october when miss rosetta was picking her apples and thinking drearily about lost camilla jane a woman came running breathlessly down the hill and into the yard  miss rosetta gave an exclamation of amazement and dropped her basket of apples  of all incredible things  the woman was charlotte charlotte who had never set foot on the grounds of the ellis cottage since her marriage ten years ago charlotte bareheaded wildeyed distraught wringing her hands and sobbing  miss rosetta flew to meet her  youve scalded camilla jane to death she exclaimed  i always knew you wouldalways expected it  oh for heavens sake come quick rosetta gasped charlotte barbara jane is in convulsions and i dont know what to do  the hired man has gone for the doctor  you were the nearest so i came to you  jenny white was there when they came on so i left her and ran  oh rosetta come come if you have a spark of humanity in you  you know what to do for convulsionsyou saved the ellis baby when it had them  oh come and save barbara jane  you mean camilla jane i presume said miss rosetta firmly in spite of her agitation  for a second charlotte wheeler hesitated  then she said passionately yes yes camilla janeany name you like  only come  miss rosetta went and not a moment too soon either  the doctor lived eight miles away and the baby was very bad  the two women and jenny white worked over her for hours  it was not until dark when the baby was sleeping soundly and the doctor had gone after telling miss rosetta that she had saved the childs life that a realization of the situation came home to them  well said miss rosetta dropping into an armchair with a long sigh of weariness i guess youll admit now charlotte wheeler that you are hardly a fit person to have charge of a baby even if you had to go and steal it from me  i should think your conscience would reproach youthat is if any woman who would marry jacob wheeler in such an underhanded fashion has a  ii wanted the baby sobbed charlotte tremulously  i was so lonely here  i didnt think it was any harm to take her because jane gave her to me in her letter  but you have saved her life rosetta and youyou can have her back although it will break my heart to give her up  but oh rosetta wont you let me come and see her sometimes  i love her so i cant bear to give her up entirely  charlotte said miss rosetta firmly the most sensible thing for you to do is just to come back with the baby  you are worried to death trying to run this farm with the debt jacob wheeler left on it for you  sell it and come home with me  and well both have the baby then  oh rosetta id love to faltered charlotte  iveive wanted to be good friends with you again so much  but i thought you were so hard and bitter youd never make up  maybe ive talked too much conceded miss rosetta but you ought to know me well enough to know i didnt mean a word of it it was your never saying anything no matter what i said that riled me up so bad  let bygones be bygones and come home charlotte  i will said charlotte resolutely wiping away her tears  im sick of living here and putting up with hired men  ill be real glad to go home rosetta and thats the truth  ive had a hard enough time  i spose youll say i deserved it but i was fond of jacob and  of course of course  why shouldnt you be said miss rosetta briskly  im sure jacob wheeler was a good enough soul if he was a little slacktwisted  id like to hear anybody say a word against him in my presence  look at that blessed child charlotte  isnt she the sweetest thing  im desperate glad you are coming back home charlotte  ive never been able to put up a decent mess of mustard pickles since you went away and you were always such a hand with them  well be real snug and cozy againyou and me and little camilla barbara jane    v the dreamchild  a mans heartaye and a womans tooshould be light in the spring  the spirit of resurrection is abroad calling the life of the world out of its wintry grave knocking with radiant fingers at the gates of its tomb  it stirs in human hearts and makes them glad with the old primal gladness they felt in childhood  it quickens human souls and brings them if so they will so close to god that they may clasp hands with him  it is a time of wonder and renewed life and a great outward and inward rapture as of a young angel softly clapping his hands for creations joy  at least so it should be and so it always had been with me until the spring when the dreamchild first came into our lives  that year i hated the springi who had always loved it so  as boy i had loved it and as man  all the happiness that had ever been mine and it was much had come to blossom in the springtime  it was in the spring that josephine and i had first loved each other or at least had first come into the full knowledge that we loved  i think that we must have loved each other all our lives and that each succeeding spring was a word in the revelation of that love not to be understood until in the fullness of time the whole sentence was written out in that most beautiful of all beautiful springs  how beautiful it was  and how beautiful she was  i suppose every lover thinks that of his lass otherwise he is a poor sort of lover  but it was not only my eyes of love that made my dear lovely she was slim and lithe as a young whitestemmed birch tree her hair was like a soft dusky cloud and her eyes were as blue as avonlea harbor on a fair twilight when all the sky is abloom over it  she had dark lashes and a little red mouth that quivered when she was very sad or very happy or when she loved very muchquivered like a crimson rose too rudely shaken by the wind  at such times what was a man to do save kiss it  the next spring we were married and i brought her home to my gray old homestead on the gray old harbor shore  a lonely place for a young bride said avonlea people  nay it was not so  she was happy here even in my absences  she loved the great restless harbor and the vast misty sea beyond she loved the tides keeping their worldold tryst with the shore and the gulls and the croon of the waves and the call of the winds in the fir woods at noon and even she loved the moonrises and the sunsets and the clear calm nights when the stars seemed to have fallen into the water and to be a little dizzy from such a fall she loved these things even as i did  no she was never lonely here then  the third spring came and our boy was born  we thought we had been happy before now we knew that we had only dreamed a pleasant dream of happiness and had awakened to this exquisite reality  we thought we had loved each other before now as i looked into my wifes pale face blanched with its baptism of pain and met the uplifted gaze of her blue eyes aglow with the holy passion of motherhood i knew we had only imagined what love might be  the imagination had been sweet as the thought of the rose is sweet before the bud is open but as the rose to the thought so was love to the imagination of it  all my thoughts are poetry since baby came my wife said once rapturously  our boy lived for twenty months  he was a sturdy toddling rogue so full of life and laughter and mischief that when he died one day after the illness of an hour it seemed a most absurd thing that he should be deada thing i could have laughed at until belief forced itself into my soul like a burning searing iron  i think i grieved over my little sons death as deeply and sincerely as ever man did or could  but the heart of the father is not as the heart of the mother  time brought no healing to josephine she fretted and pined her cheeks lost their pretty oval and her red mouth grew pale and drooping  i hoped that spring might work its miracle upon her  when the buds swelled and the old earth grew green in the sun and the gulls came back to the gray harbor whose very grayness grew golden and mellow i thought i should see her smile again  but when the spring came came the dreamchild and the fear that was to be my companion at bed and board from sunsetting to sunsetting  one night i awakened from sleep realizing in the moment of awakening that i was alone  i listened to hear whether my wife were moving about the house  i heard nothing but the little splash of waves on the shore below and the low moan of the distant ocean  i rose and searched the house  she was not in it  i did not know where to seek her but at a venture i started along the shore  it was pale fainting moonlight  the harbor looked like a phantom harbor and the night was as still and cold and calm as the face of a dead man  at last i saw my wife coming to me along the shore  when i saw her i knew what i had feared and how great my fear had been  as she drew near i saw that she had been crying her face was stained with tears and her dark hair hung loose over her shoulders in little glossy ringlets like a childs  she seemed to be very tired and at intervals she wrung her small hands together  she showed no surprise when she met me but only held out her hands to me as if glad to see me  i followed himbut i could not overtake him she said with a sob  i did my besti hurried so but he was always a little way ahead  and then i lost himand so i came back  but i did my bestindeed i did  and oh i am so tired  josie dearest what do you mean and where have you been i said drawing her close to me  why did you go out soalone in the night  she looked at me wonderingly  how could i help it david  he called me  i had to go  who called you  the child she answered in a whisper  our child davidour pretty boy  i awakened in the darkness and heard him calling to me down on the shore  such a sad little wailing cry david as if he were cold and lonely and wanted his mother  i hurried out to him but i could not find him  i could only hear the call and i followed it on and on far down the shore  oh i tried so hard to overtake it but i could not  once i saw a little white hand beckoning to me far ahead in the moonlight  but still i could not go fast enough  and then the cry ceased and i was there all alone on that terrible cold gray shore  i was so tired and i came home  but i wish i could have found him perhaps he does not know that i tried to  perhaps he thinks his mother never listened to his call  oh i would not have him think that  you have had a bad dream dear i said  i tried to say it naturally but it is hard for a man to speak naturally when he feels a mortal dread striking into his very vitals with its deadly chill  it was no dream she answered reproachfully  i tell you i heard him calling meme his mother  what could i do but go to him  you cannot understandyou are only his father  it was not you who gave him birth  it was not you who paid the price of his dear life in pain  he would not call to youhe wanted his mother  i got her back to the house and to her bed whither she went obediently enough and soon fell into the sleep of exhaustion but there was no more sleep for me that night  i kept a grim vigil with dread  when i had married josephine one of those officious relatives that are apt to buzz about a mans marriage told me that her grandmother had been insane all the latter part of her life  she had grieved over the death of a favorite child until she lost her mind and as the first indication of it she had sought by nights a white dreamchild which always called her so she said and led her afar with a little pale beckoning hand  i had smiled at the story then  what had that grim old bygone to do with springtime and love and josephine  but it came back to me now hand in hand with my fear  was this fate coming on my dear wife  it was too horrible for belief  she was so young so fair so sweet this girlwife of mine  it had been only a bad dream with a frightened bewildered waking  so i tried to comfort myself  when she awakened in the morning she did not speak of what had happened and i did not dare to  she seemed more cheerful that day than she had been and went about her household duties briskly and skillfully  my fear lifted  i was sure now that she had only dreamed  and i was confirmed in my hopeful belief when two nights had passed away uneventfully  then on the third night he dreamchild called to her again  i wakened from a troubled doze to find her dressing herself with feverish haste  he is calling me she cried  oh dont you hear him  cant you hear him  listenlistenthe little lonely cry  yes yes my precious mother is coming  wait for me  mother is coming to her pretty boy  i caught her hand and let her lead me where she would  hand in hand we followed the dreamchild down the harbor shore in that ghostly clouded moonlight  ever she said the little cry sounded before her  she entreated the dreamchild to wait for her she cried and implored and uttered tender mothertalk  but at last she ceased to hear the cry and then weeping wearied she let me lead her home again  what a horror brooded over that springthat so beautiful spring it was a time of wonder and marvel of the soft touch of silver rain on greening fields of the incredible delicacy of young leaves of blossom on the land and blossom in the sunset  the whole world bloomed in a flush and tremor of maiden loveliness instinct with all the evasive fleeting charm of spring and girlhood and young morning  and almost every night of this wonderful time the dreamchild called his mother and we roved the gray shore in quest of him  in the day she was herself but when the night fell she was restless and uneasy until she heard the call  then follow it she would even through storm and darkness  it was then she said that the cry sounded loudest and nearest as if her pretty boy were frightened by the tempest  what wild terrible rovings we had she straining forward eager to overtake the dreamchild i sick at heart following guiding protecting as best i could then afterwards leading her gently home heartbroken because she could not reach the child  i bore my burden in secret determining that gossip should not busy itself with my wifes condition so long as i could keep it from becoming known  we had no near relativesnone with any right to share any troubleand whoso accepteth human love must bind it to his soul with pain  i thought however that i should have medical advice and i took our old doctor into my confidence  he looked grave when he heard my story  i did not like his expression nor his few guarded remarks  he said he thought human aid would avail little she might come all right in time humor her as far as possible watch over her protect her  he needed not to tell me that  the spring went out and summer came inand the horror deepened and darkened  i knew that suspicions were being whispered from lip to lip  we had been seen on our nightly quests  men and women began to look at us pityingly when we went abroad  one day on a dull drowsy afternoon the dreamchild called  i knew then that the end was near the end had been near in the old grandmothers case sixty years before when the dreamchild called in the day  the doctor looked graver than ever when i told him and said that the time had come when i must have help in my task i could not watch by day and night  unless i had assistance i would break down  i did not think that i should  love is stronger than that  and on one thing i was determinedthey should never take my wife from me  no restraint sterner than a husbands loving hand should ever be put upon her my pretty piteous darling  i never spoke of the dreamchild to her  the doctor advised against it  it would he said only serve to deepen the delusion  when he hinted at an asylum i gave him a look that would have been a fierce word for another man  he never spoke of it again  one night in august there was a dull murky sunset after a dead breathless day of heat with not a wind stirring  the sea was not blue as a sea should be but pinkall pinka ghastly staring painted pink  i lingered on the harbor shore below the house until dark  the evening bells were ringing faintly and mournfully in a church across the harbor  behind me in the kitchen i heard my wife singing  sometimes now her spirits were fitfully high and then she would sing the old songs of her girlhood  but even in her singing was something strange as if a wailing unearthly cry rang through it  nothing about her was sadder than that strange singing  when i went back to the house the rain was beginning to fall but there was no wind or sound in the aironly that dismal stillness as if the world were holding its breath in expectation of a calamity  josie was standing by the window looking out and listening  i tried to induce her to go to bed but she only shook her head  i might fall asleep and not hear him when he called she said i am always afraid to sleep now for fear he should call and his mother fail to hear him  knowing it was of no use to entreat i sat down by the table and tried to read  three hours passed on  when the clock struck midnight she started up with the wild light in her sunken blue eyes  he is calling she cried calling out there in the storm yes yes sweet i am coming  she opened the door and fled down the path to the shore  i snatched a lantern from the wall lighted it and followed  it was the blackest night i was ever out in dark with the very darkness of death  the rain fell thickly and heavily  i overtook josie caught her hand and stumbled along in her wake for she went with the speed and recklessness of a distraught woman  we moved in the little flitting circle of light shed by the lantern  all around us and above us was a horrible voiceless darkness held as it were at bay by the friendly light  if i could only overtake him once moaned josie  if i could just kiss him once and hold him close against my aching heart this pain that never leaves me would leave me than  oh my pretty boy wait for mother  i am coming to you  listen david he crieshe cries so pitifully listen  cant you hear it  i did hear it  clear and distinct out of the deadly still darkness before us came a faint wailing cry  what was it  was i too going mad or was there something out theresomething that cried and moanedlonging for human love yet ever retreating from human footsteps  i am not a superstitious man but my nerve had been shaken by my long trial and i was weaker than i thought  terror took possession of meterror unnameable i trembled in every limb clammy perspiration oozed from my forehead i was possessed by a wild impulse to turn and flee anywhere away from that unearthly cry  but josephines cold hand gripped mine firmly and led me on  that strange cry still rang in my ears  but it did not recede it sounded clearer and stronger it was a wail but a loud insistent wail it was nearernearer it was in the darkness just beyond us  then we came to it a little dory had been beached on the pebbles and left there by the receding tide  there was a child in ita boy of perhaps two years old who crouched in the bottom of the dory in water to his waist his big blue eyes wild and wide with terror his face white and tearstained  he wailed again when he saw us and held out his little hands  my horror fell away from me like a discarded garment  this child was living  how he had come there whence and why i did not know and in my state of mind did not question  it was no cry of parted spirit i had heardthat was enough for me  oh the poor darling cried my wife  she stooped over the dory and lifted the baby in her arms  his long fair curls fell on her shoulder she laid her face against his and wrapped her shawl around him  let me carry him dear i said  he is very wet and too heavy for you  no no i must carry him  my arms have been so emptythey are full now  oh david the pain at my heart has gone  he has come to me to take the place of my own  god has sent him to me out of the sea  he is wet and cold and tired  hush sweet one we will go home  silently i followed her home  the wind was rising coming in sudden angry gusts the storm was at hand but we reached shelter before it broke  just as i shut our door behind us it smote the house with the roar of a baffled beast  i thanked god that we were not out in it following the dreamchild  you are very wet josie i said  go and put on dry clothes at once  the child must be looked to first she said firmly  see how chilled and exhausted he is the pretty dear  light a fire quickly david while i get dry things for him  i let her have her way  she brought out the clothes our own child had worn and dressed the waif in them rubbing his chilled limbs brushing his wet hair laughing over him mothering him she seemed like her old self  for my own part i was bewildered  all the questions i had not asked before came crowding to my mind how  whose child was this whence had he come  what was the meaning of it all  he was a pretty baby fair and plump and rosy  when he was dried and fed he fell asleep in josies arms  she hung over him in a passion of delight  it was with difficulty i persuaded her to leave him long enough to change her wet clothes  she never asked whose he might be or from where he might have come  he had been sent to her from the sea the dreamchild had led her to him that was what she believed and i dared not throw any doubt on that belief  she slept that night with the baby on her arm and in her sleep her face was the face of a girl in her youth untroubled and unworn  i expected that the morrow would bring some one seeking the baby i had come to the conclusion that he must belong to the cove across the harbor where the fishing hamlet was and all day while josie laughed and played with him i waited and listened for the footsteps of those who would come seeking him  but they did not come  day after day passed and still they did not come  i was in a maze of perplexity  what should i do  i shrank from the thought of the boy being taken away from us  since we had found him the dreamchild had never called  my wife seemed to have turned back from the dark borderland where her feet had strayed to walk again with me in our own homely paths  day and night she was her old bright self happy and serene in the new motherhood that had come to her  the only thing strange in her was her calm acceptance of the event  she never wondered who or whose the child might benever seemed to fear that he would be taken from her and she gave him our dreamchilds name  at last when a full week had passed i went in my bewilderment to our old doctor  a most extraordinary thing he said thoughtfully  the child as you say must belong to the spruce cove people  yet it is an almost unbelievable thing that there has been no search or inquiry after him  probably there is some simple explanation of the mystery however  i advise you to go over to the cove and inquire  when you find the parents or guardians of the child ask them to allow you to keep it for a time  it may prove your wifes salvation  i have known such cases  evidently on that night the crisis of her mental disorder was reached  a little thing might have sufficed to turn her feet either wayback to reason and sanity or into deeper darkness  it is my belief that the former has occurred and that if she is left in undisturbed possession of this child for a time she will recover completely  i drove around the harbor that day with a lighter heart than i had hoped ever to possess again  when i reached spruce cove the first person i met was old abel blair  i asked him if any child were missing from the cove or along shore  he looked at me in surprise shook his head and said he had not heard of any  i told him as much of the tale as was necessary leaving him to think that my wife and i had found the dory and its small passenger during an ordinary walk along the shore  a green dory he exclaimed  ben forbes old green dory has been missing for a week but it was so rotten and leaky he didnt bother looking for it  but this child sirit beats me  what might he be like  i described the child as closely as possible  that fits little harry martin to a hair said old abel perplexedly but sir it cant be  or if it is theres been foul work somewhere  james martins wife died last winter sir and he died the next month  they left a baby and not much else there werent nobody to take the child but jims halfsister maggie fleming  she lived here at the cove and im sorry to say sir she hadnt too good a name  she didnt want to be bothered with the baby and folks say she neglected him scandalous  well last spring she begun talking of going away to the states  she said a friend of hers had got her a good place in boston and she was going to go and take little harry  we supposed it was all right  last saturday she went sir  she was going to walk to the station and the last seen of her she was trudging along the road carrying the baby  it hasnt been thought of since  but sir dye suppose she set that innocent child adrift in that old leaky dory to send him to his death  i knew maggie was no better than she should be but i cant believe she was as bad as that  you must come over with me and see if you can identify the child i said  if he is harry martin i shall keep him  my wife has been very lonely since our baby died and she has taken a fancy to this little chap  when we reached my home old abel recognized the child as harry martin  he is with us still  his baby hands led my dear wife back to health and happiness  other children have come to us she loves them all dearly but the boy who bears her dead sons name is to heraye and to meas dear as if she had given him birth  he came from the sea and at his coming the ghostly dreamchild fled nevermore to lure my wife away from me with its exciting cry  therefore i look upon him and love him as my firstborn    vi the brother who failed  the monroe family were holding a christmas reunion at the old prince edward island homestead at white sands  it was the first time they had all been together under one roof since the death of their mother thirty years before  the idea of this christmas reunion had originated with edith monroe the preceding spring during her tedious convalescence from a bad attack of pneumonia among strangers in an american city where she had not been able to fill her concert engagements and had more spare time in which to feel the tug of old ties and the homesick longing for her own people than she had had for years  as a result when she recovered she wrote to her second brother james monroe who lived on the homestead and the consequence was this gathering of the monroes under the old rooftree  ralph monroe for once laid aside the cares of his railroads and the deceitfulness of his millions in toronto and took the longpromised longdeferred trip to the homeland  malcolm monroe journeyed from the far western university of which he was president  edith came flushed with the triumph of her latest and most successful concert tour  mrs woodburn who had been margaret monroe came from the nova scotia town where she lived a busy happy life as the wife of a rising young lawyer  james prosperous and hearty greeted them warmly at the old homestead whose fertile acres had well repaid his skillful management  they were a merry party casting aside their cares and years and harking back to joyous boyhood and girlhood once more  james had a family of rosy lads and lasses margaret brought her two blueeyed little girls ralphs dark cleverlooking son accompanied him and malcolm brought his a young man with a resolute face in which there was less of boyishness than in his fathers and the eyes of a keen perhaps a hard bargainer  the two cousins were the same age to a day and it was a family joke among the monroes that the stork must have mixed the babies since ralphs son was like malcolm in face and brain while malcolms boy was a second edition of his uncle ralph  to crown all aunt isabel came tooa talkative clever shrewd old lady as young at eightyfive as she had been at thirty thinking the monroe stock the best in the world and beamingly proud of her nephews and nieces who had gone out from this humble little farm to destinies of such brilliance and influence in the world beyond  i have forgotten robert  robert monroe was apt to be forgotten although he was the oldest of the family white sands people in naming over the various members of the monroe family would add and robert in a tone of surprise over the remembrance of his existence  he lived on a poor sandy little farm down by the shore but he had come up to james place on the evening when the guests arrived they had all greeted him warmly and joyously and then did not think about him again in their laughter and conversation robert sat back in a corner and listened with a smile but he never spoke  afterwards he had slipped noiselessly away and gone home and nobody noticed his going  they were all gayly busy recalling what had happened in the old times and telling what had happened in the new  edith recounted the successes of her concert tours malcolm expatiated proudly on his plans for developing his beloved college ralph described the country through which his new railroad ran and the difficulties he had had to overcome in connection with it  james aside discussed his orchard and his crops with margaret who had not been long enough away from the farm to lose touch with its interests  aunt isabel knitted and smiled complacently on all talking now with one now with the other secretly quite proud of herself that she an old woman of eightyfive who had seldom been out of white sands in her life could discuss high finance with ralph and higher education with malcolm and hold her own with james in an argument on drainage  the white sands school teacher an archeyed redmouthed bit a girla bell from avonleawho boarded with the james monroes amused herself with the boys  all were enjoying themselves hugely so it is not to be wondered at that they did not miss robert who had gone home early because his old housekeeper was nervous if left alone at night  he came again the next afternoon  from james in the barnyard he learned that malcolm and ralph had driven to the harbor that margaret and mrs james had gone to call on friends in avonlea and that edith was walking somewhere in the woods on the hill there was nobody in the house except aunt isabel and the teacher  youd better wait and stay the evening said james indifferently  theyll all be back soon  robert went across the yard and sat down on the rustic bench in the angle of the front porch  it was a fine december evening as mild as autumn there had been no snow and the long fields sloping down from the homestead were brown and mellow  a weird dreamy stillness had fallen upon the purple earth the windless woods the rain of the valleys the sere meadows  nature seemed to have folded satisfied hands to rest knowing that her long wintry slumber was coming upon her out to sea a dull red sunset faded out into somber clouds and the ceaseless voice of many waters came up from the tawny shore  robert rested his chin on his hand and looked across the vales and hills where the feathery gray of leafless hardwoods was mingled with the sturdy unfailing green of the conebearers  he was a tall bent man with thin gray hair a lined face and deeplyset gentle brown eyesthe eyes of one who looking through pain sees rapture beyond  he felt very happy  he loved his family clannishly and he was rejoiced that they were all again near to him  he was proud of their success and fame  he was glad that james had prospered so well of late years  there was no canker of envy or discontent in his soul  he heard absently indistinct voices at the open hall window above the porch where aunt isabel was talking to kathleen bell presently aunt isabel moved nearer to the window and her words came down to robert with startling clearness  yes i can assure you miss bell that im real proud of my nephews and nieces  theyre a smart family  theyve almost all done well and they hadnt any of them much to begin with  ralph had absolutely nothing and today he is a millionaire  their father met with so many losses what with his illhealth and the bank failing that he couldnt help them any  but theyve all succeeded except poor robertand i must admit that hes a total failure  oh no no said the little teacher deprecatingly  a total failure  aunt isabel repeated her words emphatically she was not going to be contradicted by anybody least of all a bell from avonlea  he has been a failure since the time he was born  he is the first monroe to disgrace the old stock that way im sure his brothers and sisters must be dreadfully ashamed of him  he has lived sixty years and he hasnt done a thing worth while  he cant even make his farm pay  if hes kept out of debt its as much as hes ever managed to do  some men cant even do that murmured the little school teacher  she was really so much in awe of this imperious clever old aunt isabel that it was positive heroism on her part to venture even this faint protest  more is expected of a monroe said aunt isabel majestically robert monroe is a failure and that is the only name for him  robert monroe stood up below the window in a dizzy uncertain fashion  aunt isabel had been speaking of him  he robert was a failure a disgrace to his blood of whom his nearest and dearest were ashamed  yes it was true he had never realized it before he had known that he could never win power or accumulate riches but he had not thought that mattered much  now through aunt isabels scornful eyes he saw himself as the world saw himas his brothers and sisters must see him  there lay the sting  what the world thought of him did not matter but that his own should think him a failure and disgrace was agony  he moaned as he started to walk across the yard only anxious to hide his pain and shame away from all human sight and in his eyes was the look of a gentle animal which had been stricken by a cruel and unexpected blow  edith monroe who unaware of roberts proximity had been standing on the other side of the porch saw that look as he hurried past her unseeing  a moment before her dark eyes had been flashing with anger at aunt isabels words now the anger was drowned in a sudden rush of tears  she took a quick step after robert but checked the impulse  not thenand not by her alonecould that deadly hurt be healed nay more robert must never suspect that she knew of any hurt she stood and watched him through her tears as he went away across the lowlying shore fields to hide his broken heart under his own humble roof  she yearned to hurry after him and comfort him but she knew that comfort was not what robert needed now justice and justice only could pluck out the sting which otherwise must rankle to the death  ralph and malcolm were driving into the yard  edith went over to them  boys she said resolutely i want to have a talk with you   the christmas dinner at the old homestead was a merry one  mrs james spread a feast that was fit for the halls of lucullus laughter jest and repartee flew from lip to lip  nobody appeared to notice that robert ate little said nothing and sat with his form shrinking in his shabby best suit his gray head bent even lower than usual as if desirous of avoiding all observation  when the others spoke to him he answered deprecatingly and shrank still further into himself  finally all had eaten all they could and the remainder of the plum pudding was carried out  robert gave a low sigh of relief it was almost over  soon he would be able to escape and hide himself and his shame away from the mirthful eyes of these men and women who had earned the right to laugh at the world in which their success gave them power and influence  heheonlywas a failure  he wondered impatiently why mrs james did not rise  mrs james merely leaned comfortably back in her chair with the righteous expression of one who has done her duty by her fellow creatures palates and looked at malcolm  malcolm rose in his place  silence fell on the company everybody looked suddenly alert and expectant except robert  he still sat with bowed head wrapped in his own bitterness  i have been told that i must lead off said malcolm because i am supposed to possess the gift of gab  but if i do i am not going to use it for any rhetorical effect today  simple earnest words must express the deepest feelings of the heart in doing justice to its own  brothers and sisters we meet today under our own rooftree surrounded by the benedictions of the past years  perhaps invisible guests are herethe spirits of those who founded this home and whose work on earth has long been finished  it is not amiss to hope that this is so and our family circle made indeed complete  to each one of us who are here in visible bodily presence some measure of success has fallen but only one of us has been supremely successful in the only things that really countthe things that count for eternity as well as timesympathy and unselfishness and selfsacrifice  i shall tell you my own story for the benefit of those who have not heard it  when i was a lad of sixteen i started to work out my own education  some of you will remember that old mr blair of avonlea offered me a place in his store for the summer at wages which would go far towards paying my expenses at the country academy the next winter  i went to work eager and hopeful  all summer i tried to do my faithful best for my employer  in september the blow fell  a sum of money was missing from mr blairs till  i was suspected and discharged in disgrace  all my neighbors believed me guilty even some of my own family looked upon me with suspicionnor could i blame them for the circumstantial evidence was strongly against me  ralph and james looked ashamed edith and margaret who had not been born at the time referred to lifted their faces innocently robert did not move or glance up  he hardly seemed to be listening  i was crushed in an agony of shame and despair continued malcolm  i believed my career was ruined  i was bent on casting all my ambitions behind me and going west to some place where nobody knew me or my disgrace  but there was one person who believed in my innocence who said to me you shall not give upyou shall not behave as if you were guilty  you are innocent and in time your innocence will be proved  meanwhile show yourself a man  you have nearly enough to pay your way next winter at the academy  i have a little i can give to help you out  dont give innever give in when you have done no wrong  i listened and took his advice  i went to the academy  my story was there as soon as i was and i found myself sneered at and shunned  many a time i would have given up in despair had it not been for the encouragement of my counselor  he furnished the backbone for me  i was determined that his belief in me should be justified  i studied hard and came out at the head of my class  then there seemed to be no chance of my earning any more money that summer  but a farmer at newbridge who cared nothing about the character of his help if he could get the work out of them offered to hire me  the prospect was distasteful but urged by the man who believed in me i took the place and endured the hardships  another winter of lonely work passed at the academy  i won the farrell scholarship the last year it was offered and that meant an arts course for me  i went to redmond college  my story was not openly known there but something of it got abroad enough to taint my life there also with its suspicion  but the year i graduated mr blairs nephew who as you know was the real culprit confessed his guilt and i was cleared before the world  since then my career has been what is called a brilliant one  butmalcolm turned and laid his hand on roberts thin shoulderall of my success i owe to my brother robert  it is his successnot mineand here today since we have agreed to say what is too often left to be said over a coffin lid i thank him for all he did for me and tell him that there is nothing i am more proud of and thankful for than such a brother  robert had looked up at last amazed bewildered incredulous his face crimsoned as malcolm sat down  but now ralph was getting up  i am no orator as malcolm is he quoted gayly but ive got a story to tell too which only one of you knows  forty years ago when i started in life as a business man money wasnt so plentiful with me as it may be today  and i needed it badly  a chance came my way to make a pile of it  it wasnt a clean chance  it was a dirty chance  it looked square on the surface but underneath it meant trickery and roguery  i hadnt enough perception to see that thoughi was fool enough to think it was all right  i told robert what i meant to do  and robert saw clear through the outward sham to the real hideous thing underneath  he showed me what it meant and he gave me a preachment about a few monroe traditions of truth and honor  i saw what i had been about to do as he saw itas all good men and true must see it  and i vowed then and there that id never go into anything that i wasnt sure was fair and square and clean through and through  ive kept that vow  i am a rich man and not a dollar of my money is tainted money  but i didnt make it  robert really made every cent of my money  if it hadnt been for him id have been a poor man today or behind prison bars as are the other men who went into that deal when i backed out  ive got a son here  i hope hell be as clever as his uncle malcolm but i hope still more earnestly that hell be as good and honorable a man as his uncle robert  by this time roberts head was bent again and his face buried in his hands  my turn next said james  i havent much to sayonly this after mother died i took typhoid fever  here i was with no one to wait on me  robert came and nursed me  he was the most faithful tender gentle nurse ever a man had  the doctor said robert saved my life  i dont suppose any of the rest of us here can say we have saved a life  edith wiped away her tears and sprang up impulsively  years ago she said there was a poor ambitious girl who had a voice  she wanted a musical education and her only apparent chance of obtaining it was to get a teachers certificate and earn money enough to have her voice trained  she studied hard but her brains in mathematics at least werent as good as her voice and the time was short  she failed  she was lost in disappointment and despair for that was the last year in which it was possible to obtain a teachers certificate without attending queens academy and she could not afford that  then her oldest brother came to her and told her he could spare enough money to send her to the conservatory of music in halifax for a year  he made her take it  she never knew till long afterwards that he had sold the beautiful horse which he loved like a human creature to get the money  she went to the halifax conservatory  she won a musical scholarship  she has had a happy life and a successful career  and she owes it all to her brother robert  but edith could go no further  her voice failed her and she sat down in tears  margaret did not try to stand up  i was only five when my mother died she sobbed  robert was both father and mother to me  never had child or girl so wise and loving a guardian as he was to me  i have never forgotten the lessons he taught me  whatever there is of good in my life or character i owe to him  i was often headstrong and willful but he never lost patience with me  i owe everything to robert  suddenly the little teacher rose with wet eyes and crimson cheeks  i have something to say too she said resolutely  you have spoken for yourselves  i speak for the people of white sands there is a man in this settlement whom everybody loves  i shall tell you some of the things he has done  last fall in an october storm the harbor lighthouse flew a flag of distress  only one man was brave enough to face the danger of sailing to the lighthouse to find out what the trouble was  that was robert monroe  he found the keeper alone with a broken leg and he sailed back and madeyes made the unwilling and terrified doctor go with him to the lighthouse  i saw him when he told the doctor he must go and i tell you that no man living could have set his will against robert monroes at that moment  four years ago old sarah cooper was to be taken to the poorhouse  she was brokenhearted  one man took the poor bedridden fretful old creature into his home paid for medical attendance and waited on her himself when his housekeeper couldnt endure her tantrums and temper  sarah cooper died two years afterwards and her latest breath was a benediction on robert monroethe best man god ever made  eight years ago jack blewitt wanted a place  nobody would hire him because his father was in the penitentiary and some people thought jack ought to be there too  robert monroe hired himand helped him and kept him straight and got him started rightand jack blewitt is a hardworking respected young man today with every prospect of a useful and honorable life there is hardly a man woman or child in white sands who doesnt owe something to robert monroe  as kathleen bell sat down malcolm sprang up and held out his hands  every one of us stand up and sing auld lang syne he cried  everybody stood up and joined hands but one did not sing robert monroe stood erect with a great radiance on his face and in his eyes  his reproach had been taken away he was crowned among his kindred with the beauty and blessing of sacred yesterdays  when the singing ceased malcolms sternfaced son reached over and shook roberts hands  uncle rob he said heartily i hope that when im sixty ill be as successful a man as you   i guess said aunt isabel aside to the little school teacher as she wiped the tears from her keen old eyes that theres a kind of failure thats the best success    vii the return of hester  just at dusk that evening i had gone upstairs and put on my muslin gown  i had been busy all day attending to the strawberry preservingfor mary sloane could not be trusted with thatand i was a little tired and thought it was hardly worth while to change my dress especially since there was nobody to see or care since hester was gone  mary sloane did not count  but i did it because hester would have cared if she had been here  she always liked to see me neat and dainty  so although i was tired and sick at heart i put on my pale blue muslin and dressed my hair  at first i did my hair up in a way i had always liked but had seldom worn because hester had disapproved of it  it became me but i suddenly felt as if it were disloyal to her so i took the puffs down again and arranged my hair in the plain oldfashioned way she had liked  my hair though it had a good many gray threads in it was thick and long and brown still but that did not matternothing mattered since hester was dead and i had sent hugh blair away for the second time  the newbridge people all wondered why i had not put on mourning for hester  i did not tell them it was because hester had asked me not to  hester had never approved of mourning she said that if the heart did not mourn crape would not mend matters and if it did there was no need of the external trappings of woe  she told me calmly the night before she died to go on wearing my pretty dresses just as i had always worn them and to make no difference in my outward life because of her going  i know there will be a difference in your inward life she said wistfully  and oh there was  but sometimes i wondered uneasily feeling almost consciencestricken whether it were wholly because hester had left mewhether it were no partly because for a second time i had shut the door of my heart in the face of love at her bidding  when i had dressed i went downstairs to the front door and sat on the sandstone steps under the arch of the virginia creeper  i was all alone for mary sloane had gone to avonlea  it was a beautiful night the full moon was just rising over the wooded hills and her light fell through the poplars into the garden before me  through an open corner on the western side i saw the sky all silvery blue in the afterlight  the garden was very beautiful just then for it was the time of the roses and ours were all outso many of themgreat pink and red and white and yellow roses  hester had loved roses and could never have enough of them  her favorite bush was growing by the steps all gloried over with blossomswhite with pale pink hearts  i gathered a cluster and pinned it loosely on my breast  but my eyes filled as i did soi felt so very very desolate  i was all alone and it was bitter  the roses much as i loved them could not give me sufficient companionship  i wanted the clasp of a human hand and the lovelight in human eyes  and then i fell to thinking of hugh though i tried not to  i had always lived alone with hester  i did not remember our parents who had died in my babyhood  hester was fifteen years older than i and she had always seemed more like a mother than a sister  she had been very good to me and had never denied me anything i wanted save the one thing that mattered  i was twentyfive before i ever had a lover  this was not i think because i was more unattractive than other women  the merediths had always been the big family of newbridge  the rest of the people looked up to us because we were the granddaughters of old squire meredith  the newbridge young men would have thought it no use to try to woo a meredith  i had not a great deal of family pride as perhaps i should be ashamed to confess  i found our exalted position very lonely and cared more for the simple joys of friendship and companionship which other girls had  but hester possessed it in a double measure she never allowed me to associate on a level of equality with the young people of newbridge  we must be very nice and kind and affable to themnoblesse oblige as it werebut we must never forget that we were merediths  when i was twentyfive hugh blair came to newbridge having bought a farm near the village  he was a stranger from lower carmody and so was not imbued with any preconceptions of meredith superiority  in his eyes i was just a girl like othersa girl to be wooed and won by any man of clean life and honest heart  i met him at a little sundayschool picnic over at avonlea which i attended because of my class  i thought him very handsome and manly  he talked to me a great deal and at last he drove me home  the next sunday evening he walked up from church with me  hester was away or of course this would never have happened she had gone for a months visit to distant friends  in that month i lived a lifetime  hugh blair courted me as the other girls in newbridge were courted  he took me out driving and came to see me in the evenings which we spent for the most part in the garden  i did not like the stately gloom and formality of our old meredith parlor and hugh never seemed to feel at ease there  his broad shoulders and hearty laughter were oddly out of place among our faded oldmaidish furnishings  mary sloane was very much pleased at hughs visit  she had always resented the fact that i had never had a beau seeming to think it reflected some slight or disparagement upon me  she did all she could to encourage him  but when hester returned and found out about hugh she was very angryand grieved which hurt me far more  she told me that i had forgotten myself and that hughs visits must cease  i had never been afraid of hester before but i was afraid of her then  i yielded  perhaps it was very weak of me but then i was always weak  i think that was why hughs strength had appealed so to me  i needed love and protection  hester strong and selfsufficient had never felt such a need  she could not understand  oh how contemptuous she was  i told hugh timidly that hester did not approve of our friendship and that it must end  he took it quietly enough and went away i thought he did not care much and the thought selfishly made my own heartache worse  i was very unhappy for a long time but i tried not to let hester see it and i dont think she did  she was not very discerning in some things  after a time i got over it that is the heartache ceased to ache all the time  but things were never quite the same again  life always seemed rather dreary and empty in spite of hester and my roses and my sundayschool  i supposed that hugh blair would find him a wife elsewhere but he did not  the years went by and we never met although i saw him often at church  at such times hester always watched me very closely but there was no need of her to do so  hugh made no attempt to meet me or speak with me and i would not have permitted it if he had  but my heart always yearned after him i was selfishly glad he had not married because if he had i could not have thought and dreamed of himit would have been wrong  perhaps as it was it was foolish but it seemed to me that i must have something if only foolish dreams to fill my life  at first there was only pain in the thought of him but afterwards a faint misty little pleasure crept in like a mirage from a land of lost delight  ten years slipped away thus  and then hester died  her illness was sudden and short but before she died she asked me to promise that i would never marry hugh blair  she had not mentioned his name for years  i thought she had forgotten all about him  oh dear sister is there any need of such a promise i asked weeping  hugh blair does not want to marry me now  he never will again  he has never marriedhe has not forgotten you she said fiercely  i could not rest in my grave if i thought you would disgrace your family by marrying beneath you  promise me margaret  i promised  i would have promised anything in my power to make her dying pillow easier  besides what did it matter  i was sure that hugh would never think of me again  she smiled when she heard me and pressed my hand  good little sisterthat is right  you were always a good girl margaretgood and obedient though a little sentimental and foolish in some ways  you are like our mothershe was always weak and loving  i took after the merediths  she did indeed  even in her coffin her dark handsome features preserved their expression of pride and determination  somehow that last look of her dead face remained in my memory blotting out the real affection and gentleness which her living face had almost always shown me  this distressed me but i could not help it  i wished to think of her as kind and loving but i could remember only the pride and coldness with which she had crushed out my newborn happiness  yet i felt no anger or resentment towards her for what she had done  i knew she had meant it for the bestmy best  it was only that she was mistaken  and then a month after she had died hugh blair came to me and asked me to be his wife  he said he had always loved me and could never love any other woman  all my old love for him reawakened  i wanted to say yesto feel his strong arms about me and the warmth of his love enfolding and guarding me  in my weakness i yearned for his strength  but there was my promise to hesterthat promise give by her deathbed  i could not break it and i told him so  it was the hardest thing i had ever done  he did not go away quietly this time  he pleaded and reasoned and reproached  every word of his hurt me like a knifethrust but i could not break my promise to the dead  if hester had been living i would have braved her wrath and her estrangement and gone to him  but she was dead and i could not do it  finally he went away in grief and anger  that was three weeks agoand now i sat alone in the moonlit rosegarden and wept for him  but after a time my tears dried and a very strange feeling came over me  i felt calm and happy as if some wonderful love and tenderness were very near me  and now comes the strange part of my storythe part which will not i suppose be believed  if it were not for one thing i think i should hardly believe it myself  i should feel tempted to think i had dreamed it  but because of that one thing i know it was real  the night was very calm and still  not a breath of wind stirred  the moonshine was the brightest i had ever seen in the middle of the garden where the shadow of the poplars did not fall it was almost as bright as day  one could have read fine print  there was still a little rose glow in the west and over the airy boughs of the tall poplars one or two large bright stars were shining  the air was sweet with a hush of dreams and the world was so lovely that i held my breath over its beauty  then all at once down at the far end of the garden i saw a woman walking  i thought at first that it must be mary sloane but as she crossed a moonlit path i saw it was not our old servants stout homely figure  this woman was tall and erect  although no suspicion of the truth came to me something about her reminded me of hester  even so had hester liked to wander about the garden in the twilight  i had seen her thus a thousand times  i wondered who the woman could be  some neighbor of course but what a strange way for her to come  she walked up the garden slowly in the poplar shade  now and then she stooped as if to caress a flower but she plucked none  half way up she out in to the moonlight and walked across the plot of grass in the center of the garden  my heart gave a great throb and i stood up  she was quite near to me nowand i saw that it was hester  i can hardly say just what my feelings were at this moment  i know that i was not surprised  i was frightened and yet i was not frightened  something in me shrank back in a sickening terror but i the real i was not frightened  i knew that this was my sister and that there could be no reason why i should be frightened of her because she loved me still as she had always done  further than this i was not conscious of any coherent thought either of wonder or attempt at reasoning  hester paused when she came to within a few steps of me  in the moonlight i saw her face quite plainly  it wore an expression i had never before seen on ita humble wistful tender look often in life hester had looked lovingly even tenderly upon me but always as it were through a mask of pride and sternness this was gone now and i felt nearer to her than ever before  i knew suddenly that she understood me  and then the halfconscious awe and terror some part of me had felt vanished and i only realized that hester was here and that there was no terrible gulf of change between us  hester beckoned to me and said  come  i stood up and followed her out of the garden  we walked side by side down our lane under the willows and out to the road which lay long and still in that bright calm moonshine  i felt as if i were in a dream moving at the bidding of a will not my own which i could not have disputed even if i had wished to do so but i did not wish it i had only the feeling of a strange boundless content  we went down the road between the growths of young fir that bordered it  i smelled their balsam as we passed and noticed how clearly and darkly their pointed tops came out against the sky  i heard the tread of my own feet on little twigs and plants in our way and the trail of my dress over the grass but hester moved noiselessly  then we went through the avenuethat stretch of road under the apple trees that anne shirley over at avonlea calls the white way of delight it was almost dark here and yet i could see hesters face just as plainly as if the moon were shining on it and whenever i looked at her she was always looking at me with that strangely gentle smile on her lips  just as we passed out of the avenue james trent overtook us driving  it seems to me that our feelings at a given moment are seldom what we would expect them to be  i simply felt annoyed that james trent the most notorious gossip in newbridge should have seen me walking with hester  in a flash i anticipated all the annoyance of it he would talk of the matter far and wide  but james trent merely nodded and called out  howdy miss margaret  taking a moonlight stroll by yourself lovely night aint it  just then his horse suddenly swerved as if startled and broke into a gallop  they whirled around the curve of the road in an instant  i felt relieved but puzzled  james trent had not seen hester  down over the hill was hugh blairs place  when we came to it hester turned in at the gate  then for the first time i understood why she had come back and a blinding flash of joy broke over my soul  i stopped and looked at her  her deep eyes gazed into mine but she did not speak  we went on hughs house lay before us in the moonlight grown over by a tangle of vines  his garden was on our right a quaint spot full of oldfashioned flowers growing in a sort of disorderly sweetness  i trod on a bed of mint and the spice of it floated up to me like the incense of some strange sacred solemn ceremonial  i felt unspeakably happy and blessed  when we came to the door hester said  knock margaret  i rapped gently  in a moment hugh opened it  then that happened by which in after days i was to know that this strange thing was no dream or fancy of mine  hugh looked not at me but past me  hester he exclaimed with human fear and horror in his voice  he leaned against the doorpost the big strong fellow trembling from head to foot  i have learned said hester that nothing matters in all gods universe except love  there is no pride where i have been and no false ideals  hugh and i looked into each others eyes wondering and then we knew that we were alone    viii the little brown book of miss emily  the first summer mr irving and miss lavendardiana and i could never call her anything else even after she was marriedwere at echo lodge after their marriage both diana and i spent a great deal of time with them  we became acquainted with many of the grafton people whom we had not known before and among others the family of mr mack leith  we often went up to the leiths in the evening to play croquet  millie and margaret leith were very nice girls and the boys were nice too  indeed we liked every one in the family except poor old miss emily leith  we tried hard enough to like her because she seemed to like diana and me very much and always wanted to sit with us and talk to us when we would much rather have been somewhere else  we often felt a good deal of impatience at these times but i am very glad to think now that we never showed it  in a way we felt sorry for miss emily  she was mr leiths oldmaid sister and she was not of much importance in the household  but though we felt sorry for her we couldnt like her  she really was fussy and meddlesome she liked to poke a finger into every ones pie and she was not at all tactful then too she had a sarcastic tongue and seemed to feel bitter towards all the young folks and their love affairs  diana and i thought this was because she had never had a lover of her own  somehow it seemed impossible to think of lovers in connection with miss emily  she was short and stout and pudgy with a face so round and fat and red that it seemed quite featureless and her hair was scanty and gray  she walked with a waddle just like mrs rachel lynde and she was always rather short of breath  it was hard to believe miss emily had ever been young yet old mr murray who lived next door to the leiths not only expected us to believe it but assured us that she had been very pretty  that at least is impossible said diana to me  and then one day miss emily died  im afraid no one was very sorry  it seems to me a most dreadful thing to go out of the world and leave not one person behind to be sorry because you have gone  miss emily was dead and buried before diana and i heard of it at all  the first i knew of it was when i came home from orchard slope one day and found a queer shabby little black horsehair trunk all studded with brass nails on the floor of my room at green gables  marilla told me that jack leith had brought it over and said that it had belonged to miss emily and that when she was dying she asked them to send it to me  but what is in it  and what am i to do with it i asked in bewilderment  there was nothing said about what you were to do with it  jack said they didnt know what was in it and hadnt looked into it seeing that it was your property  it seems a rather queer proceedingbut youre always getting mixed up in queer proceedings anne  as for what is in it the easiest way to find out i reckon is to open it and see  the key is tied to it jack said miss emily said she wanted you to have it because she loved you and saw her lost youth in you  i guess she was a bit delirious at the last and wandered a good deal  she said she wanted you to understand her   i ran over to orchard slope and asked diana to come over and examine the trunk with me  i hadnt received any instructions about keeping its contents secret and i knew miss emily wouldnt mind diana knowing about them whatever they were  it was a cool gray afternoon and we got back to green gables just as the rain was beginning to fall  when we went up to my room the wind was rising and whistling through the boughs of the big old snow queen outside of my window  diana was excited and i really believe a little bit frightened  we opened the old trunk  it was very small and there was nothing in it but a big cardboard box  the box was tied up and the knots sealed with wax  we lifted it out and untied it  i touched dianas fingers as we did it and both of us exclaimed at once how cold your hand is  in the box was a quaint pretty oldfashioned gown not at all faded made of blue muslin with a little darker blue flower in it  under it we found a sash a yellowed feather fan and an envelope full of withered flowers  at the bottom of the box was a little brown book  it was small and thin like a girls exercise book with leaves that had once been blue and pink but were now quite faded and stained in places  on the fly leaf was written in a very delicate hand emily margaret leith and the same writing covered the first few pages of the book  the rest were not written on at all  we sat there on the floor diana and i and read the little book together while the rain thudded against the window panes                                                     june 19 18      i came today to spend a while with aunt margaret in     charlottetown  it is so pretty here where she livesand     ever so much nicer than on the farm at home  i have no cows     to milk here or pigs to feed  aunt margaret has given me     such a lovely blue muslin dress and i am to have it made to     wear at a garden party out at brighton next week  i never     had a muslin dress beforenothing but ugly prints and dark     woolens  i wish we were rich like aunt margaret  aunt     margaret laughed when i said this and declared she would     give all her wealth for my youth and beauty and     lightheartedness  i am only eighteen and i know i am very     merry but i wonder if i am really pretty  it seems to me     that i am when i look in aunt margarets beautiful mirrors     they make me look very different from the old cracked one in     my room at home which always twisted my face and turned me     green  but aunt margaret spoiled her compliment by telling     me i look exactly as she did at my age  if i thought id     ever look as aunt margaret does now i dont know what id     do  she is so fat and red                                                          june 29      last week i went to the garden party and i met a young man     called paul osborne  he is a young artist from montreal who     is boarding over at heppoch  he is the handsomest man i have     ever seenvery tall and slender with dreamy dark eyes and     a pale clever face  i have not been able to keep from     thinking about him ever since and today he came over here     and asked if he could paint me  i felt very much flattered     and so pleased when aunt margaret gave him permission  he     says he wants to paint me as spring standing under the     poplars where a fine rain of sunshine falls through  i am to     wear my blue muslin gown and a wreath of flowers on my hair     he says i have such beautiful hair  he has never seen any of     such a real pale gold  somehow it seems even prettier than     ever to me since he praised it      i had a letter from home today  ma says the blue hen stole     her nest and came off with fourteen chickens and that pa has     sold the little spotted calf  somehow those things dont     interest me like they once did                                                           july 9      the picture is coming on very well mr osborne says  i know     he is making me look far too pretty in it although her     persists in saying he cant do me justice  he is going to     send it to some great exhibition when finished but he says     he will make a little watercolor copy for me      he comes every day to paint and we talk a great deal and he     reads me lovely things out of his books  i dont understand     them all but i try to and he explains them so nicely and is     so patient with my stupidity  and he says any one with my     eyes and hair and coloring does not need to be clever  he     says i have the sweetest merriest laugh in the world  but i     will not write down all the compliments he has paid me  i     dare say he does not mean them at all      in the evening we stroll among the spruces or sit on the     bench under the acacia tree  sometimes we dont talk at all     but i never find the time long  indeed the minutes just     seem to flyand then the moon will come up round and red     over the harbor and mr osborne will sigh and say he supposes     it is time for him to go                                                          july 24      i am so happy  i am frightened at my happiness  oh i     didnt think life could ever be so beautiful for me as it is      paul loves me  he told me so tonight as we walked by the     harbor and watched the sunset and he asked me to be his     wife  i have cared for him ever since i met him but i am     afraid i am not clever and welleducated enough for a wife     for paul  because of course im only an ignorant little     country girl and have lived all my life on a farm  why my     hands are quite rough yet from the work ive done  but paul     just laughed when i said so and took my hands and kissed     them  then he looked into my eyes and laughed again because     i couldnt hide from him how much i loved him      we are to be married next spring and paul says he will take     me to europe  that will be very nice but nothing matters so     long as i am with him      pauls people are very wealthy and his mother and sisters are     very fashionable  i am frightened of them but i did not     tell paul so because i think it would hurt him and oh i     wouldnt do that for the world      there is nothing i wouldnt suffer if it would do him any     good  i never thought any one could feel so  i used to     think if i loved anybody i would want him to do everything     for me and wait on me as if i were a princess  but that is     not the way at all  love makes you very humble and you want     to do everything yourself for the one you love                                                        august 10      paul went home today  oh it is so terrible  i dont know     how i can bear to live even for a little while without him     but this is silly of me because i know he has to go and he     will write often and come to me often  but still it is so     lonesome  i didnt cry when he left me because i wanted him     to remember me smiling in the way he liked best but i have     been crying ever since and i cant stop no matter how hard i     try  we have had such a beautiful fortnight  every day     seemed dearer and happier than the last and now it is ended     and i feel as if it could never be the same again  oh i am     very foolishbut i love him so dearly and if i were to lose     his love i know i would die                                                        august 17      i think my heart is dead  but no it cant be for it aches     too much      pauls mother came here to see me today  she was not angry     or disagreeable  i wouldnt have been so frightened of her     if she had been  as it was i felt that i couldnt say a     word  she is very beautiful and stately and wonderful with     a low cold voice and proud dark eyes  her face is like     pauls but without the loveableness of his      she talked to me for a long time and she said terrible     thingsterrible because i knew they were all true  i     seemed to see everything through her eyes  she said that     paul was infatuated with my youth and beauty but that it     would not last and what else i to give him  she said paul     must marry a woman of his own class who could do honor to     his fame and position  she said that he was very talented     and had a great career before him but that if he married me     it would ruin his life      i saw it all just as she explained it out and i told her at     last that i would not marry paul and she might tell him so     but she smiled and said i must tell him myself because he     would not believe any one else  i could have begged her to     spare me that but i knew it would be of no use  i do not     think she has any pity or mercy for any one  besides what     she said was quite true      when she thanked me for being so reasonable i told her i was     not doing it to please her but for pauls sake because i     would not spoil his life and that i would always hate her     she smiled again and went away      oh how can i bear it  i did not know any one could suffer     like this                                                        august 18      i have done it  i wrote to paul today  i knew i must tell     him by letter because i could never make him believe it face     to face  i was afraid i could not even do it by letter  i     suppose a clever woman easily could but i am so stupid     i wrote a great many letters and tore them up because i felt     sure they wouldnt convince paul  at last i got one that i     thought would do  i knew i must make it seems as if i were     very frivolous and heartless or he would never believe  i     spelled some words wrong and put in some mistakes of grammar     on purpose  i told him i had just been flirting with him     and that i had another fellow at home i liked better  i said     fellow because i knew it would disgust him  i said that it     was only because he was rich that i was tempted to marry him      i thought would my heart would break while i was writing     those dreadful falsehoods  but it was for his sake because     i must not spoil his life  his mother told me i would be a     millstone around his neck  i love paul so much that i would     do anything rather than be that  it would be easy to die for     him but i dont see how i can go on living  i think my     letter will convince paul  i suppose it convinced paul because there was no further entry in the little brown book  when we had finished it the tears were running down both our faces  oh poor dear miss emily sobbed diana  im so sorry i ever thought her funny and meddlesome  she was good and strong and brave i said  i could never have been as unselfish as she was  i thought of whittiers lines      the outward wayward life we see     the hidden springs we may not know  at the back of the little brown book we found a faded watercolor sketch of a young girlsuch a slim pretty little thing with big blue eyes and lovely long rippling golden hair  paul osbornes name was written in faded ink across the corner  we put everything back in the box  then we sat for a long time by my window in silence and thought of many things until the rainy twilight came down and blotted out the world    ix saras way  the warm june sunshine was coming down through the trees white with the virginal bloom of appleblossoms and through the shining panes making a tremulous mosaic upon mrs eben andrews spotless kitchen floor  through the open door a wind fragrant from long wanderings over orchards and clover meadows drifted in and from the window mrs eben and her guest could look down over a long misty valley sloping to a sparkling sea  mrs jonas andrews was spending the afternoon with her sisterinlaw  she was a big sonsy woman with fullblown peony cheeks and large dreamy brown eyes  when she had been a slim pinkandwhite girl those eyes had been very romantic  now they were so out of keeping with the rest of her appearance as to be ludicrous  mrs eben sitting at the other end of the small teatable that was drawn up against the window was a thin little woman with a very sharp nose and light faded blue eyes  she looked like a woman whose opinions were always very decided and warranted to wear  how does sara like teaching at newbridge asked mrs jonas helping herself a second time to mrs ebens matchless black fruit cake and thereby bestowing a subtle compliment which mrs eben did not fail to appreciate  well i guess she likes it pretty wellbetter than down at white sands anyway answered mrs eben  yes i may say it suits her  of course its a long walk there and back  i think it would have been wiser for her to keep on boarding at morrisons as she did all winter but sara is bound to be home all she can  and i must say the walk seems to agree with her  i was down to see jonas aunt at newbridge last night said mrs jonas and she said shed heard that sara had made up her mind to take lige baxter at last and that they were to be married in the fall  she asked me if it was true  i said i didnt know but i hoped to mercy it was  now is it louisa  not a word of it said mrs eben sorrowfully  sara hasnt any more notion of taking lige than ever she had  im sure its not my fault  ive talked and argued till im tired  i declare to you amelia i am terribly disappointed  id set my heart on saras marrying ligeand now to think she wont  she is a very foolish girl said mrs jonas judicially  if lige baxter isnt good enough for her who is  and hes so well off said mrs eben and does such a good business and is well spoken of by every one  and that lovely new house of his at newbridge with bay windows and hardwood floors  ive dreamed and dreamed of seeing sara there as mistress  maybe youll see her there yet said mrs jonas who always took a hopeful view of everything even of saras contrariness but she felt discouraged too  well she had done her best  if lige baxters broth was spoiled it was not for lack of cooks every andrews in avonlea had been trying for two years to bring about a match between him and sara and mrs jonas had borne her part valiantly  mrs ebens despondent reply was cut short by the appearance of sara herself  the girl stood for a moment in the doorway and looked with a faintly amused air at her aunts  she knew quite well that they had been discussing her for mrs jonas who carried her conscience in her face looked guilty and mrs eben had not been able wholly to banish her aggrieved expression  sara put away her books kissed mrs jonas rosy cheek and sat down at the table  mrs eben brought her some fresh tea some hot rolls and a little jellypot of the apricot preserves sara liked and she cut some more fruit cake for her in moist plummy slices  she might be out of patience with saras contrariness but she spoiled and petted her for all that for the girl was the very core of her childless heart  sara andrews was not strictly speaking pretty but there was that about her which made people look at her twice  she was very dark with a rich dusky sort of darkness her deep eyes were velvety brown and her lips and cheeks were crimson  she ate her rolls and preserves with a healthy appetite sharpened by her long walk from newbridge and told amusing little stories of her days work that made the two older women shake with laughter and exchange shy glances of pride over her cleverness  when tea was over she poured the remaining contents of the cream jug into a saucer  i must feed my pussy she said as she left the room  that girl beats me said mrs eben with a sigh of perplexity you know that black cat weve had for two years  eben and i have always made a lot of him but sara seemed to have a dislike to him  never a peaceful nap under the stove could he have when sara was homeout he must go  well a little spell ago he got his leg broke accidentally and we thought hed have to be killed but sara wouldnt hear of it  she got splints and set his leg just as knacky and bandaged it up and she has tended him like a sick baby ever since  hes just about well now and he lives in clover that cat does  its just her way  theres them sick chickens shes been doctoring for a week giving them pills and things  and she thinks more of that wretchedlooking calf that got poisoned with paris green than of all the other stock on the place   as the summer wore away mrs eben tried to reconcile herself to the destruction of her air castles  but she scolded sara considerably  sara why dont you like lige  im sure he is a model young man  i dont like model young men answered sara impatiently  and i really think i hate lige baxter  he has always been held up to me as such a paragon  im tired of hearing about all his perfections  i know them all off by heart  he doesnt drink he doesnt smoke he doesnt steal he doesnt tell fibs he never loses his temper he doesnt swear and he goes to church regularly  such a faultless creature as that would certainly get on my nerves  no no youll have to pick out another mistress for your new house at the bridge aunt louisa  when the apple trees that had been pink and white in june were russet and bronze in october mrs eben had a quilting  the quilt was of the rising star pattern which was considered in avonlea to be very handsome  mrs eben had intended it for part of saras setting out and while she sewed the redandwhite diamonds together she had regaled her fancy by imagining she saw it spread out on the spareroom bed of the house at newbridge with herself laying her bonnet and shawl on it when she went to see sara  those bright visions had faded with the apple blossoms and mrs eben hardly had the heart to finish the quilt at all  the quilting came off on saturday afternoon when sara could be home from school  all mrs ebens particular friends were ranged around the quilt and tongues and fingers flew  sara flitted about helping her aunt with the supper preparations  she was in the room getting the custard dishes out of the cupboard when mrs george pye arrived  mrs george had a genius for being late  she was later than usual today and she looked excited  every woman around the rising star felt that mrs george had some news worth listening to and there was an expectant silence while she pulled out her chair and settled herself at the quilt  she was a tall thin woman with a long pale face and liquid green eyes  as she looked around the circle she had the air of a cat daintily licking its chops over some titbit  i suppose she said that you have heard the news  she knew perfectly well that they had not  every other woman at the frame stopped quilting  mrs eben came to the door with a pan of puffy smokinghot soda biscuits in her hand  sara stopped counting the custard dishes and turned her ripelycolored face over her shoulder  even the black cat at her feet ceased preening his fur mrs george felt that the undivided attention of her audience was hers  baxter brothers have failed she said her green eyes shooting out flashes of light  failed disgracefully  she paused for a moment but since her hearers were as yet speechless from surprise she went on  george came home from newbridge just before i left with the news  you could have knocked me down with a feather  i should have thought that firm was as steady as the rock of gibraltar but theyre ruinedabsolutely ruined  louisa dear can you find me a good needle  louisa dear had set her biscuits down with a sharp thud reckless of results  a sharp metallic tinkle sounded at the closet where sara had struck the edge of her tray against a shelf  the sound seemed to loosen the paralyzed tongues and everybody began talking and exclaiming at once  clear and shrill above the confusion rose mrs george pyes voice  yes indeed you may well say so  it is disgraceful  and to think how everybody trusted them  george will lose considerable by the crash and so will a good many folks  everything will have to gopeter baxters farm and liges grand new house  mrs peter wont carry her head so high after this ill be bound george saw lige at the bridge and he said he looked dreadful cut up and ashamed  who or whats to blame for the failure asked mrs rachel lynde sharply  she did not like mrs george pye  there are a dozen different stories on the go was the reply as far as george could make out peter baxter has been speculating with other folks money and this is the result everybody always suspected that peter was crooked but youd have thought that lige would have kept him straight  he had always such a reputation for saintliness  i dont suppose lige knew anything about it said mrs rachel indignantly  well hed ought to then  if he isnt a knave hes a fool said mrs harmon andrews who had formerly been among his warmest partisans  he should have kept watch on peter and found out how the business was being run  well sara you were the levelheadest of us allill admit that now  a nice mess it would be if you were married or engaged to lige and him left without a centeven if he can clear his character  there is a good deal of talk about peter and swindling and a lawsuit said mrs george pye quilting industriously  most of the newbridge folks think its all peters fault and that lige isnt to blame  but you cant tell  i dare say lige is as deep in the mire as peter  he was always a little too good to be wholesome i thought  there was a clink of glass at the cupboard as sara set the tray down  she came forward and stood behind mrs rachel lyndes chair resting her shapely hands on that ladys broad shoulders her face was very pale but her flashing eyes sought and faced defiantly mrs george pyes catlike orbs  her voice quivered with passion and contempt  youll all have a fling at lige baxter now that hes down  you couldnt say enough in his praise once  ill not stand by and hear it hinted that lige baxter is a swindler  you all know perfectly well that lige is as honest as the day if he is so unfortunate as to have an unprincipled brother  you mrs pye know it better than any one yet you come here and run him down the minute hes in trouble  if theres another word said here against lige baxter ill leave the room and the house till youre gone every one of you  she flashed a glance around the quilt that cowed the gossips even mrs george pyes eyes flickered and waned and quailed nothing more was said until sara had picked up her glasses and marched from the room  even then they dared not speak above a whisper  mrs pye alone smarting from snub ventured to ejaculate pity save us as sara slammed the door  for the next fortnight gossip and rumor held high carnival in avonlea and newbridge and mrs eben grew to dread the sight of a visitor  theyre bound to talk about the baxter failure and criticize lige she deplored to mrs jonas  and it riles sara up so terrible  she used to declare that she hated lige and now she wont listen to a word against him  not that i say any myself im sorry for him and i believe hes done his best  but i cant stop other people from talking  one evening harmon andrews came in with a fresh budget of news  the baxter business is pretty near wound up at last he said as he lighted his pipe  peter has got his lawsuits settled and has hushed up the talk about swindling somehow  trust him for slipping out of a scrape clean and clever he dont seem to worry any but lige looks like a walking skeleton  some folks pity him but i say he should have kept the run of things better and not have trusted everything to peter  i hear hes going out west in the spring to take up land in alberta and try his hand at farming  best thing he can do i guess  folks hereabouts have had enough of the baxter breed  newbridge will be well rid of them  sara who had been sitting in the dark corner by the stove suddenly stood up letting the black cat slip from her lap to the floor  mrs eben glanced at her apprehensively for she was afraid the girl was going to break out in a tirade against the complacent harmon  but sara only walked fiercely out of the kitchen with a sound as if she were struggling for breath  in the hall she snatched a scarf from the wall flung open the front door and rushed down the lane in the chill pure air of the autumn twilight  her heart was throbbing with the pity she always felt for bruised and baited creatures  on and on she went heedlessly intent only on walking away her pain over gray brooding fields and winding slopes and along the skirts of ruinous dusky pine woods curtained with fine spun purple gloom  her dress brushed against the brittle grasses and sere ferns and the moist night wind loosed from wild places far away blew her hair about her face  at last she came to a little rustic gate leading into a shadowy woodlane  the gate was bound with willow withes and as sara fumbled vainly at them with her chilled hands a mans firm step came up behind her and lige baxters hand closed over hers  oh lige she said with something like a sob  he opened the gate and drew her through  she left her hand in his as they walked through the lane where lissome boughs of young saplings flicked against their heads and the air was wildly sweet with the woodsy odors  its a long while since ive seen you lige sara said at last  lige looked wistfully down at her through the gloom  yes it seems very long to me sara  but i didnt think youd care to see me after what you said last spring  and you know things have been going against me  people have said hard things ive been unfortunate sara and may be too easygoing but ive been honest  dont believe folks if they tell you i wasnt  indeed i never didnot for a minute fired sara  im glad of that  im going away later on  i felt bad enough when you refused to marry me sara but its well that you didnt  im man enough to be thankful my troubles dont fall on you  sara stopped and turned to him  beyond them the lane opened into a field and a clear lake of crocus sky cast a dim light into the shadow where they stood  above it was a new moon like a gleaming silver scimitar  sara saw it was over her left shoulder and she saw liges face above her tender and troubled  lige she said softly do you love me still  you know i do said lige sadly  that was all sara wanted  with a quick movement she nestled into his arms and laid her warm tearwet cheek against his cold one   when the amazing rumor that sara was going to marry lige baxter and go out west with him circulated through the andrews clan hands were lifted and heads were shaken  mrs jonas puffed and panted up the hill to learn if it were true  she found mrs eben stitching for dear life on an irish chain quilt while sara was sewing the diamonds on another rising star with a martyrlike expression on her face  sara hated patchwork above everything else but mrs eben was mistress up to a certain point  youll have to make that quilt sara andrews  if youre going to live out on those prairies youll need piles of quilts and you shall have them if i sew my fingers to the bone  but youll have to help make them  and sara had to  when mrs jonas came mrs eben sent sara off to the postoffice to get her out of the way  i suppose its true this time said mrs jonas  yes indeed said mrs eben briskly  sara is set on it there is no use trying to move heryou know thatso ive just concluded to make the best of it  im no turncoat  lige baxter is lige baxter still neither more nor less  ive always said hes a fine young man and i say so still  after all he and sara wont be any poorer than eben and i were when we started out  mrs jonas heaved a sigh of relief  im real glad you take that view of it louisa  im not displeased either although mrs harmon would take my head off if she heard me say so  i always liked lige  but i must say im amazed too after the way sara used to rail at him  well we might have expected it said mrs eben sagely  it was always saras way  when any creature got sick or unfortunate she seemed to take it right into her heart  so you may say lige baxters failure was a success after all    x the son of his mother  thyra carewe was waiting for chester to come home she sat by the west window of the kitchen looking out into the gathering of the shadows with the expectant immovability that characterized her she never twitched or fidgeted  into whatever she did she put the whole force of her nature  if it was sitting still she sat still  a stone image would be twitchedly beside thyra said mrs cynthia white her neighbor across the lane  it gets on my nerves the way she sits at that window sometimes with no more motion than a statue and her great eyes burning down the lane when i read the commandment thou shalt have no other gods before me i declare i always think of thyra  she worships that son of hers far ahead of her creator  shell be punished for it yet  mrs white was watching thyra now knitting furiously as she watched in order to lose no time  thyras hands were folded idly in her lap  she had not moved a muscle since she sat down mrs white complained it gave her the weeps  it doesnt seem natural to see a woman sit so still she said sometimes the thought comes to me what if shes had a stroke like her old uncle horatio and is sitting there stone dead   the evening was cold and autumnal  there was a fiery red spot out at sea where the sun had set and above it over a chill clear saffron sky were reefs of purpleblack clouds  the river below the carewe homestead was livid  beyond it the sea was dark and brooding  it was an evening to make most people shiver and forebode an early winter but thyra loved it as she loved all stern harshly beautiful things  she would not light a lamp because it would blot out the savage grandeur of sea and sky  it was better to wait in the darkness until chester came home  he was late tonight  she thought he had been detained overtime at the harbor but she was not anxious  he would come straight home to her as soon as his business was completedof that she felt sure  her thoughts went out along the bleak harbor road to meet him  she could see him plainly coming with his free stride through the sandy hollows and over the windy hills in the harsh cold light of that forbidding sunset strong and handsome in his comely youth with her own deeply cleft chin and his fathers dark gray straightforward eyes  no other woman in avonlea had a son like hersher only one  in his brief absences she yearned after him with a maternal passion that had in it something of physical pain so intense was it  she thought of cynthia white knitting across the road with contemptuous pity  that woman had no sonnothing but palefaced girls  thyra had never wanted a daughter but she pitied and despised all sonless women  chesters dog whined suddenly and piercingly on the doorstep outside  he was tired of the cold stone and wanted his warm corner behind the stove  thyra smiled grimly when she heard him she had no intention of letting him in  she said she had always disliked dogs but the truth although she would not glance at it was that she hated the animal because chester loved him  she could not share his love with even a dumb brute  she loved no living creature in the world but her son and fiercely demanded a like concentrated affection from him  hence it pleased her to hear his dog whine  it was now quite dark the stars had begun to shine out over the shorn harvest fields and chester had not come  across the lane cynthia white had pulled down her blind in despair of outwatching thyra and had lighted a lamp  lively shadows of little girlshapes passed and repassed on the pale oblong of light  they made thyra conscious of her exceeding loneliness she had just decided that she would walk down the lane and wait for chester on the bridge when a thunderous knock came at the east kitchen door  she recognized august vorsts knock and lighted a lamp in no great haste for she did not like him  he was a gossip and thyra hated gossip in man or woman  but august was privileged  she carried the lamp in her hand when she went to the door and its upwardstriking light gave her face a ghastly appearance she did not mean to ask august in but he pushed past her cheerfully not waiting to be invited  he was a midget of a man lame of foot and hunched of back with a white boyish face despite his middle age and deepset malicious black eyes  he pulled a crumpled newspaper from his pocket and handed it to thyra  he was the unofficial mailcarrier of avonlea  most of the people gave him a trifle for bringing their letters and papers from the office  he earned small sums in various other ways and so contrived to keep the life in his stunted body there was always venom in augusts gossip  it was said that he made more mischief in avonlea in a day than was made otherwise in a year but people tolerated him by reason of his infirmity  to be sure it was the tolerance they gave to inferior creatures and august felt this  perhaps it accounted for a good deal of his malignity  he hated most those who were kindest to him and of these thyra carewe above all  he hated chester too as he hated strong shapely creatures  his time had come at last to wound them both and his exultation shone through his crooked body and pinched features like an illuminating lamp  thyra perceived it and vaguely felt something antagonistic in it  she pointed to the rockingchair as she might have pointed out a mat to a dog  august crawled into it and smiled  he was going to make her writhe presently this woman who looked down upon him as some venomous creeping thing she disdained to crush with her foot  did you see anything of chester on the road asked thyra giving august the very opening he desired  he went to the harbor after tea to see joe raymond about the loan of his boat but its the time he should be back  i cant think what keeps the boy  just what keeps most menleaving out creatures like meat some time or other in their lives  a girla pretty girl thyra  it pleases me to look at her  even a hunchback can use his eyes eh  oh shes a rare one  what is the man talking about said thyra wonderingly  damaris garland to be sure  chesters down at tom blairs now talking to herand looking more than his tongue says too of that you may be sure  well well we were all young once thyraall young once even crooked little august vorst  eh now  what do you mean said thyra  she had sat down in a chair before him with her hands folded in her lap  her face always pale had not changed but her lips were curiously white  august vorst saw this and it pleased him also her eyes were worth looking at if you liked to hurt peopleand that was the only pleasure august took in life  he would drink this delightful cup of revenge for her long years of disdainful kindnessah he would drink it slowly to prolong its sweetness  sip by siphe rubbed his long thin white hands togethersip by sip tasting each mouthful  eh now  you know well enough thyra  i know nothing of what you would be at august vorst  you speak of my son and damariswas that the namedamaris garland as if they were something to each other  i ask you what you mean by it  tut tut thyra nothing very terrible  theres no need to look like that about it  young men will be young men to the end of time and theres no harm in chesters liking to look at a lass eh now  or in talking to her either  the little baggage with the red lips of her  she and chester will make a pretty pair hes not so illlooking for a man thyra  i am not a very patient woman august said thyra coldly  i have asked you what you mean and i want a straight answer  is chester down at tom blairs while i have been sitting here alone waiting for him  august nodded  he saw that it would not be wise to trifle longer with thyra  that he is  i was there before i came here  he and damaris were sitting in a corner by themselves and very wellsatisfied they seemed to be with each other  tut tut thyra dont take the news so  i thought you knew  its no secret that chester has been going after damaris ever since she came here  but what then  you cant tie him to your apron strings forever woman hell be finding a mate for himself as he should  seeing that hes straight and wellshaped no doubt damaris will look with favor on him  old martha blair declares the girl loves him better than her eyes  thyra made a sound like a strangled moan in the middle of augusts speech  she heard the rest of it immovably  when it came to an end she stood and looked down upon him in a way that silenced him  youve told the news you came to tell and gloated over it and now get you gone she said slowly  now thyra he began but she interrupted him threateningly  get you gone i say  and you need not bring my mail here any longer  i want no more of your misshapen body and lying tongue  august went but at the door he turned for a parting stab  my tongue is not a lying one mrs carewe  ive told you the truth as all avonlea knows it  chester is mad about damaris garland  its no wonder i thought you knew what all the settlement can see  but youre such a jealous odd body i suppose the boy hid it from you for fear youd go into a tantrum as for me ill not forget that youve turned me from your door because i chanced to bring you news youd no fancy for  thyra did not answer him  when the door closed behind him she locked it and blew out the light  then she threw herself face downward on the sofa and burst into wild tears  her very soul ached  she wept as tempestuously and unreasoningly as youth weeps although she was not young  it seemed as if she was afraid to stop weeping lest she should go mad thinking  but after a time tears failed her and she began bitterly to go over word by word what august vorst had said  that her son should ever cast eyes of love on any girl was something thyra had never thought about  she would not believe it possible that he should love any one but herself who loved him so much  and now the possibility invaded her mind as subtly and coldly and remorselessly as a seafog stealing landward  chester had been born to her at an age when most women are letting their children slip from them into the world with some natural tears and heartaches but content to let them go after enjoying their sweetest years  thyras latecome motherhood was all the more intense and passionate because of its very lateness she had been very ill when her son was born and had lain helpless for long weeks during which other women had tended her baby for her  she had never been able to forgive them for this  her husband had died before chester was a year old  she had laid their son in his dying arms and received him back again with a last benediction  to thyra that moment had something of a sacrament in it  it was as if the child had been doubly given to her with a right to him solely that nothing could take away or transcend  marrying  she had never thought of it in connection with him he did not come of a marrying race  his father had been sixty when he had married her thyra lincoln likewise well on in life few of the lincolns or carewes had married young many not at all  and to her chester was her baby still  he belonged solely to her  and now another woman had dared to look upon him with eyes of love  damaris garland  thyra now remembered seeing her  she was a newcomer in avonlea having come to live with her uncle and aunt after the death of her mother  thyra had met her on the bridge one day a month previously  yes a man might think she was prettya lowbrowed girl with a wave of reddishgold hair and crimson lips blossoming out against the strange milkwhiteness of her skin  her eyes toothyra recalled them hazel in tint deep and laughterbrimmed  the girl had gone past her with a smile that brought out many dimples  there was a certain insolent quality in her beauty as if it flaunted itself somewhat too defiantly in the beholders eye  thyra had turned and looked after the lithe young creature wondering who she might be  and tonight while she his mother waited for him in darkness and loneliness he was down at blairs talking to this girl  he loved her and it was past doubt that she loved him  the thought was more bitter than death to thyra  that she should dare  her anger was all against the girl  she had laid a snare to get chester and he like a fool was entangled in it thinking manfashion only of her great eyes and red lips  thyra thought savagely of damaris beauty  she shall not have him she said with slow emphasis  i will never give him up to any other woman and least of all to her she would leave me no place in his heart at allme his mother who almost died to give him life  he belongs to me  let her look for the son of some other womansome woman who has many sons  she shall not have my only one  she got up wrapped a shawl about her head and went out into the darkly golden evening  the clouds had cleared away and the moon was shining  the air was chill with a belllike clearness  the alders by the river rustled eerily as she walked by them and out upon the bridge  here she paced up and down peering with troubled eyes along the road beyond or leaning over the rail looking at the sparkling silver ribbon of moonlight that garlanded the waters  late travelers passed her and wondered at her presence and mien  carl white saw her and told his wife about her when he got home  striding to and fro over the bridge like mad  at first i thought it was old crazy may blair  what do you suppose she was doing down there at this hour of the night  watching for ches no doubt said cynthia  he aint home yet likely hes snug at blairs  i do wonder if thyra suspicions that he goes after damaris  ive never dared to hint it to her shed be as liable to fly at me tooth and claw as not  well she picks out a precious queer night for moongazing said carl who was a jolly soul and took life as he found it its bitter coldtherell be a hard frost  its a pity she cant get it grained into her that the boy is grown up and must have his fling like the other lads  shell go out of her mind yet like her old grandmother lincoln if she doesnt ease up ive a notion to go down to the bridge and reason a bit with her  indeed and youll do no such thing cried cynthia  thyra carewe is best left alone if she is in a tantrum  shes like no other woman in avonleaor out of it  id as soon meddle with a tiger as her if shes rampaging about chester  i dont envy damaris garland her life if she goes in there  thyrad sooner strangle her than not i guess  you women are all terrible hard on thyra said carl goodnaturedly  he had been in love with thyra himself long ago and he still liked her in a friendly fashion  he always stood up for her when the avonlea women ran her down  he felt troubled about her all night recalling her as she paced the bridge  he wished he had gone back in spite of cynthia   when chester came home he met his mother on the bridge  in the faint yet penetrating moonlight they looked curiously alike but chester had the milder face  he was very handsome  even in the seething of her pain and jealousy thyra yearned over his beauty  she would have liked to put up her hands and caress his face but her voice was very hard when she asked him where he had been so late  i called in at tom blairs on my way home from the harbor he answered trying to walk on  but she held him back by his arm  did you go there to see damaris she demanded fiercely  chester was uncomfortable  much as he loved his mother he felt and always had felt an awe of her and an impatient dislike of her dramatic ways of speaking and acting  he reflected resentfully that no other young man in avonlea who had been paying a friendly call would be met by his mother at midnight and held up in such tragic fashion to account for himself  he tried vainly to loosen her hold upon his arm but he understood quite well that he must give her an answer  being strictly straightforward by nature and upbringing he told the truth albeit with more anger in his tone than he had ever shown to his mother before  yes he said shortly  thyra released his arm and struck her hands together with a sharp cry  there was a savage note in it  she could have slain damaris garland at that moment  dont go on so mother said chester impatiently  come in out of the cold  it isnt fit for you to be here  who has been tampering with you  what if i did go to see damaris  ohohoh cried thyra  i was waiting for youaloneand you were thinking only of her  chester answer medo you love her  the blood rolled rapidly over the boys face  he muttered something and tried to pass on but she caught him again  he forced himself to speak gently  what if i do mother  it wouldnt be such a dreadful thing would it  and me  and me cried thyra  what am i to you then  you are my mother  i wouldnt love you any the less because i cared for another too  i wont have you love another she cried  i want all your loveall  whats that babyface to you compared to your mother  i have the best right to you  i wont give you up  chester realized that there was no arguing with such a mood  he walked on resolved to set the matter aside until she might be more reasonable  but thyra would not have it so  she followed on after him under the alders that crowded over the lane  promise me that youll not go there again she entreated promise me that youll give her up  i cant promise such a thing he cried angrily  his anger hurt her worse than a blow but she did not flinch  youre not engaged to her she cried out  now mother be quiet  all the settlement will hear you  why do you object to damaris  you dont know how sweet she is  when you know her  i will never know her cried thyra furiously  and she shall not have you  she shall not chester  he made no answer  she suddenly broke into tears and loud sobs touched with remorse he stopped and put his arms about her  mother mother dont  i cant bear to see you cry so  but indeed you are unreasonable  didnt you ever think the time would come when i would want to marry like other men  no no  and i will not have iti cannot bear it chester  you must promise not to go to see her again  i wont go into the house this night until you do  ill stay out here in the bitter cold until you promise to put her out of your thoughts  thats beyond my power mother  oh mother youre making it hard for me  come in come in  youre shivering with cold now youll be sick  not a step will i stir till you promise  say you wont go to see that girl any more and theres nothing i wont do for you but if you put her before me ill not go ini never will go in  with most women this would have been an empty threat but it was not so with thyra and chester knew it  he knew she would keep her word  and he feared more than that  in this frenzy of hers what might she not do  she came of a strange breed as had been said disapprovingly when luke carewe married her  there was a strain of insanity in the lincolns  a lincoln woman had drowned herself once  chester thought of the river and grew sick with fright  for a moment even his passion for damaris weakened before the older tie  mother calm yourself  oh surely theres no need of all this let us wait until tomorrow and talk it over then  ill hear all you have to say  come in dear  thyra loosened her arms from about him and stepped back into a moonlit space  looking at him tragically she extended her arms and spoke slowly and solemnly  chester choose between us  if you choose her i shall go from you tonight and you will never see me again  mother  choose she reiterated fiercely  he felt her long ascendancy  its influence was not to be shaken off in a moment  in all his life he had never disobeyed her besides with it all he loved her more deeply and understandingly than most sons love their mothers  he realized that since she would have it so his choice was already madeor rather that he had no choice  have your way he said sullenly  she ran to him and caught him to her heart  in the reaction of her feeling she was half laughing half crying  all was well againall would be well she never doubted this for she knew he would keep his ungracious promise sacredly  oh my son my son she murmured youd have sent me to my death if you had chosen otherwise  but now you are mine again  she did not heed that he was sullenthat he resented her unjustice with all her own intensity  she did not heed his silence as they went into the house together  strangely enough she slept well and soundly that night  not until many days had passed did she understand that though chester might keep his promise in the letter it was beyond his power to keep it in the spirit  she had taken him from damaris garland but she had not won him back to herself  he could never be wholly her son again there was a barrier between them which not all her passionate love could break down  chester was gravely kind to her for it was not in his nature to remain sullen long or visit his own unhappiness upon anothers head besides he understood her exacting affection even in its injustice and it has been wellsaid that to understand is to forgive  but he avoided her and she knew it  the flame of her anger burned bitterly towards damaris  he thinks of her all the time she moaned to herself  hell come to hate me yet i fear because its i who made him give her up  but id rather even that than share him with another woman oh my son my son  she knew that damaris was suffering too  the girls wan face told that when she met her  but this pleased thyra  it eased the ache in her bitter heart to know that pain was gnawing at damaris also  chester was absent from home very often now  he spent much of his spare time at the harbor consorting with joe raymond and others of that ilk who were but sorry associates for him avonlea people thought  in late november he and joe started for a trip down the coast in the latters boat  thyra protested against it but chester laughed at her alarm  thyra saw him go with a heart sick from fear  she hated the sea and was afraid of it at any time but most of all in this treacherous month with its sudden wild gales  chester had been fond of the sea from boyhood  she had always tried to stifle this fondness and break off his associations with the harbor fishermen who liked to lure the highspirited boy out with them on fishing expeditions  but her power over him was gone now  after chesters departure she was restless and miserable wandering from window to window to scan the dour unsmiling sky carl white dropping in to pay a call was alarmed when he heard that chester had gone with joe and had not tact enough to conceal his alarm from thyra  t isnt safe this time of year he said  folks expect no better from that reckless harumscarum joe raymond  hell drown himself some day theres nothing surer  this mad freak of starting off down the shore in november is just of a piece with his usual performances  but you shouldnt have let chester go thyra  i couldnt prevent him  say what i could he would go  he laughed when i spoke of danger  oh hes changed from what he was  i know who has wrought the change and i hate her for it  carl shrugged his fat shoulders  he knew quite well that thyra was at the bottom of the sudden coldness between chester carewe and damaris garland about which avonlea gossip was busying itself  he pitied thyra too  she had aged rapidly the past month  youre too hard on chester thyra  hes out of leadingstrings now or should be  you must just let me take an old friends privilege and tell you that youre taking the wrong way with him  youre too jealous and exacting thyra  you dont know anything about it  you have never had a son said thyra cruelly enough for she knew that carls sonlessness was a rankling thorn in his mind  you dont know what it is to pour out your love on one human being and have it flung back in your face  carl could not cope with thyras moods  he had never understood her even in his youth  now he went home still shrugging his shoulders and thinking that it was a good thing thyra had not looked on him with favor in the old days  cynthia was much easier to get along with  more than thyra looked anxiously to sea and sky that night in avonlea  damaris garland listened to the smothered roar of the atlantic in the murky northeast with a prescience of coming disaster  friendly longshoremen shook their heads and said that ches and joe would better have kept to good dry land  its sorry work joking with a november gale said abel blair he was an old man and in his life had seen some sad things along the shore  thyra could not sleep that night  when the gale came shrieking up the river and struck the house she got out of bed and dressed herself  the wind screamed like a ravening beast at her window  all night she wandered to and fro in the house going from room to room now wringing her hands with loud outcries now praying below her breath with white lips now listening in dumb misery to the fury of the storm  the wind raged all the next day but spent itself in the following night and the second morning was calm and fair  the eastern sky was a great arc of crystal smitten through with auroral crimsonings  thyra looking from her kitchen window saw a group of men on the bridge  they were talking to carl white with looks and gestures directed towards the carewe house  she went out and down to them  none of these who saw her white rigid face that day ever forgot the sight  you have news for me she said  they looked at each other each man mutely imploring his neighbor to speak  you need not fear to tell me said thyra calmly  i know what you have come to say  my son is drowned  we dont know that mrs carewe said abel blair quickly  we havent got the worst to tell youtheres hope yet  but joe raymonds boat was found last night stranded bottom up on the blue point sand shore forty miles down the coast  dont look like that thyra said carl white pityingly  they may have escapedthey may have been picked up  thyra looked at him with dull eyes  you know they have not  not one of you has any hope  i have no son  the sea has taken him from memy bonny baby  she turned and went back to her desolate home  none dared to follow her  carl white went home and sent his wife over to her  cynthia found thyra sitting in her accustomed chair  her hands lay palms upward on her lap  her eyes were dry and burning she met cynthias compassionate look with a fearful smile  long ago cynthia white she said slowly you were vexed with me one day and you told me that god would punish me yet because i made an idol of my son and set it up in his place  do you remember  your word was a true one  god saw that i loved chester too much and he meant to take him from me  i thwarted one way when i made him give up damaris  but one cant fight against the almighty  it was decreed that i must lose himif not in one way then in another  he has been taken from me utterly  i shall not even have his grave to tend cynthia  as near to a mad woman as anything you ever saw with her awful eyes cynthia told carl afterwards  but she did not say so there  although she was a shallow commonplace soul she had her share of womanly sympathy and her own life had not been free from suffering  it taught her the right thing to do now  she sat down by the stricken creature and put her arms about her while she gathered the cold hands in her own warm clasp  the tears filled her big blue eyes and her voice trembled as she said  thyra im sorry for you  iilost a child oncemy little firstborn  and chester was a dear good lad  for a moment thyra strained her small tense body away from cynthias embrace  then she shuddered and cried out  the tears came and she wept her agony out on the other womans breast  as the ill news spread other avonlea women kept dropping in all through the day to condole with thyra  many of them came in real sympathy but some out of mere curiosity to see how she took it thyra knew this but she did not resent it as she would once have done  she listened very quietly to all the halting efforts at consolation and the little platitudes with which they strove to cover the nakedness of bereavement  when darkness came cynthia said she must go home but would send one of her girls over for the night  you wont feel like staying alone she said  thyra looked up steadily  no  but i want you to send for damaris garland  damaris garland  cynthia repeated the name as if disbelieving her own ears  there was never any knowing what whim thyra might take but cynthia had not expected this  yes  tell her i want hertell her she must come  she must hate me bitterly but i am punished enough to satisfy even her hate  tell her to come to me for chesters sake  cynthia did as she was bid she sent her daughter jeanette for damaris  then she waited  no matter what duties were calling for her at home she must see the interview between thyra and damaris  her curiosity would be the last thing to fail cynthia white  she had done very well all day but it would be asking too much of her to expect that she would consider the meeting of these two women sacred from her eyes  she half believed that damaris would refuse to come  but damaris came  jeanette brought her in amid the fiery glow of a november sunset  thyra stood up and for a moment they looked at each other  the insolence of damaris beauty was gone  her eyes were dull and heavy with weeping her lips were pale and her face had lost its laughter and dimples  only her hair escaping from the shawl she had cast around it gushed forth in warm splendor in the sunset light and framed her wan face like the aureole of a madonna  thyra looked upon her with a shock of remorse  this was not the radiant creature she had met on the bridge that summer afternoon  thisthiswas her work  she held out her arms  oh damaris forgive me  we both loved himthat must be a bond between us for life  damaris came forward and threw her arms about the older woman lifting her face  as their lips met even cynthia white realized that she had no business there  she vented the irritation of her embarrassment on the innocent jeanette  come away she whispered crossly  cant you see were not wanted here  she drew jeanette out leaving thyra rocking damaris in her arms and crooning over her like a mother over her child  when december had grown old damaris was still with thyra  it was understood that she was to remain there for the winter at least thyra could not bear her to be out of her sight  they talked constantly about chester thyra confessed all her anger and hatred  damaris had forgiven her but thyra could never forgive herself  she was greatly changed and had grown very gentle and tender  she even sent for august vorst and begged him to pardon her for the way she had spoken to him  winter came late that year and the season was a very open one there was no snow on the ground and a month after joe raymonds boat had been cast up on the blue point sand shore thyra wandering about in her garden found some pansies blooming under their tangled leaves  she was picking them for damaris when she heard a buggy rumble over the bridge and drive up the white lane hidden from her sight by the alders and firs  a few minutes later carl and cynthia came hastily across their yard under the huge balmofgileads  carls face was flushed and his big body quivered with excitement  cynthia ran behind him with tears rolling down her face  thyra felt herself growing sick with fear  had anything happened to damaris  a glimpse of the girl sewing by an upper window of the house reassured her  oh thyra thyra gasped cynthia  can you stand some good news thyra asked carl in a trembling voice  very very good news  thyra looked wildly from one to the other  theres but one thing you would dare to call good news to me she cried  is it aboutabout  chester  yes its about chester  thyra he is alivehes safehe and joe both of them thank god  cynthia catch her  no i am not going to faint said thyra steadying herself by cynthias shoulder  my son alive  how did you hear  how did it happen  where has he been  i heard it down at the harbor thyra  mike mccreadys vessel the nora lee was just in from the magdalens  ches and joe got capsized the night of the storm but they hung on to their boat somehow and at daybreak they were picked up by the nora lee bound for quebec  but she was damaged by the storm and blown clear out of her course  had to put into the magdalens for repairs and has been there ever since  the cable to the islands was out of order and no vessels call there this time of year for mails  if it hadnt been an extra open season the nora lee wouldnt have got away but would have had to stay there till spring  you never saw such rejoicing as there was this morning at the harbor when the nora lee came in flying flags at the mast head  and chesterwhere is he demanded thyra  carl and cynthia looked at each other  well thyra said the latter the fact is hes over there in our yard this blessed minute  carl brought him home from the harbor but i wouldnt let him come over until we had prepared you for it  hes waiting for you there  thyra made a quick step in the direction of the gate  then she turned with a little of the glow dying out of her face  no theres one has a better right to go to him first  i can atone to himthank god i can atone to him  she went into the house and called damaris  as the girl came down the stairs thyra held out her hands with a wonderful light of joy and renunciation on her face  damaris she said chester has come back to usthe sea has given him back to us  he is over at carl whites house  go to him my daughter and bring him to me    xi the education of betty  when sara currie married jack churchill i was brokenheartedor believed myself to be so which in a boy of twentytwo amounts to pretty much the same thing  not that i took the world into my confidence that was never the douglas way and i held myself in honor bound to live up to the family traditions  i thought then that nobody but sara knew but i dare say now that jack knew it also for i dont think sara could have helped telling him  if he did know however he did not let me see that he did and never insulted me by any implied sympathy on the contrary he asked me to be his best man  jack was always a thoroughbred  i was best man  jack and i had always been bosom friends and although i had lost my sweetheart i did not intend to lose my friend into the bargain  sara had made a wise choice for jack was twice the man i was he had had to work for his living which perhaps accounts for it  so i danced at saras wedding as if my heart were as light as my heels but after she and jack had settled down at glenby i closed the maples and went abroadbeing as i have hinted one of those unfortunate mortals who need consult nothing but their own whims in the matter of time and money  i stayed away for ten years during which the maples was given over to moths and rust while i enjoyed life elsewhere  i did enjoy it hugely but always under protest for i felt that a brokenhearted man ought not to enjoy himself as i did  it jarred on my sense of fitness and i tried to moderate my zest and think more of the past than i did  it was no use the present insisted on being intrusive and pleasant as for the futurewell there was no future  then jack churchill poor fellow died  a year after his death i went home and again asked sara to marry me as in duty bound sara again declined alleging that her heart was buried in jacks grave or words to that effect  i found that it did not much matterof course at thirtytwo one does not take these things to heart as at twentytwo  i had enough to occupy me in getting the maples into working order and beginning to educate betty  betty was saras ten yearold daughter and she had been thoroughly spoiled  that is to say she had been allowed her own way in everything and having inherited her fathers outdoor tastes had simply run wild  she was a thorough tomboy a thin scrawny little thing with a trace of saras beauty  betty took after her fathers dark tall race and on the occasion of my first introduction to her seemed to be all legs and neck  there were points about her though which i considered promising  she had fine almondshaped hazel eyes the smallest and most shapely hands and feet i ever saw and two enormous braids of thick nutbrown hair  for jacks sake i decided to bring his daughter up properly sara couldnt do it and didnt try  i saw that if somebody didnt take betty in hand wisely and firmly she would certainly be ruined  there seemed to be nobody except myself at all interested in the matter so i determined to see what an old bachelor could do as regards bringing up a girl in the way she should go  i might have been her father as it was her father had been my best friend  who had a better right to watch over his daughter  i determined to be a father to betty and do all for her that the most devoted parent could do it was selfevidently my duty  i told sara i was going to take betty in hand  sara sighed one of the plaintive little sighs which i had once thought so charming but now to my surprise found faintly irritating and said that she would be very much obliged if i would  i feel that i am not able to cope with the problem of bettys education stephen she admitted betty is a strange childall churchill  her poor father indulged her in everything and she has a will of her own i assure you  i have really no control over her whatever  she does as she pleases and is ruining her complexion by running and galloping out of doors the whole time  not that she had much complexion to start with  the churchills never had you knowsara cast a complacent glance at her delicately tinted reflection in the mirror  i tried to make betty wear a sunbonnet this summer but i might as well have talked to the wind  a vision of betty in a sunbonnet presented itself to my mind and afforded me so much amusement that i was grateful to sara for having furnished it  i rewarded her with a compliment  it is to be regretted that betty has not inherited her mothers charming color i said but we must do the best we can for her under her limitations  she may have improved vastly by the time she has grown up  and at least we must make a lady of her she is a most alarming tomboy at present but there is good material to work uponthere must be in the churchill and currie blend  but even the best material may be spoiled by unwise handling  i think i can promise you that i will not spoil it  i feel that betty is my vocation and i shall set myself up as a rival of wordsworths nature of whose methods i have always had a decided distrust in spite of his insidious verses  sara did not understand me in the least but then she did not pretend to  i confide bettys education entirely to you stephen she said with another plaintive sigh  i feel sure i could not put it into better hands  you have always been a person who could be thoroughly depended on  well that was something by way of reward for a lifelong devotion  i felt that i was satisfied with my position as unofficial advisorinchief to sara and selfappointed guardian of betty  i also felt that for the furtherance of the cause i had taken to heart it was a good thing that sara had again refused to marry me  i had a sixth sense which informed me that a staid old family friend might succeed with betty where a stepfather would have signally failed  bettys loyalty to her fathers memory was passionate and vehement she would view his supplanter with resentment and distrust but his old familiar comrade was a person to be taken to her heart  fortunately for the success of my enterprise betty liked me she told me this with the same engaging candor she would have used in informing me that she hated me if she had happened to take a bias in that direction saying frankly  you are one of the very nicest old folks i know stephen  yes you are a ripping good fellow  this made my task a comparatively easy one i sometimes shudder to think what it might have been if betty had not thought i was a ripping good fellow  i should have stuck to it because that is my way but betty would have made my life a misery to me  she had startling capacities for tormenting people when she chose to exert them i certainly should not have liked to be numbered among bettys foes  i rode over to glenby the next morning after my paternal interview with sara intending to have a frank talk with betty and lay the foundations of a good understanding on both sides betty was a sharp child with a disconcerting knack of seeing straight through grindstones she would certainly perceive and probably resent any underhanded management  i thought it best to tell her plainly that i was going to look after her  when however i encountered betty tearing madly down the beech avenue with a couple of dogs her loosened hair streaming behind her like a banner of independence and had lifted her hatless and breathless up before me on my mare i found that sara had saved me the trouble of an explanation  mother says you are going to take charge of my education stephen said betty as soon as she could speak  im glad because i think that for an old person you have a good deal of sense  i suppose my education has to be seen to some time or other and id rather youd do it than anybody else i know  thank you betty i said gravely  i hope i shall deserve your good opinion of my sense  i shall expect you to do as i tell you and be guided by my advice in everything  yes i will said betty because im sure you wont tell me to do anything id really hate to do  you wont shut me up in a room and make me sew will you  because i wont do it  i assured her i would not  nor send me to a boardingschool pursued betty  mothers always threatening to send me to one  i suppose she would have done it before this only she knew id run away  you wont send me to a boardingschool will you stephen  because i wont go  no i said obligingly  i wont  i should never dream of cooping a wild little thing like you up in a boardingschool youd fret your heart out like a caged skylark  i know you and i are going to get along together splendidly stephen said betty rubbing her brown cheek chummily against my shoulder  you are so good at understanding  very few people are  even dad darling didnt understand  he let me do just as i wanted to just because i wanted to not because he really understood that i couldnt be tame and play with dolls  i hate dolls  real live babies are jolly but dogs and horses are ever so much nicer than dolls  but you must have lessons betty  i shall select your teachers and superintend your studies and i shall expect you to do me credit along that line as well as along all others  ill try honest and true stephen declared betty  and she kept her word  at first i looked upon bettys education as a duty in a very short time it had become a pleasurethe deepest and most abiding interest of my life  as i had premised betty was good material and responded to my training with gratifying plasticity  day by day week by week month by month her character and temperament unfolded naturally under my watchful eye  it was like beholding the gradual development of some rare flower in ones garden  a little checking and pruning here a careful training of shoot and tendril there and lo the reward of grace and symmetry  betty grew up as i would have wished jack churchills girl to growspirited and proud with the fine spirit and gracious pride of pure womanhood loyal and loving with the loyalty and love of a frank and unspoiled nature true to her hearts core hating falsehood and shamas crystalclear a mirror of maidenhood as ever man looked into and saw himself reflected back in such a halo as made him ashamed of not being more worthy of it  betty was kind enough to say that i had taught her everything she knew but what had she not taught me  if there were a debt between us it was on my side  sara was fairly well satisfied  it was not my fault that betty was not better looking she said  i had certainly done everything for her mind and character that could be done  saras manner implied that these unimportant details did not count for much balanced against the lack of a pinkandwhite skin and dimpled elbows but she was generous enough not to blame me  when betty is twentyfive i said patientlyi had grown used to speaking patiently to sarashe will be a magnificent woman far handsomer than you ever were sara in your pinkest and whitest prime  where are your eyes my dear lady that you cant see the promise of loveliness in betty  betty is seventeen and she is as lanky and brown as ever she was sighed sara  when i was seventeen i was the belle of the county and had had five proposals  i dont believe the thought of a lover has ever entered bettys head  i hope not i said shortly  somehow i did not like the suggestion  betty is a child yet  for pitys sake sara dont go putting nonsensical ideas into her head  im afraid i cant mourned sara as if it were something to be regretted  you have filled it too full of books and things like that  ive every confidence in your judgment stephenand really youve done wonders with betty  but dont you think youve made her rather too clever  men dont like women who are too clever  her poor father nowhe always said that a woman who liked books better than beaux was an unnatural creature  i didnt believe jack had ever said anything so foolish  sara imagined things  but i resented the aspersion of bluestockingness cast on betty  when the time comes for betty to be interested in beaux i said severely she will probably give them all due attention  just at present her head is a great deal better filled with books than with silly premature fancies and sentimentalities  im a critical old fellowbut im satisfied with betty sara perfectly satisfied  sara sighed  oh i dare say she is all right stephen  and im really grateful to you  im sure i could have done nothing at all with her  its not your fault of coursebut i cant help wishing she were a little more like other girls  i galloped away from glenby in a rage  what a blessing sara had not married me in my absurd youth  she would have driven me wild with her sighs and her obtuseness and her everlasting pinkandwhiteness  but theretheretheregently  she was a sweet goodhearted little woman she had made jack happy and she had contrived heaven only knew how to bring a rare creature like betty into the world  for that much might be forgiven her by the time i reached the maples and had flung myself down in an old kinky comfortable chair in my library i had forgiven her and was even paying her the compliment of thinking seriously over what she had said  was betty really unlike other girls  that is to say unlike them in any respect wherein she should resemble them  i did not wish this although i was a crusty old bachelor i approved of girls holding them the sweetest things the good god has made  i wanted betty to have her full complement of girlhood in all its best and highest manifestation  was there anything lacking  i observed betty very closely during the next week or so riding over to glenby every day and riding back at night meditating upon my observations  eventually i concluded to do what i had never thought myself in the least likely to do  i would send betty to a boardingschool for a year  it was necessary that she should learn how to live with other girls  i went over to glenby the next day and found betty under the beeches on the lawn just back from a canter  she was sitting on the dappled mare i had given her on her last birthday and was laughing at the antics of her rejoicing dogs around her  i looked at her with much pleasure it gladdened me to see how much nay how totally a child she still was despite her churchill height  her hair under her velvet cap still hung over her shoulders in the same thick plaits her face had the firm leanness of early youth but its curves were very fine and delicate  the brown skin that worried sara so was flushed through with dusky color from her gallop her long dark eyes were filled with the beautiful unconsciousness of childhood more than all the soul in her was still the soul of a child  i found myself wishing that it could always remain so  but i knew it could not the woman must blossom out some day it was my duty to see that the flower fulfilled the promise of the bud  when i told betty that she must go away to a school for a year she shrugged frowned and consented  betty had learned that she must consent to what i decreed even when my decrees were opposed to her likings as she had once fondly believed they never would be  but betty had acquired confidence in me to the beautiful extent of acquiescing in everything i commanded  ill go of course since you wish it stephen she said  but why do you want me to go  you must have a reasonyou always have a reason for anything you do  what is it  that is for you to find out betty i said  by the time you come back you will have discovered it i think  if not it will not have proved itself a good reason and shall be forgotten  when betty went away i bade her goodby without burdening her with any useless words of advice  write to me every week and remember that you are betty churchill i said  betty was standing on the steps above among her dogs  she came down a step and put her arms about my neck  ill remember that you are my friend and that i must live up to you she said  goodby stephen  she kissed me two or three timesgood hearty smacks did i not say she was still a childand stood waving her hand to me as i rode away  i looked back at the end of the avenue and saw her standing there shortskirted and hatless fronting the lowering sun with those fearless eyes of hers  so i looked my last on the child betty  that was a lonely year  my occupation was gone and i began to fear that i had outlived my usefulness  life seemed flat stale and unprofitable  bettys weekly letters were all that lent it any savor  they were spicy and piquant enough  betty was discovered to have unsuspected talents in the epistolary line at first she was dolefully homesick and begged me to let her come home  when i refusedit was amazingly hard to refuseshe sulked through three letters then cheered up and began to enjoy herself  but it was nearly the end of the year when she wrote  ive found out why you sent me here stephenand im glad you did  i had to be away from home on unavoidable business the day betty returned to glenby  but the next afternoon i went over  i found betty out and sara in  the latter was beaming  betty was so much improved she declared delightedly  i would hardly know the dear child  this alarmed me terribly  what on earth had they done to betty i found that she had gone up to the pineland for a walk and thither i betook myself speedily  when i saw her coming down a long goldenbrown alley i stepped behind a tree to watch heri wished to see her myself unseen  as she drew near i gazed at her with pride and admiration and amazementand under it all a strange dreadful heartsinking which i could not understand and which i had never in all my life experienced beforeno not even when sara had refused me  betty was a woman  not by virtue of the simple white dress that clung to her tall slender figure revealing lines of exquisite grace and litheness not by virtue of the glossy masses of dark brown hair heaped high on her head and held there in wonderful shining coils not by virtue of added softness of curve and daintiness of outline not because of all these but because of the dream and wonder and seeking in her eyes  she was a woman looking all unconscious of her quest for love  the understanding of the change in her came home to me with a shock that must have left me i think something white about the lips  i was glad  she was what i had wished her to become  but i wanted the child betty back this womanly betty seemed far away from me  i stepped out into the path and she saw me with a brightening of her whole face  she did not rush forward and fling herself into my arms as she would have done a year ago but she came towards me swiftly holding out her hand  i had thought her slightly pale when i had first seen her but now i concluded i had been mistaken for there was a wonderful sunrise of color in her face i took her handthere were no kisses this time  welcome home betty i said  oh stephen it is so good to be back she breathed her eyes shining  she did not say it was good to see me again as i had hoped she would do  indeed after the first minute of greeting she seemed a trifle cool and distant  we walked for an hour in the pine wood and talked  betty was brilliant witty selfpossessed altogether charming  i thought her perfect and yet my heart ached  what a glorious young thing she was in that splendid youth of hers  what a prize for some lucky manconfound the obtrusive thought  no doubt we should soon be overrun at glenby with lovers  i should stumble over some forlorn youth at every step  well what of it  betty would marry of course  it would be my duty to see that she got a good husband worthy of her as men go  i thought i preferred the old duty of superintending her studies  but there it was all the same thingmerely a postgraduate course in applied knowledge  when she began to learn lifes greatest lesson of love i the tried and true old family friend and mentor must be on hand to see that the teacher was what i would have him be even as i had formerly selected her instructor in french and botany  then and not until then would bettys education be complete  i rode home very soberly  when i reached the maples i did what i had not done for yearslooked critically at myself in the mirror  the realization that i had grown older came home to me with a new and unpleasant force  there were marked lines on my lean face and silver glints in the dark hair over my temples when betty was ten she had thought me an old person  now at eighteen she probably thought me a veritable ancient of days pshaw what did it matter  and yeti thought of her as i had seen her standing under the pines and something cold and painful laid its hand on my heart  my premonitions as to lovers proved correct  glenby was soon infested with them  heaven knows where they all came from  i had not supposed there was a quarter as many young men in the whole county but there they were  sara was in the seventh heaven of delight  was not betty at last a belle  as for the proposalswell betty never counted her scalps in public but every once in a while a visiting youth dropped out and was seen no more at glenby  one could guess what that meant  betty apparently enjoyed all this  i grieve to say that she was a bit of a coquette  i tried to cure her of this serious defect but for once i found that i had undertaken something i could not accomplish  in vain i lectured betty only laughed in vain i gravely rebuked betty only flirted more vivaciously than before men might come and men might go but betty went on forever  i endured this sort of thing for a year and then i decided that it was time to interfere seriously  i must find a husband for bettymy fatherly duty would not be fulfilled until i hadnor indeed my duty to society  she was not a safe person to have running at large  none of the men who haunted glenby was good enough for her  i decided that my nephew frank would do very well  he was a capital young fellow handsome cleansouled and wholehearted from a worldly point of view he was what sara would have termed an excellent match he had money social standing and a rising reputation as a clever young lawyer  yes he should have betty confound him  they had never met  i set the wheels going at once  the sooner all the fuss was over the better  i hated fuss and there was bound to be a good deal of it  but i went about the business like an accomplished matchmaker  i invited frank to visit the maples and before he came i talked muchbut not too muchof him to betty mingling judicious praise and still more judicious blame together  women never like a paragon  betty heard me with more gravity than she usually accorded to my dissertations on young men  she even condescended to ask several questions about him  this i thought a good sign  to frank i had said not a word about betty when he came to the maples i took him over to glenby and coming upon betty wandering about among the beeches in the sunset i introduced him without any warning  he would have been more than mortal if he had not fallen in love with her upon the spot  it was not in the heart of man to resist herthat dainty alluring bit of womanhood  she was all in white with flowers in her hair and for a moment i could have murdered frank or any other man who dared to commit the sacrilege of loving her  then i pulled myself together and left them alone  i might have gone in and talked to saratwo old folks gently reviewing their youth while the young folks courted outsidebut i did not  i prowled about the pine wood and tried to forget how blithe and handsome that curlyheaded boy frank was and what a flash had sprung into his eyes when he had seen betty  well what of it  was not that what i had brought him there for  and was i not pleased at the success of my scheme  certainly i was delighted  next day frank went to glenby without even making the poor pretense of asking me to accompany him  i spent the time of his absence overseeing the construction of a new greenhouse i was having built  i was conscientious in my supervision but i felt no interest in it  the place was intended for roses and roses made me think of the pale yellow ones betty had worn at her breast one evening the week before when all lovers being unaccountably absent we had wandered together under the pines and talked as in the old days before her young womanhood and my gray hairs had risen up to divide us  she had dropped a rose on the brown floor and i had sneaked back after i had left her the house to get it before i went home  i had it now in my pocketbook  confound it mightnt a future uncle cherish a family affection for his prospective niece  franks wooing seemed to prosper  the other young sparks who had haunted glenby faded away after his advent  betty treated him with most encouraging sweetness sara smiled on him i stood in the background like a benevolent god of the machine and flattered myself that i pulled the strings  at the end of a month something went wrong  frank came home from glenby one day in the dumps and moped for two whole days  i rode down myself on the third  i had not gone much to glenby that month but if there were trouble bettyward it was my duty to make smooth the rough places  as usual i found betty in the pineland  i thought she looked rather pale and dullfretting about frank no doubt  she brightened up when she saw me evidently expecting that i had come to straighten matters out but she pretended to be haughty and indifferent  i am glad you havent forgotten us altogether stephen she said coolly  you havent been down for a week  im flattered that you noticed it i said sitting down on a fallen tree and looking up at her as she stood tall and lithe against an old pine with her eyes averted  i shouldnt have supposed youd want an old fogy like myself poking about and spoiling the idyllic moments of loves young dream  why do you always speak of yourself as old said betty crossly ignoring my reference to frank  because i am old my dear  witness these gray hairs  i pushed up my hat to show them the more recklessly  betty barely glanced at them  you have just enough to give you a distinguished look she said and you are only forty  a man is in his prime at forty he never has any sense until he is fortyand sometimes he doesnt seem to have any even then she concluded impertinently  my heart beat  did betty suspect  was that last sentence meant to inform me that she was aware of my secret folly and laughed at it  i came over to see what has gone wrong between you and frank i said gravely  betty bit her lips  nothing she said  betty i said reproachfully i brought you upor endeavored to bring you upto speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth  dont tell me i have failed  ill give you another chance  have you quarreled with frank  no said the maddening betty he quarreled with me  he went away in a temper and i do not care if he never comes back  i shook my head  this wont do betty  as your old family friend i still claim the right to scold you until you have a husband to do the scolding  you mustnt torment frank  he is too fine a fellow you must marry him betty  must i said betty a dusky red flaming out on her cheek  she turned her eyes on me in a most disconcerting fashion  do you wish me to marry frank stephen  betty had a wretched habit of emphasizing pronouns in a fashion calculated to rattle anybody  yes i do wish it because i think it will be best for you i replied without looking at her  you must marry some time betty and frank is the only man i know to whom i could trust you  as your guardian i have an interest in seeing you well and wisely settled for life  you have always taken my advice and obeyed my wishes and youve always found my way the best in the long run havent you betty  you wont prove rebellious now im sure  you know quite well that i am advising you for your own good  frank is a splendid young fellow who loves you with all his heart  marry him betty  mind i dont command  i have no right to do that and you are too old to be ordered about if i had  but i wish and advise it  isnt that enough betty  i had been looking away from her all the time i was talking gazing determinedly down a sunlit vista of pines  every word i said seemed to tear my heart and come from my lips stained with lifeblood  yes betty should marry frank  but good god what would become of me  betty left her station under the pine tree and walked around me until she got right in front of my face  i couldnt help looking at her for if i moved my eyes she moved too  there was nothing meek or submissive about her her head was held high her eyes were blazing and her cheeks were crimson  but her words were meek enough  i will marry frank if you wish it stephen she said  you are my friend  i have never crossed your wishes and as you say i have never regretted being guided by them  i will do exactly as you wish in this case also i promise you that  but in so solemn a question i must be very certain what you do wish there must be no doubt in my mind or heart  look me squarely in the eyes stephenas you havent done once today no nor once since i came home from schooland so looking tell me that you wish me to marry frank douglas and i will do it  do you stephen  i had to look her in the eyes since nothing else would do her and as i did so all the might of manhood in me rose up in hot revolt against the lie i would have told her  that unfaltering impelling gaze of hers drew the truth from my lips in spite of myself  no i dont wish you to marry frank douglas a thousand times no i said passionately  i dont wish you to marry any man on earth but myself  i love youi love you betty  you are dearer to me than lifedearer to me than my own happiness  it was your happiness i thought ofand so i asked you to marry frank because i believed he would make you a happy woman  that is all  bettys defiance went from her like a flame blown out  she turned away and drooped her proud head  it could not have made me a happy woman to marry one man loving another she said in a whisper  i got up and went over to her  betty whom do you love i asked also in a whisper  you she murmured meeklyoh so meekly my proud little girl  betty i said brokenly im oldtoo old for youim more than twenty years your seniorim  oh betty wheeled around on me and stamped her foot  dont mention your age to me again  i dont care if youre as old as methuselah  but im not going to coax you to marry me sir  if you wont ill never marry anybodyill live and die an old maid  you can please yourself of course  she turned away halflaughing halfcrying but i caught her in my arms and crushed her sweet lips against mine  betty im the happiest man in the worldand i was the most miserable when i came here  you deserved to be said betty cruelly  im glad you were any man as stupid as you deserves to be unhappy  what do you think i felt like loving you with all my heart and seeing you simply throwing me at another mans head  why ive always loved you stephen but i didnt know it until i went to that detestable school  then i found outand i thought that was why you had sent me  but when i came home you almost broke my heart  that was why i flirted so with all those poor nice boys i wanted to hurt you but i never thought i succeeded  you just went on being fatherly  then when you brought frank here i almost gave up hope and i tried to make up my mind to marry him i should have done it if you had insisted  but i had to have one more try for happiness first  i had just one little hope to inspire me with sufficient boldness  i saw you that night when you came back here and picked up my rose  i had come back myself to be alone and unhappy  it is the most wonderful thing that ever happenedthat you should love me i said  its noti couldnt help it said betty nestling her brown head on my shoulder  you taught me everything else stephen so nobody but you could teach me how to love  youve made a thorough thing of educating me  when will you marry me betty i asked  as soon as i can fully forgive you for trying to make me marry somebody else said betty  it was rather hard lines on frank when you come to think of it but such is the selfishness of human nature that we didnt think much about frank  the young fellow behaved like the douglas he was  went a little white about the lips when i told him wished me all happiness and went quietly away gentleman unafraid  he has since married and is i understand very happy  not as happy as i am of course that is impossible because there is only one betty in the world and she is my wife    xii in her selfless mood  the raw wind of an early may evening was puffing in and out the curtains of the room where naomi holland lay dying  the air was moist and chill but the sick woman would not have the window closed  i cant get my breath if you shut everything up so tight she said  whatever comes i aint going to be smothered to death carline holland  outside of the window grew a cherry tree powdered with moist buds with the promise of blossoms she would not live to see between its boughs she saw a crystal cup of sky over hills that were growing dim and purple  the outside air was full of sweet wholesome springtime sounds that drifted in fitfully  there were voices and whistles in the barnyard and now and then faint laughter  a bird alighted for a moment on a cherry bough and twittered restlessly  naomi knew that white mists were hovering in the silent hollows that the maple at the gate wore a misty blossom red and that violet stars were shining bluely on the brooklands  the room was a small plain one  the floor was bare save for a couple of braided rugs the plaster discolored the walls dingy and glaring  there had never been much beauty in naomi hollands environment and now that she was dying there was even less  at the open window a boy of about ten years was leaning out over the sill and whistling  he was tall for his age and beautifulthe hair a rich auburn with a glistening curl in it skin very white and warmtinted eyes small and of a greenish blue with dilated pupils and long lashes  he had a weak chin and a full sullen mouth  the bed was in the corner farthest from the window on it the sick woman in spite of the pain that was her portion continually was lying as quiet and motionless as she had done ever since she had lain down upon it for the last time  naomi holland never complained when the agony was at its worst she shut her teeth more firmly over her bloodless lip and her great black eyes glared at the blank wall before in a way that gave her attendants what they called the creeps but no word or moan escaped her  between the paroxysms she kept up her keen interest in the life that went on about her  nothing escaped her sharp alert eyes and ears  this evening she lay spent on the crumpled pillows she had had a bad spell in the afternoon and it had left her very weak  in the dim light her extremely long face looked corpselike already  her black hair lay in a heavy braid over the pillow and down the counterpane  it was all that was left of her beauty and she took a fierce joy in it  those long glistening sinuous tresses must be combed and braided every day no matter what came  a girl of fourteen was curled up on a chair at the head of the bed with her head resting on the pillow  the boy at the window was her halfbrother but between christopher holland and eunice carr not the slightest resemblance existed  presently the sibilant silence was broken by a low halfstrangled sob  the sick woman who had been watching a white evening star through the cherry boughs turned impatiently at the sound  i wish youd get over that eunice she said sharply  i dont want any one crying over me until im dead and then youll have plenty else to do most likely  if it wasnt for christopher i wouldnt be anyways unwilling to die  when one has had such a life as ive had there isnt much in death to be afraid of only a body would like to go right off and not die by inches like this  taint fair  she snapped out the last sentence as if addressing some unseen tyrannical presence her voice at least had not weakened but was as clear and incisive as ever  the boy at the window stopped whistling and the girl silently wiped her eyes on her faded gingham apron  naomi drew her own hair over her lips and kissed it  youll never have hair like that eunice she said  it does seem most too pretty to bury doesnt it  mind you see that it is fixed nice when im laid out  comb it right up on my head and braid it there  a sound such as might be wrung from a suffering animal came from the girl but at the same moment the door opened and a woman entered  chris she said sharply you get right off for the cows you lazy little scamp  you knew right well you had to go for them and here youve been idling and me looking high and low for you make haste now its ridiculous late  the boy pulled in his head and scowled at his aunt but he dared not disobey and went out slowly with a sulky mutter  his aunt subdued a movement that might have developed into a sound box on his ears with a rather frightened glance at the bed  naomi holland was spent and dying but her temper was still a thing to hold in dread and her sisterinlaw did not choose to rouse it by slapping christopher  to her and her conurse the spasms of rage which the sick woman sometimes had seemed to partake of the nature of devil possession  the last one only three days before had been provoked by christophers complaint of some real or fancied illtreatment from his aunt and the latter had no mind to bring on another  she went over to the bed and straightened the clothes  sarah and i are going out to milk naomi eunice will stay with you  she can run for us if you feel another spell coming on  naomi holland looked up at her sisterinlaw with something like malicious enjoyment  i aint going to have any more spells carline anne  im going to die tonight  but you neednt hurry milking for that at all ill take my time  she liked to see the alarm that came over the other womans face it was richly worth while to scare caroline holland like that  are you feeling worse naomi asked the latter shakily  if you are ill send for charles to go for the doctor  no you wont  what good can the doctor do me  i dont want either his or charles permission to die  you can go and milk at your ease  i wont die till youre donei wont deprive you of the pleasure of seeing me  mrs holland shut her lips and went out of the room with a martyrlike expression  in some ways naomi holland was not an exacting patient but she took her satisfaction out in the biting malicious speeches she never failed to make  even on her deathbed her hostility to her sisterinlaw had to find vent  outside at the steps sarah spencer was waiting with the milk pails over her arm  sarah spencer had no fixed abiding place but was always to be found where there was illness  her experience and an utter lack of nerves made her a good nurse she was a tall homely woman with iron gray hair and a lined face  beside her the trim little caroline anne with her light step and round applered face looked almost girlish  the two women walked to the barnyard discussing naomi in undertones as they went  the house they had left behind grew very still  in naomi hollands room the shadows were gathering  eunice timidly bent over her mother  ma do you want the light lit  no im watching that star just below the big cherry bough ill see it set behind the hill  ive seen it there off and on for twelve years and now im taking a goodby look at it  i want you to keep still too  ive got a few things to think over and i dont want to be disturbed  the girl lifted herself about noiselessly and locked her hands over the bedpost  then she laid her face down on them biting at them silently until the marks of her teeth showed white against their red roughness  naomi holland did not notice her  she was looking steadfastly at the great pearllike sparkle in the fainthued sky  when it finally disappeared from her vision she struck her long thin hands together twice and a terrible expression came over her face for a moment  but when she spoke her voice was quite calm  you can light the candle now eunice  put it up on the shelf here where it wont shine in my eyes  and then sit down on the foot of the bed where i can see you  ive got something to say to you  eunice obeyed her noiselessly  as the pallid light shot up it revealed the child plainly  she was thin and illformedone shoulder being slightly higher than the other  she was dark like her mother but her features were irregular and her hair fell in straggling dim locks about her face  her eyes were a dark brown and over one was the slanting red scar of a birth mark  naomi holland looked at her with the contempt she had never made any pretense of concealing  the girl was bone of her bone and flesh of her flesh but she had never loved her all the mother love in her had been lavished on her son  when eunice had placed the candle on the shelf and drawn down the ugly blue paper blinds shutting out the strips of violet sky where a score of glimmering points were now visible she sat down on the foot of the bed facing her mother  the door is shut is it eunice  eunice nodded  because i dont want carline or any one else peeking and harking to what ive got to say  shes out milking now and i must make the most of the chance  eunice im going to die and  ma  there now no taking on  you knew it had to come sometime soon i havent the strength to talk much so i want you just to be quiet and listen  i aint feeling any pain now so i can think and talk pretty clear  are you listening eunice  yes ma  mind you are  its about christopher  it hasnt been out of my mind since i laid down here  ive fought for a year to live on his account and it aint any use  i must just die and leave him and i dont know what hell do  its dreadful to think of  she paused and struck her shrunken hand sharply against the table  if he was bigger and could look out for himself it wouldnt be so bad  but he is only a little fellow and carline hates him youll both have to live with her until youre grown up  shell put on him and abuse him  hes like his father in some ways hes got a temper and he is stubborn  hell never get on with carline  now eunice im going to get you to promise to take my place with christopher when im dead as far as you can youve got to its your duty  but i want you to promise  i will ma whispered the girl solemnly  you havent much forceyou never had  if you was smart you could do a lot for him  but youll have to do your best  i want you to promise me faithfully that youll stand by him and protect himthat you wont let people impose on him that youll never desert him as long as he needs you no matter what comes eunice promise me this  in her excitement the sick woman raised herself up in the bed and clutched the girls thin arm  her eyes were blazing and two scarlet spots glowed in her thin cheeks  eunices face was white and tense  she clasped her hands as one in prayer  mother i promise it  naomi relaxed her grip on the girls arm and sank back exhausted on the pillow  a deathlike look came over her face as the excitement faded  my mind is easier now  but if i could only have lived another year or two  and i hate carlinehate her  eunice dont you ever let her abuse my boy  if she did or if you neglected him id come back from my grave to you  as for the property things will be pretty straight  ive seen to that  therell be no squabbling and doing christopher out of his rights  hes to have the farm as soon as hes old enough to work it and hes to provide for you  and eunice remember what youve promised   outside in the thickly gathering dusk caroline holland and sarah spencer were at the dairy straining the milk into creamers for which christopher was sullenly pumping water  the house was far from the road up to which a long red lane led across the field was the old holland homestead where caroline lived her unmarried sisterinlaw electa holland kept house for her while she waited on naomi  it was her night to go home and sleep but naomis words haunted her although she believed they were born of pure cantankerousness  youd better go in and look at her sarah she said as she rinsed out the pails  if you think id better stay here tonight i will  if the woman was like anybody else a body would know what to do but if she thought she could scare us by saying she was going to die shed say it  when sarah went in the sick room was very quiet  in her opinion naomi was no worse than usual and she told caroline so but the latter felt vaguely uneasy and concluded to stay  naomi was as cool and defiant as customary  she made them bring christopher in to say goodnight and had him lifted up on the bed to kiss her then she held him back and looked at him admiringlyat the bright curls and rosy cheeks and round firm limbs  the boy was uncomfortable under her gaze and squirmed hastily down  her eyes followed him greedily as he went out when the door closed behind him she groaned  sarah spencer was startled  she had never heard naomi holland groan since she had come to wait on her  are you feeling any worse naomi  is the pain coming back  no  go and tell carline to give christopher some of that grape jelly on his bread before he goes to bed  shell find it in the cupboard under the stairs  presently the house grew very still  caroline had dropped asleep on the sittingroom lounge across the hall  sarah spencer nodded over her knitting by the table in the sick room  she had told eunice to go to bed but the child refused  she still sat huddled up on the foot of the bed watching her mothers face intently  naomi appeared to sleep  the candle burned long and the wick was crowned by a little cap of fiery red that seemed to watch eunice like some impish goblin  the wavering light cast grotesque shadows of sarah spencers head on the wall  the thin curtains at the window wavered to and fro as if shaken by ghostly hands  at midnight naomi holland opened her eyes  the child she had never loved was the only one to go with her to the brink of the unseen  euniceremember  it was the faintest whisper  the soul passing over the threshold of another life strained back to its only earthly tie a quiver passed over the long pallid face  a horrible scream rang through the silent house  sarah spencer sprang out of her doze in consternation and gazed blankly at the shrieking child  caroline came hurrying in with distended eyes on the bed naomi holland lay dead   in the room where she had died naomi holland lay in her coffin it was dim and hushed but in the rest of the house the preparations for the funeral were being hurried on  through it all eunice moved calm and silent  since her one wild spasm of screaming by her mothers deathbed she had shed no tear given no sign of grief  perhaps as her mother had said she had no time  there was christopher to be looked after  the boys grief was stormy and uncontrolled  he had cried until he was utterly exhausted  it was eunice who soothed him coaxed him to eat kept him constantly by her  at night she took him to her own room and watched over him while he slept  when the funeral was over the household furniture was packed away or sold  the house was locked up and the farm rented  there was nowhere for the children to go save to their uncles  caroline holland did not want them but having to take them she grimly made up her mind to do what she considered her duty by them  she had five children of her own and between them and christopher a standing feud had existed from the time he could walk  she had never liked naomi  few people did  benjamin holland had not married until late in life and his wife had declared war on his family at sight  she was a stranger in avonleaa widow with a three yearold child  she made few friends as some people always asserted that she was not in her right mind  within a year of her second marriage christopher was born and from the hour of his birth his mother had worshiped him blindly he was her only solace  for him she toiled and pinched and saved  benjamin holland had not been forehanded when she married him but when he died six years after his marriage he was a welltodo man  naomi made no pretense of mourning for him  it was an open secret that they had quarreled like the proverbial cat and dog charles holland and his wife had naturally sided with benjamin and naomi fought her battles singlehanded  after her husbands death she managed to farm alone and made it pay  when the mysterious malady which was to end her life first seized on her she fought against it with all the strength and stubbornness of her strong and stubborn nature  her will won for her an added year of life and then she had to yield  she tasted all the bitterness of death the day on which she lay down on her bed and saw her enemy come in to rule her house  but caroline holland was not a bad or unkind woman  true she did not love naomi or her children but the woman was dying and must be looked after for the sake of common humanity  caroline thought she had done well by her sisterinlaw  when the red clay was heaped over naomis grave in the avonlea burying ground caroline took eunice and christopher home with her  christopher did not want to go it was eunice who reconciled him  he clung to her with an exacting affection born of loneliness and grief  in the days that followed caroline holland was obliged to confess to herself that there would have been no doing anything with christopher had it not been for eunice  the boy was sullen and obstinate but his sister had an unfailing influence over him  in charles hollands household no one was allowed to eat the bread of idleness  his own children were all girls and christopher came in handy as a chore boy  he was made to workperhaps too hard  but eunice helped him and did half his work for him when nobody knew  when he quarreled with his cousins she took his part whenever possible she took on herself the blame and punishment of his misdeeds  electa holland was charles unmarried sister  she had kept house for benjamin until he married then naomi had bundled her out electa had never forgiven her for it  her hatred passed on to naomis children  in a hundred petty ways she revenged herself on them  for herself eunice bore it patiently but it was a different matter when it touched christopher  once electa boxed christophers ears  eunice who was knitting by the table stood up  a resemblance to her mother never before visible came out in her face like a brand  she lifted her hand and slapped electas cheek deliberately twice leaving a dull red mark where she struck  if you ever strike my brother again she said slowly and vindictively i will slap your face every time you do  you have no right to touch him  my patience what a fury said electa  naomi hollandll never be dead as long as youre alive  she told charles of the affair and eunice was severely punished but electa never interfered with christopher again   all the discordant elements in the holland household could not prevent the children from growing up  it was a consummation which the harrassed caroline devoutly wished  when christopher holland was seventeen he was a man growna big strapping fellow  his childish beauty had coarsened but he was thought handsome by many  he took charge of his mothers farm then and the brother and sister began their new life together in the longunoccupied house  there were few regrets on either side when they left charles hollands roof  in her secret heart eunice felt an unspeakable relief  christopher had been hard to manage as his uncle said in the last year  he was getting into the habit of keeping late hours and doubtful company  this always provoked an explosion of wrath from charles holland and the conflicts between him and his nephew were frequent and bitter  for four years after their return home eunice had a hard and anxious life  christopher was idle and dissipated  most people regarded him as a worthless fellow and his uncle washed his hands of him utterly  only eunice never failed him she never reproached or railed she worked like a slave to keep things together  eventually her patience prevailed  christopher to a great extent reformed and worked harder  he was never unkind to eunice even in his rages  it was not in him to appreciate or return her devotion but his tolerant acceptance of it was her solace  when eunice was twentyeight edward bell wanted to marry her he was a plain middleaged widower with four children but as caroline did not fail to remind her eunice herself was not for every market and the former did her best to make the match  she might have succeeded had it not been for christopher  when he in spite of carolines skillful management got an inkling of what was going on he flew into a true holland rage  if eunice married and left himhe would sell the farm and go to the devil by way of the klondike  he could not and would not do without her  no arrangement suggested by caroline availed to pacify him and in the end eunice refused to marry edward bell  she could not leave christopher she said simply and in this she stood rockfirm  caroline could not budge her an inch  youre a fool eunice she said when she was obliged to give up in despair  its not likely youll ever have another chance as for chris in a year or two hell be marrying himself and where will you be then  youll find your nose nicely out of joint when he brings a wife in here  the shaft went home  eunices lips turned white  but she said faintly the house is big enough for us both if he does  caroline sniffed  maybe so  youll find out  however theres no use talking youre as set as your mother was and nothing would ever budge her an inch  i only hope you wont be sorry for it  when three more years had passed christopher began to court victoria pye  the affair went on for some time before either eunice or the hollands go wind of it  when they did there was an explosion  between the hollands and the pyes root and branch existed a feud that dated back for three generations  that the original cause of the quarrel was totally forgotten did not matter it was matter of family pride that a holland should have no dealings with a pye  when christopher flew so openly in the face of this cherished hatred there could be nothing less than consternation  charles holland broke through his determination to have nothing to do with christopher to remonstrate  caroline went to eunice in as much of a splutter as if christopher had been her own brother  eunice did not care a row of pins for the hollandpye feud victoria was to her what any other girl upon whom christopher cast eyes of love would have beena supplanter  for the first time in her life she was torn with passionate jealousy existence became a nightmare to her  urged on by caroline and her own pain she ventured to remonstrate with christopher also  she had expected a burst of rage but he was surprisingly goodnatured  he seemed even amused  what have you got against victoria he asked tolerantly  eunice had no answer ready  it was true that nothing could be said against the girl  she felt helpless and baffled christopher laughed at her silence  i guess youre a little jealous he said  you must have expected i would get married some time  this house is big enough for us all  youd better look at the matter sensibly eunice dont let charles and caroline put nonsense into your head  a man must marry to please himself  christopher was out late that night  eunice waited up for him as she always did  it was a chilly spring evening reminding her of the night her mother had died  the kitchen was in spotless order and she sat down on a stiffbacked chair by the window to wait for her brother  she did not want a light  the moonlight fell in with faint illumination  outside the wind was blowing over a bed of newsprung mint in the garden and was suggestively fragrant  it was a very oldfashioned garden full of perennials naomi holland had planted long ago  eunice always kept it primly neat  she had been working in it that day and felt tired  she was all alone in the house and the loneliness filled her with a faint dread  she had tried all that day to reconcile herself to christophers marriage and had partially succeeded  she told herself that she could still watch over him and care for his comfort  she would even try to love victoria after all it might be pleasant to have another woman in the house  so sitting there she fed her hungry soul with these husks of comfort  when she heard christophers step she moved about quickly to get a light  he frowned when he saw her he had always resented her sitting up for him  he sat down by the stove and took off his boots while eunice got a lunch for him  after he had eaten it in silence he made no move to go to bed  a chill premonitory fear crept over eunice  it did not surprise her at all when christopher finally said abruptly eunice ive a notion to get married this spring  eunice clasped her hands together under the table  it was what she had been expecting  she said so in a monotonous voice  we must make some arrangement forfor you eunice christopher went on in a hurried hesitant way keeping his eyes riveted doggedly on his plate  victoria doesnt exactly likewell she thinks its better for young married folks to begin life by themselves and i guess shes about right  you wouldnt find it comfortable anyhow having to step back to second place after being mistress here so long  eunice tried to speak but only an indistinct murmur came from her bloodless lips  the sound made christopher look up something in her face irritated him  he pushed back his chair impatiently  now eunice dont go taking on  it wont be any use  look at this business in a sensible way  im fond of you and all that but a man is bound to consider his wife first  ill provide for you comfortably  do you mean to say that your wife is going to turn me out eunice gasped rather than spoke the words  christopher drew his reddish brows together  i just mean that victoria says she wont marry me if she has to live with you  shes afraid of you  i told her you wouldnt interfere with her but she wasnt satisfied  its your own fault eunice  youve always been so queer and close that people think youre an awful crank  victorias young and lively and you and she wouldnt get on at all  there isnt any question of turning you out  ill build a little house for you somewhere and youll be a great deal better off there than you would be here  so dont make a fuss  eunice did not look as if she were going to make a fuss  she sat as if turned to stone her hands lying palm upward in her lap christopher got up hugely relieved that the dreaded explanation was over  guess ill go to bed  youd better have gone long ago  its all nonsense this waiting up for me  when he had gone eunice drew a long sobbing breath and looked about her like a dazed soul  all the sorrow of her life was as nothing to the desolation that assailed her now  she rose and with uncertain footsteps passed out through the hall and into the room where her mother died  she had always kept it locked and undisturbed it was arranged just as naomi holland had left it  eunice tottered to the bed and sat down on it  she recalled the promise she had made to her mother in that very room  was the power to keep it to be wrested from her  was she to be driven from her home and parted from the only creature she had on earth to love  and would christopher allow it after all her sacrifices for him  aye that he would  he cared more for that blackeyed waxenfaced girl at the old pye place than for his own kin  eunice put her hands over her dry burning eyes and groaned aloud   caroline holland had her hour of triumph over eunice when she heard it all  to one of her nature there was no pleasure so sweet as that of saying i told you so  having said it however she offered eunice a home  electa holland was dead and eunice might fill her place very acceptably if she would  you cant go off and live by yourself caroline told her its all nonsense to talk of such a thing  we will give you a home if christopher is going to turn you out  you were always a fool eunice to pet and pamper him as youve done  this is the thanks you get for itturned out like a dog for his fine wifes whim  i only wish your mother was alive  it was probably the first time caroline had ever wished this she had flown at christopher like a fury about the matter and had been rudely insulted for her pains  christopher had told her to mind her own business  when caroline cooled down she made some arrangements with him to all of which eunice listlessly assented  she did not care what became of her  when christopher holland brought victoria as mistress to the house where his mother had toiled and suffered and ruled with her rod of iron eunice was gone  in charles hollands household she took electas placean unpaid upper servant  charles and caroline were kind enough to her and there was plenty to do  for five years her dull colorless life went on during which time she never crossed the threshold of the house where victoria holland ruled with a sway as absolute as naomis had been  carolines curiosity led her after her first anger had cooled to make occasional calls the observations of which she faithfully reported to eunice  the latter never betrayed any interest in them save once  this was when caroline came home full of the news that victoria had had the room where naomi died opened up and showily furnished as a parlor  then eunices sallow face crimsoned and her eyes flashed over the desecration  but no word of comment or complaint ever crossed her lips  she knew as every one else knew that the glamor soon went from christopher hollands married life  the marriage proved an unhappy one  not unnaturally although unjustly eunice blamed victoria for this and hated her more than ever for it  christopher seldom came to charles house  possibly he felt ashamed  he had grown into a morose silent man at home and abroad  it was said he had gone back to his old drinking habits  one fall victoria holland went to town to visit her married sister  she took their only child with her  in her absence christopher kept house for himself  it was a fall long remembered in avonlea  with the dropping of the leaves and the shortening of the dreary days the shadow of a fear fell over the land  charles holland brought the fateful news home one night  theres smallpox in charlottetownfive or six cases  came in one of the vessels  there was a concert and a sailor from one of the ships was there and took sick the next day  this was alarming enough  charlottetown was not so very far away and considerable traffic went on between it and the north shore districts  when caroline recounted the concert story to christopher the next morning his ruddy face turned quite pale  he opened his lips as if to speak then closed them again  they were sitting in the kitchen caroline had run over to return some tea she had borrowed and incidentally to see what she could of victorias housekeeping in her absence  her eyes had been busy while her tongue ran on so she did not notice the mans pallor and silence  how long does it take for smallpox to develop after one has been exposed to it he asked abruptly when caroline rose to go  ten to fourteen days i calclate was her answer  i must see about having the girls vaccinated right off  itll likely spread  when do you expect victoria home  when shes ready to come whenever that will be was the gruff response  a week later caroline said to eunice whatevers got christopher  he hasnt been out anywhere for agesjust hangs round home the whole time  its something new for him  i spose the place is so quiet now madam victorias away that he can find some rest for his soul  i believe ill run over after milking and see how hes getting on  you might as well come too eunice  eunice shook her head  she had all her mothers obstinacy and darken victorias door she would not  she went on patiently darning socks sitting at the west window which was her favorite positionperhaps because she could look from it across the sloping field and past the crescent curve of maple grove to her lost home  after milking caroline threw a shawl over her head and ran across the field  the house looked lonely and deserted  as she fumbled at the latch of the gate the kitchen door opened and christopher holland appeared on the threshold  dont come any farther he called  caroline fell back in blank astonishment  was this some more of victorias work  i aint an agent for the smallpox she called back viciously  christopher did not heed her  will you go home and ask uncle if hell go or send for doctor spencer  hes the smallpox doctor  im sick  caroline felt a thrill of dismay and fear  she faltered a few steps backward  sick  whats the matter with you  i was in charlottetown that night and went to the concert that sailor sat right beside me  i thought at the time he looked sick  it was just twelve days ago  ive felt bad all day yesterday and today  send for the doctor  dont come near the house or let any one else come near  he went in and shut the door  caroline stood for a few moments in an almost ludicrous panic  then she turned and ran as if for her life across the field  eunice saw her coming and met her at the door  mercy on us gasped caroline  christophers sick and he thinks hes got the smallpox  wheres charles  eunice tottered back against the door  her hand went up to her side in a way that had been getting very common with her of late even in the midst of her excitement caroline noticed it  eunice what makes you do that every time anything startles you she asked sharply  is it anything about your heart  i dontknow  a little painits gone now  did you say that christopher hasthe smallpox  well he says so himself and its more than likely considering the circumstances  i declare i never got such a turn in my life  its a dreadful thing  i must find charles at oncetherell be a hundred things to do  eunice hardly heard her  her mind was centered upon one idea christopher was illaloneshe must go to him  it did not matter what his disease was  when caroline came in from her breathless expedition to the barn she found eunice standing by the table with her hat and shawl on tying up a parcel  eunice  where on earth are you going  over home said eunice  if christopher is going to be ill he must be nursed and im the one to do it  he ought to be seen to right away  eunice carr  have you gone clean out of your senses  its the smallpoxthe smallpox  if hes got it hell have to be taken to the smallpox hospital in town  you shant stir a step to go to that house  i will  eunice faced her excited aunt quietly  the odd resemblance to her mother which only came out in moments of great tension was plainly visible  he shant go to the hospitalthey never get proper attention there  you neednt try to stop me  it wont put you or your family in any danger  caroline fell helplessly into a chair  she felt that it would be of no use to argue with a woman so determined  she wished charles was there  but charles had already gone posthaste for the doctor  with a firm step eunice went across the field footpath she had not trodden for so long  she felt no fearrather a sort of elation  christopher needed her once more the interloper who had come between them was not there  as she walked through the frosty twilight she thought of the promise made to naomi holland years ago   christopher saw her coming and waved her back  dont come any nearer eunice  didnt caroline tell you  im taking smallpox  eunice did not pause  she went boldly through the yard and up the porch steps  he retreated before her and held the door  eunice youre crazy girl  go home before its too late  eunice pushed open the door resolutely and went in  its too late now  im here and i mean to stay and nurse you if its the smallpox youve got  maybe its not  just now when a person has a fingerache he thinks its smallpox  anyhow whatever it is you ought to be in bed and looked after  youll catch cold  let me get a light and have a look at you  christopher had sunk into a chair  his natural selfishness reasserted itself and he made no further effort to dissuade eunice  she got a lamp and set it on the table by him while she scrutinized his face closely  you look feverish  what do you feel like  when did you take sick  yesterday afternoon  i have chills and hot spells and pains in my back  eunice do you think its really smallpox  and will i die  he caught her hands and looked imploringly up at her as a child might have done  eunice felt a wave of love and tenderness sweep warmly over her starved heart  dont worry  lots of people recover from smallpox if theyre properly nursed and youll be that for ill see to it  charles has gone for the doctor and well know when he comes  you must go straight to bed  she took off her hat and shawl and hung them up  she felt as much at home as if she had never been away  she had got back to her kingdom and there was none to dispute it with her  when dr spencer and old giles blewett who had had smallpox in his youth came two hours later they found eunice in serene charge  the house was in order and reeking of disinfectants  victorias fine furniture and fixings were being bundled out of the parlor there was no bedroom downstairs and if christopher was going to be ill he must be installed there  the doctor looked grave  i dont like it he said but im not quite sure yet  if it is smallpox the eruption will probably by out by morning  i must admit he has most of the symptoms  will you have him taken to the hospital  no said eunice decisively  ill nurse him myself  im not afraid and im well and strong  very well  youve been vaccinated lately  yes  well nothing more can be done at present  you may as well lie down for a while and save your strength  but eunice could not do that  there was too much to attend to she went out to the hall and threw up the window  down below at a safe distance charles holland was waiting  the cold wind blew up to eunice the odor of the disinfectants with which he had steeped himself  what does the doctor say he shouted  he thinks its the smallpox  have you sent word to victoria  yes jim blewett drove into town and told her  shell stay with her sister till it is over  of course its the best thing for her to do  shes terribly frightened  eunices lip curled contemptuously  to her a wife who could desert her husband no matter what disease he had was an incomprehensible creature  but it was better so she would have christopher all to herself  the night was long and wearisome but the morning came all too soon for the dread certainty it brought  the doctor pronounced the case smallpox  eunice had hoped against hope but now knowing the worst she was very calm and resolute  by noon the fateful yellow flag was flying over the house and all arrangements had been made  caroline was to do the necessary cooking and charles was to bring the food and leave it in the yard  old giles blewett was to come every day and attend to the stock as well as help eunice with the sick man and the long hard fight with death began  it was a hard fight indeed  christopher holland in the clutches of the loathsome disease was an object from which his nearest and dearest might have been pardoned for shrinking  but eunice never faltered she never left her post  sometimes she dozed in a chair by the bed but she never lay down  her endurance was something wonderful her patience and tenderness almost superhuman  to and fro she went in noiseless ministry as the long dreadful days wore away with a quiet smile on her lips and in her dark sorrowful eyes the rapt look of a pictured saint in some dim cathedral niche  for her there was no world outside the bare room where lay the repulsive object she loved  one day the doctor looked very grave  he had grown wellhardened to pitiful scenes in his lifetime but he shrunk from telling eunice that her brother could not live  he had never seen such devotion as hers  it seemed brutal to tell her that it had been in vain  but eunice had seen it for herself  she took it very calmly the doctor thought  and she had her reward at lastsuch as it was she thought it amply sufficient  one night christopher holland opened his swollen eyes as she bent over him  they were alone in the old house  it was raining outside and the drops rattled noisily on the panes  christopher smiled at his sister with parched lips and put out a feeble hand toward her  eunice he said faintly youve been the best sister ever a man had  i havent treated you right but youve stood by me to the last  tell victoriatell herto be good to you  his voice died away into an inarticulate murmur  eunice carr was alone with her dead  they buried christopher holland in haste and privacy the next day  the doctor disinfected the house and eunice was to stay there alone until it might be safe to make other arrangements she had not shed a tear the doctor thought she was a rather odd person but he had a great admiration for her  he told her she was the best nurse he had ever seen  to eunice praise or blame mattered nothing  something in her life had snappedsome vital interest had departed  she wondered how she could live through the dreary coming years  late that night she went into the room where her mother and brother had died  the window was open and the cold pure air was grateful to her after the drugladen atmosphere she had breathed so long  she knelt down by the stripped bed  mother she said aloud i have kept my promise  when she tried to rise long after she staggered and fell across the bed with her hand pressed on her heart  old giles blewett found her there in the morning  there was a smile on her face    xiii the conscience case of david bell  eben bell came in with an armful of wood and banged it cheerfully down in the box behind the glowing waterloo stove which was coloring the heart of the little kitchens gloom with tremulous rosered whirls of light  there sis thats the last chore on my list  bobs milking nothing more for me to do but put on my white collar for meeting avonlea is more than lively since the evangelist came aint it though  mollie bell nodded she was curling her hair before the tiny mirror that hung on the whitewashed wall and distorted her round pinkandwhite face into a grotesque caricature  wonder wholl stand up tonight said eben reflectively sitting down on the edge of the woodbox  there aint many sinners left in avonleaonly a few hardened chaps like myself  you shouldnt talk like that said mollie rebukingly  what if father heard you  father wouldnt hear me if i shouted it in his ear returned eben  he goes around these days like a man in a dream and a mighty bad dream at that  father has always been a good man whats the matter with him  i dont know said mollie dropping her voice  mother is dreadfully worried over him  and everybody is talking eb  it just makes me squirm  flora jane fletcher asked me last night why father never testified and him one of the elders  she said the minister was perplexed about it  i felt my face getting red  why didnt you tell her it was no business of hers said eben angrily  old flora jane had better mind her own business  but all the folks are talking about it eb  and mother is fretting her heart out over it  father has never acted like himself since these meetings began  he just goes there night after night and sits like a mummy with his head down  and almost everybody else in avonlea has testified  oh no theres lots havent said eben  matthew cuthbert never has nor uncle elisha nor any of the whites  but everybody knows they dont believe in getting up and testifying so nobody wonders when they dont  besides mollie laughedmatthew could never get a word out in public if he did believe in it  hed be too shy  but she added with a sigh it isnt that way with father  he believes in testimony so people wonder why he doesnt get up  why even old josiah sloane gets up every night  with his whiskers sticking out every which way and his hair ditto interjected the graceless eben  when the minister calls for testimonials and all the folks look at our pew i feel ready to sink through the floor for shame sighed mollie  if father would get up just once  miriam bell entered the kitchen  she was ready for the meeting to which major spencer was to take her  she was a tall pale girl with a serious face and dark thoughtful eyes totally unlike mollie  she had come under conviction during the meetings and had stood up for prayer and testimony several times  the evangelist thought her very spiritual  she heard mollies concluding sentence and spoke reprovingly  you shouldnt criticize your father mollie  it isnt for you to judge him  eben had hastily slipped out  he was afraid miriam would begin talking religion to him if he stayed  he had with difficulty escaped from an exhortation by robert in the cowstable  there was no peace in avonlea for the unregenerate he reflected robert and miriam had both come out and mollie was hovering on the brink  dad and i are the black sheep of the family he said with a laugh for which he at once felt guilty  eben had been brought up with a strict reverence for all religious matters  on the surface he might sometimes laugh at them but the deeps troubled him whenever he did so  indoors miriam touched her younger sisters shoulder and looked at her affectionately  wont you decide tonight mollie she asked in a voice tremulous with emotion  mollie crimsoned and turned her face away uncomfortably  she did not know what answer to make and was glad that a jingle of bells outside saved her the necessity of replying  theres your beau miriam she said as she darted into the sitting room  soon after eben brought the family pung and his chubby red mare to the door for mollie  he had not as yet attained to the dignity of a cutter of his own  that was for his elder brother robert who presently came out in his new fur coat and drove dashingly away with bells and glitter  thinks hes the people remarked eben with a fraternal grin  the rich winter twilight was purpling over the white world as they drove down the lane under the overarching wild cherry trees that glittered with gemmy hoarfrost  the snow creaked and crisped under the runners  a shrill wind was keening in the leafless dogwoods  over the trees the sky was a dome of silver with a lucent star or two on the slope of the west  earthstars gleamed warmly out here and there where homesteads were tucked snugly away in their orchards or groves of birch  the church will be jammed tonight said eben  its so fine that folks will come from near and far  guess itll be exciting  if only father would testify sighed mollie from the bottom of the pung where she was snuggled amid furs and straw  miriam can say what she likes but i do feels as if we were all disgraced  it sends a creep all over me to hear mr bentley say now isnt there one more to say a word for jesus and look right over at father  eben flicked his mare with his whip and she broke into a trot the silence was filled with a faint fairylike melody from afar down the road where a pungful of young folks from white sands were singing hymns on their way to meeting  look here mollie said eben awkwardly at last are you going to stand up for prayers tonight  ii cant as long as father acts this way answered mollie in a choked voice  ii want to eb and mirry and bob want me to but i cant  i do hope that the evangelist wont come and talk to me special tonight  i always feels as if i was being pulled two different ways when he does  back in the kitchen at home mrs bell was waiting for her husband to bring the horse to the door  she was a slight darkeyed little woman with thin vividred cheeks  from out of the swathings in which she had wrapped her bonnet her face gleamed sad and troubled  now and then she sighed heavily  the cat came to her from under the stove languidly stretching himself and yawning until all the red cavern of his mouth and throat was revealed  at the moment he had an uncanny resemblance to elder joseph blewett of white sandsroaring joe the irreverent boys called himwhen he grew excited and shouted mrs bell saw itand then reproached herself for the sacrilege  but its no wonder ive wicked thoughts she said wearily im that worried i aint rightly myself  if he would only tell me what the trouble is maybe i could help him  at any rate id know  it hurts me so to see him going about day after day with his head hanging and that look on his face as if he had something fearful on his consciencehim that never harmed a living soul  and then the way he groans and mutters in his sleep  he has always lived a just upright life  he hasnt no right to go on like this disgracing his family  mrs bells angry sob was cut short by the sleigh at the door her husband poked in his busy irongray head and said now mother  he helped her into the sleigh tucked the rugs warmly around her and put a hot brick at her feet  his solicitude hurt her  it was all for her material comfort  it did not matter to him what mental agony she might suffer over his strange attitude for the first time in their married life mary bell felt resentment against her husband  they drove along in silence past the snowpowdered hedges of spruce and under the arches of the forest roadways  they were late and a great stillness was over all the land  david bell never spoke  all his usual cheerful talkativeness had disappeared since the revival meetings had begun in avonlea from the first he had gone about as a man over whom some strange doom is impending seemingly oblivious to all that might be said or thought of him in his own family or in the church  mary bell thought she would go out of her mind if her husband continued to act in this way  her reflections were bitter and rebellious as they sped along through the glittering night of the winters prime  i dont get one bit of good out of the meetings she thought resentfully  there aint any peace or joy for me not even in testifying myself when david sits there like a stick or stone if hed been opposed to the revivalist coming here like old uncle jerry or if he didnt believe in public testimony i wouldnt mind  id understand  but as it is i feel dreadful humiliated  revival meetings had never been held in avonlea before  uncle jerry macpherson who was the supreme local authority in church matters taking precedence of even the minister had been uncompromisingly opposed to them  he was a stern deeply religious scotchman with a horror of the emotional form of religion  as long as uncle jerrys spare ascetic form and deeplygraved squarejawed face filled his accustomed corner by the northwest window of avonlea church no revivalist might venture therein although the majority of the congregation including the minister would have welcomed one warmly  but now uncle jerry was sleeping peacefully under the tangled grasses and white snows of the burying ground and if dead people ever do turn in their graves uncle jerry might well have turned in his when the revivalist came to avonlea church and there followed the emotional services public testimonies and religious excitement which the old mans sturdy soul had always abhorred  avonlea was a good field for an evangelist  the rev geoffrey mountain who came to assist the avonlea minister in revivifying the dry bones thereof knew this and reveled in the knowledge it was not often that such a virgin parish could be found nowadays with scores of impressionable unspoiled souls on which fervid oratory could play skillfully as a master on a mighty organ until every note in them thrilled to life and utterance the rev geoffrey mountain was a good man of the earth earthy to be sure but with an unquestionable sincerity of belief and purpose which went far to counterbalance the sensationalism of some of his methods  he was large and handsome with a marvelously sweet and winning voicea voice that could melt into irresistible tenderness or swell into sonorous appeal and condemnation or ring like a trumpet calling to battle  his frequent grammatical errors and lapses into vulgarity counted for nothing against its charm and the most commonplace words in the world would have borrowed much of the power of real oratory from its magic  he knew its value and used it effectivelyperhaps even ostentatiously  geoffrey mountains religion and methods like the man himself were showy but of their kind sincere and though the good he accomplished might not be unmixed it was a quantity to be reckoned with  so the rev geoffrey mountain came to avonlea conquering and to conquer  night after night the church was crowded with eager listeners who hung breathlessly on his words and wept and thrilled and exulted as he willed  into many young souls his appeals and warnings burned their way and each night they rose for prayer in response to his invitation  older christians too took on a new lease of intensity and even the unregenerate and the scoffers found a certain fascination in the meetings threading through it all for old and young converted and unconverted was an unacknowledged feeling for religious dissipation  avonlea was a quiet placeand the revival meetings were lively  when david and mary bell reached the church the services had begun and they heard the refrain of a hallelujah hymn as they were crossing harmon andrews field  david bell left his wife at the platform and drove to the horseshed  mrs bell unwound the scarf from her bonnet and shook the frost crystals from it  in the porch flora jane fletcher and her sister mrs harmon andrews were talking in low whispers presently flora jane put out her lank cashmeregloved hand and plucked mrs bells shawl  mary is the elder going to testify tonight she asked in a shrill whisper  mrs bell winced  she would have given much to be able to answer yes but she had to say stiffly  i dont know  flora jane lifted her chin  well mrs bell i only asked because every one thinks it is strange he doesntand an elder of all people  it looks as if he didnt think himself a christian you know  of course we all know better but it looks that way  if i was you id tell him folks was talking about it  mr bentley says it is hindering the full success of the meetings  mrs bell turned on her tormentor in swift anger  she might resent her husbands strange behavior herself but nobody else should dare to criticize him to her  i dont think you need to worry yourself about the elder flora jane she said bitingly  maybe tisnt the best christians that do the most talking about it always  i guess as far as living up to his profession goes the elder will compare pretty favorably with levi boulter who gets up and testifies every night and cheats the very eyeteeth out of people in the daytime  levi boulter was a middleaged widower with a large family who was supposed to have cast a matrimonial eye flora janeward  the use of his name was an effective thrust on mrs bells part and silenced flora jane  too angry for speech she seized her sisters arm and hurried her into church  but her victory could not remove from mary bells soul the sting implanted there by flora janes words  when her husband came up to the platform she put her hand on his snowy arm appealingly  oh david wont you get up tonight  i do feel so dreadful badfolks are talking soi just feel humiliated  david bell hung his head like a shamed schoolboy  i cant mary he said huskily  taint no use to pester me  you dont care for my feelings said his wife bitterly  and mollie wont come out because youre acting so  youre keeping her back from salvation  and youre hindering the success of the revivalmr bentley says so  david bell groaned  this sign of suffering wrung his wifes heart  with quick contrition she whispered  there never mind david  i oughtnt to have spoken to you so you know your duty best  lets go in  wait  his voice was imploring  mary is it true that mollie wont come out because of me  am i standing in my childs light  idontknow  i guess not  mollies just a foolish young girl yet  never mindcome in  he followed her dejectedly in and up the aisle to their pew in the center of the church  the building was warm and crowded the pastor was reading the bible lesson for the evening  in the choir behind him david bell saw mollies girlish face tinged with a troubled seriousness  his own windruddy face and bushy gray eyebrows worked convulsively with his inward throes  a sigh that was almost a groan burst from him  ill have to do it he said to himself in agony  when several more hymns had been sung and late arrivals began to pack the aisles the evangelist arose  his style for the evening was the tender the pleading the solemn  he modulated his tones to marvelous sweetness and sent them thrillingly over the breathless pews entangling the hearts and souls of his listeners in a mesh of subtle emotion  many of the women began to cry softly  fervent amens broke from some of the members  when the evangelist sat down after a closing appeal which in its way was a masterpiece an audible sigh of relieved tension passed like a wave over the audience  after prayer the pastor made the usual request that if any of those present wished to come out on the side of christ they would signify the wish by rising for a moment in their places after a brief interval a pale boy under the gallery rose followed by an old man at the top of the church  a frightened sweetfaced child of twelve got tremblingly upon her feet and a dramatic thrill passed over the congregation when her mother suddenly stood up beside her  the evangelists thank god was hearty and insistent  david bell looked almost imploringly at mollie but she kept her seat with downcast eyes  over in the big square stone pew he saw eben bending forward with his elbows on his knees gazing frowningly at the floor  im a stumbling block to them both he thought bitterly  a hymn was sung and prayer offered for those under conviction then testimonies were called for  the evangelist asked for them in tones which made it seem a personal request to every one in that building  many testimonies followed each infused with the personality of the giver  most of them were brief and stereotyped  finally a pause ensued  the evangelist swept the pews with his kindling eyes and exclaimed appealingly  has every christian in this church tonight spoken a word for his master  there were many who had not testified but every eye in the building followed the pastors accusing glance to the bell pew mollie crimsoned with shame  mrs bell cowered visibly  although everybody looked thus at david bell nobody now expected him to testify  when he rose to his feet a murmur of surprise passed over the audience followed by a silence so complete as to be terrible  to david bell it seemed to possess the awe of final judgment  twice he opened his lips and tried vainly to speak  the third time he succeeded but his voice sounded strangely in his own ears  he gripped the back of the pew before him with his knotty hands and fixed his eyes unseeingly on the christian endeavor pledge that hung over the heads of the choir  brethren and sisters he said hoarsely before i can say a word of christian testimony here tonight ive got something to confess  its been lying hard and heavy on my conscience ever since these meetings begun  as long as i kept silence about it i couldnt get up and bear witness for christ  many of you have expected me to do it  maybe ive been a stumbling block to some of you  this season of revival has brought no blessing to me because of my sin which i repented of but tried to conceal there has been a spiritual darkness over me  friends and neighbors i have always been held by you as an honest man  it was the shame of having you know i was not which has kept me back from open confession and testimony  just afore these meetings commenced i come home from town one night and found that somebody had passed a counterfeit tendollar bill on me  then satan entered into me and possessed me  when mrs rachel lynde come next day collecting for foreign missions i give her that ten dollar bill  she never knowed the difference and sent it away with the rest  but i knew id done a mean and sinful thing  i couldnt drive it out of my thoughts  a few days afterwards i went down to mrs rachels and give her ten good dollars for the fund  i told her i had come to the conclusion i ought to give more than ten dollars out of my abundance to the lord  that was a lie  mrs lynde thought i was a generous man and i felt ashamed to look her in the face but id done what i could to right the wrong and i thought it would be all right  but it wasnt  ive never known a minutes peace of mind or conscience since  i tried to cheat the lord and then tried to patch it up by doing something that redounded to my worldly credit  when these meetings begun and everybody expected me to testify i couldnt do it  it would have seemed like blasphemy  and i couldnt endure the thought of telling what id done either  i argued it all out a thousand times that i hadnt done any real harm after all but it was no use  ive been so wrapped up in my own brooding and misery that i didnt realize i was inflicting suffering on those dear to me by my conduct and maybe holding some of them back from the paths of salvation  but my eyes have been opened to this tonight and the lord has given me strength to confess my sin and glorify his holy name  the broken tones ceased and david bell sat down wiping the great drops of perspiration from his brow  to a man of his training and cast of thought no ordeal could be more terrible than that through which he had just passed  but underneath the turmoil of his emotion he felt a great calm and peace threaded with the exultation of a hardwon spiritual victory  over the church was a solemn hush  the evangelists amen was not spoken with his usual unctuous fervor but very gently and reverently  in spite of his coarse fiber he could appreciate the nobility behind such a confession as this and the deeps of stern suffering it sounded  before the last prayer the pastor paused and looked around  is there yet one he asked gently who wishes to be especially remembered in our concluding prayer  for a moment nobody moved  then mollie bell stood up in the choir seat and down by the stove eben his flushed boyish face held high rose sturdily to his feet in the midst of his companions  thank god whispered mary bell  amen said her husband huskily  let us pray said mr bentley    xiv only a common fellow  on my dearies wedding morning i wakened early and went to her room  long and long ago she had made me promise that i would be the one to wake her on the morning of her wedding day  you were the first to take me in your arms when i came into the world aunt rachel she had said and i want you to be the first to greet me on that wonderful day  but that was long ago and now my heart foreboded that there would be no need of wakening her  and there was not  she was lying there awake very quiet with her hand under her cheek and her big blue eyes fixed on the window through which a pale dull light was creeping ina joyless light it was and enough to make a body shiver  i felt more like weeping than rejoicing and my heart took to aching when i saw her there so white and patient more like a girl who was waiting for a windingsheet than for a bridal veil  but she smiled bravelike when i sat down on her bed and took her hand  you look as if you havent slept all night dearie i said  i didntnot a great deal she answered me  but the night didnt seem long no it seemed too short  i was thinking of a great many things  what time is it aunt rachel  five oclock  then in six hours more  she suddenly sat up in her bed her great thick rope of brown hair falling over her white shoulders and flung her arms about me and burst into tears on my old breast  i petted and soothed her and said not a word and after a while she stopped crying but she still sat with her head so that i couldnt see her face  we didnt think it would be like this once did we aunt rachel she said very softly  it shouldnt be like this now i said  i had to say it  i never could hide the thought of that marriage and i couldnt pretend to  it was all her stepmothers doingsright well i knew that  my dearie would never have taken mark foster else  dont let us talk of that she said soft and beseeching just the same way she used to speak when she was a babychild and wanted to coax me into something  let us talk about the old daysand him  i dont see much use in talking of him when youre going to marry mark foster today i said  but she put her hand on my mouth  its for the last time aunt rachel  after today i can never talk of him or even think of him  its four years since he went away  do you remember how he looked aunt rachel  i mind well enough i reckon i said kind of curtlike  and i did  owen blair hadnt a face a body could forgetthat long face of his with its clean color and its eyes made to look love into a womans  when i thought of mark fosters sallow skin and lank jaws i felt sicklike  not that mark was uglyhe was just a commonlooking fellow  he was so handsome wasnt he aunt rachel my dearie went on in that patient voice of hers  so tall and strong and handsome i wish we hadnt parted in anger  it was so foolish of us to quarrel  but it would have been all right if he had lived to come back  i know it would have been all right  i know he didnt carry any bitterness against me to his death  i thought once aunt rachel that i would go through life true to him and then over on the other side id meet him just as before all his and his only  but it isnt to be  thanks to your stepmas wheedling and mark fosters scheming said i  no mark didnt scheme she said patiently  dont be unjust to mark aunt rachel  he has been very good and kind  hes as stupid as an owlet and as stubborn as solomons mule i said for i would say it  hes just a common fellow and yet he thinks hes good enough for my beauty  dont talk about mark she pleaded again  i mean to be a good faithful wife to him  but im my own woman yetyetfor just a few more sweet hours and i want to give them to him  the last hours of my maidenhoodthey must belong to him  so she talked of him me sitting there and holding her with her lovely hair hanging down over my arm and my heart aching so for her that it hurt bitter  she didnt feel as bad as i did because shed made up her mind what to do and was resigned  she was going to marry mark foster but her heart was in france in that grave nobody knew of where the huns had buried owen blairif they had buried him at all  and she went over all they had been to each other since they were mites of babies going to school together and meaning even then to be married when they grew up and the first words of love hed said to her and what shed dreamed and hoped for  the only thing she didnt bring up was the time he thrashed mark foster for bringing her apples she never mentioned marks name it was all owenowenand how he looked and what might have been if he hadnt gone off to the awful war and got shot  and there was me holding her and listening to it all and her stepma sleeping sound and triumphant in the next room  when she had talked it all out she lay down on her pillow again i got up and went downstairs to light the fire  i felt terrible old and tired  my feet seemed to drag and the tears kept coming to my eyes though i tried to keep them away for well i knew it was a bad omen to be weeping on a wedding day  before long isabella clark came down bright and pleasedlooking enough she was  id never liked isabella from the day phillippas father brought her here and i liked her less than ever this morning  she was one of your sly deep women always smiling smooth and scheming underneath it  ill say it for her though she had been good to phillippa but it was her doings that my dearie was to marry mark foster that day  up betimes rachel she said smiling and speaking me fair as she always did and hating me in her heart as i well knew that is right for well have plenty to do today  a wedding makes lots of work  not this sort of a wedding i said sourlike  i dont call it a wedding when two people get married and sneak off as if they were ashamed of itas well they might be in this case  it was phillippas own wish that all should be very quiet said isabella as smooth as cream  you know id have given her a big wedding if shed wanted it  oh its better quiet i said  the fewer to see phillippa marry a man like mark foster the better  mark foster is a good man rachel  no good man would be content to buy a girl as hes bought phillippa i said determined to give it in to her  hes a common fellow not fit for my dearie to wipe her feet on  its well that her mother didnt live to see this day but this day would never have come if shed lived  i dare say phillippas mother would have remembered that mark foster is very well off quite as readily as worse people said isabella a little spitefully  i liked her better when she was spiteful than when she was smooth  i didnt feel so scared of her then  the marriage was to be at eleven oclock and at nine i went up to help phillippa dress  she was no fussy bride caring much what she looked like  if owen had been the bridegroom it would have been different  nothing would have pleased her then but now it was only just that will do very well aunt rachel without even glancing at it  still nothing could prevent her from looking lovely when she was dressed  my dearie would have been a beauty in a beggarmaids rags  in her white dress and veil she was as fair as a queen and she was as good as she was pretty  it was the right sort of goodness too with just enough spice of original sin in it to keep it from spoiling by reason of oversweetness  then she sent me out  i want to be alone my last hour she said  kiss me aunt rachelmother rachel  when id gone down crying like the old fool i was i heard a rap at the door  my first thought was to go out and send isabella to it for i supposed it was mark foster come ahead of time and small stomach i had for seeing him  i fall trembling even yet when i think what if i had sent isabella to that door  but go i did and opened it defiantlike kind of hoping it was mark foster to see the tears on my face  i opened itand staggered back like id got a blow  owen  lord ha mercy on us  owen i said just like that going cold all over for its the truth that i thought it was his spirit come back to forbid that unholy marriage  but he sprang right in and caught my wrinkled old hands in a grasp that was of flesh and blood  aunt rachel im not too late he said savagelike  tell me im in time  i looked up at him standing over me there tall and handsome no change in him except he was so brown and had a little white scar on his forehead and though i couldnt understand at all being all bewilderedlike i felt a great deep thankfulness  no youre not too late i said  thank god said he under his breath  and then he pulled me into the parlor and shut the door  they told me at the station that phillippa was to be married to mark foster today  i couldnt believe it but i came here as fast as horseflesh could bring me  aunt rachel it cant be true  she cant care for mark foster even if she had forgotten me  its true enough that she is to marry mark i said halflaughing halfcrying but she doesnt care for him  every beat of her heart is for you  its all her stepmas doings mark has got a mortgage on the place and he told isabella clark that if phillippa would marry him hed burn the mortgage and if she wouldnt hed foreclose  phillippa is sacrificing herself to save her stepma for her dead fathers sake  its all your fault i cried getting over my bewilderment  we thought you were dead  why didnt you come home when you were alive why didnt you write  i did write after i got out of the hospital several times he said and never a word in answer aunt rachel  what was i to think when phillippa wouldnt answer my letters  she never got one i cried  she wept her sweet eyes out over you  somebody must have got those letters  and i knew then and i know now though never a shadow of proof have i that isabella clark had got themand kept them  that woman would stick at nothing  well well sift that matter some other time said owen impatiently  there are other things to think of now  i must see phillippa  ill manage it for you i said eagerly but just as i spoke the door opened and isabella and mark came in  never shall i forget the look on isabellas face  i almost felt sorry for her she turned sickly yellow and her eyes went wild they were looking at the downfall of all her schemes and hopes  i didnt look at mark foster at first and when i did there wasnt anything to see  his face was just as sallow and wooden as ever he looked undersized and common beside owen  nobodyd ever have picked him out for a bridegroom  owen spoke first  i want to see phillippa he said as if it were but yesterday that he had gone away  all isabellas smoothness and policy had dropped away from her and the real woman stood there plotting and unscrupulous as id always know her  you cant see her she said desperatelike  she doesnt want to see you  you went and left her and never wrote and she knew you werent worth fretting over and she has learned to care for a better man  i did write and i think you know that better than most folks said owen trying hard to speak quiet  as for the rest im not going to discuss it with you  when i hear from phillippas own lips that she cares for another man ill believe itand not before  youll never hear it from her lips said i  isabella gave me a venomous look  youll not see phillippa until she is a better mans wife she said stubbornly and i order you to leave my house owen blair  no  it was mark foster who spoke  he hadnt said a word but he came forward now and stood before owen  such a difference as there was between them  but he looked owen right in the face quietlike and owen glared back in fury  will it satisfy you owen if phillippa comes down here and chooses between us  yes it will said owen  mark foster turned to me  go and bring her down said he  isabella judging phillippa by herself gave a little moan of despair and owen blinded by love and hope thought his cause was won  but i knew my dearie too well to be glad and mark foster did too and i hated him for it  i went up to my dearies room all pale and shaking  when i went in she came to meet me like a girl going to meet death  isittime she said with her hands locked tight together  i said not a word hoping that the unlookedfor sight of owen would break down her resolution  i just held out my hand to her and led her downstairs  she clung to me and her hands were as cold as snow  when i opened the parlor door i stood back and pushed her in before me  she just cried owen and shook so that i put my arms about her to steady her  owen made a step towards her his face and eyes all aflame with his love and longing but mark barred his way  wait till she has made her choice he said and then he turned to phillippa  i couldnt see my dearies face but i could see marks and there wasnt a spark of feeling in it  behind it was isabellas all pinched and gray  phillippa said mark owen blair has come back  he says he has never forgotten you and that he wrote to you several times i have told him that you have promised me but i leave you freedom of choice  which of us will you marry phillippa  my dearie stood straight up and the trembling left her  she stepped back and i could see her face white as the dead but calm and resolved  i have promised to marry you mark and i will keep my word she said  the color came back to isabella clarks face but marks did not change  phillippa said owen and the pain in his voice made my old heart ache bitterer than ever have you ceased to love me  my dearie would have been more than human if she could have resisted the pleading in his tone  she said no word but just looked at him for a moment  we all saw the look her whole soul full of love for owen showed out in it  then she turned and stood by mark  owen never said a word  he went as white as death and started for the door  but again mark foster put himself in the way  wait he said  she has made her choice as i knew she would but i have yet to make mine  and i choose to marry no woman whose love belongs to another living man  phillippa i thought owen blair was dead and i believed that when you were my wife i could win your love  but i love you too well to make you miserable  go to the man you loveyou are free  and what is to become of me wailed isabella  oh youi had forgotten about you said mark kind of wearylike  he took a paper from his pocket and dropped it in the grate  there is the mortgage  that is all you care about i think  goodmorning  he went out  he was only a common fellow but somehow just then he looked every inch the gentleman  i would have gone after him and said something butthe look on his faceno it was no time for my foolish old words  phillippa was crying with her head on owens shoulder  isabella clark waited to see the mortgage burned up and then she came to me in the hall all smooth and smiling again  really its all very romantic isnt it  i suppose its better as it is all things considered  mark behaved splendidly didnt he  not many men would have done as he did  for once in my life i agreed with isabella  but i felt like having a good cry over it alland i had it  i was glad for my dearies sake and owens but mark foster had paid the price of their joy and i knew it had beggared him of happiness for life    xv tannis of the flats  few people in avonlea could understand why elinor blair had never married  she had been one of the most beautiful girls in our part of the island and as a woman of fifty she was still very attractive  in her youth she had had ever so many beaux as we of our generation well remembered but after her return from visiting her brother tom in the canadian northwest more than twentyfive years ago she had seemed to withdraw within herself keeping all men at a safe though friendly distance  she had been a gay laughing girl when she went west she came back quiet and serious with a shadowed look in her eyes which time could not quite succeed in blotting out  elinor had never talked much about her visit except to describe the scenery and the life which in that day was rough indeed not even to me who had grown up next door to her and who had always seemed more a sister than a friend did she speak of other than the merest commonplaces  but when tom blair made a flying trip back home some ten years later there were one or two of us to whom he related the story of jerome careya story revealing only too well the reason for elinors sad eyes and utter indifference to masculine attentions  i can recall almost his exact words and the inflections of his voice and i remember too that it seemed to me a far cry from the tranquil pleasant scene before us on that lovely summer day to the elemental life of the flats  the flats was a forlorn little trading station fifteen miles up the river from prince albert with a scanty population of halfbreeds and three white men  when jerome carey was sent to take charge of the telegraph office there he cursed his fate in the picturesque language permissible in the far northwest  not that carey was a profane man even as men go in the west  he was an english gentleman and he kept both his life and his vocabulary pretty clean  butthe flats  outside of the ragged cluster of log shacks which comprised the settlement there was always a shifting fringe of teepees where the indians who drifted down from the reservation camped with their dogs and squaws and papooses  there are standpoints from which indians are interesting but they cannot be said to offer congenial social attractions  for three weeks after carey went to the flats he was lonelier than he had ever imagined it possible to be even in the great lone land  if it had not been for teaching paul dumont the telegraphic code carey believed he would have been driven to suicide in selfdefense  the telegraphic importance of the flats consisted in the fact that it was the starting point of three telegraph lines to remote trading posts up north  not many messages came therefrom but the few that did come generally amounted to something worth while  days and even weeks would pass without a single one being clicked to the flats  carey was debarred from talking over the wires to the prince albert man for the reason that they were on officially bad terms  he blamed the latter for his transfer to the flats  carey slept in a loft over the office and got his meals as joe esquints across the street  joe esquints wife was a good cook as cooks go among the breeds and carey soon became a great pet of hers  carey had a habit of becoming a pet with women  he had the way that has to be born in a man and can never be acquired  besides he was as handsome as cleancut features deepset darkblue eyes fair curls and six feet of muscle could make him  mrs joe esquint thought that his mustache was the most wonderfully beautiful thing in its line that she had ever seen  fortunately mrs joe was so old and fat and ugly that even the malicious and inveterate gossip of skulking breeds and indians squatting over teepee fires could not hint at anything questionable in the relations between her and carey  but it was a different matter with tannis dumont  tannis came home from the academy at prince albert early in july when carey had been at the flats a month and had exhausted all the few novelties of his position  paul dumont had already become so expert at the code that his mistakes no longer afforded carey any fun and the latter was getting desperate  he had serious intentions of throwing up the business altogether and betaking himself to an alberta ranch where at least one would have the excitement of roping horses  when he saw tannis dumont he thought he would hang on awhile longer anyway  tannis was the daughter of old auguste dumont who kept the one small store at the flats lived in the one frame house that the place boasted and was reputed to be worth an amount of money which in halfbreed eyes was a colossal fortune  old auguste was black and ugly and notoriously badtempered  but tannis was a beauty  tannis greatgrandmother had been a cree squaw who married a french trapper  the son of this union became in due time the father of auguste dumont  auguste married a woman whose mother was a french halfbreed and whose father was a purebred highland scotchman  the result of this atrocious mixture was its justificationtannis of the flatswho looked as if all the blood of all the howards might be running in her veins  but after all the dominant current in those same veins was from the race of plain and prairie  the practiced eye detected it in the slender stateliness of carriage in the graceful yet voluptuous curves of the lithe body in the smallness and delicacy of hand and foot in the purple sheen on straightfalling masses of blueblack hair and more than all else in the long dark eye full and soft yet alight with a slumbering fire  france too was responsible for somewhat in tannis  it gave her a light step in place of the stealthy halfbreed shuffle it arched her red upper lip into a more tremulous bow it lent a note of laughter to her voice and a sprightlier wit to her tongue  as for her redheaded scotch grandfather he had bequeathed her a somewhat whiter skin and ruddier bloom than is usually found in the breeds  old auguste was mightily proud of tannis  he sent her to school for four years in prince albert bound that his girl should have the best  a high school course and considerable mingling in the social life of the townfor old auguste was a man to be conciliated by astute politicians since he controlled some two or three hundred halfbreed votessent tannis home to the flats with a very thin but very deceptive veneer of culture and civilization overlying the primitive passions and ideas of her nature  carey saw only the beauty and the veneer  he made the mistake of thinking that tannis was what she seemed to bea fairly welleducated uptodate young woman with whom a friendly flirtation was just what it was with white womankindthe pleasant amusement of an hour or season  it was a mistakea very big mistake  tannis understood something of piano playing something less of grammar and latin and something less still of social prevarications  but she understood absolutely nothing of flirtation  you can never get an indian to see the sense of platonics  carey found the flats quite tolerable after the homecoming of tannis  he soon fell into the habit of dropping into the dumont house to spend the evening talking with tannis in the parlorwhich apartment was amazingly well done for a place like the flatstannis had not studied prince albert parlors four years for nothingor playing violin and piano duets with her when music and conversation palled they went for long gallops over the prairies together  tannis rode to perfection and managed her badtempered brute of a pony with a skill and grace that made carey applaud her  she was glorious on horseback  sometimes he grew tired of the prairies and then he and tannis paddled themselves over the river in nitchie joes dugout and landed on the old trail that struck straight into the wooded belt of the saskatchewan valley leading north to trading posts on the frontier of civilization  there they rambled under huge pines hoary with the age of centuries and carey talked to tannis about england and quoted poetry to her  tannis liked poetry she had studied it at school and understood it fairly well  but once she told carey that she thought it a long roundabout way of saying what you could say just as well in about a dozen plain words  carey laughed  he liked to evoke those little speeches of hers  they sounded very clever dropping from such arched ripelytinted lips  if you had told carey that he was playing with fire he would have laughed at you  in the first place he was not in the slightest degree in love with tannishe merely admired and liked her  in the second place it never occurred to him that tannis might be in love with him  why he had never attempted any lovemaking with her  and above all he was obsessed with that aforesaid fatal idea that tannis was like the women he had associated with all his life in reality as well as in appearance  he did not know enough of the racial characteristics to understand  but if carey thought his relationship with tannis was that of friendship merely he was the only one at the flats who did think so  all the halfbreeds and quarterbreeds and anyfractional breeds there believed that he meant to marry tannis  there would have been nothing surprising to them in that  they did not know that careys second cousin was a baronet and they would not have understood that it need make any difference if they had  they thought that rich old augustes heiress who had been to school for four years in prince albert was a catch for anybody  old auguste himself shrugged his shoulders over it and was wellpleased enough  an englishman was a prize by way of a husband for a halfbreed girl even if he were only a telegraph operator  young paul dumont worshipped carey and the halfscotch mother who might have understood was dead  in all the flats there were but two people who disapproved of the match they thought an assured thing  one of these was the little priest father gabriel  he liked tannis and he liked carey but he shook his head dubiously when he heard the gossip of the shacks and teepees  religions might mingle but the different bloodsah it was not the right thing  tannis was a good girl and a beautiful one but she was no fit mate for the fair thoroughbred englishman  father gabriel wished fervently that jerome carey might soon be transferred elsewhere  he even went to prince albert and did a little wirepulling on his own account but nothing came of it  he was on the wrong side of politics  the other malcontent was lazarre meacuterimeacutee a lazy besotted french halfbreed who was after his fashion in love with tannis  he could never have got her and he knew itold auguste and young paul would have incontinently riddled him with bullets had he ventured near the house as a suitorbut he hated carey none the less and watched for a chance to do him an illturn  there is no worse enemy in all the world than a halfbreed  your true indian is bad enough but his diluted descendant is ten times worse  as for tannis she loved carey with all her heart and that was all there was about it  if elinor blair had never gone to prince albert there is no knowing what might have happened after all  carey so powerful in propinquity might even have ended by learning to love tannis and marrying her to his own worldly undoing  but elinor did go to prince albert and her going ended all things for tannis of the flats  carey met her one evening in september when he had ridden into town to attend a dance leaving paul dumont in charge of the telegraph office  elinor had just arrived in prince albert on a visit to tom to which she had been looking forward during the five years since he had married and moved out west from avonlea as i have already said she was very beautiful at that time and carey fell in love with her at the first moment of their meeting  during the next three weeks he went to town nine times and called at the dumonts only once  there were no more rides and walks with tannis  this was not intentional neglect on his part  he had simply forgotten all about her  the breeds surmised a lovers quarrel but tannis understood  there was another woman back there in town  it would be quite impossible to put on paper any adequate idea of her emotions at this stage  one night she followed carey when he went to prince albert riding out of earshot behind him on her plains pony but keeping him in sight  lazarre in a fit of jealousy had followed tannis spying on her until she started back to the flats  after that he watched both carey and tannis incessantly and months later had told tom all he had learned through his low sneaking  tannis trailed carey to the blair house on the bluffs above the town and saw him tie his horse at the gate and enter  she too tied her pony to a poplar lower down and then crept stealthily through the willows at the side of the house until she was close to the windows  through one of them she could see carey and elinor  the halfbreed girl crouched down in the shadow and glared at her rival  she saw the pretty fairtinted face the fluffy coronal of golden hair the blue laughing eyes of the woman whom jerome carey loved and she realized very plainly that there was nothing left to hope for  she tannis of the flats could never compete with that other  it was well to know so much at least  after a time she crept softly away loosed her pony and lashed him mercilessly with her whip through the streets of the town and out the long dusty river trail  a man turned and looked after her as she tore past a brightly lighted store on water street  that was tannis of the flats he said to a companion  she was in town last winter going to schoola beauty and a bit of the devil like all those breed girls  what in thunder is she riding like that for  one day a fortnight later carey went over the river alone for a ramble up the northern trail and an undisturbed dream of elinor when he came back tannis was standing at the canoe landing under a pine tree in a rain of finely sifted sunlight  she was waiting for him and she said with any preface  mr carey why do you never come to see me now  carey flushed like any girl  her tone and look made him feel very uncomfortable  he remembered selfreproachfully that he must have seemed very neglectful and he stammered something about having been busy  not very busy said tannis with her terrible directness  it is not that  it is because you are going to prince albert to see a white woman  even in his embarrassment carey noted that this was the first time he had ever heard tannis use the expression a white woman or any other that would indicate her sense of a difference between herself and the dominant race  he understood at the same moment that this girl was not to be trifled withthat she would have the truth out of him first or last but he felt indescribably foolish  i suppose so he answered lamely  and what about me asked tannis  when you come to think of it this was an embarrassing question especially for carey who had believed that tannis understood the game and played it for its own sake as he did  i dont understand you tannis he said hurriedly  you have made me love you said tannis  the words sound flat enough on paper  they did not sound flat to tom as repeated by lazarre and they sounded anything but flat to carey hurled at him as they were by a woman trembling with all the passions of her savage ancestry  tannis had justified her criticism of poetry  she had said her halfdozen words instinct with all the despair and pain and wild appeal that all the poetry in the world had ever expressed  they made carey feel like a scoundrel  all at once he realized how impossible it would be to explain matters to tannis and that he would make a still bigger fool of himself if he tried  i am very sorry he stammered like a whipped schoolboy  it is no matter interrupted tannis violently  what difference does it make about mea halfbreed girl  we breed girls are only born to amuse the white men  that is sois it not  then when they are tired of us they push us aside and go back to their own kind  oh it is very well  but i will not forgetmy father and brother will not forget  they will make you sorry to some purpose  she turned and stalked away to her canoe  he waited under the pines until she crossed the river then he too went miserably home  what a mess he had contrived to make of things  poor tannis  how handsome she had looked in her furyand how much like a squaw  the racial marks always come out plainly under the stress of emotion as tom noted later  her threat did not disturb him  if young paul and old auguste made things unpleasant for him he thought himself more than a match for them  it was the thought of the suffering he had brought upon tannis that worried him  he had not to be sure been a villain but he had been a fool and that is almost as bad under some circumstances  the dumonts however did not trouble him  after all tannis four years in prince albert had not been altogether wasted  she knew that white girls did not mix their male relatives up in a vendetta when a man ceased calling on themand she had nothing else to complain of that could be put in words  after some reflection she concluded to hold her tongue  she even laughed when old auguste asked her what was up between her and her fellow and said she had grown tired of him  old auguste shrugged his shoulders resignedly  it was just as well maybe those english sonsinlaw sometimes gave themselves too many airs  so carey rode often to town and tannis bided her time and plotted futile schemes of revenge and lazarre merimee scowled and got drunkand life went on at the flats as usual until the last week in october when a big wind and rainstorm swept over the northland  it was a bad night  the wires were down between the flats and prince albert and all communication with the outside world was cut off  over at joe esquints the breeds were having a carouse in honor of joes birthday  paul dumont had gone over and carey was alone in the office smoking lazily and dreaming of elinor  suddenly above the plash of rain and whistle of wind he heard outcries in the street  running to the door he was met by mrs joe esquint who grasped him breathlessly  meestair careycome quick  lazarre he kill paulthey fight  carey with a smothered oath rushed across the street  he had been afraid of something of the sort and had advised paul not to go for those halfbreed carouses almost always ended in a free fight  he burst into the kitchen at joe esquints to find a circle of mute spectators ranged around the room and paul and lazarre in a clinch in the center  carey was relieved to find it was only an affair of fists  he promptly hurled himself at the combatants and dragged paul away while mrs joe esquintjoe himself being deaddrunk in a cornerflung her fat arms about lazarre and held him back  stop this said carey sternly  let me get at him foamed paul  he insulted my sister  he said that youlet me get at him  he could not writhe free from careys iron grip  lazarre with a snarl like a wolf sent mrs joe spinning and rushed at paul carey struck out as best he could and lazarre went reeling back against the table  it went over with a crash and the light went out  mrs joes shrieks might have brought the roof down  in the confusion that ensued two pistol shots rang out sharply  there was a cry a groan a fallthen a rush for the door  when mrs joe esquints sisterinlaw marie dashed in with another lamp mrs joe was still shrieking paul dumont was leaning sickly against the wall with a dangling arm and carey lay face downward on the floor with blood trickling from under him  marie esquint was a woman of nerve  she told mrs joe to shut up and she turned carey over  he was conscious but seemed dazed and could not help himself  marie put a coat under his head told paul to lie down on the bench ordered mrs joe to get a bed ready and went for the doctor  it happened that there was a doctor at the flats that nighta prince albert man who had been up at the reservation fixing up some sick indians and had been stormstaid at old augustes on his way back  marie soon returned with the doctor old auguste and tannis carey was carried in and laid on mrs esquints bed  the doctor made a brief examination while mrs joe sat on the floor and howled at the top of her lungs  then he shook his head  shot in the back he said briefly  how long asked carey understanding  perhaps till morning answered the doctor  mrs joe gave a louder howl than ever at this and tannis came and stood by the bed  the doctor knowing that he could do nothing for carey hurried into the kitchen to attend to paul who had a badly shattered arm and marie went with him  carey looked stupidly at tannis  send for her he said  tannis smiled cruelly  there is no way the wires are down and there is no man at the flats who will go to town tonight she answered  my god i must see her before i die burst out carey pleadingly  where is father gabriel  he will go  the priest went to town last night and has not come back said tannis  carey groaned and shut his eyes  if father gabriel was away there was indeed no one to go  old auguste and the doctor could not leave paul and he knew well that no breed of them all at the flats would turn out on such a night even if they were not one and all mortally scared of being mixed up in the law and justice that would be sure to follow the affair  he must die without seeing elinor  tannis looked inscrutably down on the pale face on mrs joe esquints dirty pillows  her immobile features gave no sign of the conflict raging within her  after a short space she turned and went out shutting the door softly on the wounded man and mrs joe whose howls had now simmered down to whines  in the next room paul was crying out with pain as the doctor worked on his arm but tannis did not go to him  instead she slipped out and hurried down the stormy street to old augustes stable  five minutes later she was galloping down the black windlashed river trail on her way to town to bring elinor blair to her lovers deathbed  i hold that no woman ever did anything more unselfish than this deed of tannis  for the sake of love she put under her feet the jealousy and hatred that had clamored at her heart  she held not only revenge but the dearer joy of watching by carey to the last in the hollow of her hand and she cast both away that the man she loved might draw his dying breath somewhat easier  in a white woman the deed would have been merely commendable  in tannis of the flats with her ancestry and tradition it was lofty selfsacrifice  it was eight oclock when tannis left the flats it was ten when she drew bridle before the house on the bluff  elinor was regaling tom and his wife with avonlea gossip when the maid came to the door  pleasm theres a breed girl out on the verandah and shes asking for miss blair  elinor went out wonderingly followed by tom  tannis whip in hand stood by the open door with the stormy night behind her and the warm ruby light of the hall lamp showering over her white face and the long rope of drenched hair that fell from her bare head  she looked wild enough  jerome carey was shot in a quarrel at joe esquints tonight she said  he is dyinghe wants youi have come for you  elinor gave a little cry and steadied herself on toms shoulder tom said he knew he made some exclamation of horror  he had never approved of careys attentions to elinor but such news was enough to shock anybody  he was determined however that elinor should not go out in such a night and to such a scene and told tannis so in no uncertain terms  i came through the storm said tannis contemptuously  cannot she do as much for him as i can  the good old island blood in elinors veins showed to some purpose  yes she answered firmly  no tom dont objecti must go  get my horseand your own  ten minutes later three riders galloped down the bluff road and took the river trail  fortunately the wind was at their backs and the worst of the storm was over  still it was a wild black ride enough  tom rode cursing softly under his breath  he did not like the whole thingcarey done to death in some low halfbreed shack this handsome sullen girl coming as his messenger this nightmare ride through wind and rain  it all savored too much of melodrama even for the northland where people still did things in a primitive way  he heartily wished elinor had never left avonlea  it was past twelve when they reached the flats  tannis was the only one who seemed to be able to think coherently  it was she who told tom where to take the horses and then led elinor to the room where carey was dying  the doctor was sitting by the bedside and mrs joe was curled up in a corner sniffling to herself  tannis took her by the shoulder and turned her none too gently out of the room  the doctor understanding left at once  as tannis shut the door she saw elinor sink on her knees by the bed and careys trembling hand go out to her head  tannis sat down on the floor outside of the door and wrapped herself up in a shawl marie esquint had dropped  in that attitude she looked exactly like a squaw and all comers and goers even old auguste who was hunting for her thought she was one and left her undisturbed  she watched there until dawn came whitely up over the prairies and jerome carey died  she knew when it happened by elinors cry  tannis sprang up and rushed in  she was too late for even a parting look  the girl took careys hand in hers and turned to the weeping elinor with a cold dignity  now go she said  you had him in life to the very last  he is mine now  there must be some arrangements made faltered elinor  my father and brother will make all arrangements as you call them said tannis steadily  he had no near relatives in the worldnone at all in canadahe told me so  you may send out a protestant minister from town if you like but he will be buried here at the flats and his grave with be mineall mine  go  and elinor reluctant sorrowful yet swayed by a will and an emotion stronger than her own went slowly out leaving tannis of the flats alone with her dead
