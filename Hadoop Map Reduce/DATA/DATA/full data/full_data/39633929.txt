39633929	overruled  bernard shaw  1912    preface to overruled  the alleviations of monogamy  this piece is not an argument for or against polygamy it is a clinical study of how the thing actually occurs among quite ordinary people innocent of all unconventional views concerning it the enormous majority of cases in real life are those of people in that position those who deliberately and conscientiously profess what are oddly called advanced views by those others who believe them to be retrograde are often and indeed mostly the last people in the world to engage in unconventional adventures of any kind not only because they have neither time nor disposition for them but because the friction set up between the individual and the community by the expression of unusual views of any sort is quite enough hindrance to the heretic without being complicated by personal scandals thus the theoretic libertine is usually a person of blameless family life whilst the practical libertine is mercilessly severe on all other libertines and excessively conventional in professions of social principle  what is more these professions are not hypocritical they are for the most part quite sincere the common libertine like the drunkard succumbs to a temptation which he does not defend and against which he warns others with an earnestness proportionate to the intensity of his own remorse he or she may be a liar and a humbug pretending to be better than the detected libertines and clamoring for their condign punishment but this is mere selfdefence no reasonable person expects the burglar to confess his pursuits or to refrain from joining in the cry of stop thief when the police get on the track of another burglar if society chooses to penalize candor it has itself to thank if its attack is countered by falsehood the clamorous virtue of the libertine is therefore no more hypocritical than the plea of not guilty which is allowed to every criminal but one result is that the theorists who write most sincerely and favorably about polygamy know least about it and the practitioners who know most about it keep their knowledge very jealously to themselves which is hardly fair to the practice   inaccessibility of the facts  also it is impossible to estimate its prevalence a practice to which nobody confesses may be both universal and unsuspected just as a virtue which everybody is expected under heavy penalties to claim may have no existence it is often assumedindeed it is the official assumption of the churches and the divorce courts that a gentleman and a lady cannot be alone together innocently and that is manifest blazing nonsense though many women have been stoned to death in the east and divorced in the west on the strength of it on the other hand the innocent and conventional people who regard the gallant adventures as crimes of so horrible a nature that only the most depraved and desperate characters engage in them or would listen to advances in that direction without raising an alarm with the noisiest indignation are clearly examples of the fact that most sections of society do not know how the other sections live industry is the most effective check on gallantry women may as napoleon said be the occupation of the idle man just as men are the preoccupation of the idle woman but the mass of mankind is too busy and too poor for the long and expensive sieges which the professed libertine lays to virtue still wherever there is idleness or even a reasonable supply of elegant leisure there is a good deal of coquetry and philandering it is so much pleasanter to dance on the edge of a precipice than to go over it that leisured society is full of people who spend a great part of their lives in flirtation and conceal nothing but the humiliating secret that they have never gone any further for there is no pleasing people in the matter of reputation in this department every insult is a flattery every testimonial is a disparagement joseph is despised and promoted potiphars wife admired and condemned in short you are never on solid ground until you get away from the subject altogether there is a continual and irreconcilable conflict between the natural and conventional sides of the case between spontaneous human relations between independent men and women on the one hand and the property relation between husband and wife on the other not to mention the confusion under the common name of love of a generous natural attraction and interest with the murderous jealousy that fastens on and clings to its mate especially a hated mate as a tiger fastens on a carcase and the confusion is natural for these extremes are extremes of the same passion and most cases lie somewhere on the scale between them and are so complicated by ordinary likes and dislikes by incidental wounds to vanity or gratifications of it and by class feeling that a will be jealous of b and not of c and will tolerate infidelities on the part of d whilst being furiously angry when they are committed by e   the convention of jealousy  that jealousy is independent of sex is shown by its intensity in children and by the fact that very jealous people are jealous of everybody without regard to relationship or sex and cannot bear to hear the person they love speak favorably of anyone under any circumstances many women for instance are much more jealous of their husbands mothers and sisters than of unrelated women whom they suspect him of fancying but it is seldom possible to disentangle the two passions in practice besides jealousy is an inculcated passion forced by society on people in whom it would not occur spontaneously in brieuxs bourgeois aux champs the benevolent hero finds himself detested by the neighboring peasants and farmers not because he preserves game and sets mantraps for poachers and defends his legal rights over his land to the extremest point of unsocial savagery but because being an amiable and publicspirited person he refuses to do all this and thereby offends and disparages the sense of property in his neighbors the same thing is true of matrimonial jealousy the man who does not at least pretend to feel it and behave as badly as if he really felt it is despised and insulted and many a man has shot or stabbed a friend or been shot or stabbed by him in a duel or disgraced himself and ruined his own wife in a divorce scandal against his conscience against his instinct and to the destruction of his home solely because society conspired to drive him to keep its own lower morality in countenance in this miserable and undignified manner  morality is confused in such matters in an elegant plutocracy a jealous husband is regarded as a boor among the tradesmen who supply that plutocracy with its meals a husband who is not jealous and refrains from assailing his rival with his fists is regarded as a ridiculous contemptible and cowardly cuckold and the laboring class is divided into the respectable section which takes the tradesmans view and the disreputable section which enjoys the license of the plutocracy without its money creeping below the law as its exemplars prance above it cutting down all expenses of respectability and even decency and frankly accepting squalor and disrepute as the price of anarchic selfindulgence the conflict between malvolio and sir toby between the marquis and the bourgeois the cavalier and the puritan the ascetic and the voluptuary goes on continually and goes on not only between class and class and individual and individual but in the selfsame breast in a series of reactions and revulsions in which the irresistible becomes the unbearable and the unbearable the irresistible until none of us can say what our characters really are in this respect   the missing data of a scientific natural history of marriage  of one thing i am persuaded we shall never attain to a reasonable healthy public opinion on sex questions until we offer as the data for that opinion our actual conduct and our real thoughts instead of a moral fiction which we agree to call virtuous conduct and which we thenand here comes in the mischiefpretend is our conduct and our thoughts if the result were that we all believed one another to be better than we really are there would be something to be said for it but the actual result appears to be a monstrous exaggeration of the power and continuity of sexual passion the whole world shares the fate of lucrezia borgia who though she seems on investigation to have been quite a suitable wife for a modern british bishop has been invested by the popular historical imagination with all the extravagances of a messalina or a cenci writers of belles lettres who are rash enough to admit that their whole life is not one constant preoccupation with adored members of the opposite sex and who even countenance la rochefoucaulds remark that very few people would ever imagine themselves in love if they had never read anything about it are gravely declared to be abnormal or physically defective by critics of crushing unadventurousness and domestication french authors of saintly temperament are forced to include in their retinue countesses of ardent complexion with whom they are supposed to live in sin sentimental controversies on the subject are endless but they are useless because nobody tells the truth rousseau did it by an extraordinary effort aided by a superhuman faculty for human natural history but the result was curiously disconcerting because though the facts were so conventionally shocking that people felt that they ought to matter a great deal they actually mattered very little and even at that everybody pretends not to believe him   artificial retribution  the worst of that is that busybodies with perhaps rather more than a normal taste for mischief are continually trying to make negligible things matter as much in fact as they do in convention by deliberately inflicting injuriessometimes atrocious injurieson the parties concerned few people have any knowledge of the savage punishments that are legally inflicted for aberrations and absurdities to which no sanely instructed community would call any attention we create an artificial morality and consequently an artificial conscience by manufacturing disastrous consequences for events which left to themselves would do very little harm sometimes not any and be forgotten in a few days  but the artificial morality is not therefore to be condemned offhand in many cases it may save mischief instead of making it for example though the hanging of a murderer is the duplication of a murder yet it may be less murderous than leaving the matter to be settled by blood feud or vendetta as long as human nature insists on revenge the official organization and satisfaction of revenge by the state may be also its minimization the mischief begins when the official revenge persists after the passion it satisfies has died out of the race stoning a woman to death in the east because she has ventured to marry again after being deserted by her husband may be more merciful than allowing her to be mobbed to death but the official stoning or burning of an adulteress in the west would be an atrocity because few of us hate an adulteress to the extent of desiring such a penalty or of being prepared to take the law into our own hands if it were withheld now what applies to this extreme case applies also in due degree to the other cases offences in which sex is concerned are often needlessly magnified by penalties ranging from various forms of social ostracism to long sentences of penal servitude which would be seen to be monstrously disproportionate to the real feeling against them if the removal of both the penalties and the taboo on their discussion made it possible for us to ascertain their real prevalence and estimation fortunately there is one outlet for the truth we are permitted to discuss in jest what we may not discuss in earnest a serious comedy about sex is taboo a farcical comedy is privileged   the favorite subject of farcical comedy  the little piece which follows this preface accordingly takes the form of a farcical comedy because it is a contribution to the very extensive dramatic literature which takes as its special department the gallantries of married people the stage has been preoccupied by such affairs for centuries not only in the jesting vein of restoration comedy and palais royal farce but in the more tragically turned adulteries of the parisian school which dominated the stage until ibsen put them out of countenance and relegated them to their proper place as articles of commerce their continued vogue in that department maintains the tradition that adultery is the dramatic subject par excellence and indeed that a play that is not about adultery is not a play at all i was considered a heresiarch of the most extravagant kind when i expressed my opinion at the outset of my career as a playwright that adultery is the dullest of themes on the stage and that from francesca and paolo down to the latest guilty couple of the school of dumas fils the romantic adulterers have all been intolerable bores   the pseudo sex play  later on i had occasion to point out to the defenders of sex as the proper theme of drama that though they were right in ranking sex as an intensely interesting subject they were wrong in assuming that sex is an indispensable motive in popular plays the plays of moliere are like the novels of the victorian epoch or don quixote as nearly sexless as anything not absolutely inhuman can be and some of shakespears plays are sexually on a par with the census they contain women as well as men and that is all this had to be admitted but it was still assumed that the plays of the xix century parisian school are in contrast with the sexless masterpieces saturated with sex and this i strenuously denied a play about the convention that a man should fight a duel or come to fisticuffs with his wifes lover if she has one or the convention that he should strangle her like othello or turn her out of the house and never see her or allow her to see her children again or the convention that she should never be spoken to again by any decent person and should finally drown herself or the convention that persons involved in scenes of recrimination or confession by these conventions should call each other certain abusive names and describe their conduct as guilty and frail and so on all these may provide material for very effective plays but such plays are not dramatic studies of sex one might as well say that romeo and juliet is a dramatic study of pharmacy because the catastrophe is brought about through an apothecary duels are not sex divorce cases are not sex the trade unionism of married women is not sex only the most insignificant fraction of the gallantries of married people produce any of the conventional results and plays occupied wholly with the conventional results are therefore utterly unsatisfying as sex plays however interesting they may be as plays of intrigue and plot puzzles  the world is finding this out rapidly the sunday papers which in the days when they appealed almost exclusively to the lower middle class were crammed with police intelligence and more especially with divorce and murder cases now lay no stress on them and police papers which confined themselves entirely to such matters and were once eagerly read have perished through the essential dulness of their topics and yet the interest in sex is stronger than ever in fact the literature that has driven out the journalism of the divorce courts is a literature occupied with sex to an extent and with an intimacy and frankness that would have seemed utterly impossible to thackeray or dickens if they had been told that the change would complete itself within fifty years of their own time   art and morality  it is ridiculous to say as inconsiderate amateurs of the arts do that art has nothing to do with morality what is true is that the artists business is not that of the policeman and that such factitious consequences and putup jobs as divorces and executions and the detective operations that lead up to them are no essential part of life though like poisons and buttered slides and redhot pokers they provide material for plenty of thrilling or amusing stories suited to people who are incapable of any interest in psychology but the fine artists must keep the policeman out of his studies of sex and studies of crime it is by clinging nervously to the policeman that most of the pseudo sex plays convince me that the writers have either never had any serious personal experience of their ostensible subject or else have never conceived it possible that the stage door present the phenomena of sex as they appear in nature   the limits of stage presentation  but the stage presents much more shocking phenomena than those of sex there is of course a sense in which you cannot present sex on the stage just as you cannot present murder macbeth must no more really kill duncan than he must himself be really slain by macduff but the feelings of a murderer can be expressed in a certain artistic convention and a carefully prearranged sword exercise can be gone through with sufficient pretence of earnestness to be accepted by the willing imaginations of the younger spectators as a desperate combat  the tragedy of love has been presented on the stage in the same way in tristan and isolde the curtain does not as in romeo and juliet rise with the lark the whole night of love is played before the spectators the lovers do not discuss marriage in an elegantly sentimental way they utter the visions and feelings that come to lovers at the supreme moments of their love totally forgetting that there are such things in the world as husbands and lawyers and duelling codes and theories of sin and notions of propriety and all the other irrelevancies which provide hackneyed and bloodless material for our socalled plays of passion   pruderies of the french stage  to all stage presentations there are limits if macduff were to stab macbeth the spectacle would be intolerable and even the pretence which we allow on our stage is ridiculously destructive to the illusion of the scene yet pugilists and gladiators will actually fight and kill in public without sham even as a spectacle for money but no sober couple of lovers of any delicacy could endure to be watched we in england accustomed to consider the french stage much more licentious than the british are always surprised and puzzled when we learn as we may do any day if we come within reach of such information that french actors are often scandalized by what they consider the indecency of the english stage and that french actresses who desire a greater license in appealing to the sexual instincts than the french stage allows them learn and establish themselves on the english stage the german and russian stages are in the same relation to the french and perhaps more or less all the latin stages the reason is that partly from a want of respect for the theatre partly from a sort of respect for art in general which moves them to accord moral privileges to artists partly from the very objectionable tradition that the realm of art is alsatia and the contemplation of works of art a holiday from the burden of virtue partly because french prudery does not attach itself to the same points of behavior as british prudery and has a different code of the mentionable and the unmentionable and for many other reasons the french tolerate plays which are never performed in england until they have been spoiled by a process of bowdlerization yet french taste is more fastidious than ours as to the exhibition and treatment on the stage of the physical incidents of sex on the french stage a kiss is as obvious a convention as the thrust under the arm by which macduff runs macbeth through it is even a purposely unconvincing convention the actors rather insisting that it shall be impossible for any spectator to mistake a stage kiss for a real one in england on the contrary realism is carried to the point at which nobody except the two performers can perceive that the caress is not genuine and here the english stage is certainly in the right for whatever question there arises as to what incidents are proper for representation on the stage or not my experience as a playgoer leaves me in no doubt that once it is decided to represent an incident it will be offensive no matter whether it be a prayer or a kiss unless it is presented with a convincing appearance of sincerity   our disillusive scenery  for example the main objection to the use of illusive scenery in most modern plays scenery is not illusive everything visible is as real as in your drawing room at home is that it is unconvincing whilst the imaginary scenery with which the audience provides a platform or tribune like the elizabethan stage or the greek stage used by sophocles is quite convincing in fact the more scenery you have the less illusion you produce the wise playwright when he cannot get absolute reality of presentation goes to the other extreme and aims at atmosphere and suggestion of mood rather than at direct simulative illusion the theatre as i first knew it was a place of wings and flats which destroyed both atmosphere and illusion this was tolerated and even intensely enjoyed but not in the least because nothing better was possible for all the devices employed in the productions of mr granville barker or max reinhardt or the moscow art theatre were equally available for colley cibber and garrick except the intensity of our artificial light when garrick played richard ii in slashed trunk hose and plumes it was not because he believed that the plantagenets dressed like that or because the costumes could not have made him a xv century dress as easily as a nondescript combination of the state robes of george iii with such scraps of older fashions as seemed to playgoers for some reason to be romantic the charm of the theatre in those days was its makebelieve it has that charm still not only for the amateurs who are happiest when they are most unnatural and impossible and absurd but for audiences as well i have seen performances of my own plays which were to me far wilder burlesques than sheridans critic or buckinghams rehearsal yet they have produced sincere laughter and tears such as the most finished metropolitan productions have failed to elicit fielding was entirely right when he represented partridge as enjoying intensely the performance of the king in hamlet because anybody could see that the king was an actor and resenting garricks hamlet because it might have been a real man yet we have only to look at the portraits of garrick to see that his performances would nowadays seem almost as extravagantly stagey as his costumes in our day calves intensely real carmen never pleased the mob as much as the obvious fancy ball masquerading of suburban young ladies in the same character   holding the mirror up to nature  theatrical art begins as the holding up to nature of a distorting mirror in this phase it pleases people who are childish enough to believe that they can see what they look like and what they are when they look at a true mirror naturally they think that a true mirror can teach them nothing only by giving them back some monstrous image can the mirror amuse them or terrify them it is not until they grow up to the point at which they learn that they know very little about themselves and that they do not see themselves in a true mirror as other people see them that they become consumed with curiosity as to what they really are like and begin to demand that the stage shall be a mirror of such accuracy and intensity of illumination that they shall be able to get glimpses of their real selves in it and also learn a little how they appear to other people  for audiences of this highly developed class sex can no longer be ignored or conventionalized or distorted by the playwright who makes the mirror the old sentimental extravagances and the old grossnesses are of no further use to him don giovanni and zerlina are not gross tristan and isolde are not extravagant or sentimental they say and do nothing that you cannot bear to hear and see and yet they give you the one pair briefly and slightly and the other fully and deeply what passes in the minds of lovers the love depicted may be that of a philosophic adventurer tempting an ignorant country girl or of a tragically serious poet entangled with a woman of noble capacity in a passion which has become for them the reality of the whole universe no matter the thing is dramatized and dramatized directly not talked about as something that happened before the curtain rose or that will happen after it falls   farcical comedy shirking its subject  now if all this can be done in the key of tragedy and philosophic comedy it can i have always contended be done in the key of farcical comedy and overruled is a trifling experiment in that manner conventional farcical comedies are always finally tedious because the heart of them the inevitable conjugal infidelity is always evaded even its consequences are evaded mr granville barker has pointed out rightly that if the third acts of our farcical comedies dared to describe the consequences that would follow from the first and second in real life they would end as squalid tragedies and in my opinion they would be greatly improved thereby even as entertainments for i have never seen a threeact farcical comedy without being bored and tired by the third act and observing that the rest of the audience were in the same condition though they were not vigilantly introspective enough to find that out and were apt to blame one another especially the husbands and wives for their crossness but it is happily by no means true that conjugal infidelities always produce tragic consequences or that they need produce even the unhappiness which they often do produce besides the more momentous the consequences the more interesting become the impulses and imaginations and reasonings if any of the people who disregard them if i had an opportunity of conversing with the ghost of an executed murderer i have no doubt he would begin to tell me eagerly about his trial with the names of the distinguished ladies and gentlemen who honored him with their presence on that occasion and then about his execution all of which would bore me exceedingly i should say my dear sir such manufactured ceremonies do not interest me in the least i know how a man is tried and how he is hanged i should have had you killed in a much less disgusting hypocritical and unfriendly manner if the matter had been in my hands what i want to know about is the murder how did you feel when you committed it why did you do it what did you say to yourself about it if like most murderers you had not been hanged would you have committed other murders did you really dislike the victim or did you want his money or did you murder a person whom you did not dislike and from whose death you had nothing to gain merely for the sake of murdering if so can you describe the charm to me does it come upon you periodically or is it chronic has curiosity anything to do with it i would ply him with all manner of questions to find out what murder is really like and i should not be satisfied until i had realized that i too might commit a murder or else that there is some specific quality present in a murderer and lacking in me and if so what that quality is  in just the same way i want the unfaithful husband or the unfaithful wife in a farcical comedy not to bother me with their divorce cases or the stratagems they employ to avoid a divorce case but to tell me how and why married couples are unfaithful i dont want to hear the lies they tell one another to conceal what they have done but the truths they tell one another when they have to face what they have done without concealment or excuse no doubt prudent and considerate people conceal such adventures when they can from those who are most likely to be wounded by them but it is not to be presumed that when found out they necessarily disgrace themselves by irritating lies and transparent subterfuges  my playlet which i offer as a model to all future writers of farcical comedy may now i hope be read without shock i may just add that mr sibthorpe junos view that morality demands not that we should behave morally an impossibility to our sinful nature but that we shall not attempt to defend our immoralities is a standard view in england and was advanced in all seriousness by an earnest and distinguished british moralist shortly after the first performance of overruled my objection to that aspect of the doctrine of original sin is that no necessary and inevitable operation of human nature can reasonably be regarded as sinful at all and that a morality which assumes the contrary is an absurd morality and can be kept in countenance only by hypocrisy when people were ashamed of sanitary problems and refused to face them leaving them to solve themselves clandestinely in dirt and secrecy the solution arrived at was the black death a similar policy as to sex problems has solved itself by an even worse plague than the black death and the remedy for that is not salvarsan but sound moral hygiene the first foundation of which is the discontinuance of our habit of telling not only the comparatively harmless lies that we know we ought not to tell but the ruinous lies that we foolishly think we ought to tell     overruled  a lady and gentleman are sitting together on a chesterfield in a retired corner of the lounge of a seaside hotel it is a summer night the french window behind them stands open the terrace without overlooks a moonlit harbor the lounge is dark the chesterfield upholstered in silver grey and the two figures on it in evening dress catch the light from an arc lamp somewhere but the walls covered with a dark green paper are in gloom there are two stray chairs one on each side on the gentlemans right behind him up near the window is an unused fireplace opposite it on the ladys left is a door the gentleman is on the ladys right  the lady is very attractive with a musical voice and soft appealing manners she is young that is one feels sure that she is under thirtyfive and over twentyfour the gentleman does not look much older he is rather handsome and has ventured as far in the direction of poetic dandyism in the arrangement of his hair as any man who is not a professional artist can afford to in england he is obviously very much in love with the lady and is in fact yielding to an irresistible impulse to throw his arms around her   the lady dontoh dont be horrid please mr lunn she rises from the lounge and retreats behind it promise me you wont be horrid  gregory lunn im not being horrid mrs juno im not going to be horrid i love you thats all im extraordinarily happy  mrs juno you will really be good  gregory ill be whatever you wish me to be i tell you i love you i love loving you i dont want to be tired and sorry as i should be if i were to be horrid i dont want you to be tired and sorry do come and sit down again  mrs juno coming back to her seat youre sure you dont want anything you oughtnt to  gregory quite sure i only want you she recoils dont be alarmed i like wanting you as long as i have a want i have a reason for living satisfaction is death  mrs juno yes but the impulse to commit suicide is sometimes irresistible  gregory not with you  mrs juno what  gregory oh it sounds uncomplimentary but it isnt really do you know why half the couples who find themselves situated as we are now behave horridly  mrs juno because they cant help it if they let things go too far  gregory not a bit of it its because they have nothing else to do and no other way of entertaining each other you dont know what it is to be alone with a woman who has little beauty and less conversation what is a man to do she cant talk interestingly and if he talks that way himself she doesnt understand him he cant look at her if he does he only finds out that she isnt beautiful before the end of five minutes they are both hideously bored theres only one thing that can save the situation and thats what you call being horrid with a beautiful witty kind woman theres no time for such follies its so delightful to look at her to listen to her voice to hear all she has to say that nothing else happens that is why the woman who is supposed to have a thousand lovers seldom has one whilst the stupid graceless animals of women have dozens  mrs juno i wonder its quite true that when one feels in danger one talks like mad to stave it off even when one doesnt quite want to stave it off  gregory one never does quite want to stave it off danger is delicious but death isnt we court the danger but the real delight is in escaping after all  mrs juno i dont think well talk about it any more danger is all very well when you do escape but sometimes one doesnt i tell you frankly i dont feel as safe as you doif you really do  gregory but surely you can do as you please without injuring anyone mrs juno that is the whole secret of your extraordinary charm for me  mrs juno i dont understand  gregory well i hardly know how to begin to explain but the root of the matter is that i am what people call a good man  mrs juno i thought so until you began making love to me  gregory but you knew i loved you all along  mrs juno yes of course but i depended on you not to tell me so because i thought you were good your blurting it out spoilt it and it was wicked besides  gregory not at all you see its a great many years since ive been able to allow myself to fall in love i know lots of charming women but the worst of it is theyre all married women dont become charming to my taste until theyre fully developed and by that time if theyre really nice theyre snapped up and married and then because i am a good man i have to place a limit to my regard for them i may be fortunate enough to gain friendship and even very warm affection from them but my loyalty to their husbands and their hearths and their happiness obliges me to draw a line and not overstep it of course i value such affectionate regard very highly indeed i am surrounded with women who are most dear to me but every one of them has a post sticking up if i may put it that way with the inscription trespassers will be prosecuted how we all loathe that notice in every lovely garden in every dell full of primroses on every fair hillside we meet that confounded board and there is always a gamekeeper round the corner but what is that to the horror of meeting it on every beautiful woman and knowing that there is a husband round the corner i have had this accursed board standing between me and every dear and desirable woman until i thought i had lost the power of letting myself fall really and wholeheartedly in love  mrs juno wasnt there a widow  gregory no widows are extraordinarily scarce in modern society husbands live longer than they used to and even when they do die their widows have a string of names down for their next  mrs juno well what about the young girls  gregory oh who cares for young girls theyre sympathetic theyre beginners they dont attract me im afraid of them  mrs juno thats the correct thing to say to a woman of my age but it doesnt explain why you seem to have put your scruples in your pocket when you met me  gregory surely thats quite clear i  mrs juno no please dont explain i dont want to know i take your word for it besides it doesnt matter now our voyage is over and tomorrow i start for the north to my poor fathers place  gregory surprised your poor father i thought he was alive  mrs juno so he is what made you think he wasnt  gregory you said your poor father  mrs juno oh thats a trick of mine rather a silly trick i suppose but theres something pathetic to me about men i find myself calling them poor soandso when theres nothing whatever the matter with them  gregory who has listened in growing alarm butiis wa oh lord  mrs juno whats the matter  gregory nothing  mrs juno nothing rising anxiously nonsense youre ill  gregory no it was something about your late husband  mrs juno my late husband what do you mean clutching him horrorstricken dont tell me hes dead  gregory rising equally appalled dont tell me hes alive  mrs juno oh dont frighten me like this of course hes aliveunless youve heard anything  gregory the first day we meton the boatyou spoke to me of your poor dear husband  mrs juno releasing him quite reassured is that all  gregory well afterwards you called him poor tops always poor tops our poor dear tops what could i think  mrs juno sitting down again i wish you hadnt given me such a shock about him for i havent been treating him at all well neither have you  gregory relapsing into his seat overwhelmed and you mean to tell me youre not a widow  mrs juno gracious no im not in black  gregory then i have been behaving like a blackguard i have broken my promise to my mother i shall never have an easy conscience again  mrs juno im sorry i thought you knew  gregory you thought i was a libertine  mrs juno no of course i shouldnt have spoken to you if i had thought that i thought you liked me but that you knew and would be good  gregory stretching his hands towards her breast i thought the burden of being good had fallen from my soul at last i saw nothing there but a bosom to rest on the bosom of a lovely woman of whom i could dream without guilt what do i see now  mrs juno just what you saw before  gregory despairingly no no  mrs juno what else  gregory trespassers will be prosecuted trespassers will be prosecuted  mrs juno they wont if they hold their tongues dont be such a coward my husband wont eat you  gregory im not afraid of your husband im afraid of my conscience  mrs juno losing patience well i dont consider myself at all a badly behaved woman for nothing has passed between us that was not perfectly nice and friendly but really to hear a grownup man talking about promises to his mother  gregory interrupting her yes yes i know all about that its not romantic its not don juan its not advanced but we feel it all the same its far deeper in our blood and bones than all the romantic stuff my father got into a scandal once that was why my mother made me promise never to make love to a married woman and now ive done it i cant feel honest dont pretend to despise me or laugh at me you feel it too you said just now that your own conscience was uneasy when you thought of your husband what must it be when you think of my wife  mrs juno rising aghast your wife you dont dare sit there and tell me coolly that youre a married man  gregory i never led you to believe i was unmarried  mrs juno oh you never gave me the faintest hint that you had a wife  gregory i did indeed i discussed things with you that only married people really understand  mrs juno oh  gregory i thought it the most delicate way of letting you know  mrs juno well you are a daisy i must say i suppose thats vulgar but really really you and your goodness however now weve found one another out theres only one thing to be done will you please go  gregory rising slowly  i ought to go  mrs juno well go  gregory yes erhe tries to go ii somehow cant he sits down again helplessly my conscience is active my will is paralyzed this is really dreadful would you mind ringing the bell and asking them to throw me out you ought to you know  mrs juno what make a scandal in the face of the whole hotel certainly not dont be a fool  gregory yes but i cant go  mrs juno then i can goodbye  gregory clinging to her hand can you really  mrs juno of course ishe wavers oh dear they contemplate one another helplessly i cant she sinks on the lounge hand in hand with him  gregory for heavens sake pull yourself together its a question of selfcontrol  mrs juno dragging her hand away and retreating to the end of the chesterfield no its a question of distance selfcontrol is all very well two or three yards off or on a ship with everybody looking on dont come any nearer  gregory this is a ghastly business i want to go away and i cant  mrs juno i think you ought to go he makes an effort and she adds quickly but if you try i shall grab you round the neck and disgrace myself i implore you to sit still and be nice  gregory i implore you to run away i believe i can trust myself to let you go for your own sake but it will break my heart  mrs juno i dont want to break your heart i cant bear to think of your sitting here alone i cant bear to think of sitting alone myself somewhere else its so senselessso ridiculouswhen we might be so happy i dont want to be wicked or coarse but i like you very much and i do want to be affectionate and human  gregory i ought to draw a line  mrs juno so you shall dear tell me do you really like me i dont mean love me you might love the housemaid  gregory vehemently no  mrs juno oh yes you might and what does that matter anyhow are you really fond of me are we friendscomrades would you be sorry if i died  gregory shrinking oh dont  mrs juno or was it the usual aimless mans lark a mere shipboard flirtation  gregory oh no no nothing half so bad so vulgar so wrong i assure you i only meant to be agreeable it grew on me before i noticed it  mrs juno and you were glad to let it grow  gregory i let it grow because the board was not up  mrs juno bother the board i am just as fond of sibthorpe as  gregory sibthorpe  mrs juno sibthorpe is my husbands christian name i oughtnt to call him tops to you now  gregory chuckling it sounded like something to drink but i have no right to laugh at him my christian name is gregory which sounds like a powder  mrs juno chilled that is so like a man i offer you my hearts warmest friendliest feeling and you think of nothing but a silly joke a quip like that makes you forget me  gregory forget you oh if i only could  mrs juno if you could would you  gregory burying his shamed face in his hands no id die first oh i hate myself  mrs juno i glory in myself its so jolly to be reckless can a man be reckless i wonder  gregory straightening himself desperately no im not reckless i know what im doing my conscience is awake oh where is the intoxication of love the delirium the madness that makes a man think the world well lost for the woman he adores i dont think anything of the sort i see that its not worth it i know that its wrong i have never in my life been cooler more businesslike  mrs juno opening her arms to him but you cant resist me  gregory i must i ought throwing himself into her arms oh my darling my treasure we shall be sorry for this  mrs juno we can forgive ourselves could we forgive ourselves if we let this moment slip  gregory i protest to the last im against this i have been pushed over a precipice im innocent this wild joy this exquisite tenderness this ascent into heaven can thrill me to the uttermost fibre of my heart with a gesture of ecstasy she hides her face on his shoulder but it cant subdue my mind or corrupt my conscience which still shouts to the skies that im not a willing party to this outrageous conduct i repudiate the bliss with which you are filling me  mrs juno never mind your conscience tell me how happy you are  gregory no i recall you to your duty but oh i will give you my life with both hands if you can tell me that you feel for me one millionth part of what i feel for you now  mrs juno oh yes yes be satisfied with that ask for no more let me go  gregory i cant i have no will something stronger than either of us is in command here nothing on earth or in heaven can part us now you know that dont you  mrs juno oh dont make me say it of course i know nothingnot life nor death nor shame nor anything can part us  a matteroffact male voice in the corridor all right this must be it  the two recover with a violent start release one another and spring back to opposite sides of the lounge  gregory that did it  mrs juno in a thrilling whisper shshsh that was my husbands voice  gregory impossible its only our guilty fancy  a womans voice this is the way to the lounge i know it  gregory great heaven were both mad thats my wifes voice  mrs juno ridiculous oh were dreaming it all we the door opens and sibthorpe juno appears in the roseate glow of the corridor which happens to be papered in pink with mrs lunn like tannhauser in the hill of venus he is a fussily energetic little man who gives himself an air of gallantry by greasing the points of his moustaches and dressing very carefully she is a tall imposing handsome languid woman with flashing dark eyes and long lashes they make for the chesterfield not noticing the two palpitating figures blotted against the walls in the gloom on either side the figures flit away noiselessly through the window and disappear  juno officiously ah here we are he leads the way to the sofa sit down im sure youre tired she sits thats right he sits beside her on her left hullo he rises this sofas quite warm  mrs lunn bored is it i dont notice it i expect the suns been on it  juno i felt it quite distinctly im more thinly clad than you he sits down again and proceeds with a sigh of satisfaction what a relief to get off the ship and have a private room thats the worst of a ship youre under observation all the time  mrs lunn but why not  juno well of course theres no reason at least i suppose not but you know part of the romance of a journey is that a man keeps imagining that something might happen and he cant do that if there are a lot of people about and it simply cant happen  mrs lunn mr juno romance is all very well on board ship but when your foot touches the soil of england theres an end of it  juno no believe me thats a foreigners mistake we are the most romantic people in the world we english why my very presence here is a romance  mrs lunn faintly ironical indeed  juno yes youve guessed of course that im a married man  mrs lunn oh thats all right im a married woman  juno thank heaven for that to my english mind passion is not real passion without guilt i am a redblooded man mrs lunn i cant help it the tragedy of my life is that i married when quite young a woman whom i couldnt help being very fond of i longed for a guilty passionfor the real thingthe wicked thing and yet i couldnt care twopence for any other woman when my wife was about year after year went by i felt my youth slipping away without ever having had a romance in my life for marriage is all very well but it isnt romance theres nothing wrong in it you see  mrs lunn poor man how you must have suffered  juno no that was what was so tame about it i wanted to suffer you get so sick of being happily married its always the happy marriages that break up at last my wife and i agreed that we ought to take a holiday  mrs lunn hadnt you holidays every year  juno oh the seaside and so on thats not what we meant we meant a holiday from one another  mrs lunn how very odd  juno she said it was an excellent idea that domestic felicity was making us perfectly idiotic that she wanted a holiday too so we agreed to go round the world in opposite directions i started for suez on the day she sailed for new york  mrs lunn suddenly becoming attentive thats precisely what gregory and i did now i wonder did he want a holiday from me what he said was that he wanted the delight of meeting me after a long absence  juno could anything be more romantic than that would anyone else than an englishman have thought of it i daresay my temperament seems tame to your boiling southern blood  mrs lunn my what  juno your southern blood dont you remember how you told me that night in the saloon when i sang farewell and adieu to you dear spanish ladies that you were by birth a lady of spain your splendid andalusian beauty speaks for itself  mrs lunn stuff i was born in gibraltar my father was captain jenkins in the artillery  juno ardently it is climate and not race that determines the temperament the fiery sun of spain blazed on your cradle and it rocked to the roar of british cannon  mrs lunn what eloquence it reminds me of my husband when he was in love before we were married are you in love  juno yes and with the same woman  mrs lunn well of course i didnt suppose you were in love with two women  juno i dont think you quite understand i meant that i am in love with you  mrs lunn relapsing into deepest boredom oh that men do fall in love with me they all seem to think me a creature with volcanic passions im sure i dont know why for all the volcanic women i know are plain little creatures with sandy hair i dont consider human volcanoes respectable and im so tired of the subject our house is always full of women who are in love with my husband and men who are in love with me we encourage it because its pleasant to have company  juno and is your husband as insensible as yourself  mrs lunn oh gregorys not insensible very far from it but i am the only woman in the world for him  juno but you are you really as insensible as you say you are  mrs lunn i never said anything of the kind im not at all insensible by nature but i dont know whether youve noticed it i am what people call rather a fine figure of a woman  juno passionately noticed it oh mrs lunn have i been able to notice anything else since we met  mrs lunn there you go like all the rest of them i ask you how do you expect a woman to keep up what you call her sensibility when this sort of thing has happened to her about three times a week ever since she was seventeen it used to upset me and terrify me at first then i got rather a taste for it it came to a climax with gregory that was why i married him then it became a mild lark hardly worth the trouble after that i found it valuable once or twice as a spinal tonic when i was run down but now its an unmitigated bore i dont mind your declaration i daresay it gives you a certain pleasure to make it i quite understand that you adore me but if you dont mind id rather you didnt keep on saying so  juno is there then no hope for me  mrs lunn oh yes gregory has an idea that married women keep lists of the men theyll marry if they become widows ill put your name down if that will satisfy you  juno is the list a long one  mrs lunn do you mean the real list not the one i show to gregory there are hundreds of names on that but the little private list that hed better not see  juno oh will you really put me on that say you will  mrs lunn well perhaps i will he kisses her hand now dont begin abusing the privilege  juno may i call you by your christian name  mrs lunn no its too long you cant go about calling a woman seraphita  juno ecstatically seraphita  mrs lunn i used to be called sally at home but when i married a man named lunn of course that became ridiculous thats my one little pet joke call me mrs lunn for short and change the subject or i shall go to sleep  juno i cant change the subject for me there is no other subject why else have you put me on your list  mrs lunn because youre a solicitor gregorys a solicitor im accustomed to my husband being a solicitor and telling me things he oughtnt to tell anybody  juno ruefully is that all oh i cant believe that the voice of love has ever thoroughly awakened you  mrs lunn no it sends me to sleep juno appeals against this by an amorous demonstration its no use mr juno im hopelessly respectable the jenkinses always were dont you realize that unless most women were like that the world couldnt go on as it does  juno darkly you think it goes on respectably but i can tell you as a solicitor  mrs lunn stuff of course all the disreputable people who get into trouble go to you just as all the sick people go to the doctors but most people never go to a solicitor  juno rising with a growing sense of injury look here mrs lunn do you think a mans heart is a potato or a turnip or a ball of knitting wool that you can throw it away like this  mrs lunn i dont throw away balls of knitting wool a mans heart seems to me much like a sponge it sops up dirty water as well as clean  juno i have never been treated like this in my life here am i a married man with a most attractive wife a wife i adore and who adores me and has never as much as looked at any other man since we were married i come and throw all this at your feet i i a solicitor braving the risk of your husband putting me into the divorce court and making me a beggar and an outcast i do this for your sake and you go on as if i were making no sacrifice as if i had told you its a fine evening or asked you to have a cup of tea its not human its not right love has its rights as well as respectability he sits down again aloof and sulky  mrs lunn nonsense here heres a flower she gives him one go and dream over it until you feel hungry nothing brings people to their senses like hunger  juno contemplating the flower without rapture what goods this  mrs lunn snatching it from him oh you dont love me a bit  juno yes i do or at least i did but im an englishman and i think you ought to respect the conventions of english life  mrs lunn but i am respecting them and youre not  juno pardon me i may be doing wrong but im doing it in a proper and customary manner you may be doing right but youre doing it in an unusual and questionable manner i am not prepared to put up with that i can stand being badly treated im no baby and can take care of myself with anybody and of course i can stand being well treated but the thing i cant stand is being unexpectedly treated its outside my scheme of life so come now youve got to behave naturally and straightforwardly with me you can leave husband and child home friends and country for my sake and come with me to some southern isleor say south americawhere we can be all in all to one another or you can tell your husband and let him jolly well punch my head if he can but im damned if im going to stand any eccentricity its not respectable  gregory coming in from the terrace and advancing with dignity to his wifes end of the chesterfield will you have the goodness sir in addressing this lady to keep your temper and refrain from using profane language  mrs lunn rising delighted gregory darling she enfolds him in a copious embrace  juno rising you make love to another man to my face  mrs lunn why hes my husband  juno that takes away the last rag of excuse for such conduct a nice world it would be if married people were to carry on their endearments before everybody  gregory this is ridiculous what the devil business is it of yours what passes between my wife and myself youre not her husband are you  juno not at present but im on the list im her prospective husband youre only her actual one im the anticipation youre the disappointment  mrs lunn oh my gregory is not a disappointment fondly are you dear  gregory you just wait my pet ill settle this chap for you he disengages himself from her embrace and faces juno she sits down placidly you call me a disappointment do you well i suppose every husbands a disappointment what about yourself dont try to look like an unmarried man i happen to know the lady you disappointed i travelled in the same ship with her and  juno and you fell in love with her  gregory taken aback who told you that  juno aha you confess it well if you want to know nobody told me everybody falls in love with my wife  gregory and do you fall in love with everybodys wife  juno certainly not only with yours  mrs lunn but whats the good of saying that mr juno im married to him and theres an end of it  juno not at all you can get a divorce  mrs lunn what for  juno for his misconduct with my wife  gregory deeply indignant how dare you sir asperse the character of that sweet lady a lady whom i have taken under my protection  juno protection  mrs juno returning hastily really you must be more careful what you say about me mr lunn  juno my precious he embraces her pardon this betrayal of my feeling but ive not seen my wife for several weeks and she is very dear to me  gregory i call this cheek who is making love to his own wife before people now pray  mrs lunn wont you introduce me to your wife mr juno  mrs juno how do you do they shake hands and mrs juno sits down beside mrs lunn on her left  mrs lunn im so glad to find you do credit to gregorys taste im naturally rather particular about the women he falls in love with  juno sternly this is no way to take your husbands unfaithfulness to lunn you ought to teach your wife better wheres her feelings its scandalous  gregory what about your own conduct pray  juno i dont defend it and theres an end of the matter  gregory well upon my soul what difference does your not defending it make  juno a fundamental difference to serious people i may appear wicked i dont defend myself i am wicked though not bad at heart to thoughtless people i may even appear comic well laugh at me i have given myself away but mrs lunn seems to have no opinion at all about me she doesnt seem to know whether im wicked or comic she doesnt seem to care she has no more sense i say its not right i repeat i have sinned and im prepared to suffer  mrs juno have you really sinned tops  mrs lunn blandly i dont remember your sinning i have a shocking bad memory for trifles but i think i should remember thatif you mean me  juno raging trifles i have fallen in love with a monster  gregory dont you dare call my wife a monster  mrs juno rising quickly and coming between them please dont lose your temper mr lunn i wont have my tops bullied  gregory well then let him not brag about sinning with my wife he turns impulsively to his wife makes her rise and takes her proudly on his arm what pretension has he to any such honor  juno i sinned in intention mrs juno abandons him and resumes her seat chilled im as guilty as if i had actually sinned and i insist on being treated as a sinner and not walked over as if id done nothing by your wife or any other man  mrs lunn tush she sits down again contemptuously  juno furious i wont be belittled  mrs lunn to mrs juno i hope youll come and stay with us now that you and gregory are such friends mrs juno  juno this insane magnanimity  mrs lunn dont you think youve said enough mr juno this is a matter for two women to settle wont you take a stroll on the beach with my gregory while we talk it over gregory is a splendid listener  juno i dont think any good can come of a conversation between mr lunn and myself we can hardly be expected to improve one anothers morals he passes behind the chesterfield to mrs lunns end seizes a chair deliberately pushes it between gregory and mrs lunn and sits down with folded arms resolved not to budge  gregory oh indeed oh all right if you come to thathe crosses to mrs juno plants a chair by her side and sits down with equal determination  juno now we are both equally guilty  gregory pardon me im not guilty  juno in intention dont quibble you were guilty in intention as i was  gregory no i should rather describe myself guilty in fact but not in intention    juno             rising and       what   mrs juno        exclaiming       no really   mrs lunn        simultaneously   gregory  gregory yes i maintain that i am responsible for my intentions only and not for reflex actions over which i have no control mrs juno sits down ashamed i promised my mother that i would never tell a lie and that i would never make love to a married woman i never have told a lie  mrs lunn remonstrating gregory she sits down again  gregory i say never on many occasions i have resorted to prevarication but on great occasions i have always told the truth i regard this as a great occasion and i wont be intimidated into breaking my promise i solemnly declare that i did not know until this evening that mrs juno was married she will bear me out when i say that from that moment my intentions were strictly and resolutely honorable though my conduct which i could not control and am therefore not responsible for was disgracefulor would have been had this gentleman not walked in and begun making love to my wife under my very nose  juno flinging himself back into his chair well i like this  mrs lunn really darling theres no use in the pot calling the kettle black  gregory when you say darling may i ask which of us you are addressing  mrs lunn i really dont know im getting hopelessly confused  juno why dont you let my wife say something i dont think she ought to be thrust into the background like this  mrs lunn im sorry im sure please excuse me dear  mrs juno thoughtfully i dont know what to say i must think over it i have always been rather severe on this sort of thing but when it came to the point i didnt behave as i thought i should behave i didnt intend to be wicked but somehow or other nature or whatever you choose to call it didnt take much notice of my intentions gregory instinctively seeks her hand and presses it and i really did think tops that i was the only woman in the world for you  juno cheerfully oh thats all right my precious mrs lunn thought she was the only woman in the world for him  gregory reflectively so she is in a sort of a way  juno flaring up and so is my wife dont you set up to be a better husband than i am for youre not ive owned im wrong you havent  mrs lunn are you sorry gregory  gregory perplexed sorry  mrs lunn yes sorry i think its time for you to say youre sorry and to make friends with mr juno before we all dine together  gregory seraphita i promised my mother  mrs juno involuntarily oh bother your mother recovering herself i beg your pardon  gregory a promise is a promise i cant tell a deliberate lie i know i ought to be sorry but the flat fact is that im not sorry i find that in this business somehow or other there is a disastrous separation between  my moral principles and my conduct  juno theres nothing disastrous about it it doesnt matter about your principles if your conduct is all right  gregory bosh it doesnt matter about your principles if your conduct is all right  juno but your conduct isnt all right and my principles are  gregory whats the good of your principles being right if they wont work  juno they will work sir if you exercise selfsacrifice  gregory oh yes if if if you know jolly well that selfsacrifice doesnt work either when you really want a thing how much have you sacrificed yourself pray  mrs lunn oh a great deal gregory dont be rude mr juno is a very nice man he has been most attentive to me on the voyage  gregory and mrs junos a very nice woman she oughtnt to be but she is  juno why oughtnt she to be a nice woman pray  gregory i mean she oughtnt to be nice to me and you oughtnt to be nice to my wife and your wife oughtnt to like me and my wife oughtnt to like you and if they do they oughtnt to go on liking us and i oughtnt to like your wife and you oughtnt to like mine and if we do we oughtnt to go on liking them but we do all of us we oughtnt but we do  juno but my dear boy if we admit we are in the wrong wheres the harm of it were not perfect but as long as we keep the ideal before us  gregory how  juno by admitting we were wrong  mrs lunn springing up out of patience and pacing round the lounge intolerantly well really i must have my dinner these two men with their morality and their promises to their mothers and their admissions that they were wrong and their sinning and suffering and their going on at one another as if it meant anything or as if it mattered are getting on my nerves stooping over the back of the chesterfield to address mrs juno if you will be so very good my dear as to take my sentimental husband off my hands occasionally i shall be more than obliged to you im sure you can stand more male sentimentality than i can sweeping away to the fireplace i on my part will do my best to amuse your excellent husband when you find him tiresome  juno i call this polyandry  mrs lunn i wish you wouldnt call innocent things by offensive names mr juno what do you call your own conduct  juno rising i tell you i have admitted    gregory               whats the good of keeping on at that   mrs juno   together  oh not that again please   mrs lunn             tops ill scream if you say that again  juno oh well if you wont listen to me he sits down again  mrs juno what is the position now exactly mrs lunn shrugs her shoulders and gives up the conundrum gregory looks at juno juno turns away his head huffily i mean what are we going to do  mrs lunn what would you advise mr juno  juno i should advise you to divorce your husband  mrs lunn do you want me to drag your wife into court and disgrace her  juno no i forgot that excuse me but for the moment i thought i was married to you  gregory i think we had better let bygones be bygones to mrs juno very tenderly you will forgive me wont you why should you let a moments forgetfulness embitter all our future life  mrs juno but its mrs lunn who has to forgive you  gregory oh dash it i forgot this is getting ridiculous  mrs lunn im getting hungry  mrs juno do you really mind mrs lunn  mrs lunn my dear mrs juno gregory is one of those terribly uxorious men who ought to have ten wives if any really nice woman will take him off my hands for a day or two occasionally i shall be greatly obliged to her  gregory seraphita you cut me to the soul he weeps  mrs lunn serve you right youd think it quite proper if it cut me to the soul  mrs juno am i to take sibthorpe off your hands too mrs lunn  juno rising do you suppose ill allow this  mrs juno youve admitted that youve done wrong tops whats the use of your allowing or not allowing after that  juno i do not admit that i have done wrong i admit that what i did was wrong  gregory can you explain the distinction  juno its quite plain to anyone but an imbecile if you tell me ive done something wrong you insult me but if you say that something that i did is wrong you simply raise a question of morals i tell you flatly if you say i did anything wrong you will have to fight me in fact i think we ought to fight anyhow i dont particularly want to but i feel that england expects us to  gregory i wont fight if you beat me my wife would share my humiliation if i beat you she would sympathize with you and loathe me for my brutality  mrs lunn not to mention that as we are human beings and not reindeer or barndoor fowl if two men presumed to fight for us we couldnt decently ever speak to either of them again  gregory besides neither of us could beat the other as we neither of us know how to fight we should only blacken each others eyes and make fools of ourselves  juno i dont admit that every englishman can use his fists  gregory youre an englishman can you use yours  juno i presume so i never tried  mrs juno you never told me you couldnt fight tops i thought you were an accomplished boxer  juno my precious i never gave you any ground for such a belief  mrs juno you always talked as if it were a matter of course you spoke with the greatest contempt of men who didnt kick other men downstairs  juno well i cant kick mr lunn downstairs were on the ground floor  mrs juno you could throw him into the harbor  gregory do you want me to be thrown into the harbor  mrs juno no i only want to show tops that hes making a ghastly fool of himself  gregory rising and prowling disgustedly between the chesterfield and the windows were all making fools of ourselves  juno following him well if were not to fight i must insist at least on your never speaking to my wife again  gregory does my speaking to your wife do you any harm  juno no but its the proper course to take emphatically we must behave with some sort of decency  mrs lunn and are you never going to speak to me again mr juno  juno im prepared to promise never to do so i think your husband has a right to demand that then if i speak to you after it will not be his fault it will be a breach of my promise and i shall not attempt to defend my conduct  gregory facing him i shall talk to your wife as often as shell let me  mrs juno i have no objection to your speaking to me mr lunn  juno then i shall take steps  gregory what steps  juno steps measures proceedings what steps as may seem advisable  mrs lunn to mrs juno can your husband afford a scandal mrs juno  mrs juno no  mrs lunn neither can mine  gregory mrs juno im very sorry i let you in for all this i dont know how it is that we contrive to make feelings like ours which seems to me to be beautiful and sacred feelings and which lead to such interesting and exciting adventures end in vulgar squabbles and degrading scenes  juno i decline to admit that my conduct has been vulgar or degrading  gregory i promised  juno look here old chap i dont say a word against your mother and im sorry shes dead but really you know most women are mothers and they all die some time or other yet that doesnt make them infallible authorities on morals does it  gregory i was about to say so myself let me add that if you do things merely because you think some other fool expects you to do them and he expects you to do them because he thinks you expect him to expect you to do them it will end in everybody doing what nobody wants to do which is in my opinion a silly state of things  juno lunn i love your wife and thats all about it  gregory juno i love yours what then  juno clearly she must never see you again  mrs juno why not  juno why not my love im surprised at you  mrs juno am i to speak only to men who dislike me  juno yes i think that is properly speaking a married womans duty  mrs juno then i wont do it thats flat i like to be liked i like to be loved i want everyone round me to love me i dont want to meet or speak to anyone who doesnt like me  juno but my precious this is the most horrible immorality  mrs lunn i dont intend to give up meeting you mr juno you amuse me very much i dont like being loved it bores me but i do like to be amused  juno i hope we shall meet very often but i hope also we shall not defend our conduct  mrs juno rising this is unendurable weve all been flirting need we go on footling about it  juno huffily i dont know what you call footling  mrs juno cutting him short you do youre footling mr lunn is footling cant we admit that were human and have done with it  juno i have admitted it all along i  mrs juno almost screaming then stop footling  the dinner gong sounds  mrs lunn rising thank heaven lets go in to dinner gregory take in mrs juno  gregory but surely i ought to take in our guest and not my own wife  mrs lunn well mrs juno is not your wife is she  gregory oh of course i beg your pardon im hopelessly confused he offers his arm to mrs juno rather apprehensively  mrs juno you seem quite afraid of me she takes his arm  gregory i am i simply adore you they go out together and as they pass through the door he turns and says in a ringing voice to the other couple i have said to mrs juno that i simply adore her he takes her out defiantly  mrs lunn calling after him yes dear shes a darling to juno now sibthorpe  juno giving her his arm gallantly you have called me sibthorpe thank you i think lunns conduct fully justifies me in allowing you to do it  mrs lunn yes i think you may let yourself go now  juno seraphita i worship you beyond expression  mrs lunn sibthorpe you amuse me beyond description come they go in to dinner together
