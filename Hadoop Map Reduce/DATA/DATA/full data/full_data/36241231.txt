36241231	the rover boys in camp  or the rivals of pine island  by  arthur m winfield  1904        introduction  my dear boys the rover boys in camp is a complete story in itself but forms the eighth volume of the rover boys series for young americans  as i have mentioned before when i started this line of stories i had in mind to make not more than three or possibly four volumes but the publication of rover boys at school rover boys on the ocean rover boys in the jungle and rover boys out west did not appear to satisfy my readers and so i followed with rover boys on the great lakes rover boys in the mountains and lastly with rover boys on land and sea but the publishers say there is still a cry for more more and so i now present to you this new rover boys book which relates the adventures of dick tom and sam and a number of their oldtime friends at home at dear old putnam hall and in camp on pine island  in writing this tale i have had in mind two thoughtsone to give my young readers an outandout story of jolly summer adventure along with a little touch of mystery and the other to show them that it very often pays to return good for evil arnold baxter had done much to bring trouble to the rover family but what dick rover did in return was christianlike in the highest meaning of that term dick was not a goodygoody youth but he was a thoroughly manly one and his example is well worth following by any lad who wishes to make something of himself  once more let me thank all of those who have expressed themselves as satisfied with the previous stories in this series i earnestly trust the present volume will also prove acceptable to them and will do them good  affectionately and sincerely yours  arthur m winfield     contents       i the rover boys at home

through the doorway of the car step lively please  hurrah for home shouted a curlyheaded youth of sixteen as he caught up a small dresssuit case come on sam  im coming tom answered a boy a year younger where is dick  here i am replied dick rover the big brother of the others just been in the baggage car making sure the trunks would be put off he added say but this looks natural doesnt it after traveling thousands of miles across the pacific  and across the continent from san francisco put in sam rover  do you know i feel as if id been away for an age  its what weve gone through with that makes you feel that way sam came from tom rover just think of being cast away on a lonely island like robinson crusoe why half the folks wont believe our story when they hear it  theyll have to believe it sam hopped down to the depot platform followed by the others wonder if the folks got that telegram i forwarded from buffalo  they must have for there is jack with the big carriage said tom and walked over to the turnout he mentioned hullo jack he called out how is everybody  master tom ejaculated jack ness the rovers hired man back at last are you an safe an sound  sound as a dollar jack how are the folks  your father is putty well and so is your uncle randolph your aunt martha got so excited athinkin you was coming hum she got a headache  dear aunt martha murmured tom ill soon cure her of that he turned to his brothers what shall we do about the trunks we cant take em in the carriage  aleck is comin for them boxes said the hired man theres his wagon now  a box wagon came dashing up to the depot platform with a tall goodlooking colored man on the seat the eyes of the colored man lit up with pleasure when he caught sight of the boys  well well well he ejaculated leaping down and rushing forward heah yo are at las bless you ise been dat worried bout yo i couldnt most sleep fo tree nights an jess to tink yo was cast away on an island in de middle of dat pacific ocean its a wonder dem cannonballs didnt eat yo up  thanks but we didnt meet any cannonballs aleck i am thankful to say replied dick rover our greatest trouble was with some mutineers who got drunk and wanted to run things to suit themselves they might have got the best of us but a warship visited the island just in the nick of time and rescued us  so i heared out ob dat letter wot yo writ yo father an to tink dat miss dora stanhope and de laning gals was wrecked wid yo its wonderful  it certainly was strange aleck but come i am anxious to get home here are the trunk checks and dick passed the brasses over  in a moment more the three boys had entered the carriage along with jack ness tom insisted on driving and away they went at a spanking gait over swift river through the little village of dexters corners and then out on the road that led to valley brook farm  as my old readers know the rover boys were three in number as already introduced they were the sons of anderson rover a welltodo gentleman who was now living in retirement at valley brook in company with his brother randolph and the latters wife martha  while anderson rover had been on a hunt for gold in the heart of africa the three boys had been sent by their uncle randolph to a military academy known as putnam hall here they made many friends and also a few enemies the worst of the latter being dan baxter a bully who wanted his way in everything baxter was the offspring of a family of low reputation and his father arnold baxter was now in prison for various misdeeds  the first term at school had been followed by an exciting chase on the ocean after which the boys had gone with their uncle to the jungles of africa in a search after anderson rover after the parent was found it was learned that arnold baxter was trying to swindle the rovers out of a valuable gold mine in the far west but this plot after some exciting adventures was nipped in the bud  the trip west had tired the boys and they hailed an outing on the great lakes with delight during this outing they learned something about a treasure located in the heart of the adirondack mountains and the next winter visited the locality and unearthed a box containing gold silver and precious stones worth several thousands of dollars during this treasurehunt dan baxter did his best to bring the rover boys to grief but without success  after the winter in the adirondacks the boys had expected to return at once to putnam hall to continue their studies but three pupils were taken down with scarlet fever and the academy was promptly closed by the master captain victor putnam  that gives us another holiday tom had said let us put in the time by traveling and later on it was decided that the boys should visit california for their health this they did and in the seventh volume of this series entitled the rover boys on land and sea i related the particulars of how they were carried off to sea during a violent storm in company with three of their oldtime girl friends dora stanhope and her cousins nellie and grace laning it may be mentioned here that dick thought dora stanhope the sweetest girl in the world and tom and sam were equally smitten with nellie and grace laning  being cast away on the pacific was productive of additional adventures and surprises on a ship that picked the girls and boys up they fell in again with dan baxter and he did all in his power to make trouble for them when all were cast away on a deserted island dan baxter joined some mutineers among the sailors and there was a fight which threatened to end seriously for our friends but as luck would have it a united states warship hove into sight and from that moment the boys and girls and the friends who had stuck to them through thick and thin were safe  before the warship left the island a search was made for dan baxter and for those who had mutinied with him but the bully and his evilminded followers kept out of sight and so they were left behind to shift for themselves  do you think that we will ever see dan baxter again sam had questioned  i hardly think so had been dicks reply but in this surmise the elder rover boy was mistaken as later events will prove  the journey across the pacific to san francisco was accomplished without incident as soon as the golden gate was reached the boys and also the girls sent telegrams to their folks telling them that all was well  mrs stanhope was staying at santa barbara for her health all of the girls had been stopping with her and now it was decided that dora nellie and grace should go to her again  its too bad we must part dick had said as he squeezed doras hand but you are coming east soon arent you  in a month or two yes and what will you do  go back to putnam hall most likelyif the scarlet fever scare is over  then well be likely to see you again before long and dora smiled her pleasure  it will be like old times to get back to the hall again sam had put in but first i want to go home and see the folks  right you are had come from tom i reckon they are dead anxious to see us too  and so they had parted with tight handsqueezing and bright smiles that meant a good deal one train had taken the girls southward to santa barbara and another had taken the boys eastward to denver and to chicago at the latter city the lads had made a quick change and twentysix hours later found them at oak run and in the carriage for the farm     chapter ii  news of interest   my boys my boys  such was the cry given by anderson rover when he caught sight of the occupants of the carriage as the turnout swept up to the piazza of the comfortable farm home     home again home again    safe from a foreign shore  sang out tom and leaping to the ground he caught his father around the shoulders arent you glad to see us father he went on  glad doesnt express it tom replied the fond parent as he embraced first one and then another my heart is overflowing with joy and i thank god that you have returned unharmed after having passed through so many grave perils how brown all of you look  tanned by the tropical sun answered sam oh here is aunt martha and uncle randolph  sam burst out the motherly aunt as she kissed him oh how you must have suffered on that lonely island and then she kissed the others  weve certainly had our fill of adventures came from dick who was shaking hands with his uncle randolph and more than once we thought we should never see valley brook farm again  we were real robinson crusoes went on sam and the girls were robinson crusoes too  are the girls well questioned mrs rover  very well auntie if they hadnt been we shouldnt have parted with them in san francisco they went back to santa barbara to finish their vacation  i see well it certainly was a wonderful trip youll have to tell us all the particulars this evening i suppose you are as hungry as bears just now tom is im sure  oh aunt martha i see you havent forgotten my failing piped in the youth mentioned with a twinkle in his eye and do i get pie for dinner  yes tom and all you care to eat too we are going to make your homecoming a holiday  good  they were soon in the house every nook and corner of which was so familiar to them they rushed up to their rooms and after a brushing and a washing up came down to the big dining room where the table fairly groaned with good things  gosh this is a regular christmas spread observed tom as he looked the table over tell you what aunt martha im going to be cast away every week after this  oh tom dont speak of it after this you must stay right here neither your father nor your uncle nor myself will want to leave you out of sight  pooh we cant stay home but well be careful of our trips in the future you can be sure of that  have you heard anything about putnam hall since we went away asked dick during the meal  the academy opened again last week dick answered his father we received a circular letter from captain putnam the scarlet fever scare did not amount to much for which the captain is very thankful  i sent him a telegram stating we were safe said sam i knew he would like to hear from us the captain is a brick  the best ever said tom with his mouth full of chicken  and ditto mr strong put in dick referring to the head assistant at the hall  exactly dick but no more jasper grinders in mine went on tom referring to a tyrannical teacher who had caused them much trouble and who had been discharged from the academy as already mentioned in the rover boys in the mountains  or josiah crabtrees said dick referring to another teacher who had been made to leave putnam hall and who had wanted to marry the widow stanhope in an endeavor to get control of the money that was coming to dora crabtrees misdeeds had landed him in prison where he was likely to stay for some time to come  while the meal was still in progress the boys began the recital of their many adventures and this recital was kept up until a late hour it was astonishing how much they had to tell and how interesting it proved to the listeners  you might make a book of it said anderson rover it equals our adventures in the jungles of africa  i am going to write it out some day answered dick and maybe ill get the story printed the trouble is i cant end the tale properly  how is that dick asked his uncle randolph you were all saved isnt that a proper ending for any book  yes but what of the villain baxter didnt show himself and that is no ending at all he should have fallen over a cliff or been shot or something like that  and we should have married the three girls put in funloving tom that would make the story even more complete  well things do not happen in real life as they do in story books said the parent it is likely you will never hear of dan baxter again but we may hear from his father  his father exclaimed the three youths in concert  why arnold baxter is in prison added sam  he was up to five days ago when they took him to the hospital to undergo some sort of an operation at the hospital the operation was postponed for a day and during the night he slipped away from the institution and disappeared  well i never burst out dick isnt he the slick one though just when you think youve got him hard and fast you havent at all  havent they any trace of him asked sam  none so far as i have heard there was a report that he had gone to new york and taken passage on a ship bound for liverpool but at present the ship is on the atlantic so the authorities can do nothing  i hope they catch him  we all hope that sam  for a few days the three boys did nothing but take it easy it was pleasant weather and they roamed around the farm in company with their father and their uncle or with alexander pop the colored man of work as my old readers know pop had been in former days a waiter at putnam hall and dick tom and sam had befriended him on more than one occasion for which he was extremely grateful  yo boys is jes naturally fustclass heroes said aleck one day even if dem cannonballs had cum after yo i dont tink da could have cotched yo no sirree  its a pity you werent along aleck answered tom  i cant say as to dat master tom i got bout all de hairraisin times i wanted when we was in de jungles ob africy ise only sorry ob one ting  and what is that  dat you didnt jes go an frow dat dan baxter overboard from dat ship de fust time yo sot eyes on him suah as yo am born hell turn up some day to make moah trouble  well if he turns up well be ready for him returned tom grimly  how can yo be ready fo a pusson wot acts like a snake in de grass hell sting befo yo hab de chance to spot him  well have to keep our eyes open aleck answered the youth and then the subject was changed  during those days the boys went fishing and bathing in the river and also visited humpback falls that spot where sam had had such a thrilling adventure as related in the rover boys at school  what a lot has happened since those days said sam taking a deep breath tom do you remember how you got into trouble with old crabtree the very first day we landed at putnam hall  i do sam and do you remember our first meeting on the boat with dan baxter and how we sent him about his business when he tried to annoy nellie and grace and dora  yes indeed say i am getting anxious to get back to the hall it seems almost like a second home  so am i put in dick besides we have lost time enough from our studies well have to pitch in or well drop behind our classes  father says we can return to the hall next monday if we wish  i vote we do so  so do i  and thus it was decided that they should return to the academy four days later  but during those four days something was to happen which would have an important bearing upon their future actions     chapter iii  a midnight visitor   the next day shortly after noon it began to rain and the storm increased in violence until the wind blew almost a gale  the rain kept the boys indoors at which tom was inclined to grumble  no use of grumbling tom said dick cheerfully let us improve the time by looking over our school books that will make it easier to slip into the grind again when we get back to the hall  that is excellent advice richard said randolph rover whatever you do do not neglect your studies  by the way uncle randolph how is scientific farming progressing said tom referring to something that had been his uncles hobby for yearsa hobby that had cost the gentleman considerable money  wellahto tell the truth thomas not as well as i had hoped for  hope you didnt drop a thousand or two this year uncle  oh nonot over fifty dollars  then you got off easy  i shall do better next year the potatoes already show signs of improvement  good i suppose youll be growing em on top of the ground soon then you wont have the bother of digging em you know went on the funloving boy innocently  absurd thomas but i shall have some very large varieties i feel certain  big as a watermelon  hardly but  big as a muskmelon then  not exactly but  about the size of a cocoanut eh  no no they will be as large as  i mean a little cocoanut pleaded tom while sam felt like laughing outright  well yes a little cocoanut you see  we saw some big potatoes in california uncle randolph  ah of what variety  cornus bustabus or something like that sam what was the name do you know  that must be something like it tom grinned the youngest rover  took two men to lift some of those potatoes went on tom calmly  two men thomas surely you are joking  no uncle i am telling nothing but the strict truth  but two men the potatoes must have been of monstrous size  oh not so very big but they did weigh a good deal no question of it  think of two men lifting one potato  i didnt say one potato uncle randolph i said some of those potatoes  eh  the men had a barrel full of em  thomas the uncle shook his finger threateningly at your old tricks i see i might have known it and then he stalked off to hide his chagrin  tom that was rather rough on uncle randolph said sam after a laugh  so it was sam but ive got to do something this being boxed up when one might be fishing or swimming or playing baseball is simply dreadful answered the other  just before the evening meal was announced jack ness came up from the barn and sought out randolph rover  found a man slinking around the cowshed a while ago he said he looked like a tramp i wanted to talk to him but he scooted in doublequick order  humph we havent had any tramps here in a long time came from randolph rover where did he go to  down toward the berry patch  did you follow him up  i did sir but he got away from me  you must keep a close watch for those fellows said randolph rover bluntly i dont want any of them getting in our barn and burning it down to the ground  you are right randolph said anderson rover make them keep away from the place by all means jack  ill keep my eye peeled for em answered the hired man  the wind was now blowing a gale causing the trees near the farmhouse to creak and groan and banging more than one shutter but the boys did not mind this and went to bed promptly at the usual hour  a storm like this on land is nothing to one on the sea was the way tom expressed himself i dont like anything better than to listen to the whistling of the wind when i am snug in bed  for the time being sam and tom were occupying a room in the l of the farmhouse and dick had a small bedchamber adjoining the boys were soon undressed and having said their prayers hopped into bed and were soon sound asleep  it was not until half an hour later that the older folks retired anderson rover was the last to leave the sitting room where he had been busy writing some letters at the desk that stood there  as he was about to retire he fancied he heard a noise outside of one of the windows he drew up the curtain and looked through the glass but could see nothing  it must have been the wind he murmured but somehow it didnt sound like it  as he stepped into the dark hallway an uneasy feeling took possession of hima feeling hard to define and one for which he could not account  i think i had better go around and see that all the doors and windows are properly locked he told himself brother randolph may have overlooked one of them  he walked the length of the hallway and stepped into the kitchen and over to a side window  as he had his hand on the windowlatch he heard a quick step directly behind him  he started to turn but before he could do so he received a blow on the head from a club that staggered him then he was jerked backward to the floor  silence muttered a voice close to his ear dont you dare to make a sound  what does this mean he managed to gasp  silence i tell you was the short answer if you say another word i will hit you again  having no desire to receive a blow that might render him totally unconscious or perhaps take his life anderson rover said no more he heard a match struck and then a bit of a tallow candle was lit and placed on the edge of the kitchen table  by this dim light the father of the rover boys saw standing over him a tall man beardless and with his head closely cropped one glance into that hardened face sufficed to tell him who the unwelcome visitor was  arnold baxter  i see you recognize me was the harsh reply not so loud please unless you want that crack i promised you  what brings you here and at such an hour as this  i find it more convenient to travel during the night than in the daytime  the police are on your track  i know that as well you rover  what do you want here  what does any man want when he has been stripped of all his belongings i want money  i have none for you  bosh do you think i have forgotten how you and your boys swindled me out of my rights to that mine in the far west  we did not swindle you baxter the claim was lawfully mine  i cant stop to argue the question and i dont want you to talk so loud remember that no dont try to get up went on the midnight visitor as anderson rover attempted to rise stay just where you are  he was feeling in his pocket and now he brought forth a strip of cloth with a knot tied in the middle  it was a gag and he started to place it in anderson rovers mouth when the latter leaped up and began to struggle with all the force he could command  stop i tell you cried arnold baxter softly  stop and then catching up his club once more he dealt anderson rover another blow this time directly across the temple the gentleman wavered for an instant gave a deep groan and fell like a log to the floor     chapter iv  a useless pursuit   half an hour later tom awoke with a start for the moment he could not tell what had aroused him then he remembered hearing the slam of a door or a window sash  must have been the storm he told himself and was about to turn over and go to sleep when he heard a gunshot from the direction of the barn  something is wrong thats certain he cried sam wake up  whats the row tom questioned the youngest brother sleepily  before tom could reply they heard dick getting up and also their uncle randolph and aunt martha  what did that shot mean demanded randolph rover coming toward the boys rooms did any of you fire it  no it came from outside returned torn hark  hullo in the house came in the voice of jack ness wake up everybody something is wrong  after this it did not take long for those upstairs to slip into some clothing and go below randolph rover ran to the side door to find it wide open dick lit the hall lamp  saw a man running across the garden said jack ness who had his shotgun with him i yelled to him to stop and then fired the gun i think he came from the house  how did you happen to be up asked sam  one of the horses is sick and i was attending to him  by this time some of the others were looking into the various rooms  the desk has been broken open cried dick and the pantry in the corner too  mercy save us shrieked mrs rover from the kitchen come here at once poor anderson has been killed  killed gasped tom and then all ran to the kitchen as quickly as they could  they found anderson rover lying where he had fallen and still unconscious there was a lump on his forehead and a thin stream of blood trickled down one side of his face  thank heaven he is not dead murmured dick as he knelt beside his father but he has been struck some cruel blows somebody fetch water and a bandage  the water was procured and also a bandage and under skillful treatment anderson rover was presently restored to consciousness  wherewhere is he he questioned when he could speak  do you mean the person who struck you down asked dick  yeyes  i dont know got away i guess  the villain he attacked me most foully  i saw him running across the garden put in the hired man did he steal anything  to be sure he stole something said sam he ransacked the whole lower floor by the looks of things  wonder who it was put in tom  it was arnold baxter answered his father  arnold baxter cried the others in chorus  are you certain asked dick  yes he struck me down and then lit the bit of tallow candle you see lying there then we struggled and he hit me again and that is all i know but i am sure it was baxter for i spoke to him he accused us of having robbed him of that mine out west  was he alone asked randolph rover  i saw no one else  we ought to follow him up declared tom now that he realized his father was not so badly hurt as at first feared  thats the talk ejaculated dick wait till i get my pistol  boys do keep out of harm pleaded mrs rover remember that this arnold baxter is a desperate criminal  we are not afraid of him answered tom  well show him that he cant come here and attack father added sam  leaving their father in the care of their aunt martha the three rover boys armed themselves and sallied forth accompanied by their uncle and alexander pop the latter carrying a horsepistol of the oldfashioned variety  dat dar baxter am a rascal of de fust water was alecks comment he deserbes to be shot full ob holes an i am de boy to do dat same if only i gets de chance  jack ness was closely questioned and he described the spot where he had last seen the unwelcome midnight visitor  he had a bag of something over his shoulder he declared  most likely the stuff taken from the house declared dick  the party crossed the garden patch and then took to the path which ran down toward the river  here all was intensely dark although it had stopped raining and the wind was trying its best to scatter the heavy clouds that obscured the stars  not a thing to see observed randolph rover we may as well go back  let us scatter and make a search came from dick and his idea was carried out but though they tramped the locality for a good half hour the pursuit of arnold baxter proved useless  he is probably making good use of his time was toms comment he knew we would be after him hotfooted just as soon as we heard of his being here  im going to drive over to the railroad station said dick he may hang around and get aboard of the first morning train  take me along with you said sam and dick agreed they got aleck to drive them and took the fastest team the stable afforded  but at the depot all was dark and deserted and if arnold baxter was anywhere near he took good care not to show himself nor was anything seen of him in oak run later on  he has left the neighborhood by some other way said randolph rover and his surmise was correct  when the boys reached home again they found their parent sitting up in an easychair with his forehead still bandaged the blows he had received were painful but by no means serious and when the doctor was called in he said the patient would speedily recover  but you had a narrow escape said the doctor had you been struck a little harder your skull might have been broken  well i dont think arnold baxter would have cared if he had broken my skull answered anderson rover he is a thoroughly bad man  it was broad daylight before a complete examination of the house was made and then it was learned that baxter had run away with some silver knives forks and spoons some gold napkin rings a silver and gold water pitcher and half a dozen similar articles from the desk he had taken a pocketbook containing three hundred dollars in cash and from anderson rovers person his watch and chain and a diamond stud he had also tried to rob the unconscious man of his diamond ring but as the ring would not come off had pried out the stone and taken that  he is at his old tricks again said dick evidently his term in prison has done him no good  guess it has made him worse added sam oh how i would like to lay my hands on him and tom said the same  the authorities were notified including the sheriff of the county and later still anderson rover hired a new york detective to take up the case but it was of no avail arnold baxter did not show himself and not a trace of him was to be found anywhere  i shouldnt be surprised if he disguised himself as soon as he got away from here remarked tom he could easily put on a false mustache and a wig would fit capitally over that almost bald pate of his  but where would he get the mustache and wig tom asked dick  he may have bought them before he came here i have heard that some robbers prepare themselves for all sorts of emergencies only last week i was reading about a fellow who went to a ball and between the dances went out and robbed a gentleman on the street of his watch when he was arrested he tried to prove that he hadnt been outside of the ballroom all night and it was by the merest accident that the authorities found out his story wasnt true  tom is right some criminals are very shrewd said his father and i fancy arnold baxter is about as slick as any of them  well i hope we run across him some day said dick  with so much to occupy their minds the days flew by swiftly and almost before they knew it monday was at hand and the three boys set out to return once more to putnam hall     chapter v  on the way to putnam hall   the idea of going back to dear old putnam hall with all of its pleasant memories filled tom with good humor and he was fairly bubbling over on the train which carried the boys to ithaca where they were to take a steamer up cayuga lake to cedarville the nearest village to the academy  makes me feel as i did the first time we went to the hall he declared dont you remember that trip and the fun we had with peleg snuggers the wagon man and then he burst out singing  putnam halls the place for me tralalee tralalee putnam halls the place for me the best old school i know  youll have the conductor putting you off the next thing you know remarked sam  putting me off never cried tom he knows that academy boys own privileges that other passengers do not possess he cant cork me up i defy him  wonder if well meet any of the other fellows mused dick  he had hardly spoken when the train stopped at a junction and two other lads got aboard and came down the aisle one was tall and handsome and the other stout and with a round chubby face beaming with good humor  larry colby cried dick leaping up and grasping the tall boys hand im awfully glad to meet you returning to the hall of course  yes was the answer from the rover boys old chum isnt it odd that i should be thinking of you just as we meet and he shook hands  hullo if it tont peen dem rofer brudders alretty cried the roundfaced lad with a twinkle in his eyes i dink me you vos left der hall for goot yah  hans mueller came from sam then you are going back too i thought you had scarlet fever  not much i aint said the german youth i vos eat too much of dem puckveat cakes alretty und dot makes mine face preak owid put i aint got no scarlet fefers nein how you vos alretty annahow and he shook hands as larry had done  i can hardly believe your story about being cast away on an island in the pacific said larry  your letter read like a fairy tale if you tell the fellows theyll think you are drawing the long bow  yes larry vos told me somedings apoud dot broke in hans you vos regular robinson roosters he said  great scott robinson roosters yelled tom bursting out into a fit of laughter boys we are discovered at last  well if you are you neednt crow over it came from larry  roosters and crowing oh larry i didnt think youd begin to pun so early put in sam  he just hatched it out said tom  i suppose you think that sounds chic joined in dick and then there was a laugh in which all but hans mueller joined the german youth looked blankly from one to another of his companions  vos dot robinson rooster a choke he demanded of it vos let me in by it kvick  oh you couldnt climb in on a gangway and a stepladder combined answered tom  put vos you robinson roosters or vos you not robinson roosters  oh we were robinson roosters right enough answered tom when he could control his laughter  den vot you vos giggling apout hey  nothing only it was so funny to be a robinson rooster and live on a big island with nobody but lions buffaloes snakes and cannonballs added the funloving youth  cannonballs queried larry  thats what aleck pop calls em larry he said it was a wonder the cannonballs hadnt eaten us up and then came another laugh during which hans was as mute as ever  vos dere lions snakes and buffaloes py dot island on went on the german youth  to be sure there were hans and likewise elephants panthers cats dogs hippopotamuses mice elk rats and winged jibberjackers  mine gracious tom und you vosnt eaten up alretty kvick  none of the animals troubled us but the threehorned jibberjacker he came into our house one night crawled upstairs and began to swallow sam alive  you tont tole me  yes i do tell you he had sam in his mouth and had swallowed him as far as his waist when sam began to kick on the floor with his feet  i see i see hans eyes were as big as saucers  that woke dick and me up and we ran and got sam by the legs and pulled for all we were worth  you tont tole me tom und vot did dot votyoucallhim do den  he planked his ten feet on the floor and  his ten feet did you said tom interrupted hans doubtfully  to be sure didnt you know that a real jibberjacker has ten feet  maype i didi tont oxactly remember about him  i am surprised at your ignorance of natural history hans yes the real jibberjacker has ten feet although a branch of the family known as the jibbertwister has only eight feet  well go on he planked his ten feets by der floor town  he held on and so did we and it was a regular tug of war between us sam was swallowed as far as the waist and couldnt do anything to help himself you just ask sam if that isnt so  when tom tells the truth its a fact every time hans answered sam who felt as if he would choke from suppressed laughter  so the blamed old jibberjacker held on and held on continued tom then we gave a tug and he gave a tug and all of a sudden sam came out the shock was so great it threw dick and me clear across the room and through a doorway into the next room but the poor jibberjacker fared still worse  how vos dot  he flew up against the outside wall and his weight was so great he went right through the side of the building and landed on some rocks below all of his ten legs were broken and of course he couldnt get away so we went down got a long crosscut saw and sawed off his head now if you dont believe that story you come to our house sometime and ill show you the crosscut saw  hans stared in breathless amazement his solemn face was too much for the others and a peal of laughter rang through the car at this hans grew suspicious and at length a sickly grin overspread his features  i know you tom rofer he said dot vos von of dem fish stories aint it alretty  no its a jibberjacker story hans  it vos a jibjacker fish story den annahow you cant fool me some more i vos too schmart for dot alretty ven i go py der academy i git mine ear teeths cut hey  all right hans if you have cut your earteeth well call it off said dick and here the conversation took a more rational turn  so far as i know only a few of the fellows have left the hall on account of the scarlet fever scare said larry and they were boys that nobody seemed to care much about  i was told that the fellows expected to elect an entirely new lot of officers said sam we have been away so much ive rather lost track of our military affairs  captain putnam said we would have to ballot for officers as soon as all the boys were back said larry some of the old officers have graduated you must remember  ive not forgotten that i was once second lieutenant of company a put in dick reckon ill have to try my luck once moreif the boys want me to run  well i want you to run for one dick said larry hans youll vote for dick wont you  yah und i vonts him to vote for me too said the german youth  why hans do you want to be watercarrier this year asked sam  nein i vonts to be high brivate py der rear rank alretty von of der fellows tole me dot would chust suit me  all right hans well all elect you high private of the rear rank answered larry with a laugh     chapter vi  fun on the boat   at the city of ithaca the boys stopped long enough to get dinner and were here joined by fred garrison and george granbury two more of their old school chums  hurrah for the gathering of the clans cried george granbury with a beaming face this is like a touch of old times how are all of you anyway  first rate with the exception of hans here said tom hes got the buckwheat measles  yah und tom hes got der jipperjocker fefer declared the german boy bound to do his best to get square  good for hans cried sam tom after this you have got to take care or hansie will roast you  oh hans is just all right observed tom and when the german boys face was turned away he took the latters coffee and put into it about a teaspoonful of salt tell you what fellows this coffee just touches the spot he added loudly  right you are said fred garrison never tasted better in my life  so far hans had not touched the coffee but hearing the words he took up his cup and downed a deep draught it may be added that he was a german who loved coffee a good deal and frequently drank several cups at a meal  for an instant the german youth said nothing then his face turned pale  dat coffee was no goot he gasped  why hans cried several  see how pale he is getting came from george granbury hans are you going to die  dont say the coffee is going to poison him burst out tom i was reading about poison getting into the coffee at this hotel last week but of course  did da got poison py der coffee in here demanded hans  to be sure put  how vos dot poisoned coffee taste annahow  im sure i dont know  i think it was a little salty came from fred garrison  mine cracious me of dots so i vos poisoned sure run for der toctor kvick  here eat some jam hans that will counteract the effect of the poison said tom and handed over a small dish with jam in it over which he had just sprinkled the pepper with an exceedingly liberal hand  anxious to do anything that would stop him from being poisoned the german boy clutched the dish and took a large spoonful of the jam but as he gulped it he gave a gasp and the tears started down his cheeks  du meine zeit he bawled i vos purnt up alife by mine mouth alretty dake it avay kvick and jumping up from the table he began to dance around madly  its a serious case said tom if hes burning up we had better call out the fire department  this remark made hans grow suddenly suspicious he caught up toms cup of coffee and tasted it  i know you tom rofer he said dot vos more dricks of yours aint it he held the cup of coffee on high how you like dot hey and splash down came the coffee on toms head and trickled down his back  hi you let up roared tom and knocked the halfempty cup to one side let up i say or ill have the landlord put you out  i told you to take care tom came from sam when the other boys had restored quietness when hans gets his dander up he is dangerous  dot is drue came from hans i vonts no more of them chokes alretty and then as the waiter came hurrying up he forced tom to order him another cup of coffee and took good care to keep it out of the funloving youths reach poor tom sopped away the spilt coffee as best he could but it must be admitted that for the balance of that day his backbone felt none too comfortable yet he bore no grudge towards hans for he knew that he had deserved the punishment meted out to him  down at the dock the boys found the golden star a trim little sidewheeler ready to take them up the lake there were about half a hundred passengers bound for various landings and among them six putnam hall scholars including our oldtime acquaintances jack powell generally called songbird powell because of his habit of composing poems and songs and that aristocratic young gentleman who rejoiced in the name of william philander tubbs  the family is surely getting together remarked dick after another handshaking had been indulged in songbird do you warble as much as ever  you can wager a sweet potato he does said george granbury nothing short of a cyclone will ever stop songbirds warbling eh songbird  for reply the youth addressed turned a pair of dreamy eyes on the speaker and then said slowly     with hopeful hearts    and brightest faces    to school we go    to fill our places    well study hard    and do our best     if songbird powell    will give us a rest  finished tom oh songbird have mercy on us and dont begin so early  youre a good one to preach tom came from larry started to joke the moment we met him didnt he hans  did i questioned tom innocently i had forgotten he turned to tubbs and how is our friend philliam willander today  william philander if you please rover was the dignified reply i must insist on your getting my name correctly this term  all right tubby old boy it shall be just as you say i wouldnt hurt your feelings for a big red apple  then please dont call me tubby you know my real name is william philander tubbs  dont you want esquire tacked to it too  that is hardly necessary as yet but you may write it after my name if you have occasion to send me any written communication continued tubbs with greater dignity than ever  phew but tubby is worse than he was before whispered sam to dick they must have been tuning him up at home  tubbs is going to try for a captaincy this term said powell who had not minded toms interruption of his versification in the least  hurrah for captain tubbs cried tom captain allow me to salute you and he made a sweeping bow to the deck tom spoke so earnestly that tubbs was pleased and instantly forgot their little differences  i shall be pleased to become a captain said the young gentleman i feel i can fill the position with credit to myself and dignity to the academy there is military blood in my veins for a second cousin on my mothers side was a lieutenant in the civil war besides that i have studied military movements at west point where i went to see the cadets drill  do you know how to swab out a cannon asked sam with a wink at the others  i shouldntahcare for such dirty work replied william philander tubbs with dignity  or police a camp  surely you dont think i was ever a policeman  dont you remember what policing a camp is asked george granbury  upon my honor i do not  it means to clean up the streets burn up the rubbish and all that  thank you but i do notahcare to become a street cleaner returned tubbs with great dignity  sorry but im afraid you are not cut out for a corporalship came from tom  i didnt say a corporalship tom i said  excuse me i meant a sergeantship  no i said  make it a second lieutenantship then tubby anything to be friends you know  i said  oh bother if you want to be a majorgeneral go ahead nobody will stop you  hurrah majorgeneral tubbs cried sam that sounds well doesnt it fellows  well have to present him with a tinplated sword came from one of the crowd  and a pair of yellow worsted epaulets added another  and then songbird powell began to sing softly     rub a dub dub     here comes general tubb        hell make you bow to the ground     you must stop evry lark     and toe the chalk mark        as soon as he comes around  there you are tubby think of songbird composing a poem in your honor cried tom you ought to present him with a leather medal  ii dont like suchersuch doggerel cried william philander tubbs angrily i think  well i never ejaculated tom in pretended astonishment and songbird worked so hard over it too thus doth genius receive its reward songbird if i were you id give up writing poems and go turn railroad president trackwalker or something like that  you boys are simply horrid dont you know cried tubbs and pushing his way through the crowd he walked to the other end of the boat  being away from school hasnt done tubby any good was fred garrisons remark he thinks hes the high tumtum and no mistake  dont fret hell be taken down before the term is over came from larry colby  thats true added another pupil who had been taken down himself two terms before and when he hits his level hell be just as good as any of us  the time on the steamer passed quickly enough and after several stops along the lake the golden star turned in at the cedarville landing and all of the putnam hall cadets went ashore     chapter vii  something about the military academy   as my old readers know cedarville was only a small country village so the arrival and departure of the steamer was a matter of importance to the inhabitants  the boys consequently found the little dock crowded with sightseers and more than one face looked familiar to them  there are the rover boys said one man quite loudly everybody knows em  we are growing notorious it would seem whispered dick to sam  back of the dock stood the big carryall attached to putnam hall with the old hall driver peleg snuggers on the box  hullo peleg old friend shouted tom waving his hand at the man how are we tomorrow as the clown in the circus puts it  im all right master toman will be so long as you let me alone was the deliberate answer from the driver  he remembers you all right enough tom came from george granbury  now peleg dont throw cold water on my enthusiasm said tom reproachfully  i aint throwin water on nobody master tom im only giving fair warning that i want to be let alone answered the driver doggedly no more monkey shines around me remember that  all right peleg ill remember and how is mrs green our worthy housekeeper  firstrate  no whoopingcough  no  nor measles or chickenpox  not a bit of em  or mumps tell me now she really hasnt got the mumps has she  see here master tom didnt i jest tell you  no you didnt tell me and thats why im so anxious to know if shes got the mumps and the chilblains and the ingrowing warts  oh crickey i knew it groaned peleg snuggers i says to myself as i was adrivin over if thet tom rover comes back i might as well throw up my job for he wont give nobody a rest if you would only  all right peleg i see you are really and truly bound to go back on me you hate me tom drew his handkerchief from his pocket it is awful after all i have tried to do for you in the past ive got to tocry boohoo and the boy began to wipe his eyes  look ahere master tom it aint nothin to cry about said peleg half suspiciously i only give you warnin  you are soso hardhearted peleg boohoo i want to go back home and tom began to sob  this was too much for the driver and his face fell  dont you mind me master tom he said softly i didnt mean nothin indeed i didnt youre all right i like you bettern any of em  oh dear burst out larry colby just to hear that  peleg have you gone back on us demanded george granbury  he ought to have a ducking for that put in another  lets dump him into the lake  come on a cold bath will do him good  no no oh crickey groaned the driver of the carryall this is a mess ii didnt mean nuthin gents indeed i didnt  hes mean enough for anything thats what he means came from a voice in the rear pile in before he runs away and leaves us to walk to the hall and into the carryall the boys tumbled one over another dick got a seat beside the driver and away they went at a spanking gait through cedarville and then along the winding road leading to the academy two or three of the cadets had brought tin horns with them and they made the welkin ring as the turnout dashed on its way  a gingersnap prize to the first fellow who spots the academy cried sam as they made the last turn in the highway  i see the hall shouted half a dozen voices in chorus and in a few seconds they came out into full view of the broad brick and stone building with its wellkept parade ground and its trees and shrubbery the parade ground came down to the edge of the wagon road and off to the other side the land sloped gradually down to the lake glistening like a sheet of gold in the rays of the setting sun  the boys set up a loud shout and a wild blowing of horns and in a moment a score of cadets came running forward to greet them followed by captain victor putnam the master of the academy and george strong his head assistant  i am glad to see you young gentlemen said captain putnam as he shook one and another by the hand you look as if your vacation had done you good  its done me a pile of good said sam but i dont know as i want another like it  you rover boys have certainly had some remarkable experiences continued the captain i congratulate you on escaping so many grave perils sometime you must give me all the particulars but now it is time to prepare for supper i dare say the trip on the lake has made you hungry  dot is so came from hans mueller i vos so hungry like four lions alretty  i have made some slight changes in your sleeping accommodations went on captain putnam mr strong will show you to your rooms then the boys marched into the academy led by the head assistant  the majority of the cadets had their dormitories on the second floor of the building each room held from four to eight students and was both bright and clean the rules of putnam hall were similar to those in force at west point and every pupil was expected to keep his clothing his books and his other possessions in perfect order each had a cot a chair and a clothes closet to himself extra closets having been introduced in the rooms for that purpose and each was allowed the use of his trunk in addition each cadet had to take his turn at keeping the room in order although the dormitories were given a regular sweeping and cleaning once a week by the servants  as before the rover boys were placed in one room and into this came also larry colby fred garrison and george granbury the apartment was at an angle of the building and next to it was another occupied by songbird powell tubbs hans and three other cadets between the two rooms was a door but this was closed and was supposed to be kept locked  this makes one feel like home said sam as he began to wash up for supper  right you are answered larry colby no matter where i go during a vacation i am always glad to get back to putnam hall  a little later came the evening parade of the cadets who marched around the parade ground several times before entering the messroom as the dining hall was termed the late arrivals did not join in the parade but they watched it with interest and then hurried to their accustomed places at the long tables where a plain but substantial supper awaited them  only a little talking was allowed throughout the meal but at its conclusion the cadets were given an hour off in which time they could do very much as they pleased in that hour some played games others took walks and not a few drifted over to the gymnasium which stood at one corner of the grounds  im going over to the gym said dick to larry colby want to go along  certainly was the prompt answer i am going in for gymnastics this term dick  want to win some of the prizes when we have our contests  if i can  i dont see why you shouldnt larry you seem to be in firstclass shape physically  i am going to try hard dick  they were soon in the building and larry slipped off to the dressing room to don his gymnasium suit  while dick was waiting for his friend to reappear he looked on at the efforts of the other cadets present some were on the rings and bars others were using the parallel bars and horses and still others were at the pulling and lifting machines in one corner two of the boys were boxing while another was hammering a punching bag as hard as he could  the boy at the punching bag was a tall bigboned youth named lew flapp he was a newcomer at putnam hall but though he had been there but three weeks he acted as if half of the place already belonged to him at the start he had made a few friends principally on account of the money he had to spend but these were gradually deserting him  dick was interested in the work on the punching bag and he walked closer to note what lew flapp was doing clap clap clap went flapps fists on the bag which bounced back and forth with great rapidity  well how do you like that asked lew flapp as he paused in his exercise and stared at dick  its all right answered dick briefly  ill bet there aint another cadet here can do as well went on lew flapp boastfully  oh thats saying a good deal said dick some of the boys can hit the bag pretty well  humph lew flapp stared at the eldest rover harder than ever perhaps you think you can do it he sneered  i didnt say that  but your words implied it  dick rover can do every bit as well said a cadet who overheard the talk  i want to see him do it  i didnt come here to punch the bag said dick as calmly as ever i just thought id take a look around  humph afraid to try eh  oh no  i dare you to show what you can do sneered lew flapp  very well ill show you came from dick and he began to take off his coat collar and tie     chapter viii  a scene in the gymnasium   lew flapp spoke in such a loud overbearing voice that a crowd began to collect in the corner where the punching apparatus was located  whats up asked more than one cadet  lew flapp and dick rover are going to try to beat each other at punching the bag was the report  rover will have to do his best then flapp is a prime one at bag punching its about the only thing he can do real well  this isnt a fair contest put in another student flapp took lessons from a man who used to do bagpunching on the vaudeville stage  if thats so i wouldnt try to beat him if i was dick rover  dick heard some of this talk but said nothing he was soon ready for the trial and stepping up to the punching bag he began to undo the top strap  that bag is all right blustered lew flapp  yesfor you answered dick but you must remember i am not quite so tall i must have it an inch lower  it seems to me you are mighty particular  i have a right to be when you do your punching you can raise the bag as high as you please  thats the talk came from several standing near  by this time larry was on the floor again and he came up to learn what dick was doing  dick they tell me he is the best bagpuncher here whispered larry  i cant help it  he will crow over you if you dont do as well as he can do  let him  dick began his punching exercise slowly for he had not tried it for some time and was afraid he was a little stiff but it may be added here there was a punching bag in the barn at the rovers farm so the youth knew exactly what he was doing  oh anybody can do that remarked lew flapp presently thats as simple as a b c  well can you do this returned dick and branched off into something a trifle more difficult  to be sure i can  then what about this and now dick settled down to some real work clap clap went the bag this way and that  yes i can do that too answered the tall boy  id like to see you  lew flapp was only too anxious to show his skill and having adjusted the bag to suit him he went at the work once again doing just what dick had done  now do this he cried and gave a performance of his most difficult exercise it was certainly well executed and at the conclusion many of the cadets began to applaud  dick rover will have to hump himself to do that remarked one  i dont believe he can touch it said another  with care dick fixed the bag and went at the exercise it was something he had not practiced for a considerable time yet he did not miss a stroke and he wound up with a speed fully equal to that exhibited by his opponent  good for you dick cried larry heartily  theyll have to call it a tie suggested another cadet  im not done yet said dick can you do this he asked of lew flapp and then commenced an exercise he had learned some time before from a boxing instructor it was full of intricate movements all executed so rapidly that the eye could scarcely follow them the cadets looked on in wonder lew flapp staring angrily at the performance  wonderful  i didnt know dick rover could do such punching  say flapp youll have to get up early in the morning to beat that  oh you shut your mouth retorted lew flapp angrily i can do ten times better if i want to  let us see you  iiim in no condition to go ahead just now remember i was punching the bag for an hour before rover got here  how can that be when all of us just came from the mess hall questioned larry  hes trying to sneak out of the trial said a voice in the rear of the crowd  ill sneak you roared lew flap in a rage i want you all to know that i aint afraid of dick rover or anybody else  do you want the trial to continue  questioned dick in an even tone  didnt i just say i was tired out but ill show you what i can do some time blustered lew flapp  oh all right  you neednt think youre kingpin of the punching bag went on the tall boy who had lost control of his temper because of the exhibition  thank you flapp what i think and what i dont think isnt any of your business  pooh ive heard about you and your two brothers dick rover they tell all sorts of stories about you but i dont believe the half of them  come come whats the use of quarreling put in larry pleasantly  im sure i dont want to quarrel answered dick he challenged me to punch the bag against him and i did so thats all  youre dead stuck on yourself rover went on lew flapp slangily you think youre the only toad in the puddle but you aint let me tell you that as soon as i heard about you i made up my mind i wouldnt knuckle under to you  this isnt right cried larry dick is my friend and let me say he never asks any cadet to knuckle under to him unless the cadet did something that wasnt on the level  thats true thats true came from half a dozen of the students dick rover is all right  so youre all turning against me eh burst out lew flapp fiercely his face growing dark with rage i was warned of this before i came here  who warned you asked tom who had just put in an appearance  a gentleman who used to teach here  what was his name questioned several  mr jasper grinder he said he had left because the rover boys tried to run everything  that old fraud cried larry  he left because he was kicked out came from another  and he is a criminal put in dick i can prove it if he wants me to do it  oh you can talk all you please growled lew flapp i know what i know and dont you forget it and what is more dick rover dont you expect me to knuckle under to you if you try that game youll get what you least expect and so speaking lew flapp forced his way out of the crowd and left the gymnasium  well of all the idiots i ever met came from tom he believes in meeting trouble threequarters of the way doesnt he  i think jasper grinder must have stuffed him full of stories about us said dick thats the way that rascally teacher expects to get square on captain putnamby ruining the reputation of the school  oh its mostly lew flapps fault put in a pupil who had been at the hall for some time the very first day flapp arrived he had a row with little tommy browne and knocked tommy down and a few days after that he had a fight with jack raymond and was pounding jack good when mr strong came up and made them run off in different directions hes a good deal of the same kind of a bully that dan baxter was  if thats the case he had better keep his distance said dick determinedly i dont want any quarrels but i despise a bully thoroughly  so do i  i wonder if this flipflap ever heard of dan baxter put in tom if he has he ought to profit by the example  hullo toms got a new name for flapp said one of the boys  isnt his name flipflap questioned tom innocently or is it flapjack  it will be flopdown if he ever gets into a fight with dick said larry and then followed a general laugh  i really dont want any more fights said dick when he could be heard i came back to putnam hall to dig in and learn something ive had enough adventures to last a lifetime if the others will only leave me alone ill leave them alone  but if they wont leave you alone dick asked george granbury  then they had better look out for themselves thats all was the reply of the eldest rover     chapter ix  settling down to study   dick meant what he said concerning coming back to putnam hall for the sake of learning something he felt that he had lost too much time from school already to lose more and he pitched in with a vigor that was indeed surprising  i dont see how you can do it said tom one day i cant to save my life yet tom was by no means a poor scholar and if he did not stand at the head of his class he was not far from it sam was also doing his best and all of this gratified captain putnam exceedingly  it shows they can work as well as play was what the captain told himself and he wrote anderson rover a long letter in which he praised the boys for their efforts  the boys fell into their places at the academy with a naturalness that was surprising when one considered the adventures that had but lately befallen them over and over again did they have to tell of their doings while on the pacific and as crusoes and some of the cadets never tired of listening to the stories a few including lew flapp did not believe them true but the majority did and that was enough for the rovers  dick was now advancing in years and he knew that before long he would either have to go into business or to college which he had not yet fully decided to tell the truth the thought of separating from his brothers was exceedingly distasteful to him  if i went to college id like you fellows to be with me he said one day to tom and sam there would be no fun in going alone  thats true answered tom but if you wanted us to go together youd have to wait for sam and me to catch up to you  well i might spend a year or so in traveling while i waited or sam and you might hurry up a little answered the eldest rover  during those days but little out of the ordinary happened dick took especial care to avoid lew flapp and the tall youth did not attempt to bother him it was soon learned that flapp was more of a braggart than anything else and then even some of the smaller boys grew less afraid of him  as already told it had been decided by captain putnam to have the cadets elect a new set of officers for the term and these officers were to be chosen in a somewhat different manner than heretofore  in the past said the captain when addressing the students on the subject you have been permitted to elect whoever you pleased to any office from major down this has occasionally resulted in someone being chosen who while he might be a good scholar and a good fellow generally was not exactly fitted to a military position on that account i have made a change next wednesday and thursday i shall hold a general examination in military matters only and the twenty pupils standing highest shall be the ones eligible for the positions of major captain and first and second lieutenants on these twenty names you shall vote as heretofore as we now have three companies here we shall want a major three captains and six lieutenants making a total of ten officers after that each company shall choose its own corporals and sergeants the company marching best on parade the following saturday shall have the honor of carrying the flag until after the annual encampment which this year will begin a month from today  at the mention of the annual encampment the cadets set up a cheer the outing was looked forward to with great interest  where are we going this year asked george granbury  its a secret i believe answered larry colby but i am pretty certain that we are going further away than usual  i hope we go into the mountains  or along some other lake where the fishing is fine put in tom  yes that would suit me too  the announcement concerning the examination in military matters also caused much talk and many of the cadets began at once to study military tactics harder than ever while drills became a pleasure instead of a hardship  im going to win some kind of a place said larry earnestly even a lieutenantship would be better than nothing  i am sure i am going to win put in william philander tubbs i am perfect in every kind of a drill  good for buttertub the perfect man sang out tom billy you ought to have your picture done in oil to hang alongside of washingtons in the library  dont you dare to call me buttertub or billy either you rude thing snorted tubbs and walked away in outraged dignity  dot examinations vos dickle me alretty said hans vot i dont know apoud dem military tictacs you dont know aint it i vill pe by der top of der class so kvick as neffer vos you pet yourself and he nodded his head as if he meant every word of it  dick rover said but little on the subject but he meant to win if he possibly could and so did tom sam felt he was as yet too young to become anything but a sergeant so he did not enter the competition with much vigor  lew flapp was not a particularly bright pupil but there was one thing outside of bag punching that he could do well and that was to drill he took to military tactics naturally and knew nearly every rule that the book of instructions contained  its going to be an easy matter to get into the chosen twenty the tall boy told himself but after that will the cadets elect me to one of those positions  he wanted to be major of the battalion but doubted if he could muster up sufficient friends to elect him  the examination in military matters came off on the afternoon of the following wednesday and on thursday morning captain putnam was very thorough in the work and made the pupils do certain things over and over again and write the answers to long lists of questions  it has given me great pleasure to conduct this examination he said on the day following it shows that the average in military knowledge is much higher than it was last term the following are the pupils who have passed given in the order of merit and then he read the list of names lew flapp came first dick rover next larry colby third george granbury fourth and the others including tom and fred garrison followed neither william philander tubbs nor hans mueller were mentioned  i dink me dere vos a mistake py dot said the german boy or else i vos know so much der captain didnt vont nobody to know apout it and this raised a laugh  its an outrage declared tubbs an outrage i shall request my parents to withdraw me from the institution and he wrote a letter home that very night but his parents refused to grant his request probably they knew of his shortcomings and thought a few terms at putnam hall would do him good  lew flapp was much pleased over the fact that he headed the list of those who had passed and nobody could blame him for this but he immediately made himself more obnoxious than ever by going around among the cadets and declaring that he was the only one to be elected to the office of major  its mine by right he said it wouldnt be fair to elect anybody else  but dick rover and larry colby stand almost as high said one of the cadets captain putnam said your average was 96 per cent while rovers average was 95 per cent and larry colbys was 94 per cent a difference of one or two per cent out of a possible hundred isnt much  i dont care retorted lew flapp i ought to be elected major and that is all there is to it  when dick was approached he had but little to say  i didnt expect to stand so high he declared i dont know that i care to be made major if i get to be a captain or a first lieutenant i shall be well content you know i was a second lieutenant once  my percentage is more than i expected said larry i really didnt think i was so well up in military matters now if the boys want me for an officer ill take whatever they give me  and that is what i say added george granbury  ditto myself put in tom even a second lieutenantship will not be declined by yours truly  after this there was a good deal of canvassing and log rolling as it is called lew flapp spent much money in secret treating boys when at the village and elsewhere by this means he gathered quite a band of followers around him  he is going to win by hook or by crook observed songbird powell he acts just like some of those politicians who dont care what they do so long as they win  i am not going to spend a cent on the boys declared dick i dont believe in buying votes  there was a strict rule at putnam hall that no cadet should touch liquor of any kind excepting when ordered by the doctor this rule had been broken in the past by dan baxter and a few others but the majority of the cadets respected the rule and kept it  but lew flapp had always been allowed to drink when at home and now he frequently drank on the sly when down to cedarville on these excursions he was generally joined by a weakminded boy named hurdy who was usually willing to do whatever flapp desired done  one day just before the election for officers was to come off lew flapp called ben hurdy to him  i am going down to cedarville this evening he said i want you to go along and invite jackson and pender and rockley  going to have a good time  asked ben hurdy  yes and you can tell the others so and tell them if they know some others who want a good time and can keep their mouths shut about it to bring them along but mind hurdy we want no blabbers  all right flapp ill get the right fellows answered ben hurdy and ran away to fulfill his questionable errand     chapter x  an adventure in cedarville   on the same evening that lew flapp and his particular cronies went down to cedarville to have a good time in a very questionable way dick rover and songbird powell also visited the village one to buy some handkerchiefs and the other to invest in a book he had ordered from the local bookseller and newsdealer  i heard that lew flapp was going to cedarville said powell while on the way do you know dick i dont like that fellow at all  neither do i songbird  it will make me sick if he is elected major of the battalion  nevertheless the cadets have a right to elect whom they please  i know that as well as you do but i cant stand flapps domineering ways and he is bound to grow worse if he is put in authority  as to that i shall not stand being bullied came from dick with flashing eyes ill let him go just so far and if he goes any further hell have to beware  both boys were excellent walkers and it was not long before cedarville was reached dick soon had the handkerchiefs wanted and then powell led the way to the bookstore to obtain a volume of humorous verses he had ordered the week previous  i dont see why you buy verses since you can make them up so readily said dick with a smile  oh i like to see what the other fellows are doing answered his friend  i saw some more of your cadets in town tonight said the bookseller while wrapping up the book  yes i believe half a dozen or more came down returned powell  having a special celebration tonight  not that i am aware of  why do you ask put in dick who knew the bookseller well  oh i only thought some of the boys were flying their kite pretty high thats all and the man closed one eye suggestively  where did you meet the fellows  wellerid rather not say rover you see i dont want to make trouble for anybody  are they in town yet  i presume they are but dont say i mentioned it please pleaded the bookseller  no more was said and having paid for the book powell walked out with dick behind him  if those fellows are drinking its a jolly shame declared dick when they were out of hearing what do you think about it songbird  exactly as you do dick  shall we hunt them up  what good will it do lew flapp wont listen to what you say and im sure i dont want to play the spy and report him  but what if he is leading some innocent students astray he has had half a dozen young chaps dangling at his heels lately  i know that there was a pause we might look into some of the places as we pass them  very slowly they walked up and down the main street of cedarville a thing easy to do since the stores extended only a distance of two blocks then they passed to a side street upon which two new places had recently been built  one of the new places was a butcher shop and this was dark and deserted next to it was a new resort known as mike sherrys palace and this was well lit up and evidently in full blast  if flapp is drinking he is evidently in this place remarked dick but i dont see anything of him he added after peering through the swinging doors  they tell me this sherry has a room upstairs also for drinking purposes returned powell maybe flapp and his friends are up there they wouldnt want to be seen in public you must remember  that is true but how do they get upstairsthrough the saloon  there may be a back way let us look  they walked around to the rear of the building and here found a door leading into a back hall but the door was locked  this is the way up i feel sure said dick somebody has locked the door as a safeguard  then im afraid well have to give it up  not yet songbird dick had been looking over toward the rear of the butcher shop see the painters are at work here and have left one of their ladders wonder if we cant move it over and put it up under one of those windows  the matter was talked over for a minute and then the two boys took hold of the long ladder and did as dick desired  this may be a wild goose chase was powells comment and if it is and mike sherry discovers us hell want us to explain maybe hell take us for burglars  you can keep shady if you want to songbird im going up and so speaking dick began to mount the ladder  the window under which the ladder had been placed was open from the top only and a half curtain over the lower portion hid what was beyond from view so in order to look over the curtain dick had to climb to the very top of the ladder and then brace his feet on the window sill  he could now hear voices quite plainly and presently heard lew flapp speak  im on the right track he called softly to powell they are in the room next to this one but the door between is wide open  shall i come up  suit yourself im going inside  as good as his word dick slipped over the top of the lowered window sash and an instant later stood in the room which was but dimly lit then he tiptoed his way behind a door and peeped into the room beyond  seven cadets were present including lew flapp ben hurdy and their particular cronies jackson pender and rockley the others were two young cadets named joe davis and harry moss  on the table in the center of the room stood a platter of chicken sandwiches and also several bottles containing beer and wine and a box of cigars evidently all of the crowd had been eating and drinking and now several were filling the apartment with tobacco smoke  come smoke up moss cried lew flapp shoving the box of cigars toward one of the younger cadets dont be afraid it wont kill you  thank you flapp but ii guess i wont tonight pleaded harry moss whose face was strangely flushed  why not  iidont feel well the drinking has made me feel sick  oh nonsense here take this cigar and smoke up it will brace your nerves and you davis have another glass of something to drink went on lew flapp pouring out a glassful and handing it to the one addressed  thank you flapp but i dont want any more answered joe davis he looked as ill at ease as did harry moss  dont you want to be sociable demanded the tall boy  it isnt that flapp ii guess ive had enough already  oh dont be a sissy davis here ill drink with you and then ill smoke a cigar with moss if you are going to be men you want to start right in eh rockley  thats right lew answered rockley as he lit a fresh cigar  what you need is another glass davis came from pender it will act as a bracer just try it and see  ii dont want to getget faltered davis  get what  intoxicatedreally i dont  who said anything about that demanded lew flapp in apparent anger dont be a fool one more glass wont hurt you here take it and he almost forced the liquor to joe daviss lips  but before he could accomplish his wicked design dick rover leaped quickly into the apartment and hurled the glass from the big boys hand  for shame flapp he cried for shame  and thats what i say too came from powell who was close behind dick  every cadet in the room was astonished and all leaped to their feet  whats up cried rockley  they have been spying on us came from jackson  talk about meanness this is the limit added pender  i want you to leave joe davis and harry moss alone went on dick as calmly as he could its an outrage to get them to drink and smoke against their will  are you two alone asked lew flapp glancing nervously over the newcomers shoulders  we are  what right had you to come here  well we took the right  then you enjoy playing the spy  no flapp said dick boldly but i do enjoy doing davis and moss a favor  what do you mean by that  i mean that i am going to stand by them so you shall not get them to drink any more or smoke  humph what right have you to interfere  maybe hes going to squeal to the captain put in jackson  if he does that ill punch his head for him roared lew flapp who had been drinking just enough to make him ugly and unreasonable  i did not come here to squeal on anybody answered dick  i know you didand im going to pound you well for it howled lew flapp and on the instant he leaped forward and aimed a savage blow with his fist at dicks head     chapter xi  a quarrel and its result   had the blow landed as intended dick rover would have received a bloody nose and might perhaps have lost one or two teeth  but dick was on the alert and he dodged to one side so the blow landed on songbird powells shoulder  see here what do you mean by that flapp demanded powell who was no weakling  i meant to hit rover was the answer  hands off flapp cried dick i didnt come here to fight but i can defend myself  well see roared the unreasonable tall boy and made another rush at dick but in a twinkling he found himself flat on the floor where he had been thrown with a suddenness that took away his breath  hi that aint fair put in rockley you let lew alone  i will when he leaves me alone retorted dick he turned to harry moss and joe davis do you want to stay here any longer  no answered both of the small cadets promptly  i didnt wish to come at all but ben hurdy urged it continued harry moss  and pender said it would do no harm added joe davis he said we were going to have nothing but sandwiches root beer and soda  look here davis you keep your mouth shut cried pender you knew exactly what to expect you know mike sherry dont run a temperance hotel he continued with a sneer  at these words joe davis grew pale  yes i know itnow and if i ever get out of it i shant come again  oh youre too good to live broke in jackson you ought to be laid away in a glass case for safe keeping  davis is all right and he has more brains than you jackson came from dick if you want to make a fool of yourself by drinking and smoking i shant stop you but you shant drag joe and harry into it against their will  thats the way to talk dick said powell let us clear out and take the youngsters with us  by this time lew flap had recovered from the flooring received and now he approached dick once more  do you want me to hammer you good rover he panted  as i said before flapp i didnt come here to fight but i can defend myself i propose to leave quietly and take harry and joe with me  supposing i wont let you leave  i dont think youll stop me  come flapp dont make a fool of yourself put in powell we didnt come here to quarrel but to urge all of the crowd to quit drinking you know its against the hall rules and regulations  and you intend to blab on us  not at all im not that kind and dick rover isnt either  i know how to fix em came from pender with a cunning look in his eye  how asked flapp and rockley in concert  our word is as good as anybodys if they say they found us at mike sherrys we can say that we found them there too for all we know they were drinking below before they came up  thats it interrupted lew flapp thinking he saw a way of implicating dick and powell mike sherry never lets anybody in his saloon without they drink something  its as plain as day came from rockley  they had all the liquor they wanted before they came up and now they want to stop our sport  your story might be believed were it not for one thing said dick trying to keep calm come on harry come joe and he whispered something into their ears  oh all right said harry moss and he retreated from the room speedily followed by joe davis  hi come back here you young scamps roared lew flapp and then he made for the doorway leading to the next room  not so fast flapp said dick and blocked the opening with his own form while powell stood directly behind  say fellows moss and davis are getting out of the window cried flapp in astonishment  thats the way rover and powell must have gotten in came from pender  exactly answered dick and that proves we didnt have to stop below for liquor he added triumphantly  look here i dont mean to let those fellows go yet blustered lew flapp let me get at them  not tonight flapp  scarcely had dick spoken when the tall boy flung himself forward the pair grappled and a moment later both went down with dick on top  hit him dick dont let him get the best of you cried powell and an instant later found himself tackled by pender and jackson for the moment ben hurdy who had remained silent during the most of the talk did nothing but then he ran forward and watching his chance kicked dick in the side of the head with his foot  the quarrel was now on in earnest and in the midst of the melee a burly waiter came rushing from below demanding to know what was the matter  a pair of spies shouted pender help us to give them a sound thrashing pat  sure oi will that was the answer and the waiter joined in the attack on dick and powell  it was with a mighty effort that powell managed to throw off his assailants then he leaped for the window reached the ladder and fairly slid to the ground  let up on dick rover he called when safe if you dont ill rouse the constable and have somebody locked up  confound him muttered rockley we had better dust out if he calls a constable the jig will be up  with a parting kick at dick he rushed down the back stairs to the resort and unlocked the door taking care that powell should not see him he darted into the gathering darkness  ben hurdy followed rockley and a moment later pender and jackson did the same then flapp came staggering down the stairs holding his nose from which the blood was flowing freely  lets get back to the hall as quickly as we can he said to the others and if we are examined we can deny everything  all right said pender but what did you do to rover  somebody kicked him and hes about half unconscious i left him to the tender mercies of pat the waiter and then lew flapp and his cronies hurried away on the road leading to putnam hall  dick might have defended himself but he was cruelly kicked several times and partly lost consciousness as already told in a dim uncertain manner he felt himself raised up and carried below and then put on the grass of the yard behind mike sherrys resort  when he was able to move he sat up and then arose to his feet slowly at that moment songbird powell discovered him powell had been up the ladder a second time to find the window closed and locked  dick he exclaimed are you badly hurt  ii dont know was the slow reply how are you  im all right  where are flapp and the rest  they ran away  and harry and joe  they are waiting for us down at the turn in the road  dick put his hand to his head to find a big lump directly back of the ear his ear was cut and there was a scratch on his chin  they didnt fight fair he explained when he felt a little stronger they kicked me when i was down  aided by powell he made his way to a pump and there bathed his head and procured a drink of water  while both boys were recovering from the adventure all the lights in mike sherrys resort were put out and every door and window was locked  he wants to steer clear of trouble said powell  i put the blame on lew flapp answered dick to my mind he is about as mean as any boy around here  of course we cant report him dick  no im no talebearer songbird but he ought to be punished  hell make a fine major if hes elected went on powell as he and dick started for the road leading to the academy  he shall never be elected if i can help it  i am with you on that  they found harry moss and joe davis walking slowly toward putnam hall joe seemed to feel all right now that he was out in the fresh evening air but harry complained of a strange sickness at the stomach  it was horrid of lew flapp to make us drink said the young cadet i told him i didnt want anything stronger than soda but he and pender made me take it  i think the walk will do you good harry answered dick kindly here take my arm and songbird can take your other arm  when the hall was reached they found that lew flapp and his cronies had already gone to bed dick took harry and joe to their dormitory and then rejoined powell  going to keep mum asked the latter  for the present answered the eldest rover but after this let us keep a sharp eye on flapp pender  company  and so it was agreed     chapter xii  the election for officers   on the following morning all of the cadets but harry moss appeared in the messroom  joe davis says harry is quite sick said powell to dick  thats too bad have they sent for a doctor  i dont know  when lew flapp heard that harry was sick he grew pale and during the morning session could scarcely fix his mind on his studies  i hope the little fool dont blab on us was his thought if he does there is no telling what the captain will do hes altogether too strict for comfort in some things  no doctor was sent for so it was finally agreed that harry moss was not as ill as had been supposed but the young cadet did not enter the schoolroom for all of that day  the sickness had frightened captain putnam who was not yet over the scarlet fever scare and he questioned harry thoroughly about what he had been doing and about what he had been eating and drinking  at first the young cadet did not dare to tell the truth but finally he blurted out that he had taken a glass of liquor against his will and it had turned his stomach in a most painful manner  where did you get the liquor demanded captain putnam sternly  iioh must i tell you sir  yes harry  ithat is lew flappoh sir i dont want to be a tattletale  did lew flapp give you the liquor answer me at once  yes sir he and another cadet named pender but sir i dont want to hurt them ii and here harry burst into tears  where was this  down in cedarville sir but iii shant say any more captain putnam and after that harry remained silent as it was plain to see that he was suffering captain putnam did not push the matter but he called lew flapp and pender into his private office and interviewed the unworthy pair for fully half an hour  to do such a thing is outrageous said the captain if i hear of it again i shall dismiss you from the hall at once  on the following morning one of the assistant teachers made a brief announcement that filled the entire school with curiosity  on next monday you are to have an election of officers for the term said he as you know twenty cadets were selected as worthy of being elected the list has since been cut down to eighteen lew flapp and augustus pender will not run  at this announcement dick and powell looked at each other significantly all of the other cadets looked around to find flapp and pender but the pair were absent nor did they put in an appearance at all until the next school session  the captain found it out in some way said dick to powell  shouldnt wonder if harry moss let the cat out of the bag was the answer  its queer about flapp and pender declared tom to his older brother do you know why they were dropped  yes tom but i dont want you to say anything about it  theres a report around that they were found cutting loose in the village put in sam  well as i said before i dont want to speak about it went on dick  a few of the boys dared to question flapp and pender but got no satisfaction  if i want to drop out i reckon i can do it growled flapp and that was as much as either he or his crony would say  with flapp out of the race there was considerable curiosity to know who would be elected for the term each set of cadets had their favorite candidates and the spirit of rivalry ran high but most of the candidates were goodnatured about it and especially dick and tom rover and george granbury fred garrison and larry colby  it had been decided that the cadets should first elect the major then the three captains and then the six lieutenants all to be selected according to the highest number of votes received  the voting began on monday immediately after breakfast captain putnam had slips passed around and on these each cadet wrote down his choice for major  i will read the result said the captain a few minutes after the poll was declared closed and he read as follows  whole number of votes cast96  lawrence colby has 67  the next highest student has 19  lawrence colby is declared elected major of the battalion for the present term including the annual encampment  hurrah for major larry colby cried tom and a rousing cheer followed while captain putnam strode over and shook hands with the newly elected commanding officer  i must congratulate you major colby he said warmly i must say i am well satisfied with the choice of our students  thank you sir answered larry and blushed in spite of himself  we will now proceed to the election of the three captains went on captain putnam remember the three standing highest on the list will be declared elected respectively  again slips were passed around and again the students marked down the names of their favorites three upon each slip  counting up the vote for captains took longer than that for major but soon the captain had his statement ready and the cadets listened in silence as he proceeded to make his announcement  whole number of votes cast 288  richard rover has 82  fred garrison has 67  mark romer has 59  the next highest student has 28  richard rover is elected captain of company a frederick garrison captain of company b and mark romer captain of company c for this term and during the annual encampment  hurrah for dick rover  hurrah for fred garrison and mark romer  and then the students cheered as wildly as ever while captain putnam once more offered his congratulations  captain rover my hand said larry coming up  thank you major colby answered dick and then both gave a grip that meant a good deal  we seem to be right in it observed the newly elected major  thats true answered dick  we shall now proceed to the election of six lieutenants went on captain putnam and once more the slips went the rounds and the boys did a lot of writing and speculating as each put down the six names required  this vote was rather a long one and captain putnam had two teachers help him in tabulating the result  this contest must make flapp feel sick whispered powell to dick while the students were taking it easy on the parade ground  well he brought it on himself was the brief reply  ill wager he tries to square up with us especially if he thinks we told on him  a bugle sounded calling the cadets together and once more captain putnam read the result  whole number of votes cast 576  john powell has 83  william merrick has 76  walter durham has 71  thomas rover has 68  george granbury has 51  raymond hollbrook has 43  the next highest cadet has 38  john powell is declared first lieutenant of company a william merrick first lieutenant of company b walter durham first lieutenant of company c thomas rover second lieutenant of company a george granbury second lieutenant of company b and raymond hollbrook second lieutenant of company c for this term and during the annual encampment  as this announcement was made there was a breathless silence then came a rousing cheer and the various successful ones were congratulated by the captain and their friends  well songbird it seems you are to be my first lieutenant said dick as he shook hands with powell that suits me firstrate  and i am to be second lieutenant said tom coming up with sam in the company as private this begins to look like a family affair  oh im going to make you fellows toe the mark now laughed dick no more skylarking if you please lieutenant rover  all right captain rover replied tom with a stiff salute that was sidesplitting  taking it all the way through the election was declared to be a popular success of course some of the defeated candidates were bitterly disappointed but they did their best to hide their true feelings william philander tubbs had declined to vote and lew flapp and gus pender had kept entirely out of sight while the voting was going on the two cronies took themselves to the gymnasium and there declared their hatred of dick rover  he is responsible for this muttered flapp clenching his fists and grating his teeth but for him i might at this minute be major of the battalion or one of the captains oh but wont i square up some day  what will you do questioned pender remember im just as down on him as you are  i dont know yet gus but ill do something  all right when you are ready to act let me know and ill help you all i can answered gus pender     chapter xiii  the fight at the boathouse   inside of a week the newlyelected officers felt perfectly at home in their various positions captain putnams idea of allowing only such cadets to be candidates as could fill the positions properly had borne good fruit and the battalion was now in better condition than ever before  contrary to general expectations larry colby as major proved a strict disciplinarian when on parade in the playground he was as chummy as ever but this was cast aside when he buckled on his sword and took command  this is as it should be was captain putnams comment and it is the same throughout life play is play and business is business  as a captain dick was equally successful and tom also made a good second lieutenant company a was speedily voted superior to the others when drilling and when on the march and consequently became the flag bearer for the term  this is splendid said dick when the announcement was made and then he went at company a to make the cadets drill and march better than ever  but though the students gave considerable time to military matters they were not permitted to neglect their regular studies and to their honor be it said that the three rover boys pitched in with a will  if i cant be an officer im going to be a high grade student anyway said sam and kept his word books suited him better than did military glories and soon he was at the top of his class in almost every branch of learning  many of the cadets were anxious to know where the annual encampment would be held but for the time being captain putnam declined to discuss the subject  we will talk about that as soon as lessons are done for the term said he  i dont believe well go to brierroot grove again said powell to dick a farmer has built a house up there and is clearing off the land as fast as he can  i wish we could go to some place at a distance returned dick all of us know this territory pretty well i like to visit new localities  so do i  during those days the rover boys received a letter from their father which proved unusually interesting anderson rover wrote in part as follows  you will be surprised to learn at this late day that something had been heard about arnold baxter a man who knows him fairly well met him a few nights ago in owego the news was telegraphed to me at once and the local police were informed but since that time nothing more has been seen or heard of the rascal the man said he was well dressed and had been stopping at a leading hotel evidently he is using what was stolen  in owego cried sam why that city isnt over fifty miles from here  this is his old stamping ground put in tom for all we know he may now be hanging around ithaca or cedarville  i dont believe hell come here said dick he is too well known  oh if only we could lay hands on him dick  wish we could tom but arnold baxter knows enough to keep out of our clutches  wonder if he knows what became of dan  like as not our story was in all the newspapers and they mentioned dan too  if that is so its more than likely he thinks we are responsible for dan being left behind on the island  im not going to bother my head about arnold baxter put in sam if he shows himself ill have him arrested thats all  one day after another slipped by and all of the boys continued to study with a will once they received long letters from dora stanhope and nellie and grace laning and sent long letters in return  wish the girls were back here said dick but this could not be as they had decided to remain in california for a while longer and the boys had to content themselves by sending the girls keepsakes by which to be remembered  on the friday afternoon preceding the final week of the term tom and sam walked down to the lake intending to go out in a boat for a short row  as they drew close to the boathouse they heard loud talking and then a cry of pain  please dont came in the voice of a young cadet please please dont flapp  but i just will you little imp came in lew flapps harsh voice ill teach you to play the sneak  but ii didnt mean to do anything really i didnt answered the other but i felt so sick and i  oh i know you moss for two pins id break your head for you and then came the sounds of several blows in quick succession  its flapp cried sam he is beating somebody most shamefully  its little harry moss returned tom leaping to the front the big bully why cant he take a fellow of his own size  he rushed around the corner of the boathouse and there beheld a scene that aroused his warmest indignation harry moss was crowded into a corner and over him stood lew flapp beating him with a heavy boat chain  flapp had just raised the chain for another blow when tom ran in and caught his arm  stop he cried you let harry moss alone  startled at the interruption lew flapp turned when he saw both tom and sam his face fell  what do you want here he asked sulkily  i want you to leave harry moss alone answered tom  oh rover please make him stop pleaded harry hes trying to kill me  no i aint retorted flapp im only giving him a whipping that he deserves  its an outrage to strike anybody with that chain said sam  you neednt put your oar in sam rover  but he just will and so will i said tom give me that chain and he tried to pull it from lew flapps hand  let go screamed lew flapp and began a struggle to keep the chain in his possession he struck at tom hitting him in the shoulder then tom got mad doubled up his fist and lew flapp received a blow in the left eye that made him see stars  oh he howled and dropped the chain tom rover ill get even for that mind that  what do you mean by attacking harry moss in such a disgraceful fashion  because hes a sneak and you know it  i know nothing of the kind  didnt he go and blab on me to captain putnam  about what  lew flapp paused and eyed tom and sam curiously  i reckon you know well enough he remarked slowly  but i dont know anything do you sam  not a thing so far as i know harry is all right  is he sneered flapp well i dont think so  what was the trouble about harry asked tom turning to the small boy  dont you say a word shouted lew flapp in alarm if tom and sam rover dont know already they neednt know at all so there  evidently you dont want harry to talk said sam suggestively  hes a sneak i tell you  and you are a big longlegged bully retorted tom for two pins id give you a good drubbing  humph do you think you can lick me blustered flapp who felt certain he could best tom at fisticuffs  i dont think soi know it said tom coolly  dont you fight him tom said sam in alarm he only wants to get you into trouble hed like nothing better than to see you lose your position as lieutenant  hes afraid sneered lew flapp all of you rover boys are mere bags of wind  i dont think you found dick a bag of wind flapp  yes i did now you clear out and let moss and me settle this affair between us  but this was not to be for harry moss was already at the doorway of the boathouse and now he retreated to a safe distance  if you hit tom rover or sam ill call mr strong cried the little cadet  dont you do it said tom i am not afraid of flapp  but hes so big tom  i dont care for that  tom had scarcely spoken when lew flapp watching his opportunity leaped forward and planted a blow on his chin that sent him staggering back into sams arms  now come on if you dare he cried  all right came from tom as he recovered and like a flash he flew at lew flapp before sam could do a thing to stop him blow after blow was taken and given by each of the cadets and tom was hit in the chest on the shoulder and in the left cheek in return flapp got one in the right eye that almost closed up that optic and then came a blow on the nose that made the blood spurt in all directions  good for you tom cried sam dancing around forgetful of what he had just said about his brother getting into trouble thats the time you did it now give him another  again the two boys went at it and once more tom was struck in the shoulder then lew flapp aimed for toms face but the latter ducked and recovering hit the big boy a heavy blow in the chin that made his teeth rattle and sent him staggering over the side of an upturned boat and flat on his back  hurrah cried sam that was almost a knockout tom now give him to understand  sam broke off short as a warning cry from harry moss reached his ears all eyes turned toward the doorway of the boathouse and a second later george strong the head teacher stepped into view     chapter xiv  getting ready for the encampment   for fully ten seconds after the head teacher appeared nobody spoke lew flapp arose slowly to his feet and bringing out his handkerchief applied it to his bleeding nose  what does this mean demanded george strong sternly  hehe pitched into me faltered flapp  that is hardly true returned tom hotly  both of you are well aware that it is against the rules of this school to fight went on the teacher  i know that mr strong answered tom but flapp struck me first  it isnt so cried the big boy i wasnt doing anything when rover came along and started to quarrel  my brother sam and harry moss can prove that flapp struck me first  that is true said harry moss while sam nodded  what was the quarrel about  i caught him here beating harry with this boat chain i told him to stop and then he pitched into me  is this true moss  yeyes sir butiididnt want to say anything about it sir  do you mean to say that flapp attacked you with that chain  harry moss was silent  answer me  he did but mr strong i dont want to make any complaint he and some of the others think im aa sneak already and now harry could hardly keep back his tears  i dont know why he attacked harry put in tom but i couldnt stand it and i took the chain away from him and told him to stop then he struck me and we pitched into each otherand i guess he got the worst of it added tom a bit triumphantly  hum flapp you may go and bathe your nose which i see is bleeding and then come to captain putnams office the others can come to the office with me  george strong led the way and tom sam and harry moss followed the teacher took along the boat chain and made harry show where he had been struck  captain putnam looked very grave when the affair was explained to him he questioned harry in private and learned that the attack was made by flapp because of what the young cadet had told about drinking and smoking  rover it was wrong to fight said the captain to tom but under the circumstances i am inclined to be lenient with you you can retire and this evening during off time i want you to write one hundred times the proverb beginning blessed are the peacemakers  yes sir said tom humbly he was glad to escape thus easily for he knew that the captain was very strict concerning fighting  a little later the others were sent off leaving lew flapp alone with captain putnam  flapp said the owner of the school with a hardness that made the big boys heart sink into his shoes i hardly know what to say to you your former conduct was mean enough and this appears to be on a level with it with such a heavy boat chain you might have injured moss very seriously do you want me to give you another chance or not  whwhat do you mean sir asked flapp much frightened  do you want to remain at putnam hall or shall i send you home in disgrace  ii dont want to go home said the big boy his father was a rough man and he knew that if his parent heard of this trouble he would make him pay dearly for it  i expect my pupils to be young gentlemen went on captain putnam this is an academy for the better class of boys only bad boys do not come here but are sent to the reformatory if i give you another chance will you promise to do better in the future  yes sir  very well then i will give you one more chance i believe you are somewhat behind in your arithmetic during the next four days you will remain in during all off time and apply yourself to such examples as your teacher gives you  yes sir  now you can go and remember i want to hear of no further fighting and no further molesting of harry moss  ill remember sir answered lew flapp meekly and then left the office and ran up to his dormitory to bathe his nose and put witchhazel on his hurts although outwardly humble he was in reality burning with rage  ill have to be careful in the future he told himself with clenched fists but ill get squareoh ill get square  hullo hurt yourself asked pender as he came in  yes i fell over a boat down at the boathouse answered the big boy  is that so i heard something of a fight and came up to see about it  oh i had a row with harry moss and tom rover but it didnt amount to much gus but say i just wish i could square up with dick rover and tom too  you said something like that before  im going to watch my chances  perhaps something will turn up during the encampment  yes i was thinking of that a fellow has more of a chance in camp than he does in school  it would be a fine thing to get dick rover into trouble and make him lose his position as captain went on gus pender  yes and make tom rover lose his position as lieutenant too added flapp  the term at putnam hall was now drawing to a close and it was not long before the semiannual examinations began all of the rovers worked hard over their papers and with more or less success sam came out at the top of his class while tom stood third in his grade and dick third in a still higher class the boys lost no time in sending the news home and received word back that not only their father but also uncle randolph and aunt martha were much pleased with the result  now well feel as if we deserve an outing said tom and sam and dick agreed with him  it was on the following morning that captain putnam made an announcement that filled all of the cadets with interest  you are all anxious i know to learn where the annual encampment is to be held said he during general assembly i am pleased to be able to announce that i have arranged to hold it at pine island a fine bit of ground located close to the south shore of bass lake the lake is situated about thirtyfive miles from here and we will make a twodays march to the spot stopping on the road over night in true soldier style weather permitting  hurrah burst out half a dozen cadets  three cheers for captain putnam called out tom and they were given with a will  i am told that the lake is an excellent one for fishing and for bathing and i have already engaged six boats which the cadets will be allowed to use from time to time  again there was a cheer and with it a loud clapping of hands  while in camp you may play such games as you please during off time and we will see if we cannot arrange for contests at swimming rowing and running and to the winners suitable prizes shall be given  hurrah for captain putnam came the cry once more and again a cheer arose  when will we start captain  wish we were going right now  we shall start monday morning was the answer tomorrow we will get out our tents and camping outfits and see that all are in firstclass order it is perhaps needless to add that during this encampment the officers will be in authority during all but off hours when myself and my assistants will take charge  this ended the talk and the students immediately broke up into little groups to discuss the good news  we ought to have just a boss good time while in camp cried sam think of living in tents and having nothing to do but fish and swim and make yourself comfortable  sam must be getting lazy returned dick but i grant you i think it will be firstclass myself  about the only pupil who did not relish going into camp was william philander tubbs  it will be beastly to live out in the open on the ground said tubbs supposing it should rain why well all get wet  never mind that will make you grow tubby said sam  sam rover how often must i tell you not to address me asahtubby my full name is  oh i know thatwilliam longfellow washington hezekiah philander salamander tubbs but you cant expect me to say that every time can you questioned sam innocently  mine cracious vos dot his hull name burst in hans mueller its apout as long as a freight drain aint it alretty  no my name is  perhaps i forgot one or two syllables interrupted sam very sorry im sure  i said my name  i know you said it half a dozen times billy but you see life is so very short and time so precious  i meant to say  sorry billy but i cant wait to hear it all cried sam and ran away  he iserextremely rude murmured tubbs  put dots a long name aint it said hans i couldnt remember dot no more as i can remember der names of all der kings py england alretty  oh i am disgusted sighed william philander and started to walk away  vot is you disgusted apout mr dubbs  because they wont call me by my proper name  do da call you by your imbrober name asked hans innocently  eh  i said do da call you py your imbrober name repeated the german youth  oh dont talk to me howled tubbs and walked away more disconcerted than ever  dot fellow vas so sharp like a pox of bebber aint it sighed hans to himself  the preparations for the annual encampment went forward rapidly all of the outfit was inspected with care and found to be in good order each cadet was provided with a blanket and a knapsack full of extra underclothing and other necessary things the captain had already engaged three big wagons to carry the tents poles and cooking utensils including several camp stoves and from another quarter cots were to be sent to the camp direct so that the cadets would not be compelled to lie upon the ground  now i guess everything is ready said dick late saturday evening  sunday was a day of rest for the most part in the morning the majority of the students marched to church under the directions of the captain and mr strong and part of the afternoon was spent in writing letters to the folks at home lights out sounded half an hour earlier than usual so that the cadets might get a good sleep before starting out on the two days march     chapter xv  on the march to camp   rattattat rattattat rattattat  the cadets got their first taste of the annual encampment early in the morning when instead of hearing the familiar bell they were awakened by the rolling of the drum  time to get up everybody cried sam flinging the covers from him it wont do to be late this morning  that is true private rover came solemnly from dick i will fine any soldier of my command who is behind time  thank you captain rover ill remember that came from one of the other cadets and how is lieutenant rover this morning  fine as silk came from tom who was already splashing in the cold water of his washbowl ill bet a big red apple against a turnip that im down first and he began to don his uniform with remarkable rapidity  all of the students were soon below and then the various companies marched into the messroom for their last breakfast at the hall for some time to come  i see the wagons have already left said sam  yes the drivers are to get the camp in readiness for tonight answered his big brother  knowing that they had a long march before them the majority of the cadets ate a hearty breakfast mrs green the housekeeper was sorry to have them leave and had prepared an unusually fine repast  mrs green is just all right declared tom i move we give her a vote of thanks and this was later on done much to the old ladys delight  it was a perfect day the sun shone brightly and there was just enough breeze to keep the atmosphere fresh and exhilarating captain putnam was to accompany the students on horseback and the teachers had already gone off with the wagons  battalion attention shouted major larry colby when the cadets were assembled on the parade ground and the order was immediately obeyed  shoulder arms was the next order given and up went every gun in unison the movement was so pretty that the spectators who had gathered to see the boys march off clapped their hands in approval  forwardmarch came next and the drums and fifes struck up and away went the cadets company front toward the road  by column of fours was the next command and captain dick rover turned to his company  by column of fours he repeated and company a broke up into four abreast and turned into the road leading off in the direction of pine island the other companies also broke up and in a minute more the cadets were really and truly on the march for the camp  the drums and fifes sounded well on that bracing morning air and quite a crowd of boys and not a few girls followed the students over the first of the hills back of putnam hall but here the crowd dropped gradually away until the young soldiers had the country road practically to themselves  for a full mile the cadets were made to keep in step then came the order route step and they moved forward as pleased them keeping together however by companies the route step is given that one may take the step that is most natural to him be it longer or shorter than the regulation step  farms were rather scattered in that neighborhood but occasionally they passed country homes when all the folks would rush forth to learn what the drumming and fifing meant  they are the putnam hall cadets said one farm woman how neat they look and how nicely they march  puts me in mind o war times mirandy said her husband dont you remember how the boys marched away in them days  indeed i do ira answered the woman but that was real while this is only for fun  well i reckon some o those lads would make putty good soldiers were they put to it they handle their guns like veterans  the cadets marched until ten oclock and then stopped for a brief rest near a fine hillside spring where all procured a drink then they moved forward again until noon when they reached a small village where dinner already awaited them  we have covered twelve miles said captain putnam eight more and the days march will be over  the cadets were glad enough to eat their dinner and take it easy on the porch of the old country hotel at which they had stopped  imagine us marching off to war observed sam how would you like it tom  oh i dont think i would complain was the answer anything for a bit of excitement  the days march was completed long before sundown and the battalion came to a halt in an open field through which flowed a shaded brook  the tents were at hand and the students lost no time in putting up the shelters  food was supplied for the occasion by a farmer living near for it was not deemed advisable to unload the cook stoves and build the necessary fires  the farmer gave the students permission to visit his apple orchard and this the majority did returning to the temporary camp with their pockets fairly bulging with apples  the weather remained clear and warm so the first night in the open proved very agreeable a campfire was lit just for the look of things and around this the cadets gathered telling stories and singing songs until it was time to turn in  sleeping in a tent just suited the rover boys and none of them awoke until sunrise soon the whole camp was astir and each cadet took a good washing up at the brook breakfast was supplied by the farmer and by nine oclock the column was once again in motion on its way to pine island  dot sleeping out in der air vos a funny dings said hans mueller to sam i vake up der middle of der night in und find a pig mouskeeter mine toe on alretty  be thankful that it wasnt something worse hans said sam what would you do if you woke up and saw a big black bear standing beside your cot  i dink i cofer mine head kvick sammy  but the bear might chew the cover up  den i vos rund for mine life und holler like sixty  well you want to keep your eyes open for bears added sam thinking he scented fun ahead  how vos i going to keep mine eyes oben of i go to sleep tell me dot  youll have to figure that out yourself hansy old boy and here the talk had to come to an end  by the middle of the afternoon they came in sight of bass lake a beautiful sheet of water about two miles and a half long by nearly half a mile wide close to the south shore lay pine island so called because it was covered in spots with tall pine trees between the main shore and pine island were two smaller islands and there were low wooden bridges from one to the other connecting the big island with the mainland  the wagons had already gone over the bridges to the spot selected for the camp and now the battalion marched across from island to island under low arching trees and over ground covered with fallen leaves and moss  what a grand spot for a camp  it was dick who uttered the words when the final halt was made his words were true and his fellow students agreed with him that captain putnam could not have made a better selection  there was an open space nearly an acre in extent covered with short grass and sloping slightly toward the lake at the waters edge was a small wooden dock where the boats were tied up and next to this a sandy strip excellent for bathing purposes back of the open space was a fine grove of trees to which the students could retire when the sun became too hot for them more trees lined the north shore some hanging out far over the water making ideal spots for reading or fishing there were beautiful walks through the woods and in the center of the island was a rocky hill from the top of which one could obtain a view of the country for several miles around  captain putnam insisted upon it that the camp be laid out in true military fashion and two students who knew a little about civil engineering put down the necessary stakes there was a street for each company with a tent for the captain and his lieutenants at the head each tent was of the wall pattern and large enough to accommodate four soldiers that the flooring of the tent might be kept dry around each a trench was dug by which the water could run off when it rained on the bottom pine boughs were strewn giving a delicious smell to the interior  this smell of pine is very good for a cold in the head said major larry to dick my sister always uses a pillow filled with pine needles for that purpose  the students worked hard that evening getting their tents ready for occupancy and as a consequence all were glad to retire when the proper time came captain putnam had expected that there would be some skylarking but he was mistaken that was to come laterwhen the lads felt more rested     chapter xvi  the first day on pine island   can anybody tell me where theerlooking glass is  it was william philander tubbs who asked the question he stood in the middle of one of the tents gazing helplessly about him  beastly way to live really now it is he continued how is a fellow to arrange his toilet without a glass  better run down to the lake and look into the water suggested sam who occupied a cot in the tent  look into the water beastly murmured tubbs really now this isnt like home is it he continued  it suits me well enough went on sam leaping up and beginning to dress youll get used to it before long  never my dear boy never  as tubbs spoke he began to put on his coat but failed to get either of his hands further than the elbows of the sleeves  whats the matter with this coat he ejaculated well i declare  whats up now asked another cadet  somebody has gone and sewed up the sleeves  there was a roar of laughter at this  mustnt mind a little thing like that said sam and he sat down on the edge of his cot to put on his shoes great scott whats this  he had forced his foot into one shoe and now withdrew it covered with soft soap  haw haw roared tubbs rather fancy the laugh is on you now rover  thats a fact muttered sam and began to clean out the shoe as quickly as he could  several other small jokes had been played showing that the cadets were tuning up as major larry expressed it  i guess ill have my hands full before the week is out he said to dick in private keeping order will be no fool of a job  well you must remember that you liked to have your fling too when you were a private major answered the captain of company a  the cooking detail were already preparing breakfast and the aroma of hot coffee floated throughout the camp immediately after rollcall breakfast was served of fruit fish eggs bread and coffee and the cadets pitched in with a will  gives one an appetite to live out in the open said lieutenant tom  as if you didnt carry your appetite with you wherever you go grinned sam  silence private rover or ill fine you half a days pay flung back tom with a similar grin  my but we are some pumpkins went on sam squaring his shoulders wonder how soon well get to be a general  perhaps at the next general election suggested george granbury  lieutenant granbury is fined a peanut for punning said tom severely dont do it again and the fine will be remitted  thats a fine way to do murmured george and then sam shied a tin plate at him  as soon as the meal was over there was a drill lasting half an hour and then the cadets were permitted to do as they pleased until noon some went boating some fishing while others took a swim or simply knocked around as sam expressed it  i shouldnt mind a swim said tom who will go in with me  a dozen cadets were willing including dick larry and fred garrison as it was off time larry even though major did not feel it necessary to stand on his dignity  im just going to be as ive always been he told the others if i cant be that i dont want to be major  several tents had been erected close to the waters edge where the cadets might undress and don their bathing suits tom was the first ready and with a run he plunged into the lake headfirst  its glorious he shouted as he came up and shook the water from his head worth a dollar a minute come on in and they came one after another without loss of more time the water was slightly cool but the students at putnam hall were required to take cold baths weekly so they did not mind the temperature laughing and shouting gleefully they dove around in all directions and then tom suggested a race  just the thing said another cadet where shall we race to  over to yonder rock and back answered tom line up everybody a stale biscuit to the winner and a sour cream puff for the last man all ready  there was a pause  start yelled tom and made a wild splash that sent the water flying in all directions  a race a race shouted one of the students on the shore and his cry soon brought a score or more of the others to the spot  i think tom rover will win that race  ill bet on major larry  fred garrison is ahead hes the best swimmer in the school  he cant swim as well as dick rover  ill bet jackson wins came from lew flapp who was in the crowd on the beach jackson it will be remembered was one of his particular cronies  jackson cant swim against dick rover came from songbird powell who had hardly spoken to flapp since the row at mike sherrys resort  ill bet you a dollar he beats rover replied the tall boy in a low tone  i dont bet flapp  youre afraid to bet sneered the tall boy  this statement angered powell and he quickly dove into his pocket and pulled out the sum mentioned  this is the time you lose flapp he said quietly  another student was made stakeholder and each boy passed over his money  by this time the race was well underway tom was still in the lead but jackson was close behind him with larry colby third and dick fourth  go it tom you are sure to win shouted one of his friends  dont know about that tom returned pantingly guess i started too hard and soon he began to drop behind  jackson is ahead was the next cry  major colby is a close second  that is true but dick rover is crawling up  so the cries went on until the big rock that was the turning point was gained  jackson touched the rock first several seconds before either larry or dick came up it certainly looked as if lew flapps crony had a good chance of winning  told you he would win said flapp to powell  the race isnt over yet answered songbird briefly  humph do you think dick rover can catch jackson when he is five yards behind  not quite as much as that flapp and he is gradually crawling up  he wont make it i tell you  perhaps he will  ill bet you five to one that he wont insisted the big boy  i wont bet any more  youre afraid sneered flapp  again powell went down into his pocket and drew forth another dollar  there you are he said to the stakeholder  lew flapp had not expected this but he quickly covered the one dollar with a five feeling sure he was going to win  youll never see your two dollars again powell he said  perhaps youll never see your six again answered songbird and moved away to watch the race from another point along the island shore  jackson was certainly swimming well although the terrific strain was beginning to tell upon him  go it jackson roared lew flapp go it old moneybags  moneybags was a signal among many of the cadets signifying that the speaker had bet money on the result betting at the academy was strictly prohibited but wagers were often made on the sly  hearing this cry jackson renewed his struggles and for a few seconds held his lead  but now dick rover was crawling up inch by inch he had passed tom who was left hopelessly in the rear and now he was pressing larry  the major and the captain are tie  see captain rover is crawling ahead  swim jackson swim yelled lew flapp frantically you must win and pender took up the call and so did rockley  again jackson did his best the finish of the race was now but twenty yards off  go in and win dick came from larry colby im about used up and he let dick go ahead  dick was almost as fresh as at the start and slowly but surely he kept gaining upon jackson until the two were not over two yards apart  hurrah captain rover is crawling up  dont give up jackson you can win out yet screamed lew flapp  go it dick yelled sam go it i say the race is yours  cheered by the last cry dick increased his stroke and in a second more he was alongside of jackson  the latter made a side kick intending to catch dick in the stomach but the eldest rover was wise enough to keep out of his opponents reach  the kick made jackson lose ground and like a flash dick passed him  dick rover is ahead  see jackson is played out he can hardly take another stroke  major colby is crawling up see he is passing jackson  and here comes tom rover too  wake up tom cried sam you can beat jackson yet  at this cry tom did wake up and seeing jackson floundering around put on a final spurt and passed him  dick rover has won the race  and major colby is second and tom rover third  poor jackson wasnt in it after all     chapter xvii  the enemy plot mischief   the most disgusted cadet on pine island was lew flapp and when jackson walked out of the water and entered one of the bathtents he followed his crony with a face full of bitterness  why didnt you try to keep up and win out he asked bitterly while jackson was dressing  i did try but rover came up like a steam engine  you seemed to play out all in a minute  and that is just what i did do the pace was too hot for me and i just about collapsed those fellows are good swimmers no two ways about that  bah i could have beaten them with ease  id like to see you do it  do you know i lost six dollars on that race went on flapp after a pause  who won the money  songbird powell  how did you come to put up such an odd figure lew  i bet a dollar even first and then when i felt certain you would win i gave him odds of five to one i was a chump  well i did my besthonestly i did returned jackson who hated to have his crony lose  i ought to make you pay me back  id do it if i had the money said jackson he rarely had money in his pocket spending everything as fast as received  well that is one more we owe that crowd observed flapp with increased bitterness  when jackson was dressed he and flapp took themselves to another part of the camp and there met pender rockley and ben hurdy  let us take a walk said jackson i am sick of staying around where the others can stare at me  come with me put in pender i have found something i want to show you  a gold mine perhaps said flapp i need one just now betting on jackson nearly cleaned me out  its no gold mine but it may prove useful to us answered the other cadet  the crowd started off and pender led the way through the woods and partly around the rocky hill in the center of the island  i ran into it quite by accident he said youd never suspect it was there unless you knew of it  knew of what asked rockley what sort of a mystery are you running us into now  just wait and see  pender stepped from the path they had been pursuing and pushed aside some overhanging bushes beyond was a small clearing backed up by a high rocky wall in the wall was an opening blocked up by a heavy door secured by a rusty iron chain that was passed through a ring in the rocks  well this is certainly odd exclaimed flapp what kind of a place is it  its a den of some sort said hurdy maybe some counterfeiters belong here  bosh you talk as if you were in a dime novel came from jackson more than likely some old hermit lived here when some men get queer in the head they come to just such a spot as this to end their days they hate the sight of other human beings  i reckon it is a hermits den said pender but if so the hermit left it years ago for everything inside is covered with dust and cobwebs and mildew  pender walked up to the stout wooden door unfastened the iron chain and threw the barrier back  one after the other the boys entered the opening beyond at first they could see but little but gradually their eyes became accustomed to the gloom and they made out a rocky chamber about twelve feet wide and running back in irregular shape for a hundred feet or more at some points the ceiling was so low they had to stoop while elsewhere it was far above their reach the flooring was fairly level with rock in some places and hard dirt in others  the opening was rudely furnished with a heavy table and a bench and close to one wall was a box bed still filled with pine boughs on a big wooden hook hung a mans coat so decayed that it began to fall apart when they touched it the table contained several tin cups and plates all rust eaten  this is certainly a curious find said flapp how did you happen to hit it gus  i was exploring the cliff above when i happened to slip and fall into the bushes just in front of the door i was shook up but not hurt and when i got up i saw the door and wondered what it meant then i looked inside and after that went back to camp to tell you fellows about it  it will make a dandy place for secret meetings suggested rockley we can come here and do what we please  just what i thought said pender we can smuggle no end of good things here from the nearest village and come whenever we have our off time  perhaps we can do more than that said flapp struck with a sudden idea  what asked the others  ill tell you some other time its a great find continued the tall boy  in the meantime those left at the camp had surrounded dick and were congratulating him on his victory  i knew you would win said powell when the excitement was over i bet with lew flapp on the result garling was stakeholder  what did you win songbird  six dollars  gracious you went in pretty deep  flapp called me a coward when i told him i didnt want to bet so i had to take him up went on songbird had it been anybody else i might have given the money back but i wont give it back to that bully  its against the rules to bet songbird  but you are not going to tell on me are you  you know me better than to ask the question just the same i am sorry you bet said dick  im going to treat the boys as soon as i get the chance went on powell six dollars will buy a whole lot of ice cream and cake not to mention soda and candy and peanuts and then he began to hum to himself     peanuts and candy and raspberry ice     chocolate cake and all thats nice     evry student can come if he will     and evry student can eat his fill  i believe youd sing at a funeral said dick laughing  i wouldnt sing at my own funeral answered powell and stalked off humming as gayly as ever  the remainder of the day passed quietly enough although by the whispering in various tents it was easy to see that something unusual was in the air  hazing tonight as sure as guns said major larry to one of the officers  shall we arrest the hazers asked the officer with a twinkle in his eye  you must obey orders answered the youthful major noncommittally since he had given no orders on the subject  he could well remember his first year in camp when he had been dragged from his cot at midnight almost stripped and thrown into a brook of icy spring water and then made to run over a rough road in his bare feet for half a mile just to warm up as the hazers told him it was rough sport not to be approved but boys will be boys and it is practically impossible to stop hazing even in the highest of our institutions of learning  it was poor hans mueller who was the first to suffer that night in the midst of the darkness for there was no moon hans found himself suddenly aroused from his slumbers by being dragged out of his cot by the feet  shtop he began when a hand was thrust over his mouth then he was raised up by six cadets shoved out of the back of the tent and carried away to the grove in the rear of the camp the party had to pass two sentries but the sentries were evidently posted for they appeared to see nothing wrong  hans was not allowed to speak until he was out of hearing distance of the camp then he was dumped on the ground with a dull thud  mine cracious vot does dis mean annahow he demanded as he struggled to his feet does you vants to kill me alretty drowing me aroundt like a log of vood hey  there was no answer and now he looked at the cadets to discover that each wore a black mask with a hood from which two black horns protruded  who you vos alretty he spluttered staring in openmouthed amazement at the party you vos all look like der oldt boy aint it i guess i go me back to der camp kvick and he started to run  hans did not get far for a foot send him sprawling and by the time he was again on his feet four masked cadets had him by the hands and arms so that he could not get away he started to yell when of a sudden somebody threw a handful of dry flour into his wide open mouth  wuog he gasped wuog doyouwantsto choke me alretty and then he started to sneeze as some of the flour entered his nose  there was a moment of silence and then one of the masked figures advanced slowly  hans mueller are you prepared to meet your doom was the question put in a deep bass voice  doom vots dot asked the german boy slightly frightened  are you prepared to die  die not by a jugful i aint you let me go  are you prepared to become a fullfledged member of the order of black skulls  not much i tont belong to noddings gasped hans  then you must prepare to meet your fate away with him fellows to his doom  before hans could resist he was caught up once again one of the cadets had brought with him a large blanket and into this the german youth was thrown then the others caught the blanket around the edges  stop roared hans and tried to climb out of the blanket but before he could manage it the thing was given a toss and up he went high into the air  oh mine cracious he gasped and came down with a crash to go up again an instant later then up and down went the boy turning over and over until he was all but dazed  stop murder fire robbers he roared let me owid kvick i vos turning outsides in alretty oh stop vont you blease  will you join the order of black skulls he was asked again  yah yah anydings so long as you lets me town kvick  and you will not breathe a word about what has taken place here  i say me noddings upon my honor aint it  then let him go fellows and a moment later hans was lowered  now you are one of us said another student and handed him a mask skullcap and pair of horns the latter made of stuffed black cloth do you promise to help us  anydings vot you vonts  then come with us and dont dare to open your mouth     chapter xviii  hazers at work   william philander tubbs was dreaming of a fashionable dance he had once enjoyed when he suddenly found himself bound and gagged and being carried he knew not where  this is awful he thought what in the world does it mean  then he remembered that some of the cadets had spoken about hazing and the cold perspiration came out on his forehead  the gag in his mouth was made of nothing more than a knot in a clean towel but it worried him a good deal and he was afraid he would be choked to death by it but nothing of the sort happened and soon the gag was removed  what does this mean he asked as many cadets had done before him  he received no answer and tried to break away from his tormentors but their hold on him could not be shaken and before he was set down he found himself well out of sight and hearing of camp putnam as the spot had been named  this is a beastly shame he murmured why do you dare to break into my nights rest in this fashion  he had heard of the mysterious society of black skulls before but so far had never been hazed by the members he looked curiously at the masked cadets wondering if he could recognize any of them  are you prepared to meet your doom he was asked  i am prepared to go back to my tent he answered  away with him was the cry  where are you going to take me he asked anxiously  there was no reply but in a twinkling his hands were caught and bound tightly behind him and a bag was thrust over his head and fastened around his throat the bag was so thick that he could not see a thing before him  let him take the cold water cure said a voice and he was forced to move forward  its rather deep there whispered a voice just loud enough for him to hear  not over his waist whispered another voice  what its twice over his head was the answer i tested the water this afternoon  never mind hes got to take the test anyway  now tubbs was by no means a good swimmer and the idea of being thrown into the water with his hands tied behind him and his head in a sack was frightful in the extreme  lelet me go he whined let me go i say  forward with him was the heartless reply and he was pushed on until he suddenly found himself in water up to his ankles  stop stop he cried in a muffled voice stop i dont want to drown  will you obey your superiors  yes yesanything  will you join the order of black skulls  anything i told you only dont let me drown cried the frightened william philander  and will you promise to keep mum about what has happened here tonight  yes yes  very well you shall not be allowed to drown but you must take the plunge  oh dear me i cant  forward and be lively about it we will fish you out with a crab net  but ii cant swim with my hands tied behind me chattered poor tubbs  yes you can forward now ha fellows he will not go jab him with the pitchfork  at this a student stepped behind tubbs and pricked his back with a pin  the fashionable youth let out a yell of terror and then certain that he was about to take an awful plunge into some deep part of the lake made a desperate leap forward  a wild shriek of laughter rang out as tubbs made the leap he had jumped across a narrow brook not six inches deep and landed sprawling on the grass beyond  you are now initiated said one of the masked cadets when the laughter had somewhat died away and at once tubbs hands were untied and the bag was taken from his head  well i never he murmured as he gazed in amazement at the brook thought it was the lake front sure  as you are now one of us tubbs you must wear these said a cadet and furnished the fashionable youth with a mask cap and pair of horns  we have now disposed of number two said another cadet what of number three  number three must  at that moment a gunshot rang out on the still night air  hullo something is wrong cried one of the hazers in quick alarm  there goes the drum fellows came in the unmistakable voice of sam rover weve got to hustle back to camp or well be exposed  right you are came from songbird powell come fellows and mind you dont let anybody see the masks and other things  and away they scooted under the trees and then along a row of bushes running fairly close to the first line of tents in the meantime the drum continued to roll and the whole camp was astir captain putnam himself was out and was soon followed by major larry and captain fred garrison dick rover knew what was up and took his time about showing himself since he did not wish any of the hazers to be captured  call the roll said major larry after making a round of the company streets but he himself was in no particular hurry  almost out of breath with running the hazers came into camp accompanied by hans and tubbs masks caps and horns were pushed out of sight under cots and then all sallied forth to join their various commands calling the roll was already in progress  all present or accounted for came the declaration five minutes later  all present eh mused captain putnam thats queer who fired that gun  private jackson  i will interview jackson said the master of the school and he ordered jackson to his private tent  what made you raise the alarm jackson he questioned sharply  i thought some of the cadets were out of camp sir was the answer  did you see them go  not exactly sir but i thought i saw three or four of them sneaking along near the woods  humph you should be sure of what you are doing jackson it is not commendable to arouse the whole camp at midnight for nothing  well i thought i was sure insisted the crestfallen cadet he knew for a certainty that some of the cadets had been out but saw no way to prove it  in the future be more careful while on guard duty said captain putnam coldly and there the subject was dropped  who fired that shot asked sam on the morning following the hazing  jackson replied a cadet named gilson who had been one of the hazers  the sneak murmured the youngest rover  thats what i say rover  guess he did it to get square for losing that swimming race put in another of the hazers  more than likely we ought to square up with him for it  thats the talk  vats der madder mit tossing him a blanket up asked hans earnestly  think thats a good way to get square eh hans laughed sam  dots der vorst bunishments vot i know of said the german boy with deep conviction makes you feel like you vos going to preak abard alretty kvick  all of the boys knew that it would not do to try any more hazing for the next few nights even if the guards gave no alarm captain putnam or one of the teachers might be on the watch to catch them  on the following day it rained and the majority of the cadets were glad enough to remain under shelter a few went bathing or fishing and the latter brought in quite a respectable mess of fish even in fishing the boys were rivals and a new tin cup was voted to the cadet bringing in the string that weighed the most  the rain began about ten oclock and by noon the water was coming down in torrents  this is beautiful remarked tom as he looked at the puddle in the companys street  we ought to have dug another ditch to let that water run off remarked dick  well nobody wants to go out now and dig  that is true  instead of abating the rain became more violent as the afternoon advanced  this looks as if we were going to have some wind remarked major larry with a doubtful shake of his head  i hope it doesnt blow too heavily said captain putnam  dont you think i had better caution the fellows to pin down their tents extra hard  it would do no harm major colby  then ill do it said larry and issued the order without delay some of the cadets grumbled at being driven out into the wet but the majority knew they were doing the work for their own good and went at it without a murmur  at about sundown the wind fell and after supper it was as calm as it had been before the storm started  told you there wasnt any use of getting wet pounding down stakes growled lew flapp he had done his work in a slipshod fashion staying out but a minute or two for that purpose  it still rained so building campfires was out of the question this being so the cadets turned in early glad to seek the shelter of their cots and their warm blankets  an hour went by when of a sudden the rain increased once more then came a rush of wind that shook all of the tents violently  we are not out of it yet it would seem said dick as he sat up on his cot to listen to the flapping of the canvas in the company street  he had hardly spoken when another gust of wind tore down on the camp there was a ripping of cloth and a crashing of poles and then a cry for help sounded from several places at once     chapter xix  a storm in camp   say fellows are we all going up in a balloon cried sam rover as he rolled off his cot in a great hurry  one whole side of the tent was loose and the structure was in danger of tumbling down on the inmates heads  help came from the next tent im being smothered  thats lew flapp said a cadet whats up now flapp he called out  no answer came back and now canvases could be heard ripping in all directions  fasten down the pegs came the order fasten them down quick  the cadets were already at work and sam and his tentmates set at their task with a will realizing that every moment was precious while one student held the peg upright the other would pound it down into the wet ground with a hammer or the back of a spade  the confounded pegs wont hold cried out one cadet there she goes and the next instant the tent went flying skyward to land on another tent some distance away  it was still raining cats dogs and hammer handles as tom rover expressed it all was dark the only light being that given forth by the lantern which had not been blown out occasionally came a flash of lightning followed by the distant rolling of thunder  this is one of the real comforts of camp life said songbird powell sarcastically so much nicer than being under the roof of the hall you know  never mind songbird you need a washing off at least once a year replied a fellow sufferer  a minute later came another yell from lew flapp he and his tentmates had tried in vain to hold down their canvas now it went up with a rush one of the peg ropes caught around flapps leg and he was dragged over the wet ground with his head splashing into every pool of water that he passed  help me ill be killed roared the tall youth  the tent was blowing along the company street and half a dozen cadets ran to the rescue tom with them some leaped on the canvas while others held flapp then the rope was cut with a knife  whawhat a fearful wind groaned the tall boy when he could speak this is the worst storm i ever saw  oh but im sorry i ever came to camp groaned william philander tubbs im so wet the water is actually running out of my shoetops  tont said a vord came from hans i dink me i half a rifer floating mine packpone town alretty of dis keeps on much longer der whole camp vos in der schwim aint it  i reckon were in the swim already broke in sam some of us had better bring the rowboats up  the high wind lasted for fully half an hour and during that time six of the tents were literally blown to ribbons while many others suffered to a lesser extent a quarter of the shelters laid flat in the mud and nothing could be done with these until the wind went down  its the worst blow i have seen since we have held our encampments was captain putnams comment and he and the teachers went around with lanterns to aid the students as much as they could  by three oclock in the morning the storm was over and the stars began to peep forth from behind the clouds as tired as they were the cadets had to set to work to put up the tents and arrange their cots as best they could campfires were lit in half a dozen places and the students huddled around these to dry themselves and get warm  i guess this is a touch of real army life said dick and i must say i dont like it overly much  well have to make the best of it dick answered tom who had come over to see how his brother was getting along  how is sam  oh hes all right although as wet as any of us  this storm reminds me of the one we experienced when in the jungles of africa went on the eldest rover do you remember how it blew tom  indeed i do was the answer as toms mind went back to that thrilling experience as related in the rover boys in the jungle  on the following day the cadets were glad enough to remain in camp cleaning out their tents and drying the things that had become wet but the storm was a thing of the past and the sun shone as brightly as ever big fires were kept burning and hot coffee could be had whenever wanted so scarcely anybody suffered from the drenching received  the storm had somewhat disarranged the plans made by flapp rockley and their particular cronies but two days later flapp rockley and pender got permission to go to the village of oakville two miles distant one to buy some corn salve he said he wanted and the others to do a little trading  the boys had collected nine dollars from various members of their crowd and this was to be spent for liquor cigars and for several packs of cards all of these things were to be smuggled to the hermits den pender had discovered  we can get enough to last us during the encampment said flapp and then we can have a good time whenever we wish and captain putnam will never suspect what is going on  it did not take the cadets long to reach oakville a pretty place located among the hills there were a dozen stores a blacksmith shop two churches and perhaps fifty houses beyond were farms in a state of high cultivation showing that the inhabitants of that section were thrifty people  this town is about as slow as cedarville observed pender as they walked up the single street how folks can idle their lives away in such a place is what gets me  they dont know anything of the joys of city life returned flapp some of these people have never seen the inside of a real theater  as might be expected the unworthy cadets lost no time in entering one of the taverns located in oakville and here flapp treated then after cigars or cigarettes had been lit they proceeded to buy the things desired for the den  laying in quite a stock aint ye said the tavern keeper  oh we are getting this for the whole crowd replied pender carelessly but say he added suddenly  what is it  we dont want you to say anything about our buying this stuff  all right ill be mum answered the tavern keeper  from the tavern they proceeded to the general store where they purchased the packs of cards and a few other things  while they were making their purchases two girls came in with a market basket between them one was tall and thin and the other short and rather stout yet the girls looked very much alike and were noticeably pretty  fine girls whispered flapp to rockley nudging his companion in the ribs  yes was the answer and rockley began to smile openly on the new arrivals as the girls did not appear to notice this he drew closer and tipped his cap  fine day after the storm he said smoothly yes very said the taller of the girls and turned away  i suppose you belong in oakville put in lew flapp to the smaller girl  yes answered the girl and turned away to join her companion  we are up to the camp on pine island went on rockley following the girls up have you ever been there  once said the taller girl and began to purchase some articles from the clerk behind the counter  you ought to come and take a look at our camp continued flapp its a real interesting sight  all the girls are welcome said pender feeling he must say something  wed be willing to show you the way at any time added rockley and placed his hand on the arm of one of the girls  please let me be said the girl and walked away a moment later she left the store and her companion went with her  my but they were shy laughed pender rockley you didnt make any impression at all nor you either flapp  humph wonder who they are murmured lew flapp  lets ask the storekeeper and find out  those girls are twins said the proprietor of the establishment  twins cried rockley they didnt look itnot by their difference in sizes  but they did in looks said pender  what are their names  the tall one is alice staton and the other is helen staton their father is the local constable although he runs a big farm for a living  do they come here often  pretty often but they are very shy girls and dont hardly speak to anybody they are both studying to be schoolteachers  in the meantime helen staton and her sister alice were hurrying down the main street of oakville with flushed cheeks  i dont think those cadets were very nice said helen  certainly they were not very goodlooking replied alice and i thought they smelt a little of liquor  the idea of their saying they would show us the way to the camp i guess papa can drive us there if we want to go  id like to see it but i shouldnt want to go with those boys went on alice  perhaps papa can take us said helen but come we promised mamma wed hurry back as soon as we could  to get home the two girls had to walk for a considerable distance along the road leading to bass lake  on the way they passed the farm of one isaac klem a man who took great pride in his poultry and his cattle klem had forty cows and two bulls which were worth a good deal of money  one of the bulls a black vicious looking fellow was tied up in a small lot at the corner of the farm  the girls were just walking past this lot when helen happened to glance over her shoulder and set up a cry of alarm  oh alice mr klems black bull is loose  where helen queried her twin sister  there he is at the fence see he is trying to get over  the fence she mentioned was of stones piled loosely one on top of the other the bull was striking at the stones with his front hoofs soon some came down and then the animal leaped out into the roadway then he gave a snort and looked at the girls curiously  now as ill luck would have it each of the twins wore a red shirtwaist this color enraged the bull and with a wild snort he lowered his horns and rushed at the pair as if to gore them through and through     chapter xx  the rover boys and the bull   about an hour after lew flapp and his cronies left camp dick rover and his brothers received permission to do likewise  let us go to the village suggested tom i want to buy some cough drops my throat is raw from the wet weather  and i want to get some reading matter added sam a good story of some sort would just suit me  i wouldnt mind a magazine or two myself came from dick but i dont know if oakville can supply them  they were soon on the way each in the best of spirits tom began to whistle and his brothers joined in  feelin putty good queried a farmer who chanced to be leaning over his garden gate as they passed  why not retorted tom its better to whistle than to cry  right you are young man when one of my hands is whistling i always know he is pitchin in  the way lay over a hill and around a bend where a number of apple trees lined the road the apples were within easy reach and soon each was chewing on the juicy fruit to his hearts content  wonder where flapp and his crowd went came presently from tom  if they went to oakville they most likely visited the tavern answered dick  its a shame declared tom drinking and smoking and playing cards will never do them any good  another bend in the road was passed and they came within sight of isaac klems farm  hullo ejaculated sam pointing ahead whats the matter  those girls are running for all they are worth said dick  a bull is after them came from tom my stars but he seems to mean business  tom was right helen and alice staton were running along the highway at all the speed they could command behind them less than fifty feet distant was the enraged black bull bent on doing all the mischief possible  those girls will be hurt said dick running forward  cant we do something asked sam  we can try said tom get a rock or something and he picked up a sharp stone which lay handy sam did likewise  by this time the twins were almost upon the boys  chase the bull away panted helen who was ready to drop from exhaustion  yes yes gasped alice please dont let him touch us  jump the fence said dick quick ill help you over  he caught each girl by the hand and turned toward the low stone fence at the same time tom and sam let fly the two sharp stones one took the bull in the nose and the other struck the creature in the eye  with a snort the animal came to a halt and viewed the boys curiously he had evidently not expected the attack and the wound in the eye hurt not a little tom and sam lost no time in providing themselves with more stones  by this time dick was at the wall and in another moment he had assisted the girls over both had lost their hats and also dropped the market basket filled with things from the store  oh be careful said alice that bull will try to kill you  well look out for ourselves answered dick and picked up a bit of fence rail lying near did he chase you far  from that lot yonder answered helen  the bull had turned toward the fence and watching his chance dick struck out with the bit of rail his aim was good and the animal received a sharp blow directly across the nostrils then sam and tom let fly more stones and the bull was hit in the mouth the leg and the side he stood his ground for a moment and then began to retreat  hurrah weve got him on the run cried tom give it to him and he let go another stone which hit the bull in the tail and made him throw up his rear hoofs in a most alarming fashion  you had better come over into the lot said one of the girls he may come back  here comes mr klem with a pitchfork said the other  a farmer was rushing down the road with a pitchfork in one hand and a rope in the other he ran up to the bull and slipped the rope over the animals neck then he tied the creature to a tree  pretty savage animal youve got observed tom as he came up  is them gals hurt demanded the farmer  i dont think so but they are pretty well out of breath and scared  dont know how the pesky critter got loose said isaac klem first thing i see he was after them gals licketysplit i was out hayin and i didnt wait but picked up a pitchfork and a rope and run  the girls lost their hats said sam who had also come up  yes theyre in the road up yonder along with a basket o stuff they had  let us get the things said sam and he and tom started after the hats and the basket the things which had been in the basket were scattered in all directions and the boys picked them up  dick remained with the girls doing what he could to quiet them they were so exhausted they could not stand and each sat on a rock panting for breath  it was simply dreadful declared helen i thought every moment the bull would catch me and toss me up into the air  he didnt like the sight of your red shirtwaists was dicks comment  that must be it put in alice after this i dont think ill go near him when i have a red waist on  perhaps the farmer will be more careful and keep him roped up  when tom and sam came up with the hats and the basket isaac klem accompanied them  all right helen he asked and you too alice  yes mr klem said the tall girl but it was a narrow escape the bull would have gored us if it hadnt been for these young gentlemen  the girls thanked tom and sam for what they had brought  who be you young fellows asked isaac klem curiously  i am dick rover and these are my brothers tom and sam we belong to the cadets of putnam hall  the young sodgers up to bass lake  yes  i see well it was gritty o you to face my bull and i give ye credit for it my names isaac klem and thets my farm over yonder these gals is helen and alice staton and they live down the road a piece  the boys tipped their caps and the girls smiled  we are very thankful to you said alice and helen almost in a breath  you are welcome to the little i did returned dick  it was fun to pelt the old bull with rocks put in tom ill do as much for you any time and this caused a laugh  isaac klem went off to drive his bull home and the girls also prepared to depart  when you are coming back this way you can stop at our house if you wish said alice staton its the yellow one with honeysuckle growing over the porch  i remember it said sam thank you and the others also gave thanks for the invitation a moment later the two parties separated  what a difference between those cadets and the ones we met at the store said helen to her twin sister when they were out of hearing  yes indeed said alice the rovers are gentlemen while those at the store werewere rude  two nice girls declared tom how much alike their faces are  tom is smitten cried sam going to forget all about nellie laning tom he went on quizzically  oh you neednt talk cried tom growing red in the face you were just as attentive as a dancing master yourself  dont quarrel about it put in dick good naturedly you can be pleasant to them without forgetting all about grace and nellie laning i think  or dora stanhope either put in sam slyly shall we stop at the house on the way back  why not they may offer us a piece of pie said tom  i dont know we can walk by slowly they may be on the lookout for us you know  once again the boys set their faces toward oakville and soon reached the outskirts of the town  they were passing some of the stores when lew flapp caught sight of them  hullo cried the tall boy i declare there are the three rover brothers what brought them to oakville  we had better not let them see us with this stuff said pender hurriedly well get into hot water if they do  they lost no time in putting their purchases out of sight then they walked out on the street and stood leaning against the posts of a wooden awning  there is flapp and his crowd now said tom catching sight of the trio  we want nothing to do with them said dick they are not our kind at all  hullo rovers cried pender as they came up  hullo yourself returned tom coldly  what brought you to town asked rockley  my feet  thanks i thought it might have been your ears theyre big enough  at this sally both flapp and pender began to laugh  thats a good one said flapp  i suppose you used your tongue for a walking stick when you came over said tom its long enough  bah cried rockley and turned away in disgust  those rover boys have got the swelled head muttered flapp but well turn em down before the encampment is over eh fellows  thats what replied rockley  while the rover boys were making their purchases lew flapp and his cronies turned back into the tavern there was a billiard room in the rear and here they began to play billiards  well let the rovers start for home first said rockley it will be safer     chapter xxi  a tug of war   when the rover boys reached the vicinity of the staton cottage they found alice and helen in the dooryard watching for them  mamma says you must come in said alice she wishes to see you  and papa wants to see you too added helen  thank you we wont mind resting a bit answered dick the sun is rather hot  they were soon seated on the broad porch and here mrs staton and her husband were introduced they proved to be nice people and both thanked the boys warmly for what they had done on the road  ive told isaac klem about that bull said mr staton some day hell do a whole lot of damage  we are going to keep a good lookout for him in the future put in alice i dont wish to be scared out of my wits again  before the boys left mrs staton insisted on treating each to a piece of apple pie and a glass of milk  what did i tell you about pie whispered tom say but its all right isnt it  yes indeed whispered sam  the girls had a set of croquet on the lawn and asked the boys to play but they had to decline for want of time  all had moved to the rear of the cottage under a widespreading tree when dick chanced to look toward the roadway and uttered an exclamation  here come the other fellows now  yes and look at the packages they are carrying added sam  and the bottles came from tom significantly  dick was about to step forward when tom caught him by the arm  let us keep shady dick  all right tom if you say so  sam noticed that the faces of the two girls fell when flapp and his cronies went past  those are some of your chums i suppose said helen  they are some of the cadets but no chums of ours replied dick  oh  they belong to a little crowd of their own explained tom we dont hitch very well so that is why we let them go by unnoticed  we met them at the store in oakville said alice  did they speak to you  yes butbut we did not want them to  humph said dick and then the subject was changed  having invited the girls to come and look at the camp some pleasant day the rover boys left the cottage and hurried along the road after lew flapp and his cronies  ill wager those fellows made themselves obnoxious to the girls said tom you could tell that by the way the girls looked  what do you think they are going to do with the stuff they are carrying came from sam  i believe they intend to smuggle it into camp replied dick and if that is so i dont know but what it is my duty to report them  if you do that flapp will consider you the worst kind of a spy dick  perhaps but as a captain of the command it is my duty to see that such things are kept out of camp  well do what you think is best  better make sure that the stuff they are carrying isnt all right said sam they may have nothing but soda in those bottles  they hurried along faster than ever but strange to say failed to catch up to lew flapp and his cronies who were making for the hermits den with all possible speed  maybe they got scared thinking we might be spying on them suggested tom and hit upon the exact truth of the matter  after that nearly a week passed in camp without anything unusual happening lew flapp and his cronies kept their distance and so strict was the guard set by captain putnam and his assistants that hazing became for the time being out of the question  to pass the time more pleasantly some of the cadets organized several tugofwar teams this sort of thing pleased tom very much and he readily consented to act as anchor man on one of the teams another team had pender for an anchor man with rockley and seven others on the rope  let us have a regular contest said one of the cadets and all was arranged for a match on the following morning after drill  the students were enthusiastic over the match some thinking one side would win and others favoring the opponents  toms crowd will win that match said sam  what makes you so sure questioned ben hurdy  oh tom knows how to pull and how to manage the others  and so does rockley know how to pull continued hurdy and what is more he knows a trick or two that will pull your fellows over the line in no time  i dont believe it hurdy  want to bet  no i dont bet just the same i think rockleys crowd will lose  although sam would not bet some of the other students did so that by the time the match was to come off quite a sum was up  george strong had been chosen as starter and umpire on the green a line of white was laid down and the team pulling the other over this line would be the winner  for the contest captain putnam provided a new rope of proper size to each end was attached a belt for the anchor men and there was ample room on each side of the line for the eight cadets on the rope  all ready questioned george strong when the time had come for the contest  all ready on this end replied tom seeing to it that each of his team was in his proper position and had a proper hold on the rope  all ready here said rockley a few seconds later  drop cried the teacher and down went the two teams like a flash each pulling for all it knew how but neither gained an inch at the fall so the startoff was perfect  now pull for all youre worth rovers cried one cadet  haul em over rockleys cried another  steady boys whispered tom dont get nervous there is lots of time  he was almost flat on his back with both feet braced firmly in the soil rockley was also down and it looked as if it might be wellnigh impossible to budge either  this is a dandy tug of war said fred garrison neither has got an inch of advantage  the rovers will beat  the rockleys will win  i think it will be a tie said another  the strain was terrific and soon each member of the two teams was bathed in perspiration  here is where you earn your rations cried one cadet and this caused a general laugh  watch your chances tom whispered dick and his brother nodded to show that he understood  both sides were glaring at each other the strain was beginning to tell but so far nobody had thought of letting up in the least  but now tom saw two of rockleys men getting their wind as it is called they still held on to the rope but were hardly pulling at all  up cried tom suddenly and his men went up like a flash down came the cry an instant later and down they went before rockleys men could recover  hurrah the rovers have gained four inches came the shout and then those who favored that team set up a cheer  it was true the rope had shifted over four inches rockley was angry but could do nothing  mind yourselves wilson and brady he whispered dont let up a minute  i didnt let up growled wilson it was chambers  not much growled chambers i wasnt  up cried tom again down up pull pull pull down  up and down went the team twice the second time hauling the rope forward over a foot then they went down once more and anchored as firmly as ever  good shouted sam enthusiastically youre doing it boys keep it up  are they sneered lew flapp just you wait and see  he had a little roll of paper in his hand and watching his opportunity he blew the contents into the air directly over the team led by tom rover the paper contained pepper and it set several of toms men to sneezing  this trick had been arranged between flapp and rockley the latter feeling certain that tom and his followers could not sneeze and pull at the same time  up yelled rockley pull pull pull  stay down roared tom down dont give in an inch  but the cry could not be obeyed half the team was up and sneezing and before order could be restored the rope had gone over to the rockleys side a distance of two and a half feet  hurrah the rockleys are winning yelled ben hurdy haul em over boys  down ordered tom  what on earth made the men sneeze demanded dick gazing around sharply  smells like pepper replied major larry colby who was close at hand  would anybody be mean enough to use that  perhaps  up cried rockley once more pull pull pull  his team gave a savage haul as ordered and up came toms men in spite of themselves then began a tug of war in dead earnest with the rope nearly three feet in the rockleys favor     chapter xxii  a swim and some snakes   the majority of the cadets were now inclined to think that rockleys team would win the contest they had seen toms followers sneezing but thought this might come from the dampness of the ground  dont give in tom cried sam dancing around youve got to beat him  bah you act like a monkey said lew flapp rockleys fellows are bound to win  in the meantime the rope was moving rapidly backward and forward once rockley and his men had toms team dangerously close to the line but tom ordered a drop and there the team clung refusing to budge an inch further  time is almost up said george strong three minutes more  up cried rockley  up and pull for all you are worth cried tom pull i tell you make every ounce of muscle count  and pull toms team did as never before and tom with them watching for the first sign of returning weakness but the team was now on its mettle and made the rockleys come over the line in spite of the frantic orders from rockley himself to drop  its ours screamed tom and with a final haul brought the opponents over the line with a rush rockley flat on his back on the grass trying in vain to dig his heels into the soil and the others floundering just as vainly  a cheer went up for toms team while rockley and his followers left the field in disgust  it was well won tom said dick enthusiastically i never saw a better tug of war in my life  id like to know who threw that pepper answered tom with an angry glance toward lew flapp and his cronies  did somebody throw pepper asked mr strong  i think they did although im not sure anyway something came along and made the most of us sneeze  its too bad rover ill try to make sure of this said the teacher but though he made an investigation nothing came of it  some of the cadets were so delighted with the success of toms team that they took tom on their shoulders and marched around the entire encampment with him  i tell you rockley feels sore said sam a little later  around the belt asked tom with a grin  i mean in his mind he and lew flapp are having a regular quarrel over the contest i guess flapp lost some money  perhaps if he has it will cure him of betting put in dick  sam and tom had received permission to go to the upper end of the lake in one of the rowboats on the following afternoon songbird powell and fred garrison went along and all took their fishing outfits and plenty of bait  bring home a nice mess of fish said dick on parting with his brothers sorry i cant go with you  oh youll have company enough declared sam i heard that some of the country folks are going to visit the encampment today and perhaps those staton girls will be among them  the four boys were soon on the way two rowing at a time the weather was ideal and the water as smooth as that of a mill pond  what a beautiful spot this is declared fred as they glided long im sure captain putnam could not have selected a better  i have already gotten some splendid pictures returned powell who possessed a good snapshot camera now lying on the stern seat of the boat im going to take some more pictures today  on the way to the upper end of the lake sam did a little fishing and brought in one bass of fair size  this makes a fellow feel like a true poet murmured powell gazing dreamily at the water and then he went on    i love to glide    by the greenclad side    of the glassy lake    and there to take    my ease with book    or line and hook    and spend the day    far far away    from care and toil    on natures soil  just to listen to songbird cried tom he grinds it out like a regular sausagemaking machine and then he went on gayly    i love to swim    in natures soil    by the greenclad side    of a mountain wide    and there to bake    my little toes    on a garden rose    and take a hose    and wet the lake    with a hot snowflake    in the middle of june    if that isnt too soon    and sail to the moon    in a big balloon  oh tom let up roared fred talk about a sausagemaking machine    and when in the moon    id drive a stake    and tie my lake    fast to a star    or a trolley car    then jump in a sack    and ride right back    to where you belong    and stop that song  finished sam oh but thats the worst yet shall we duck him fred  no dont pollute the water answered garrison  he ought to be ducked came from powell in disgust whenever i have a poetic streak  its catching as the flypaper said to the fly finished tom lets call it square and take a new tack whos in for a swim when we reach the end of the lake  i am was the united cry from the others they were passing several small islands and now came to another turn in bass lake just beyond this was a small sandy beach backed up by a mass of rocks and brushwood  that looks like a good place for a swim said powell forgetting all about his socalled poetry  suits me returned tom lets pull ashore and tie the boat fast and ill put up  a peanut reward for the first fellow in finished fred caught you that time tom just as you caught songbird with his doggerel  as happy as any boys could be the four cadets tied up their boat in doing this one started to splash in the water followed by another and as a consequence before the cuttingup came to a finish the seats of the craft were pretty well wetted  never mind said tom theyll soon dry in the sun we can put our clothes on the rocks  the boys were soon in the water and having a most glorious time the lake was fairly deep off the end of the boat and here they took turns at diving fred and songbird also went in for a race the former coming in only a few feet ahead  i guess we had better dress now and try our hand at fishing said sam after nearly an hour had passed  one more dive cried tom and took one full of grace to the very bottom of the lake  as tom came up to the surface he heard a cry from sam quickly followed by a yell from fred  whats up he called out swimming toward the shore  land on the boat tom cried sam and leaped into the craft followed by fred and powell  all right but what is wrong asked tom and climbed tip over the stern  we cant get our clothes  why not  look for yourself  tom looked and gave a low whistle of astonishment and not without good reason for there on the rocks where they had left their garments rested a big black snake  this is interesting truly murmured the boy gazing at his companions in dismay  im going to get a rock and throw it at the snake said sam  a stone was close to the boat and watching his chance he picked it up and threw it at the reptile  the snake darted to one side it was merely grazed by the rock and now it hissed viciously  the hiss appeared to be a signal and in a moment more another snake and then another appeared until fully a dozen reptiles each a yard or more in length covered the rocks where all of the cadets wearing apparel rested     chapter xxiii  a glimpse of an old enemy   we are in a pickle now and no mistake groaned fred garrison he hated snakes as much as he did poison  its certainly bad declared songbird powell i wonder what we had best do  has anybody got a pistol  nobody had nor was there any weapon handy outside of a jackknife and a fishing rod  if we only had a shotgun sighed sam  but we havent one and we must do the best we can without it answered tom songbird supposing you try to charm em with some of that soothing poetry of yours or take a picture of em  this is no joke growled powell i want my clothes  well go ahead and take emi shant stop you  im going to get another rock said sam  let us all get stones suggested tom then we can throw together  this was thought to be a good idea and soon the stones were secured and each cadet took careful aim  three of the snakes were hit one quite seriously these retreated but the other snakes remained as defiant as ever  there must be a nest under the rocks said tom were that not so i am sure the snakes would leave at once  ive got another idea cried fred why didnt we think of it before  i havent thought of it yet fred grinned tom what is it  let us take our fishing rods and tie one fast to another then we can turn the boat around and go fishing on the rocks for our clothes  thats the talk rejoined powell a good idea fred  three of the rods were pieced together making a fishing pole over thirty feet long the boat was then swung around and while two kept the craft in place the others went fishing for the clothing  the task was not so easy as it looked and the snakes whipped around and hissed in a most alarming fashion more than once they had a coat or other garment on the pole only to drop it again but they persevered and soon had everything on board but freds shirt and one of toms shoes  here comes the shirt cried tom at last and landed the garment in the bow of the rowboat  and a snake with it screamed sam look out everybody  sam was right the snake was there and in a trice was whipping around under the seat  stamp on him fred cried tom and garrison who had his shoes on did so then tom caught the reptile by the tail and flung it into the lake  after this there was but little trouble in getting the remaining shoe and with this aboard they sent the rowboat out into the lake and lost no time in finishing their dressing  this was a truly horrible experience was sams comment after the excitement had died down gracious i feel as if the snakes were crawling around me this minute  dont say that said fred with a shudder you make me feel as if there was another snake in my shirt  the best thing to do is to forget the snakes put in songbird powell let us row around to the other side of the lake  all were willing and soon the vicinity was left far behind then they came to where a fair sized brook flowed into bass lake and here they came to anchor and began to fish while powell took several photographs  i have always found it good fishing near a brook like that said tom the fish come around looking for food from the brook  toms remark was evidently true for in less than an hour each of the boys had a good sized string of fish to his credit  in the excitement of the sport the cadets forgot all about the adventure with the snakes nor did they pay much attention to the flight of time until fred garrison glanced at his watch  gee christopher he ejaculated  what time is it asked powell  halfpast four  and we promised to be back at fivethirty put in sam well have to hustle fellows  oh we can get back in an hour easily enough put in tom  but weve got to clean out the boat and clean up ourselves came from fred come fellows wind up and put away your hooks and poles  he started and the others followed then fred and powell took the oars and the return to camp was begun not caring to go back the same way they had come they sped along the opposite shore of the lake where were located several coves and cliffs of rock  this is as pretty as the other shore remarked songbird and he began  oh dreamy days in summer time    when purling brooks and shady nooks  if you start up again ill jump overboard interrupted tom  do so you need a cooling off grunted powell but that was the end of the poetry for the time being  they were just passing one of the coves when they caught sight of a man sitting on an overhanging tree fishing  hullo what luck cried fred goodnaturedly  fair was the somewhat surly answer then as the man caught sight of the others in the boat he turned his head away  that fellow looks familiar to me ejaculated sam in sudden and strong excitement  and he looks familiar to me too exclaimed tom  do you think it is arnold baxter  if it isnt its his double went on tom row the boat over quick boys  who is this arnold baxter the father of dan baxter questioned fred  the same fred  the fellow who escaped from prison or the hospital asked powell  thats the chap  without delay the rowboat was turned in toward the overhanging tree  scarcely had this been done when the fisherman pulled in his line with all speed took up his string of fish and ran into the bushes between two cliffs of rocks  he is getting out and in a hurry too said fred  hi there stop we want to talk to you sang out tom at the top of his lungs  aint got time roared back the strange fisherman and on the instant he was gone  it must have been arnold baxter beyond a doubt said sam  if it was what is he doing here questioned his brother  hes keeping out of the reach of the law answered powell i suppose he thought he was perfectly safe in such an outoftheway place as this  and he was fishing just to kill time put in fred  id like to go after him and make sure went on tom what do you say sam  i am with you  but we may be late began fred  oh captain putnam will excuse us when i tell him what delayed us  the rowboat soon reached the shore and sam and tom leaped to the brushwood where the trail of the vanished fisherman was plainly to be seen  it was decided that fred and powell should remain in charge of the rowboat so that nobody might come and make off with the craft leaving their fishing outfits behind them the two rover boys struck out through the bushes and soon gained a narrow forest path running through the woods that skirted this section of bass lake  i wish we could catch baxter said tom on the way it would be a feather in our cap sam  we must be careful more than likely he is armed and he wont hesitate to shoot if he is cornered  oh i know that the most we can do is to follow him until we reach some place where we can summon assistance  the path led deeper and deeper into the woods and then along a fairsized brook they kept their eyes wide open but could see nothing excepting a number of birds and an occasional squirrel or chipmunk once they heard the distant bark of a fox and this was the only sound that broke the stillness  its rather a lonely place said sam after a silence lasting several minutes i must say i shouldnt like to meet arnold baxter here alone  for all we know he may be watching us from behind some tree  several times they got down to examine the path footprints could be seen quite plainly but neither of the boys was expert enough at trailing to tell whether these prints had been made recently or not  it would take an indian scout to make sure of these footmarks said tom they are beyond me  let us go a bit further returned his brother then if we dont see anything we may as well go back to the lake  hark  they listened intently and at a distance heard a crashing in the brushwood  that sounded as if somebody had jumped across the brook tom  just what i should say sam come on  again they went forward a distance of thirty or forty yards at this point the path seemed to dwindle down to little or nothing  we have come to the end of the trail was toms comment as he gazed around sharply  do you see anything queried his brother  nothing much one or two of the bushes over yonder seem to be brushed aside and broken  what do you think we had best do now  listen  both remained silent for several minutes but nothing out of the ordinary reached their ears  we may as well give it up sam it is growing dark and there is no telling where this search would lead us we might even get lost in the woods  they retraced their steps as quickly as they could to where they had left the rowboat  what luck queried fred  none he got away from us  its too bad said powell and then the return to the camp was made without further delay     chapter xxiv  more rivalry   do you mean to tell me that you saw arnold baxter exclaimed dick after listening to sam and toms story  we did replied the youngest rover there was no mistake  if it wasnt arnold baxter do you think he would take such pains to get out of our reach asked tom  that is true tom but it seems so unnatural what can he be doing in this outoftheway place  as powell says he must be keeping out of the reach of the law perhaps he expects to keep shady until this affair blows over  as if it would blow over cried sam dick we ought to do something  captain putnam had already learned why the four cadets had been late in returning to camp the rovers now went to consult him further  i agree something should be done said the captain perhaps you had better go to the nearest telegraph office richard and telegraph to your folks you might also get some of the local authorities to take up the hunt for this criminal  who are the local authorities  i really dont know but we can find out at oakville  in the end dick and tom received permission to leave camp for an indefinite time late as it was they hurried to oakville and caught the telegraph operator at the little railroad station just as he was shutting up for the night  having sent the message to their father they made inquiries of the operator and learned that the town boasted of a judge perkins and that the local constable was munro staton  do you mean the farmer who lives down on the road to bass lake asked dick the man who has twin daughters  thats the man  why he was in camp today with his daughters cried dick wish i had known of this before i might have hired him to make a hunt for the fellow we are after where does that judge live  sorry but he went to new york yesterday and wont be back for several days  the boys said no more but without delay turned away from oakville and made their way to the staton farmhouse  hullo i didnt expect to see you again today exclaimed munro staton as he opened the door for them come in  they entered to find the girls sewing and mrs staton darning stockings mr staton had been reading his favorite weekly newspaper  we have come on a very important errand mr staton began dick we have been down to oakville and learned there that you are the local police officer  ah do you want somebody arrested  if it can be done  somebody at the camp put in helen  no i wish he was at the camp said tom but im afraid he is miles away  all of the statons were interested and listened to the tale tom and dick had to tell with close attention  seems to me ive heard of this baxter and his son said munro staton scratching his head how does he look  as well as he was able tom described the man while dick took a sheet of paper and a pencil and made a rough but lifelike sketch of the individual  why you are quite an artist said alice staton as she gazed at the picture im sure id recognize that man if i met him  so would i added her father can i keep this picture  to be sure replied dick now mr staton to come to business what are your services as constable worth a day  oh about two or two dollars and a half  well if you will start a hunt for this man baxter at once ill guarantee you three dollars per day for a week or two and if you succeed in landing him in jail ill guarantee you a reward of one hundred dollars i know my father will pay that amount willingly  and if he wont i will said tom  you must be rich  we are fairly rich mr staton this man is a great criminal and has been an enemy to our family for years we dont want to see him at large  well ill take the job and do the best i can for you said munro staton and arose to his feet my hired man can run the farm while i am gone  he said he knew the spot where the boys had first seen arnold baxter and he would visit it at sunrise the next day and take up the trail as best he could  that trail through the woods used to lead to the village of hopdale he said perhaps ill learn something about him over there  i sincerely hope that you do returned dick  the boys and especially tom were worn out with traveling and readily consented to borrow a horse from munro staton on which to ride back to camp the steed was returned early in the morning  its rather a wildgoose chase said dick in talking matters over with his brothers but i dont know of anything else to do mr staton may catch baxter quicker than a metropolitan detective could do the job  three days passed and during that time the boys received two telegrams from home stating they should do as they thought best in the baxter affair and that a detective was on the way then the detective appeared at the camp and followed munro staton on the hunt for the missing criminal but the search by both men proved useless and nothing more was seen of arnold baxter for the time being  the cadets had arranged for a series of athletic contests to come off at the beginning of the following week there was to be broad and high jumping and running as well as throwing the hammer all of the students were interested and for some time these contests formed the total subject of conversation  the cadets to enter for the various events eight in number were those already introduced in these pages and a dozen or fifteen in addition all lively wideawake youths each of whom looked as if he would do his best to win  in a manner not to be easily explained the camp divided itself into two factions one led by dick and major larry and the other led by lew flapp and pender to the former belonged the rovers and their numerous chums and to the latter rockley ben hurdy and boys of a similar turn each crowd had one or more followers entered for every event and as before numerous wagers were made as to which person and which crowd would win  dick had entered for the high jump tom for the hammer throwing and sam for a half mile race for cadets of his own class the boys practiced a good deal although not always where the others could see what they were doing  the day for the contests was a perfect one and as news of the events had traveled to oakville and other places quite a respectable crowd of outsiders came to the camp to witness the affair  i hope you rover boys win said alice staton who had come with her twin sister and her mother in a buggy  thank you returned dick politely we shall certainly do our best but you must remember that we have some firstclass athletes at this academy  oh i dont doubt it all academies have them put in helen staton  the first event to come off was the hammer throwing to take place in the middle of the parade ground there were four entries for this tom as already mentioned jackson powell and a big boy named larson  larson who belonged to the flapp crowd was looked on as the probable winner for he handled the hammer exceedingly well but jackson could also throw as the others well knew nothing was known about the skill of tom or powell in this direction  the contest began with a throw by powell it was not very good and jackson outdistanced him by three feet  thats the style jackson cried lew flapp show em what you can do  this is the day our crowd comes out on top put in pender  crowing rather early seems to me came from fred garrison dryly  it was now toms turn and he threw the hammer with all the force at his command it fell just beyond the point reached by jackson  good for you tom cried sam thats the way to do it  humph just wait till larson takes his turn came from a flapp follower  larson stepped to the mark with the air of one who knows just what he is doing up went the hammer with a long swingto land in the very spot where tom had thrown it  a tie a tie was the cry  well done larson came from lew flapp but he was by no means satisfied over the showing made  being tied it was necessary for tom and larson to throw once more and again tom took his position at the mark  be careful tom whispered dick take your time  again the hammer swung up into the air and went sailing forward  hurrah eight inches beyond his first mark came the cry  larson will have to hump himself to beat that  it was now larsons turn and he stepped to the mark with a quick earnest air he realized that he must do his best if he expected to beat tom  jackson had picked up the hammer and he it was who had handed the article to tom  as larson swung the hammer on high tom cried out quickly  stop  whats the matter with you cried jackson uglily  i want captain putnam to examine that hammer  there aint nothing wrong with it  possibly not but please remember that i used the one marked a  so did i came from powell  captain putnam brushed forward  i will look at that hammer please he said to larson quietly he knew that the cadets had several hammers for practicing throwing in the camp  ii guess its all right faltered larson this hammer is marked b  b cried tom that b hammer is about half a pound lighter than the one marked a  it aint so yelled jackson  let me see the hammer marked a said the captain and it was brought from the spot where jackson had thrown it it is certainly heavier than this one he went on jackson what do you mean by making such a substitution  ieri didnt know there was any difference  but why did you make the change at all  ieri knew larson liked this hammer better the handle just suits him  that is so replied larson blandly  we will try the contest over again said captain putnam and every contestant will use the hammer marked a  i dont like the hammer marked a grumbled larson  i would just as lief use the hammer marked b said tom quickly  so would i added powell who felt he could not win anyway  very well then we will use the hammer marked b said captain putnam and after this jackson be sure of what you are doing he added sharply and at the words the boy who had tried to work such a mean trick was glad enough to slink back out of sight as much as possible     chapter xxv  winning the contests   powell was again the first to throw the hammer and this time it went two feet beyond his first mark  good for you songbird said tom i wish you had made it a yard  jackson came up with a scowling face he did his best but this time fell behind powell by four inches  you ought to have stuck to the other hammer jackson laughed the youth who composed songs  dont you throw that up to me whispered jackson fiercely if you do ill hammer you for it  is that meant for a pun jackson  no it aint i wont stand being slurred ill pound you good  with the hammer  no with my fists  really well youll have to spell able first tom came next as before and now the hammer flew out four feet and nine inches beyond his first mark  that shows what the other hammer can do said major larry  larson was as much out of sorts as jackson but nevertheless he resolved to do his best to win the contest up went the hammer with a mighty swing and circled through the air but the throw was behind that of tom by fourteen inches  hurrah tom rover wins was the cry and many rushed forward to congratulate him while larson and jackson retired as quickly as they could and in great disgust  the next contest was a dash of two hundred yards and was won by a boy named bird  hes a bird sang out tom loudly and at this the crowd laughed heartily  then came a race of a quarter of a mile for the little cadets and this was won by harry moss with joe davis a close second lew flapp had backed up ben hurdy but cigarettes had done their work on hurdy and his wind gave out long before the race came to a finish  good for you harry said dick slapping the little cadet on the back that was a fine run you made and your run was almost as good joe he added to davis  i dont care if i did lose panted davis both of us beat ben hurdy hollow and thats all i wanted to do  oh theres no moss growing on moss cried tom and this brought out another laugh  the next contest to come off was the high jump for which dick had entered along with pender rockley and four others including hans mueller what had possessed the german boy to enter was beyond finding out for he could scarcely jump at all yet many for the fun of it told him they thought he would surely win  oh youll outjump everybody said sam none of em will come anywhere near you  dots it dots it cried hans excitedly i vos chump so high like nefer vos aint it  a lad named lemon was the first to go over the bar at a height of four feet and two inches another cadet followed going him two inches better  now hans see what you can do said major larry  vos it mine turn to chump  yes are you ready  sure i vos  how high up shall they place the stick  apout like dot and hans pointed to the top of his head  all right fellows up she goes sang out tom and the stick went up  hans spat on his hands as if going to lift something then he squared his shoulders and drew far back from the jumping place  gif me lots of room eferypotty he sang out  all the room you want dutchy cried one of the cadets  away hans started for the stick running as swiftly as his short legs would carry him when about ten feet away he made a wild leap stuck up both legs in the air and came down flat on his back with a loud whack  hurrah hans wins cried tom best fall ive seen in a year  whwhovat gasped hans trying to recover his wind who knocked me der pack ofer annahow  nobody hit you hans  who put geese grease der groundt on ver i run hey  nobody  well did i knock der stick town  no you didnt come anywhere near the stick  do i got some more trials  i think mueller that you had better retire said captain putnam with a smile high jumping does not seem to agree with you  maype dots so captain veil i tont care annahow i vill drow der hammer ven ve haf some more of dem kondests and then hans dropped to the rear  rockley was the next to jump and his record was an inch better than that already made  thats all right said lew flapp  two other pupils now took their turns in jumping and rockleys record was speedily eclipsed then dick came along and sent the record still higher  thats the talk dick said tom enthusiastically i dont think pender can do as well  cant i sneered pender ill show you  on he came measuring his distance with care and went over the stick at the same height dick had taken  another tie was the cry  the last boy to jump did not do as well as rockley so the contest was voted a tie between dick and gus pender  now dick you must win said sam  you think a good lot of his ability sneered lew flapp who stood close by and started to walk off  he had scarcely taken a step when dick gave him a quick shove that sent the tall boy flat on his face  ill teach you to step on my foot lew flapp he cried hotly  whats the trouble demanded several while mr strong came forward to investigate  lew flapp stepped on my right foot and he did it just as hard as he could said dick  ii didnt growled flapp  i say you didand what is more i think you did it on purpose  he did it to lame you so you couldnt jump against pender came from tom  flapp did you step on rovers foot on purpose demanded george strong  no sirdidnt step on it at all  it is very strange rover says you did  he is mistaken  i am not mistaken that is why i shoved him away mr strong  is your foot hurt  i dont think it is but it didnt do it any good to have it stepped on  probably not do you still wish to jump  yes sir if i dont some of the crowd will say i am afraid said dick  in the future flapp be more careful said george strong significantly  by jinks but the flapp crowd are dandies whispered tom first jackson tried to change the hammers and now flapp himself tries to disable you we must be on our guard after this  thats true replied his elder brother and sam nodded  because of dicks hurt foot it was decided that gus pender should jump first pender did his best clearing the stick by two inches better than before  put it up an inch higher cried dick and made the jump despite a pain in the instep that was by no means pleasant then pender tried again but failed and dick was declared the winner  this is the day for the rovers cried one cadet and a cheer for tom and dick followed while the staton girls waved their handkerchiefs wildly  after this came several other contests in each of which the crowd pitted against the flapp faction won this made lew flapp rockley pender jackson and a number of others feel very sore  we must win something cried pender fiercely if we dont well be the laughing stock of the whole academy  at last came the half mile race for which sam had entered now though lew flapp was much larger than most of the others he was in the same class as sam and he had also entered this race which boasted of ten contestants including william philander tubbs  you have got to win this lew said rockley it ought to be easy for you with such long legs  i mean to win and leave that rover boy so far behind hell feel sick answered flapp  sam had but little to say but he knew that both tom and dick expected him to win and he resolved to do or die as the saying goes  even if i lose they shant say i didnt try the youngest rover told himself  out on the field william philander tubbs was strutting around boastfully  i cant help but win dont you know he drawled running is exactly in my line  oh what a whopper was fred garrisons comment tubbs is about as lazy as they make em  soon all of the contestants were ready and george strong explained the conditions of the race  you are to run along the shore to the big rock where lieutenant merrick is stationed he said you are to round the rock by running to the right and you must keep to the right of the path on returning so that you wont run into anybody the first to reach this mark on the return wins the race do you understand  the runners said that they did  very well then get ready go  away piled the boys in a line that did not break for several yards then sam rover shot ahead followed by flapp and two cadets named pigley and franell  there they go was the shout  leg it sam yelled tom leg it old man  go it flapp dont let them win this race  its yours if you want it franell  remember how you won the race at ithaca pigley  so the cries went on while the outsiders cheered for nobody in particular  oh i hope that rover boy wins said alice staton to her sister  so do i answered helen  by jove but i think ill rest a bit panted william philander tubbs after running a couple of hundred yards and he sat down on the grass while the crowd laughed at him  sam was keeping the lead in good shape although hard pressed by flapp pigley and franell his wind was good and he was running with a grace which brought forth much favorable comment  whether he wins or not he is the most graceful runner in the school whispered george strong to captain putnam i never saw his equal  you are right strong answered the captain ill tell you what he added they are a great trio those rover boys one cannot help but love them in spite of their tricks and occasional wrongdoings  i agree captain putnam and i must say i do not find their wrongdoings so very great either concluded george strong  the rock that was the turning point in the race was now almost gained sam still led but flapp was right at one shoulder with pigley at the other franell at a look from flapp had dropped behind  on the rock stood the lieutenant george strong had mentioned he was friendly to lew flapp and as sam swept around the rock he leaned forward making the youngest rover run about a yard further than was necessary then he allowed flapp to cut the rock closely  but sam was on his mettle and now bounded ahead faster than ever leaving flapp and pigley several yards in the rear  confound him thought lew flapp hell win sure unless franell does as he agreedgood  flapp almost shouted the word as he saw sam run into franell with a crash and go down the other boy had crossed the running path and gotten directly into sams way  i see you are out of it cried flapp gleefully as he shot by the prostrate figure  it was a trick muttered sam to himself and tried to rise to his feet but the wind was knocked completely out of him and before he could recover the race was over and lew flapp had come in ahead     chapter xxvi  sam shows what he can do   it was another trick he knocked me down on purpose  thus spoke sam as soon as he could get a hearing  well if that isnt beastly cried franell in apparent surprise i knocked him over why the little clown plumped right into me  were you running on your side of the path questioned george strong  i was sir flapp and pigley can prove it  thats right mr strong said lew flapp  it was entirely rovers fault added pigley he didnt keep to the right as he should  the other runners were questioned but could give no testimony as they had not been close enough at the time of the collision  it is too bad it happened said captain putnam  i would have won if it hadnt been for the fall said sam bitterly i was in the lead  yes but you were about winded said flapp i saw you getting groggy thats what made you fall into franell i guess  this remark made the youngest rover more angry than ever  mr strong he said turning to the head teacher suddenly will you do me a favor  what do you wish rover  will you time me if i run that race over again  you mean to run it over alone  yes sirunless flapp will run against me  ive won the race and thats all there is to it grumbled the tall boy doggedly  certainly ill time you if you wish it said mr strong who saw how disappointed sam was but it wont be a race you know  i dont carei want to show them what i can do  very well  sam drew up to the mark and declared himself ready  shall i run with you asked tom just to urge you on you know  all right tom come on  go cried george strong watch in hand and his eye on the second hand  away went the brothers side by side while a cheer went up from those who had wished to see sam win  tom kept close to his brother until the rounding rock was gained and here sam compelled him to drop behind  go on yelled tom goodnaturedly go im after you and he put on an extra spurt sam also spurted and kept the lead by about two yards  humph that aint running muttered lew flapp to rockley but nevertheless he was greatly disturbed  down the line swept the two runners with the speed of the wind sam keeping his two yards lead in spite of toms efforts to overtake him  won was the shout and tom rover is close behind and then the crowd gathered around george strong to learn the time  eight seconds better than lew flapp was the cry and tom rover came in four seconds better  that shows what sam rover would have done had franell kept out of his way  the race should have gone to sam rover  so the cries kept up until captain putnam compelled the cadets to quiet down  lew flapp and his cronies were much disgusted and left the field almost immediately  hes afraid to stay declared dick he doesnt want sam to challenge him and this was the truth  the foot races were followed by some prize shooting a race on the lake and then by a tub race and a race in sacks which called forth much laughter not only from the cadets but also from the visitors  it was just splendid declared alice staton to dick when it was all over i never had such a lovely time in my life  nor i added her twin sister but your brother should have had that running race it was a shame to knock him down  never mind said tom who had come up all the boys know he can run faster than the winner anyway  a luncheon was served to the visitors by captain putnams order and after that the cadets and their newlymade friends were allowed to go walking boating or driving as they saw fit swings had been erected in the grove close to the encampment and these were constantly patronized  it must be lots of fun to be a cadet said alice staton when ready to depart if i was a boy i should want to go to a military academy  oh its not all play said tom we have to work pretty hard over our studies and sometimes a fellow doesnt feel like drilling but has to do it all the same  it can truly be said that the flapp crowd were much disappointed over the results of the days contests only two events had been wona boat race of small importance and the race in which lew flapp had come off victor and the latter victory was dimmed by the knowledge that sam rover had cut down flapps time over the course by eight seconds  we may as well sell out and go home said pender in deep disgust  but we cant go home returned rockley weve got to stay right here and take all the taunts that come along  nobody shall taunt me cried jackson if they try it ill punch somebodys nose  and to think we lost our money too said ben hurdy after a pause thats what makes me sick  reckon you didnt lose much said lew flapp with a sickly grin  i lost all i had and thats enough  who won it  hans mueller that crazy dutch boy was yelling for tom rover and i took him up  the flapp crowd did not feel like mingling with the visitors and at the first opportunity lew flapp and his intimate cronies slipped away from the camp and hurried to the hermits den they had discovered  well have a little jollification of our own said rockley and his plan was speedily carried into effect in a fashion which would not have been approved by captain putnam or any of the teachers under him  we must get after dick rover said flapp while smoking a blacklooking cigar as a captain he stands pretty high if we can pull him down well be striking a blow at the whole rover family and also at their intimate friends  right you are but the question is how are we to get hold of him and what are we to do put in jackson  ive got a plan but i dont know exactly how it will work  let us have it lew came from gus pender  some dark night well go to rovers tent and haul him from his cot well wear masks and hell think hes in for a bit of hazing and wont squeal very loud then we can blindfold him and bring him here  so far so good put in rockley and after that  you know how he hates liquor  does he or is it all put on questioned ben hurdy  i cant say as to that but anyway he pretends to hate it so it amounts to the same thing well after we have him here we can get him to drink something by hook or by crook and when he falls asleep we can put an empty bottle in his hand and then somebody can bring captain putnam to the spot that will wipe out dick rovers record as a model pupil all in a minute  good almost shouted rockley we can dose him easily you just leave that for me  wish we could get his brothers into it too came from pender  oh we can serve them out some other way answered lew flapp at the start we dont want to bite off more than we can chew he added slangily  the matter was discussed for fully an hour and when the meeting broke up each member understood fully what was to be accomplished  two days after the athletic contests the cadets had a prize drill the cadets had been preparing for this for some time and each company did its best to win  i am greatly pleased with the showing made by all three companies said captain putnam after the drilling and marching were at an end companies b and c have done very well indeed but for general excellence the average of company a is a little above the others so the prize must go to captain rovers command  hurrah for dick rover was the cry and this was followed by a cheer for first lieutenant powell and for second lieutenant tom rover  humph forever cheering those rovers muttered flapp who was in company c my but it makes me sick  never mind whispered rockley just wait till we get the chance to work our little game  at once lew flapps face took on a cunning look  ive got an idea he whispered in return why not try it on tonight then captain putnam would say rover had been celebrating because his company won the prize  you are right there lew i didnt think of that wait till i sound the other fellows  it did not take rockley long to talk to his cronies and presently he came back with a knowing look on his face  its settled he said by tomorrow morning dick rover will be in disgrace and will lose his position as captain of company a     chapter xxvii  a prisoner of the enemy   never dreaming of the plot hatched out against him dick retired as usual that night now that the worry over the competitive drill was a thing of the past he realized that he was worn out and scarcely had his head touched the pillow than he was in the land of nod  his awakening was a rude one he felt himself raised up a large towel was passed over his face and tied behind his head and then he was dragged from his cot  dont dare to make a sound whispered a low voice in his ear if you do youll be struck senseless  hullo im about to be hazed thought dick and it must be admitted that he was far from pleased they think they are going to do something grand to the captain of the company that won the prize well not if i can help it and he began to struggle to free himself  but his tormentors were too many for him and almost before he knew it his hands and his feet were made secure and a sack was drawn over his head then he was raised up and carried away he knew not to where  one thing is certain they are taking me a long distance from camp was his thought when he found himself dumped into a rowboat can they be going to the head of the lake  the idea of using the boat had been suggested by jackson who said it would bewilder dick so he would not know where he was being taken and jackson was right the eldest rover thought he was a long way from camp when he was placed on shore again  his feet were now unloosed and he was made to march forward until the vicinity of the hermits den was reached then he was carried into the den and tied fast to a log erected near one of the side walls  take the sack from his head came in the voice of lew flapp and this was done and then the towel was also removed  for the moment dick could see nothing for the glare of a large lantern was directly in his face then he made out half a dozen or more cadets standing around him each with a red mask over his face and a red skull cap with horns  hullo this must be a new secret society he thought ive been initiated into the order of black skulls but never into the order of red skulls wonder what they will want me to do there was a moment of silence and one of the masked cadets stepped to the front  prisoner are you prepared to meet your doom was the question put in a harsh voice  oh chestnuts cried dick i went through that long ago when i first came to putnam hall  bow to your superiors said another voice  where are the superiors asked dick innocently i dont see em  the prisoner is impertinent make him bow  at once several sprang behind dick and forced him to move his head up and down  let up my head isnt on a hinge he cried cut it short for im sleepy  make him drink the poison and at once put in another of the masked cadets  the speaker tried to disguise his tones but the voice sounded much like that of lew flapp and instantly dick was on the alert  how much do you want me to drink he asked cheerfully  only one glass if you drink it without stopping to sneeze put in another voice and now dick was certain that he recognized rockley  these are no friends he thought they are enemies and they intend to play me foul  how can i drink with my hands tied behind me he asked  we will hold the glass for you said another and dick felt almost sure it was gus pender who uttered the words  its the whole flapp crowd he mused im in a pickle and no mistake i suppose theyll half kill me before they let me go  will you drink asked another he was small in size and dick put him down as being ben hurdy  i want you to untie my hands  very well let the prisoner hold the glass said flapp  thank you flapp  who said i was flapp growled the tall boy in dismay  i say so  my name is brown  all right then brown let it be said dick not wanting to anger the bully too much  the prisoners hands were untied and a glass containing a darkcolored mixture was handed to him dick had heard of the glass of poison before said glass containing nothing but mud and water well stirred up but now he was suspicious this glass looked as if it might contain something else  theyd as soon drug me as not he thought for all i know this may be a dose strong enough to make an elephant sick i dont think ill drink it no matter what they do  prisoner drink was the cry  thanks but i am not thirsty answered dick as coolly as he could besides i had my dose of mud and water a long time ago  he must drink roared rockley  get the switches ordered lew flapp and from a corner a number of long heavy switches were brought forth and passed around  things began to look serious and it must be confessed that dicks heart beat fast for he had no desire to undergo a switching at the hands of such a coldhearted crowd who would be sure to lay on the strokes heavily  dont you strike me said dick thinking rapidly ill drink fast enough but i want to know one thing first  well  what are you going to do with me next  make you take the antidote for the poison said flapp  and what is that  another drink  they are going to drug me as sure as fate reasoned dick how can i outwit them  while he was deliberating there was a noise outside as a night bird swept by the entrance to the hermits den  all of the masked cadets were startled and looked in that direction  by inspiration dick seized the moment to throw the contents of the glass over his shoulder into a dark corner when the crowd turned back he had the glass turned up to his mouth and was going through the movement of swallowing  ugh what ugly stuff he said handing the glass to one of the crowd  ha he has swallowed the poison cried lew flapp and nudged rockley in the ribs that was easy wasnt it he whispered  give him the second glass muttered rockley that will make him as foolish as a fiddler  pender already had the glass handy he passed it to dick who suddenly glared at him in an uncertain manner dick had smelt the liquor in the first glass and now realized something of the plot to bring him to disgrace  say but that stuff makes me feel lightheaded he said wasnt so bad after all  drink this quick cried flapp more eagerly than ever  all right said dick and spilt a little out of the glass onto the floor wonder what makes my hand shake so he murmured  take this and it will brace you up put in pender  ha look there yelled dick gazing fixedly at the rear of the den see the threeheaded owl  all looked in the direction and again he threw the contents of the glass behind him then he pretended to drink while glaring at the cadets around him  funny i cant count you any more he muttered six seven ten leven nine say im all mixed up who put me on the merrygoround anyway he began to stagger guess im on a toboggan slide aint i and he acted as if he could no longer stand upright  cut him loose fellows cried flapp and this was done and dick staggered to the table clutched it slid to the floor and acted as if he had fallen into a deep sleep  say that was dead easy cried pender gleefully took the stuff like a lamb  whats to do next flapp asked jackson  say jackson dont speak my name please cried the tall boy in alarm  oh whats the odds put in pender rover is dead to the world rockley knew just how to fix those doses  thats right gus came from rockley  we had better not lose time here went on flapp presently let us tell captain putnam without delay hell have rover brought back to camp just as he is and that will disgrace him forever  wait till i put the empty bottle near him said rockley and this was done  then the crowd of masked cadets left the den leaving the door wide open behind them     chapter xxviii  dicks midnight adventure   a minute after the last of lew flapps crowd left the hermits den dick leaped to his feet went to the doorway and listened intently it was quite dark so he could see little or nothing  at a distance he heard the masked cadets stealing swiftly along through the woods they had put out the lantern knowing the road fairly well through repeated excursions to the den soon the crowd was completely out of hearing  it must be confessed that dick felt lonely and almost the first thing he did was to take a match from his pocket and strike it discovering a bit of candle on the table he lighted this also  but little was to be seen outside of that which had already met his gaze the hermits den had been cleaned up around the table on which rested half a dozen bottles an empty cigar box and several packs of cards  this must be the stuff those fellows bought in oakville thought the eldest rover they have been using this cave for a regular club room what a beastly crowd they are and they really imagine they are having good times too  as will be remembered dick had been given a trip on a rowboat before being brought into the den and he imagined that he was somewhere near the head of bass lake how far from the camp he could not tell  perhaps im near where tom and the others met those snakes he mused ugh i dont want to fall in with things like that and how i am to get back to camp without a boat is more than i can settle  blowing out the bit of candle he placed it in his pocket and left the den on all sides were the thick bushes already described and poor dick knew not which way to turn he listened once more but hardly a sound broke the midnight silence  might as well strike out as to stay here he said i dont think theyll come back in very much of a hurry and perhaps they wont come until morning  pushing his way through the bushes he at last reached a tiny stream that poured over the rocks he followed the stream and after half an hours hard walking reached the edge of the lake he had journeyed directly away from the camp and was now in a spot that was lonely in the extreme  fortunately or unfortunately the water at this point was very shallow and soon dick was wading over to what he took to be the island upon which the encampment had been located but as a matter of fact he was headed for the main shore of the lake and soon he was tramping further away from the camp than ever for once in his life so far as his bump of locality was concerned dick was hopelessly mixed  dick traveled nearly a mile before he reached the conclusion that he was not on pine island or anywhere near it  im on the mainland thats certain he told himself i guess the best thing i can do is to wait for daylight before going further i may onlyhullo a light  dick had emerged from a grove of trees and now saw a light streaming from the window of a cottage but a short distance away the sight of this caused him to breathe a sigh of relief  some farmers place i suppose he murmured well anything will do i can get a place to sleep and the farmer can testify to it that i havent been drinking as lew flapp and his cronies will want to prove  a curtain was drawn over the window of the cottage so that dick could not see into the room the cottage was small with but a single doors and on this the youth rapped loudly  the rapping was followed by a commotion inside of the cottage and dick heard two persons leap to their feet  whos there demanded a rough voice  a stranger dick answered i have lost my way in the darkness and without waiting he tried the door and finding it unlocked opened it  dick rover  the cry came from one of the occupants of the room a tall awkwardlooking young man much tanned by exposure and with a pair of dark and wickedlooking eyes  great scott gasped dick falling back a step am i dreaming or is this really dan baxter  oh im dan baxter right enough answered the former bully of putnam hall  butbut i thought you were still on that island in the pacific  you wanted to see me end my days there didnt you sneered dan baxter  dick did not reply for he was gazing at the other occupant of the room a man with a short crop of hair and a short beard  and your father too he murmured  come in here cried arnold baxter savagely and caught him by the arm are you alone  yes answered dick before he had stopped to think twice  good enough come in and arnold baxter continued to hold him  he may be fooling us dad put in dan baxter the officers of the law may be with him  take a look around and see dan ill keep him here  let me go cried dick trying to break away  not much rover youll stay right where you are for the present answered the older baxter grimly  dan had slipped out and he made a thorough search before returning to the cottage in the meantime dick was forced to sit down on a bench in a corner while arnold baxter stood over him with a stout club  this is getting interesting to say the least thought dick i wish i hadnt come anywhere near the cottage  nobody around announced dan baxter as he came in and closed and locked the door  good answered his father he turned again to dick now how comes it that you are wandering around here rover he went on  i was trying to find my way back to camp and lost my way in the woods  but your camp is on an island  i know it i was carried off by some students who were hazing me they put a bag over my head and took me in a boat and i got mixed up  i hope they hazed you good came from dan baxter with a malicious grin  thank you dan you always were a real friend returned dick as coolly as he could  oh dont you come any of that game over me roared dan baxter i havent forgotten the past dick rover and youll find it out so before i get through with you i was just hoping you or your precious brothers might drop into my arms  what are you and your father doing here  that is my business broke in arnold baxter  i dont see why you fellows cant turn over a new leaf went on dick earnestly  oh dont preach dick rover answered dan baxter you make me sick when you do that  i suppose you find this a good hiding place  it has beenup to now said arnold baxter but since you have discovered us he did not finish  well make him pay for it said dan baxter ive been waiting to square accounts for a long time  how did you escape from that island dan asked dick curiously  a ship came along about a week after you left it  i see and did you come right through to here  that is my business dick rover but i came to help my father i dont mind telling you that  then you knew he had escaped from prison  from the hospital yes  and did you know he had robbed our house  he took what belonged to him dick rover your folks robbed him of that mine in the west  well i wont argue the point dan baxter dick got up and moved toward the door i think ill go  will you cried both of the baxters in a breath and seizing him they forced him back into the corner  let us make him a prisoner went on dan baxter and this was speedily done by aid of a rope which the elder baxter brought forth then dick was thrown into a closet of an inner apartment and the door was locked upon him     chapter xxix  true heroism   well one thing is certain i am much worse off now than i was when in the hands of lew flapps crowd thought dick dismally after trying in vain to break the bonds that bound him  the closet in which he was a prisoner was so small that he could scarcely turn himself the door was a thick one so to break it down was out of the question  stop your row in there called out dan baxter presently if you dont ill give you something you wont want  how long are you going to keep me here  if you wait long enough youll find out was the unsatisfactory answer  it wont do you any good to keep me a prisoner dan  wont it perhaps you think im going to let you go so that you can get the officers to arrest my father sneered the younger baxter  they are bound to get him anyway sooner or later  theyll never get him if they dont catch him this week  why is he going to leave the country  thats his business not yours said dan baxter and walked away  its too bad he turned up as he did remarked arnold baxter when he found himself alone with his son i thought id be safe here until i could slip over to boston  when does that steamer sail for cape town africa dad  tuesday or wednesday of next week  then all we can do is to keep dick rover a prisoner until that time  we cant do it dan as soon as he is reported missing this whole vicinity will be searched  do you think theyll find this cottage  perhaps although so far i have not been disturbed  tom and sam rover came pretty close to locating you didnt they  they came within half a mile of the spot but i gave them the slip  i wish i could square up with all of the rovers went on dan baxter savagely they have caused me no end of trouble  better leave them alone dan every time you try to do something you get your fingers burnt  to this the son could not answer for he knew that his father spoke the truth  a long talk followed and then dan baxter left promising to return before noon of the next day he was to proceed to a town about twelve miles away and there purchase for his father a new suit of clothing and a preparation for dyeing his hair and beard with this disguise arnold baxter hoped to get away from the vicinity and reach boston without being recognized  so far the night had been clear but now a storm was brewing from a great distance came a rumble of thunder and occasionally a glimpse of lightning lit up the landscape  youll have a bad journey of it said arnold baxter to his son as the latter was leaving  reckon ill have to make the best of it answered dan but ive got used to such things since ive been knocking around the ocean and elsewhere  left to himself arnold baxter paced the floor of the cottage uneasily age was beginning to tell upon him and he was by no means the man he was when introduced to the rovers years before  i wish i was out of it he murmured to himself id give a good deal to be on the ocean this minute bound for some place where i can make a fresh start  the storm kept growing in violence until the cottage fairly shook from the fury of the wind there was much thunder and lightning with some crashing in the woods close at hand that caused both baxter and dick to start in alarm  dick was doing his best to free himself and at last managed to get one hand loose  he had already found that to attempt forcing the door was useless now he tried the walls of the closet and then the flooring and the ceiling  he was much gratified to find that the boards of the ceiling were not fastened down with a great effort he managed to raise himself and after a minute of hard work found himself in the tiny loft of the cottage here the patter of the rain was strong and the water was leaking in everywhere  ill have to drop to the ground and run for it he told himself and crawled to where there was a tiny window just large enough to admit the passage of his body  it was no easy matter to get down to the ground with one hand still fastened behind him and dick made rather slow work of it the rain beat in at the window and soon he was soaked to the skin  where to go next he did not know to journey far in such a storm was entirely out of the question  dick had hardly gotten to the edge of the woods when a blinding flash of lightning and a ripping crash of thunder fairly lifted him from his feet  oh he gasped and staggered to a tree for support my but that was close  it was not until a moment later that he realized what had occurred the lightning had struck the cottage ripping off a corner of the roof and descending into the room below the structure was now a mass of flames  the cottage is on fire murmured the youth wonder if the baxters have been struck  the wind quickly drove the fire in all directions until the cottage was in flames almost from end to end  staggering from the effects of the shock dick drew closer to the building and then tried the door to find it locked  help came faintly in arnold baxters voice help  open the door returned dick forgetting that it was an enemy who was calling for assistance  ii cannot ii am helpless  again dick tried the door but without success then he leaped for the window some of the glass was broken and with his naked fist he drove in the whole sash and tore down the flapping curtain  the sight which met his gaze filled him with horror the room was on fire in several places and in a corner near the chimney piece rested arnold baxter pinned down by a section of brick and stonework that had fallen he had been hit in the head and from the wound the blood was flowing  rover is that you he cried faintly dont desert me  without replying dick began to crawl in through the broken window the air was filled with smoke and he could scarcely see what he was doing the sparks too were flying in all directions and only the wetness of his garments kept them from catching fire  he was soon at arnold baxters side and with his one free hand hurled the bricks and stones in all directions as he worked the fire kept coming closer until his face was fairly blistered by the conflagration  at last the man was free but he could not raise himself up and when dick did it arnold baxter fell a limp form in his arm he had fainted  mustering up all the strength that remained to him dick dragged the unconscious man to the door there was a bar to be flung aside and then dick threw the barrier wide open it was none too soon for now the fire was swirling in all directions staggering beneath his burden the youth hurried into the open and then fell flat with arnold baxter beside him  what a close call murmured dick when he was able to rise he felt weak in the knees and his hands and face smarted from the blistering received he looked at arnold baxter the man had not yet recovered and looked to be more dead than alive  dick remembered having crossed a brook but a short distance away and to this he went and bathed his burns and brought some water back for arnold baxter his other hand had now become free so he could work to much better advantage  he has been seriously hurt that is certain thought the youth perhaps he breathed in some of the flames if he did that he may never get over it  left to itself the cottage burnt to the ground and then the falling rain put out the hissing embers in the meantime dick did what he could to restore arnold baxter to consciousness and at last had the satisfaction of seeing the man open his eyes  oh murmured the man the fire  you are out of it answered dick soothingly  did youdid you haul me out  yes  it was good of you to do it rover said arnold baxter and then he fainted once more     chapter xxx  turning a new leafconclusion   the night was a long one for dick rover and he was glad when the storm cleared away and the first streaks of dawn began to show themselves in the eastern sky  arnold baxter had recovered consciousness but was evidently in great pain for he moaned almost constantly dick was willing to aid the sufferer yet could do little or nothing  tell me the way to our camp and i will get help said dick at last and arnold baxter gave him the directions as best he could  i must have a doctor whispered the man hoarsely if not ill surely die and i dont want to die yet rover  as well as he was able dick set off for the lake shore and then began to move in the direction of bass island  he had not gone very far when he heard somebody calling his name  rover dick rover was the cry dick rover  it must be a searching party he thought and he was right the party contained tom and sam and mr strong and they said that two other parties were out one headed by captain putnam and the other by an assistant  where in the world have you been asked tom we have been scared almost to death over your absence  its a long story answered dick what i want just now is a doctor and a lot of salve just look at me will you  blisters ejaculated sam where did you get those  in a fire that nearly burnt arnold baxter to death i want the doctor for him  and then dick had to tell the particulars of how he had run across the cottage in the woods and of what had followed  and dan baxter is here ejaculated tom it doesnt seem possible  he ought to be locked up put in sam  it was decided by mr strong that arnold baxter should be removed to the camp on a stretcher and four boys including sam and tom volunteered for the service in the meantime dick went to camp to attend to his hurts and a cadet was sent to oakville for a doctor  hullo here comes rover whispered lew flapp to pender as dick appeared wonder what sort of a story he will have to tell  one thing is certain we made a mess of our plans muttered pender  perhaps rover wont give us away put in rockley hopefully  on returning to camp word had been sent to captain putnam that dick rover was at the den in a condition not fit to be seen  mr strong and another teacher had gone to the place mentioned in the anonymous communication only to find the den empty  a general alarm was sent out and the search for the missing captain of company a was begun as recorded captain putnam also began to investigate on his private account with results that were as surprising as they were dismaying he learned the several cadets had left camp early in the night and among them ben hurdy lew flapp pender and jackson without delay he summoned ben hurdy to his private tent and made the young cadet undergo a strict crossexamination  at first hurdy would not talk but soon he became frightened and broke down utterly he told of the plot against dick and of how flapp and the others had carried it out  i didnt want to go into it he whined but flapp said he would thrash me if i didnt do my share they wanted to get square with captain rover because he had won at the athletic contests and at the drill  i see said captain putnam grimly and then he ordered ben hurdy to keep absolutely silent until called on to speak if you say a word now ill dismiss you at once he concluded  when dick arrived captain putnam saw to it that his blisters were dressed with care and then he asked the eldest rover to tell his whole story  i do not know as i can do that captain putnam said the young captain blushing i dont care to become a talebearer  did you leave camp of your own free will rover  i did not sir  you were carried away to be hazed then  yes sir but i would prefer not to speak of that part of my adventures  those who carried you off drugged you  how do you know that asked dick in surprise  never mind that now rover did they drug you or not  no sir  what  they tried to drug me but i threw the liquor over my shoulder when they werent looking  oh i see and captain putnam smiled they tried to trick you and you ended by tricking them is that it  thats about the size of it sir they thought i was in a stupor when they left me but as soon as they were gone i began to shift for myself but i dont understand how you know about this captain putnam  one of the party to this outrage has confessed so i know all about it rover the leader i believe was lew flapp and his main supporters were pender rockley and jackson  to this dick did not say a word  i know you would speak if i were accusing anybody wrongly rover in one way i can appreciate your silence but this affair was carried too far it was not an ordinary hazing the plot was one to blast your honest name and bring you into disgrace such things cannot be permitted at any school of which i am the head i will hear the rest of your strange tale  in as few words as possible dick told how he had wandered around until he had reached the cottage and what had happened afterward  it was assuredly a remarkable adventure said captain putnam i thought i had about seen the last of daniel baxter  perhaps dan baxter will keep shady when he finds out what has happened  perhaps and you think arnold baxter is in a bad way  yes sir he came pretty close to being burnt up  we will do our best for him and notify the authorities without delay  an hour later the disabled man was brought into camp and the doctor came to attend him  under the physicians directions arnold baxter was made fairly comfortable in one of the tents of the camp  he is in a bad way said the doctor he will probably recover but it will take weeks and perhaps months  arnold baxter asked for dick and the eldest rover went in to see him  ii want to thank you for what you did rover said the criminal in a low voice itit was noble very noble i shant forget it  mr baxter why dont you try to turn over a new leaf questioned dick havent you found out that it doesnt pay to be bad  yes i have found it out and the lesson has been dearly bought said arnold baxter with a sigh in the future i shall try toto do better here i want you to give these to your father and tell him ii am sorry that i visited your house some time ago went on the disabled man  he gave dick an envelope containing some pawn tickets which called for the things stolen from the rover homestead and also a pocketbook with some money in it  that is all i have left of the cash he said im sorry i havent every cent of it tell him he can do as he pleases about me i deserve no pity  i think hed like to see you turn over a new leaf too he hates to see people on the downward path mr baxter  you are a good boy dick rover i am sorry that my son dan isnt like you has he been caught yet  i believe not  if he is caught let me know concluded arnold baxter and there the talk ended  i imagine he really intends to turn over a new leaf said dick to tom and sam a little later  hope he does replied tom  so do i added sam    let me add a few words more and then bring this story of life in camp to a conclusion  on the day following dicks return to camp captain putnam summoned lew flapp pender rockley and jackson before him  i presume you know why i have sent for you said the captain briefly since the disappearance of captain rover i have been making an investigation rover himself would not talk but others have spoken and rover has not denied the truth all of you have been guilty of such serious misconduct that to overlook it would be almost criminal on my part  what have i done asked lew flapp brazenly  you have earned your dismissal from putnam hall flapp and you leave this camp as soon as arrangements can be made  going to fire me out eh  you are dismissed i will not allow such a boy as you to mingle longer with the rest of my pupils  what are you going to do with the others i wasnt to blame alone  pender rockley and jackson shall go too the others including hurdy shall have another chance for i believe they were dragged into the affair unwillingly by you and your particular cronies  if we have got to go dont lets listen to any more gas growled rockley and stalked away with a very white face followed by flapp pender and jackson pleaded for another chance but captain putnam would not listen and in the end the evilminded cadets had to leave the school never to return  putnam hall is well rid of that crowd said songbird powell and the majority of the students agreed with him  munro staton the local constable was much chagrined to think that he had not had a hand in finding arnold baxter and he at once set out to locate dan but dan baxter knew enough to leave the vicinity and that was the last heard of him for some time  through the pawn tickets given to dick mr anderson rover recovered the spoons napkin rings and other things taken from the homestead by arnold baxter mr rover visited baxter before the latter was returned to the hospital from which he had escaped  i believe the man really intends to reform said anderson rover afterwards but he is in a bad condition physically and may die before his
