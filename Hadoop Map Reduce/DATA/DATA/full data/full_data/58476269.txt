looked up from his bag  hullo allen he said what the dickens are you up here for  i was rather thinking of doing a little boxing if youve no objection of course  but you ought to be on a bed of sickness and that sort of thing i heard youd crocked yourself  so i did nothing much though trod on myself during a game of fives and twisted my ankle a bit  in for the middles of course  yes  so am i  yes so i saw in the sportsman it says you weigh eleventhree  bit more really i believe shant be able to have any lunch or i shall have to go in for the heavies what are you  just eleven well lets hope we meet in the final  rather said tony  it was at aldershotto be more exact in the dressingroom of the queens avenue gymnasium at aldershotthat the conversation took place from east and west and north and south from dan even unto beersheba the representatives of the public schools had assembled to box fence and perform gymnastic prodigies for fame and silver medals the room was full of all sorts and sizes of them heavyweights looking ponderous and muscular featherweights diminutive but wiry lightweights middleweights fencers and gymnasts in scores some wearing the unmistakable air of the veteran for whom aldershot has no mysteries others nervous and wishing themselves back again at school  tony graham had chosen a corner near the door this was his first appearance at aldershot st austins was his school and he was by far the best middleweight there but his doubts as to his ability to hold his own against allcomers were extreme nor were they lessened by the knowledge that his cousin allen thomson was to be one of his opponents indeed if he had not been a man of mettle he might well have thought that with allens advent his chances were at an end  allen was at rugby he was the son of a baronet who owned many acres in wiltshire and held fixed opinions on the subject of the whole duty of man who he held should be before anything else a sportsman both the thomsonsallens brother jim was at st austins in the same house as tonywere good at most forms of sport jim however had never taken to the art of boxing very kindly but by way of compensation allen had skill enough for two he was a splendid boxer quick neat scientific he had been up to aldershot three times once as a featherweight and twice as a lightweight and each time he had returned with the silver medal  as for tony he was more a fighter than a sparrer when he paid a visit to his uncles house he boxed with allen daily and invariably got the worst of it allen was too quick for him but he was clever with his hands his supply of pluck was inexhaustible and physically he was as hard as nails  is your ankle all right again now he asked  pretty well it wasnt much of a sprain interfered with my training a good bit though i ought by rights to be well under eleven stone youre all right i suppose  not bad boxing takes it out of you more than footer or a race i was in good footer training long before i started to get fit for aldershot but i think i ought to get along fairly well any idea whos in against us  harrow felsted wellington thats all i think  st pauls  no  good well i hope your first man mops you up ive a conscientious objection to scrapping with you  allen laughed youd be all right he said if you werent so beastly slow with your guard why dont you wake up you hit like blazes  i think i shall start guarding two seconds before you lead by the way dont have any false delicacy about spoiling my aristocratic features on the ground of relationship you know  rather not let auld acquaintance be forgot im not thomson for the present im rugby  just so and im st austins personally im going for the knockout you wont feel hurt  this was in the days before the headmasters conference had abolished the knockout blow and a boxer might still pay attentions to the point of his opponents jaw with an easy conscience  i probably shall if it comes off said allen i say it occurs to me that we shall be weighingin in a couple of minutes and i havent started to change yet good ive not brought evening dress or somebody elses footer clothes as usually happens on these festive occasions  he was just pulling on his last boot when a gymnasium official appeared in the doorway  will all those who are entering for the boxing get ready for the weighingin please he said and a general exodus ensued  the weighingin at the public schools boxing competition is something in the nature of a religious ceremony but even religious ceremonies come to an end and after a quarter of an hour or so tony was weighed in the balance and found correct he strolled off on a tour of inspection  after a time he lighted upon the st austins gym instructor whom he had not seen since they had parted that morning the one on his way to the dressingroom the other to the refreshmentbar for a modest quencher  well mr graham  hullo dawkins what time does this show start do you know when the middleweights come on  well you cant say for certain they may keep em back a bit or they may make a start with em first thing no the lightweights are going to start what number did you draw sir  one  then youll be in the first middleweight pair thatll be after these two gentlemen  these two gentlemen the first of the lightweights were by this time in the middle of a warmish opening round tony watched them with interest and envy how beastly nippy they are he said  wish i could duck like that he added  well the ole thing there is you ave to watch the other mans eyes but lightweights is always quicker at the duck than what heavier men are you get the best boxing in the lightweights though the feathers spar quicker  soon afterwards the contest finished amidst volleys of applause it had been a spirited battle and an exceedingly close thing the umpires disagreed after a short consultation the referee gave it as his opinion that on the whole r cloverdale of bedford had had a shade the worse of the exchanges and that in consequence j robinson of st pauls was the victor this was what he meant what he said was robinson wins in a sharp voice as if somebody were arguing about it the pair then shook hands and retired  first bout middleweights shrilled the mc wp ross wellington and acr graham st austins  tony and his opponent retired for a moment to the changingroom and then made their way amidst applause on to the raised stage on which the ring was pitched mr wp ross proceeded to the farther corner of the ring where he sat down and was vigorously massaged by his two seconds tony took the opposite corner and submitted himself to the same process it is a very cheering thing at any time to have ones arms and legs kneaded like bread and it is especially pleasant if one is at all nervous it sends a glow through the entire frame like somebodys something it is both grateful and comforting  tonys seconds were curious specimens of humanity one was a gigantic soldier very gruff and taciturn and with decided leanings towards pessimism the other was also a soldier he was in every way his colleagues opposite he was half his size had red hair and was bubbling over with conversation the other could not interfere with his hair or his size but he could with his conversation and whenever he attempted a remark he was promptly silenced much to his disgust  plenty o moosle ere fred he began as he rubbed tonys left arm  moosle aint everything said the other gloomily and there was silence again  are you ready seconds away said the referee  time  the two stood up to one another  the wellington representative was a plucky boxer but he was not in the same class as tony after a few exchanges the latter got to work and after that there was only one man in the ring in the middle of the second round the referee stopped the fight and gave it to tony who came away as fresh as he had started and a great deal happier and more confident  did us proud fred began the garrulous man  yes but that un aint nothing you wait till he meets young thomson ive seen im box ere three years and never bin beat yet three bloomin years yus  this might have depressed anybody else but as tony already knew all there was to be known about allens skill with the gloves it had no effect upon him  a sanguinary heavyweight encounter was followed by the first bout of the feathers and the second of the lightweights and then it was allens turn to fight the harrow representative  it was not a very exciting bout allen took things very easily he knew his training was by no means all it should have been and it was not his game to take it out of himself with any firework business in the trial heats he would reserve that for the final so he sparred three gentle rounds with the harrow sportsman just doing sufficient to keep the lead and obtain the verdict after the last round he finished without having turned a hair he had only received one really hard blow and that had done no damage after this came a long series of fights the heavyweights shed their blood in gallons for name and fame the featherweights gave excellent exhibitions of science and the lightweight pairs were fought off until there remained only the final to be decided robinson of st pauls against a charterhouse boxer  in the middleweights there were three competitors still in the running allen tony and a felsted man they drew lots and the bye fell to tony who put up an uninteresting three rounds with one of the soldiers neither fatiguing himself very much henderson of felsted proved a much tougher nut to crack than allens first opponent he was a rushing boxer and in the first round had if anything the best of it in the last two however allen gradually forged ahead gaining many points by his perfect style alone he was declared the winner but he felt much more tired than he had done after his first fight  by the time he was required again however he had had plenty of breathing space the final of the lightweights had been decided and robinson of st pauls after the custom of paulines had set the crown upon his afternoons work by fighting the carthusian to a standstill in the first round there only remained now the finals of the heavies and middles  it was decided to take the latter first  tony had his former seconds and dawkins had come to his corner to see him through the ordeal  the ole thing ere he kept repeating is to keep goin ard all the time and wear im out hes too quick for you to try any sparrin with  yes said tony  the ole thing continued the expert is to feint with your left and it with your right this was excellent in theory no doubt but tony felt that when he came to put it into practice allen might have other schemes on hand and bring them off first  are you ready seconds out of the ring time  go in sir ard whispered the redhaired man as tony rose from his place  allen came up looking pleased with matters in general he gave tony a cousinly grin as they shook hands tony did not respond he was feeling serious and wondering if he could bring off his knockout before the three rounds were over he had his doubts  the fight opened slowly both were cautious for each knew the others powers suddenly just as tony was thinking of leading allen came in like a flash a straight left between the eyes a right on the side of the head and a second left on the exact tip of the nose and he was out again leaving tony with a helpless feeling of impotence and disgust  then followed more sparring tony could never get in exactly the right position for a rush allen circled round him with an occasional feint then he hit out with the left tony ducked again he hit and again tony ducked but this time the left stopped halfway and his right caught tony on the cheek just as he swayed to one side it staggered him and before he could recover himself in darted allen again with another trio of blows ducked a belated left counter got in two stinging hits on the ribs and finished with a left drive which took tony clean off his feet and deposited him on the floor beside the ropes  silence please said the referee as a burst of applause greeted this feat  tony was up again in a moment he began to feel savage he had expected something like this but that gave him no consolation he made up his mind that he really would rush this time but just as he was coming in allen came in instead it seemed to tony for the next halfminute that his cousins fists were never out of his face he looked on the world through a brown haze of boxingglove occasionally his hand met something solid which he took to be allen but this was seldom and whenever it happened it only seemed to bring him back again like a boomerang just at the most exciting point time was called  the pessimist shook his head gloomily as he sponged tonys face  you must lead if you want to it im said the garrulous man youre too slow go in at im sir wiv both ands an youll be all right wont e fred  i said ow it ud be was the only reply fred would vouchsafe  tony was half afraid the referee would give the fight against him without another round but to his joy time was duly called he came up to the scratch as game as ever though his head was singing he meant to go in for all he was worth this round  and go in he did allen had managed in performing a complicated manoeuvre to place himself in a corner and tony rushed he was sent out again with a flush hit on the face he rushed again and again met allens left then he got past and in the confined space had it all his own way science did not tell here strength was the thing that scored hard halfarm smashes left and right at face and body and the guard could look after itself  allen uppercut him twice but after that he was nowhere tony went in with both hands there was a prolonged rally and it was not until time had been called that allen was able to extricate himself tonys blows had been mostly body blows and very warm ones at that  thats right sir was the comment of the redheaded second keep em both goin hard and youll win yet you ad im proper then adnt e fred  and even the pessimist was obliged to admit that tony could fight even if he was not quick with his guard  allen took the ring slowly his want of training had begun to tell on him and some of tonys blows had landed in very tender spots he knew that he could win if his wind held out but he had misgivings the gloves seemed to weigh down his hands tony opened the ball with a tremendous rush allen stopped him neatly there was an interval while the two sparred for an opening then allen feinted and dashed in tony did not hit him once it was the first round over again left right left right and finally as had happened before a tremendously hot shot which sent him under the ropes he got up and again allen darted in tony met him with a straight left a rapid exchange of blows and the end came allen lashed out with his left tony ducked sharply and brought his right across with every ounce of his weight behind it fairly on to the point of the jaw the right crosscounter is distinctly one of those things which it is more blessed to give than to receive allen collapsed   nine  ten  the timekeeper closed his watch  graham wins said the referee look after that man there     2  thieves break in and steal   it was always the custom for such austinians as went up to represent the school at the annual competition to stop the night in the town it was not therefore till just before breakfast on the following day that tony arrived back at his house the boarding houses at st austins formed a fringe to the school grounds the two largest were the school house and merevales tony was at merevales he was walking up from the station with welch another member of merevales who had been up to aldershot as a fencer when at the entrance to the school grounds he fell in with robinson his fag robinson was supposed by many including himself to be a very warm man for the junior quarter which was a handicap race especially as an injudicious sports committee had given him ten yards start on simpson whom he would have backed himself to beat even if the positions had been reversed being a wise youth however and knowing that the best of runners may fail through undertraining he had for the last week or so been going in for a steady course of overtraining getting up in the small hours and going for beforebreakfast spins round the track on a glass of milk and a piece of bread master r robinson was nothing if not thorough in matters of this kind  but today things of greater moment than the sports occupied his mind he had news he had great news he was bursting with news and he hailed the approach of tony and welch with pleasure with any other leading light of the school he might have felt less at ease but with tony it was different when you have underdone a fellows eggs and overdone his toast and eaten the remainder for a term or two you begin to feel that mere social distinctions and differences of age no longer form a barrier  besides he had news which was absolutely fresh news to which no one could say pityingly what have you only just heard that  hullo graham he said have you come back tony admitted that he had jolly good for getting the middles a telegram had of course preceded tony i say graham do you know whats happened therell be an awful row about it someones been and broken into the pav  rot how do you know  theres a pane taken clean out i booked it in a second as i was going past to the track  which room  first fifteen the window facing away from the houses  thats rum said welch wonder what a burglar wanted in the first room isnt even a hairbrush there generally  robinsons eyes dilated with honest pride this was good this was better than he had looked for not only were they unaware of the burglary but they had not even an idea as to the recent event which had made the first room so fit a huntingground for the burgling industry there are few pleasures keener than the pleasure of telling somebody something he didnt know before  great scott he remarked havent you heard no of course you went up to aldershot before they did it by jove  did what  why they shunted all the sports prizes from the board room to the pav and shot em into the first room i dont suppose theres one left now i should like to see the old mans face when he hears about it good mind to go and tell him now only hed have a fit jolly exciting though isnt it  well said tony of all the absolutely idiotic things to do fancy puttingthere must have been at least fifty pounds worth of silver and things fancy going and leaving all that overnight in the pav  rotten agreed welch wonder whose idea it was  look here robinson said tony youd better buck up and change or youll be late for brekker come on welch well go and inspect the scene of battle  robinson trotted off and welch and tony made their way to the pavilion there sure enough was the window or rather the absence of window a pane had been neatly removed evidently in the orthodox way by means of a diamond  may as well climb up and see if theres anything to be seen said welch  all right said tony give us a leg up rightho by jove im stiff  see anything  no theres a cloth sort of thing covering what i suppose are the prizes i see how the chap whoever he was got in youve only got to break the window draw a couple of bolts and there you are shall i go in and investigate  better not its rather the thing i fancy in these sorts of cases to leave everything just as it is  rum business said tony as he rejoined welch on terra firma wonder if theyll catch the chap wed better be getting back to the house now it struck the quarter years ago  when tony some twenty minutes later shook off the admiring crowd who wanted a full description of yesterdays proceedings and reached his study he found there james thomson brother to allen thomson as the playbills say jim was looking worried tony had noticed it during breakfast and had wondered at the cause he was soon enlightened  hullo jim said he whats up with you this morning feeling chippy  no no im all right im in a beastly hole though i wanted to talk to you about it  weigh in then weve got plenty of time before school  its about this aldershot business how on earth did you manage to lick allen like that i thought he was a cert  yes so did i the ole thing there as dawkins ud say was i knocked him out its the sort of thing thats always happening i wasnt in it at all except during the second round when i gave him beans rather in one of the corners my aunt it was warm while it lasted first round i didnt hit him once he was better than i thought hed be and i knew from experience he was pretty good  yes you look a bit bashed  yes feel it too but whats the row with you  just this i had a couple of quid on allen and the rotter goes and gets licked  good lord whom did you bet with  with allen himself  mean to say allen was crock enough to bet against himself he must have known he was miles better than anyone else in hes got three medals there already  no you see his bet with me was only a hedge hed got five to four or something in quids on with a chap in his house at rugby on himself he wanted a hedge because he wasnt sure about his ankle being all right you know he hurt it so i gave him four to one in halfsovereigns i thought he was a cert with apologies to you  dont mention it so he was a cert it was only the merest fluke i managed to out him when i did if hed hung on to the end hed have won easy hed been scoring points all through  i know so the sportsman says just like my luck  i cant see what you want to bet at all for youre bound to come a mucker sooner or later cant you raise the two quid  im broke except for half a crown  id lend it to you like a shot if i had it of course but you dont find me with two quid to my name at the end of term wont allen wait  he would if it was only him but this other chap wants his oof badly for something and hes leaving and going abroad or something at the end of term anyhow i know hes keen on getting it allen told me  tony pondered for a moment look here he said at last cant you ask your pater he usually heaves his money about pretty readily doesnt he  well you see he wouldnt send me two quid off the reel without wanting to know all about it and why i couldnt get on to the holidays with five bob and id either have to fake up a lot of lies which im not going to do  of course not  or else i must tell him ive been betting  well he bets himself doesnt he  thats just where the whole business slips up replied jim prodding the table with a pen in a misanthropic manner bettings the one thing hes absolutely down on he got done rather badly once a few years ago believe he betted on orme that year he got poisoned anyhow hes always sworn to lynch us if we made fools of ourselves that way so if i asked him id not only get beans myself besides not getting any money out of him but allen would get scalped too which he wouldnt see at all  yes its no good doing that havent you any other source of revenue  yes theres just one chance if that doesnt come off im done my pater said hed give me a quid for every race i won at the sports i got the half yesterday all right when you were up at aldershot  good man i didnt hear about that what time anything good  nothing special 27 and threefifths  thats awfully good you ought to pull off the mile too i should think  yes with luck drakes the man im afraid of hes done it in 448 twice during training he was second in the half yesterday by about three yards but you cant tell anything from that he sprinted too late  whats your best for the mile  i have done 447 but only once 448s my average so theres nothing to choose between us on paper  well youve got more to make you buck up than he has there must be something in that  yes by jove ill win if i expire on the tape i shant spare myself with that quid on the horizon  no hullo theres the bell we must buck up going to charteris gorge tonight  yes but i shant eat anything no risks for me  rusks are more in your line now come on  and in the excitement of these more personal matters tony entirely forgot to impart the news of the pavilion burglary to him     3  an unimportant byproduct   the news however was not long in spreading robinson took care of that on the way to school he overtook his friend morrison a young gentleman who had the unique distinction of being the rowdiest fag in wards house which as any austinian could have told you was the rowdiest house in the school  i say morrison heard the latest  no what  chap broke into the pav last night  who you  no you ass a regular burglar after the sports prizes  look here robinson try that on the kids  just what i am doing said robinson  this delicate reference to morrisons tender years had the effect of creating a disturbance two school house juniors who happened to be passing naturally forsook all their other aims and objects and joined the battle  whats up asked one of them dusting himself hastily as they stopped to take breath it was always his habit to take up any business that might attract his attention and ask for explanations afterwards  this kid began morrison  kid yourself morrison  this lunatic then robinson allowed the emendation to pass this lunatics got some yarn on about the pav being burgled  so it is tell you i saw it myself  did it yourself probably  how do you know anyway you seem so jolly certain about it  why theres a pane of glass cut out of the window in the first room  shouldnt wonder you know said dimsdale one of the two school house fags judicially if the kid wasnt telling the truth for once in his life those pots must be worth something dont you think so scott  scott admitted that there might be something in the idea and that however foreign to his usual habits robinson might on this occasion be confining himself more or less to strict fact  there you are then said robinson vengefully shows what a fat lot you know what youre talking about morrison  morrisons a fool said scott ever since he got off the bottom bench in form theres been no holding him  all the same said morrison feeling that matters were going against him i shant believe it till i see it  whatll you bet said robinson  i never bet replied morrison with scorn  you darent you know youd lose  all right then ill bet a penny im right he drew a deep breath as who should say its a lot of money but its worth risking it  youll lose that penny old chap said robinson thats to say he added thoughtfully if you ever pay up  youve got us as witnesses said dimsdale well see that he shells out scott remember youre a witness  rightho said scott  at this moment the clock struck nine and as each of the principals in this financial transaction and both the witnesses were expected to be in their places to answer their names at 858 they were late and as they had all been late the day before and the day before that they were presented with two hundred lines apiece which shows more than ever how wrong it is to bet  the news continuing to circulate by the end of morning school it was generally known that a gang of desperadoes numbering at least a hundred had taken the pavilion down brick by brick till only the foundations were left standing and had gone off with every jot and tittle of the unfortunately placed sports prizes  at the quartertoeleven interval the school had gone en masse to see what it could see and had stared at the window with much the same interest as they were wont to use in inspecting the first eleven pitch on the morning of a matcha curious custom by the way but one very generally observed  then the official news of the extent of the robbery was spread abroad it appeared that the burglar had by no means done the profession credit for out of a vast collection of prizes ranging from the vast and silver mile challenge cup to the pair of fivesgloves with which the under twelve disciple of deerfoot was to be rewarded he had selected only three two of these were worth having being the challenge cup for the quarter and the nonchallenge cup for the hundred yards both silver but the third was a valueless flask and the general voice of the school was loud in condemning the business abilities of one who could select his swag in so haphazard a manner it was felt to detract from the merit of the performance the knowing ones however gave it as their opinion that the man must have been frightened by something and so was unable to give the matter his best attention and do himself justice as a connoisseur  we had a burglary at my place once began reade of philpotts house the man  that rotter reade said barrett also of philpotts has been telling us that burglary chestnut of his all the morning i wish you chaps wouldnt encourage him  why what was it first ive heard of it at any rate dallas and vaughan of wards added themselves to the group out with it reade said vaughan  its only a beastly reminiscence of reades childhood said barrett a burglar got into the winecellar and collared all the coals  he didnt he was in the hall and my pater got his revolver  while you hid under the bed  and potted at him over the banisters  the last time but three you told the story your pater fired through the keyhole of the diningroom  you idiot that was afterwards  oh well what does it matter tell us something fresh  its my opinion said dallas that ward did it a man of the vilest antecedents hes capable of anything from burglary  to attempted poisoning you should see what we get to eat in wards house said vaughan  wards the worst type of beak he simply lives for the sake of booking chaps if he books a chap out of bounds it keeps him happy for a week  a man like thats bound to be a criminal of sorts in his spare time its action and reaction said vaughan  mr ward happening to pass at this moment the speaker went on to ask dallas audibly if life was worth living and dallas replied that under certain conditions and in some houses it was not  dallas and vaughan did not like mr ward mr ward was not the sort of man who inspires affection he had an unpleasant habit of jarring as it was called that is to say his conversation was shaped to one single end that of trying to make the person to whom he talked feel uncomfortable many of his jars had become part of the school history there was a legend that on one occasion he had invited his prefects to supper and regaled them with sausages there was still one prefect unhelped to him he addressed himself  a sausage jones  if you please sir  no you wont then because im going to have half myself  this story may or may not be true suffice it to say that mr ward was not popular  the discussion was interrupted by the sound of the bell ringing for second lesson the problem was left unsolved it was evident that the burglar had been interrupted but how or why nobody knew the suggestion that he had heard master r robinson training for his quartermile and had thought it was an earthquake found much favour with the junior portion of the assembly simpson on whom robinson had been given start in the race expressed an opinion that he robinson ran like a cow at which robinson smiled darkly and advised the other to wait till sports day and then hed see remarking that meanwhile if he gave him any of his cheek he might not be well enough to run at all  this sort of thing said barrett to reade as they walked to their formroom always makes me feel beastly once start a row like this and all the beaks turn into regular detectives and go ferreting about all over the place and its ten to one they knock up against something one doesnt want them to know about  reade was feeling hurt he had objected to the way in which barrett had spoiled a story that might easily have been true and really was true in parts his dignity was offended he said yes to barretts observation in a tone of reserved hauteur barrett did not notice  its an awful nuisance for one thing it makes them so jolly strict about bounds  yes  i wanted to go for a bike ride this afternoon theres nothing on at the school  why dont you  whats the good if you cant break bounds a ride of about a quarter of a miles no good theres a ripping place about ten miles down the stapleton road big wood with a ripping little hollow in the middle all ferns and moss i was thinking of taking a book out there for the afternoon only theres rollcall  he paused ordinarily this would have been the cue for reade to say oh ill answer your name at rollcall but reade said nothing barrett looked surprised and disappointed  i say reade he said  well  would you like to answer my name at rollcall it was the first time he had ever had occasion to make the request  no said reade  barrett could hardly believe his ears did he sleep did he dream or were visions about  what he said  no answer  do you mean to say you wont  of course i wont why the deuce should i do your beastly dirty work for you  barrett did not know what to make of this curiosity urged him to ask for explanations dignity threw cold water on such a scheme in the end dignity had the best of it  oh very well he said and they went on in silence in all the three years of their acquaintance they had never before happened upon such a crisis  the silence lasted until they reached the formroom then barrett determined in the interests of the common goodhe and reade shared a study and icy coolness in a small study is unpleasantto chain up dignity for the moment and give curiosity a trial  whats up with you today he asked  he could hardly have chosen a worse formula the question has on most people precisely the same effect as that which the query do you know where you lost it has on one who is engaged in looking for mislaid property  nothing said reade probably at the same moment hundreds of other people were making the same reply in the same tone of voice to the same question  oh said barrett  there was another silence  you might as well answer my name this afternoon said barrett tentatively  reade walked off without replying and barrett went to his place feeling that curiosity was a fraud and resolving to confine his attentions for the future to dignity this was byproduct number one of the pavilion burglary     4  certain revelations   during the last hour of morning school tony got a note from jim  graham said mr thompson the master of the sixth sadly just as tony was about to open it  yes sir  kindly tear that note up graham  note sir  kindly tear that note up graham come you are keeping us waiting  as the hero of the novel says further concealment was useless tony tore the note up unread  hope it didnt want an answer he said to jim after school constant practice has made thompson a sort of amateur lynx  no it was only to ask you to be in the study directly after lunch theres a most unholy row going to occur shortly as far as i can see  what about this burglary business  yes havent time to tell you now see you after lunch  after lunch having closed the study door jim embarked on the following statement  it appeared that on the previous night he had left a book of notes which were of absolutely vital importance for the examination which the sixth had been doing in the earlier part of the morning in the identical room in which the prizes had been placed or rather he had left it there several days before and had not needed it till that night at halfpast six the pavilion had been locked up and biffen the groundman had taken the key away with him and it was only after tea had been consumed and the evening paper read that jim thinking it about time to begin work had discovered his loss this was about halfpast seven  being a houseprefect jim did not attend preparation in the great hall with the common herd of the houses but was partowner with tony of a study  the difficulties of the situation soon presented themselves to him it was only possible to obtain the notes in three waysfirstly by going to the rooms of the sixth form master who lived out of college secondly by borrowing from one of the other sixth form members of the house and thirdly by the desperate expedient of burgling the pavilion the objections to the first course were two in the first place merevale was taking prep over in the hall and it was strictly forbidden for anyone to quit the house after lockup without leave and besides it was long odds that thompson the sixth form master would not have the notes as he had dictated them partly out of his head and partly from the works of various eminent scholars the second course was out of the question the only other sixth form boy in the house tony and welch being away at aldershot was charteris and charteris who never worked much except the night before an exam but worked then under forced draught was appalled at the mere suggestion of letting his notebook out of his hands jim had sounded him on the subject and had met with the reply kill my father and burn my ancestral home and i will look on and smile but touch these notes and you rouse the british lion after which he had given up the borrowing idea  there remained the third course and there was an excitement and sporting interest about it that took him immensely but how was he to get out to start with he opened his studywindow and calculated the risks of a drop to the ground no it was too far not worth risking a sprained ankle on the eve of the mile then he thought of the matrons sittingroom this was on the groundfloor and if its owner happened to be out exit would be easy as luck would have it she was out and in another minute jim had crossed the rubicon and was standing on the gravel drive which led to the front gate  a sharp sprint took him to the pavilion now the difficulty was not how to get out but how to get in theoretically it should have been the easiest of tasks but in practice there were plenty of obstacles to success he tried the lower windows but they were firmly fixed there had been a time when one of them would yield to a hard kick and fly bodily out of its frame but somebody had been caught playing that game not long before and jim remembered with a pang that not only had the window been securely fastened up but the culprit had had a spell of extra tuition and other punishments which had turned him for the time into a hater of his species his own fate he knew would be even worse for a prefect is supposed to have something better to do in his spare time than breaking into pavilions it would mean expulsion perhaps or at the least the loss of his prefects cap and jim did not want to lose that still the thing had to be done if he meant to score any marks at all in the forthcoming exam he wavered a while between a choice of methods and finally fixed on the crudest of all no one was likely to be within earshot thought he so he picked up the largest stone he could find took as careful aim as the dim light would allow and hove it there was a sickening crash loud enough he thought to bring the whole school down on him followed by a prolonged rattle as the broken pieces of glass fell to the ground  he held his breath and listened for a moment all was still uncannily still he could hear the tops of the trees groaning in the slight breeze that had sprung up and far away the distant roar of a train then a queer thing happened he heard a quiet thud as if somebody had jumped from a height on to grass and then quick footsteps  he waited breathless and rigid expecting every moment to see a form loom up beside him in the darkness it was useless to run his only chance was to stay perfectly quiet  then it dawned upon him that the man was running away from him not towards him his first impulse was to give chase but prudence restrained him catching burglars is an exhilarating sport but it is best to indulge in it when one is not on a burgling expedition oneself  besides he had come out to get his book and business is business  there was no time to be lost now for someone might have heard one or both of the noises and given the alarm  once the window was broken the rest was fairly easy the only danger being the pieces of glass he took off his coat and flung it on to the sill of the upper window in a few seconds he was up himself without injury he found it a trifle hard to keep his balance as there was nothing to hold on to but he managed it long enough to enable him to thrust an arm through the gap and turn the handle after this there was a bolt to draw which he managed without difficulty  the window swung open jim jumped in and groped his way round the room till he found his book the other window of the room was wide open he shut it for no definite reason and noticed that a pane had been cut out entire the professional cracksman had done his work more neatly than the amateur  poor chap thought jim with a chuckle as he effected a retreat i must have given him a bit of a start with my halfbrick after bolting the window behind him he climbed down  as he reached earth again the clock struck a quarter to nine in another quarter of an hour prep would be over and the house door unlocked and he would be able to get in again nor would the fact of his being out excite remark for it was the custom of the houseprefects to take the air for the few minutes which elapsed between the opening of the door and the final lockingup for the night  the rest of his adventures ran too smoothly to require a detailed description everything succeeded excellently the only reminiscences of his escapade were a few cuts in his coat which went unnoticed and the precious book of notes to which he applied himself with such vigour in the watches of the night with a surreptitious candle and a hamper of apples as aids to study that though tired next day he managed to do quite well enough in the exam to pass muster and as he had never had the least prospect of coming out top or even in the first five this satisfied him completely  tony listened with breathless interest to jims recital of his adventures and at the conclusion laughed  what a mad thing to go and do he said jolly sporting though  jim did not join in his laughter  yes but dont you see he said ruefully what a mess im in if they find out that i was in the pav at the time when the cups were bagged how on earth am i to prove i didnt take them myself  by jove i never thought of that but hang it all theyd never dream of accusing a coll chap of stealing sports prizes this isnt a reformatory for juvenile hooligans  no perhaps not  of course not  well even if they didnt the old man would be frightfully sick if he got to know about it id lose my prefects cap for a cert  you might certainly  i should there wouldnt be any question about it why dont you remember that business last summer about cairns he used to stay out after lockup that was absolutely all he did well the old un dropped on him like a hundredweight of bricks multiply that by about ten and you get what hell do to me if he books me over this job  tony looked thoughtful the case of cairns versus the powers that were was too recent to have escaped his memory even now cairns was to be seen on the grounds with a common school house cap at the back of his head in place of the prefects cap which had once adorned it  yes he said youd lose your cap all right im afraid  rather and the sickening part of the business is that this real copperbottomed burglaryll make them hunt about all over the shop for clues and things and the odds are theyll find me out even if they dont book the real man shouldnt wonder if they had a detective down for a big thing of this sort  they are having one i heard  there you are then said jim dejectedly im done you see  i dont know i dont believe detectives are much class  anyhow hell probably have gumption enough to spot me  jims respect for the abilities of our national sleuthhounds was greater than tonys and a good deal greater than that of most people     5  concerning the mutual friend   i wonder where the dear mutual gets to these afternoons said dallas  the who asked macarthur macarthur commonly known as the babe was a day boy dallas and vaughan had invited him to tea in their study  plunkett you know  why the mutual  mutual friend vaughans and mine shares this study with us i call him dear partly because hes head of the house and therefore of course we respect and admire him  and partly put in vaughan beaming at the babe over a fryingpan full of sausages partly because we love him so oh hes a beauty  no but rotting apart said the babe what sort of a chap is he i hardly know him by sight even  should describe him roughly said dallas as a hopeless forsaken unspeakable worm  understates it considerably remarked vaughan his manners are patronizing and his customs beastly  he wears spectacles and reads herodotus in the original greek for pleasure  he sneers at footer and jeers at cricket croquet is his form i should say should doubt though if he even plays that  but why on earth said the babe do you have him in your study  vaughan looked wildly and speechlessly at dallas who looked helplessly back at vaughan  dont babe please said dallas youve no idea how a remark of that sort infuriates us you surely dont suppose wed have the man in the study if we could help it  its another instance of ward at his worst said vaughan have you never heard the story of the mutual friends arrival  no  it was like this at the beginning of this term i came back expecting to be head of this show you see richards left at christmas and i was next man in dallas and i had made all sorts of arrangements for having a good time well i got back on the last evening of the holidays when i got into this study there was the man plunkett sitting in the best chair reading  probably reading herodotus in the original greek snorted dallas  he didnt take the slightest notice of me i stood in the doorway like patience on a monument for about a quarter of an hour then i coughed he took absolutely no notice i coughed again loud enough to crack the windows then i got tired of it and said hullo he did look up at that hullo he said youve got rather a nasty cough i said yes and waited for him to throw himself on my bosom and explain everything you know  did he asked the babe deeply interested  not a bit said dallas hesorry vaughan fire ahead  he went on reading after a bit i said i hoped he was fairly comfortable he said he was conversation languished again i made another shot looking for anybody i said no he said are you no then why the dickens should i be he said i didnt quite follow his argument in fact i dont even now look here i said tell me one thing have you or have you not bought this place if you have all right if you havent im going to sling you out and jolly soon too he looked at me in his superior sort of way and observed without blenching that he was head of the house  just another of wards jars said dallas knowing that vaughan was keen on being head of the house he actually went to the old man and persuaded him that it would be better to bring in some day boy who was a schoolprefect than let vaughan boss the show what do you think of that  pretty low said the babe  said i was thoughtless and headstrong cut in vaughan spearing a sausage as if it were mr wards body muffins up dallas old man when the sausages are done to a turn thoughtless and headstrong those were his very words  cant you imagine the old beast said dallas pathetically cant you see him getting round the old man a capital lad at heart i am sure distinctly a capital lad but thoughtless and headstrong far too thoughtless for a position so important as that of head of my house the abandoned old wreck  tea put an end for the moment to conversation but when the last sausage had gone the way of all flesh vaughan returned to the sore subject like a moth to a candle  it isnt only the not being head of the house that i bar its the man himself you say you havent studied plunkett much when you get to know him better youll appreciate his finer qualities more there are so few of them  the only fine quality ive ever seen in him said dallas is his habit of slinking off in the afternoons when he ought to be playing games and not coming back till lockup  which brings us back to where we started put in the babe you were wondering what he did with himself  yes it cant be anything good so well put beetles and butterflies out of the question right away he might go and poach theres heaps of opportunity round here for a chap who wants to try his hand at that i remember when i was a kid morton smith who used to be in this houseremember himtook me to old whatshisnames place whos that frantic blood who owns all that land along the badgwick road the mp man  milord sir alfred venner mp of badgwick hall  thats the man generally very much of badgwick hall came down last summer on prize day one would have thought from the side on him that he was all sorts of dooks anyhow mortonsmith took me rabbiting there i didnt know it was against the rules or anything had a grand time a few days afterwards milord sir venner copped him on the hop and he got sacked there was an awful row i thought my hair would have turned white  i shouldnt think the mutual poaches said vaughan he hasnt got the enterprise to poach an egg even no it cant be that  perhaps he bikes said the babe  no hes not got a bike hes the sort of chap though to borrow somebody elses without asking possibly he does bike  if he does said dallas its only so as to get well away from the coll before starting on his career of crime ill swear he does break rules like an ordinary human being when he thinks its safe those aggressively pious fellows generally do  i didnt know he was that sort said the babe dont you find it rather a jar  just a bit he jaws us sometimes till we turn and rend him  yes hes an awful man said vaughan  dont stop said the babe encouragingly after the silence had lasted some time its a treat picking a fellow to pieces like this  i dont know if thats your beastly sarcasm babe said vaughan but speaking for self and partner i dont know how we should get on if we didnt blow off steam occasionally in this style  we should probably last out for a week and then there would be a sharp shriek a hollow groan and all that would be left of the mutual friend would be a slight discolouration on the study carpet  coupled with an aroma of fresh gore  perhaps thats why he goes off in the afternoons suggested the babe doesnt want to run any risks  shouldnt wonder  hes such a rotten head of the house too said vaughan ward may gas about my being headstrong and thoughtless but im dashed if i would make a bally exhibition of myself like the mutual  whats he do enquired the babe  its not so much what he does its what he doesnt do that sickens me said dallas i may be a bit of a crock in some waysfor further details apply to wardbut i can stop a couple of fags ragging if i try  cant plunkett  not for nuts hes simply helpless when theres anything going on that he ought to stop why the other day there was a row in the fags room that you could almost have heard at your place babe we were up here working the mutual was jawing as usual on the subject of cramming tips for the aeschylus exam said it wasnt scholarship or some rot what business is it of his how a chap works i should like to know just as he had got under way the fags began kicking up more row than ever  i said cut in vaughan that instead of minding other peoples business hed better mind his own for a change and go down and stop the row  he looked a bit green at that said dallas said the row didnt interfere with him does with us i said its all very well for you you arent doing a stroke of work no amount of row matters to a chap whos only delivering a rotten sermon on scholarship vaughan and i happen to be trying to do some work all right he said if you want the row stopped why dont you go and stop it whats it got to do with me  rotter interpolated the babe  wasnt he well of course we couldnt stand that  we crushed him said vaughan  i said in my young days the head of the house used to keep order for himself i asked him what he thought he was here for because he isnt ornamental so he went down after that  well said the babe being a miserable day boy he had had no experience of the inner life of a boarding house which is the real life of a public school his experience of life at st austins was limited to doing his work and playing centrethreequarter for the fifteen which it may be remarked in passing he did extremely well  dallas took up the narrative well after hed been gone about five minutes and the row seemed to be getting worse than ever we thought wed better go down and investigate so we did  and when we got to the fags room said vaughan pointing the toastingfork at the babe by way of emphasis there was the mutual standing in the middle of the room gassing away with an expression on his face a cross between a village idiot and an unintelligent fried egg and all round him was a seething mass of fags half of them playing soccer with a tophat and the other half cheering wildly whenever the mutual opened his mouth  what did you do  we made an aggressive movement in force collared the hat brained every fag within reach and swore wed report them to the beak and so on they quieted down in about three and a quarter seconds by stopwatch and we retired taking the hat as a prize of war and followed by the mutual friend  he looked worried rather said vaughan and thank goodness he let us alone for the rest of the evening  thats only a sample though explained dallas that sort of thing has been going on the whole term if the head of a house is an abject lunatic theres bound to be ructions fags simply live for the sake of kicking up rows its meat and drink to them  i wish the mutual would leave said vaughan only that sort of chap always lingers on until he dies or gets sacked  hes not the sort of fellow to get sacked i should say said the babe  fraid not i wish i could shunt into some other house between ward and the mutual life here isnt worth living  theres merevales now said vaughan i wish i was in there in the first place youve got merevale he gets as near perfection as a beak ever does coaches the house footer and cricket and takes an intelligent interest in things generally then there are some decent fellows in merevales charteris welch graham thomson heaps of them  pity you came to wards said the babe why did you  my pater knew ward a bit if hed known him well hed have sent me somewhere else  my pater knew vaughans pater well who knew ward slightly and there you are voila comme des accidents arrivent  if ward wanted to lug in a day boy to be head of the house said vaughan harping once more on the old string he might at least have got somebody decent  theres the great babe himself babe why dont you come in next term  not much said the babe with a shudder  well even barring present company there are lots of chaps who would have jumped at the chance of being head of a house but nothing would satisfy ward but lugging the mutual from the bosom of his beastly family  we havent decided that point about where he goes to said the babe  at this moment the door of the study opened and the gentleman in question appeared in person he stood in the doorway for a few seconds gasping and throwing his arms about as if he found a difficulty in making his way in  i wish you two wouldnt make such an awful froust in the study every afternoon he observed pleasantly have you been having a little teaparty how nice  weve been brewing if thats what you mean said vaughan shortly  oh said plunkett i hope you enjoyed yourselves its nearly lockup macarthur  thats plunketts delicate way of telling you youre not wanted babe  well i suppose i ought to be going said the babe so long  and he went feeling grateful to providence for not having made his father like the fathers of vaughan and dallas a casual acquaintance of mr ward  the mutual friend really was a trial to vaughan and dallas only those whose fate it is or has been to share a study with an uncongenial companion can appreciate their feelings to the full three in a study is always something of a tight fit and when the three are in a state of perpetual warfare or at the best of armed truce things become very bad indeed  do you find it necessary to have teaparties every evening enquired plunkett after he had collected his books for the nights work the smell of burnt meat  fried sausages said vaughan perfectly healthy smell do you good  its quite disgusting really the air in here is hardly fit to breathe  youll find an excellent brand of air down in the senior study said dallas pointedly dont stay and poison yourself here on our account he added think of your family  i shall work where i choose said the mutual friend with dignity  of course so long as you do work you mustnt talk vaughan and i have got some livy to do  plunkett snorted and the passage of arms ended as it usually did in his retiring with his books to the senior study leaving dallas and vaughan to discuss his character once more in case there might be any points of it left upon which they had not touched in previous conversations  this robbery of the pots is a rum thing said vaughan thoughtfully when the last shreds of plunketts character had been put through the mincingmachine to the satisfaction of all concerned  yes its the sort of thing one doesnt think possible till it actually happens  what the dickens made them put the things in the pav at all they must have known it wouldnt be safe  well you see they usually cart them into the board room i believe only this time the governors were going to have a meeting there they couldnt very well meet in a room with the table all covered with silver pots  dont see why  well i suppose they could really but some of the governors are fairly nuts on strict form theres that crock who makes the twohour vote of thanks speeches on prize day you can see him rising to a point of order and fixing the old un with a fishy eye  well anyhow i dont see that they can blame a burglar for taking the pots if they simply chuck them in his way like that  no i say wed better weigh in with the livy the man wardll be round directly wheres the dic and our invaluable friend mr bohn right now you reel it off and ill keep an eye on the notes and they settled down to the business of the day  after a while vaughan looked up  whos going to win the mile he asked  whats the matter with thomson  how about drake then  thomson won the half  i knew youd say that the half isnt a test of a chaps mile form besides did you happen to see drakes sprint  jolly good one  i know but look how late he started for it thomson crammed on the pace directly he got into the straight drake only began to put it on when he got to the pav even then he wasnt far behind at the tape  no well im not plunging either way ought to be a good race  rather i say i wonder welch doesnt try his hand at the mile i believe he would do some rattling times if hed only try  why welch is a sprinter  i know but i believe for all that that the miles his distance hes always well up in the crosscountry runs  anyhow hes not in for it this year thomsons my man itll be a near thing though  jolly near thing with drake in front  thomson  drake  all right well see wonder why the beak doesnt come up i cant sit here doing livy all the evening and yet if we stop hes bound to look in  oh lord is that what youve been worrying about i thought youd developed the work habit or something wards all right hes out on the tiles tonight gone to a dinner at philpotts  good man how do you know are you certain  heard him telling prater this morning half the staff have gone good opportunity for a chap to go for a stroll if he wanted to shall we by the way  not for me thanks im in the middle of a rather special book ever read great expectations dickens you know  i know havent read it though always rather funk starting on a classic somehow good  my dear chap goods not the word  well after you exit livy then and a good job too you might pass us the great sherlock thanks  he plunged with the great detective into the mystery of the speckled band while vaughan opened great expectations at the place where he had left off the night before and a silence fell upon the study  curiously enough dallas was not the only member of wards house to whom it occurred that evening that the absence of the housemaster supplied a good opportunity for a stroll the idea had also struck plunkett favourably he was not feeling very comfortable downstairs on entering the senior study he found galloway an upper fourth member of the house already in possession galloway had managed that evening to insinuate himself with such success into the good graces of the matron that he had been allowed to stay in the house instead of proceeding with the rest of the study to the great hall for preparation the palpable failure of his attempt to hide the book he was reading under the table when he was disturbed led him to cast at the mutual friend the cause of his panic so severe and forbidding a look that that gentleman retired and made for the junior study  the atmosphere in the junior study was close and heavy with a blend of several strange odours plunkett went to the window then he noticed what he had never noticed before that there were no bars to the window only the glass stood between him and the outer world he threw up the sash as far as it would go there was plenty of room to get out so he got out he stood for a moment inhaling the fresh air then taking something from his coatpocket he dived into the shadows an hour passed in the study above dallas surfeited with mysteries and villainy put down his book and stretched himself  i say vaughan he said have you settled the house gym team yet its about time the list went up  eh what said vaughan coming slowly out of his book  dallas repeated his question  yes said vaughan got it somewhere on me haynes jarvis and myself are going in only the mutual has to stick up the list  it was the unwritten rule in wards as in most of the other houses at the school that none but the head of the house had the right of placing notices on the house board  i know said dallas ill go and buck him up now  dont trouble after prayersll do  its all right no trouble whom did you say yourself haynes  and jarvis not that hes any good but the third string never matters much and itll do him good to represent the house  right ill go and unearth the mutual  the result was that galloway received another shock to his system  dont glare galloway its rude said dallas  wheres plunkett got to he added  junior study said galloway  dallas went to the junior study there were plunketts books on the table but of their owner no signs were to be seen the mutual friend had had the good sense to close the window after he had climbed through it and dallas did not suspect what had actually happened he returned to vaughan  the mutual isnt in either of the studies he said i didnt want to spend the evening playing hideandseek with him so ive come back  it doesnt matter thanks all the same later onll do just as well  do you object to the window going up asked dallas theres a bit of a froust on in here  rather not heave it up  dallas hove it he stood leaning out looking towards the college buildings which stood out black and clear against the april sky from out of the darkness in the direction of stapleton sounded the monotonous note of a corncrake  jove he said its a grand night if i was at home now i shouldnt be cooped up indoors like this  holidays in another week said vaughan joining him it is ripping isnt it theres something not half bad in the coll buildings on a night like this i shall be jolly sorry to leave in spite of ward and the mutual  same here by jove weve each got a couple more years though if it comes to that hullo preps over  the sound of footsteps began to be heard from the direction of the college nine had struck from the school clock and the great hall was emptying  your turn to read at prayers vaughan hullo theres the mutual didnt hear him unlock the door glad he has though saves us trouble  i must be going down to look up a bit to read do you remember when harper read the same bit six days running i shall never forget wards pained expression harper explained that he thought the passage so beautiful that he couldnt leave it  why dont you try that tip  hardly my reputation hasnt quite the stamina for the test  vaughan left the room at the foot of the stairs he was met by the matron  will you unlock the door please vaughan she said handing him a bunch of keys the boys will be coming in in a minute  unlock the door repeated vaughan i thought it was unlocked all right  by jove he thought the plot thickens what is our only plunkett doing out of the house when the door is locked i wonder  plunkett strolled in with the last batch of the returning crowd wearing on his face the virtuous look of one who has been snatching a whiff of fresh air after a hard evenings preparation  oh i say plunkett said vaughan when they met in the study after prayers i wanted to see you where have you been  i have been in the junior study where did you think i had been  oh  do you doubt my word  ive the most exaggerated respect for your word but you werent in the junior study at five to nine  no i went up to my dormitory about that time you seem remarkably interested in my movements  only wanted to see you about the house gym team you might shove up the list tonight haynes jarvis and myself  very well  i didnt say anything to him said vaughan to dallas as they were going to their dormitories but you know theres something jolly fishy about the mutual that door wasnt unlocked when we saw him outside i unlocked it myself seems to me the mutuals been having a little private bust of his own on the quiet  thats rum he might have been out by the front way to see one of the beaks though  well even then he would be breaking rules you arent allowed to go out after lockup without house beaks leave no i find him guilty  if only hed go and get booked said vaughan then he might have to leave but he wont no such luck  no said dallas goodnight  goodnight  certainly there was something mysterious about the matter     6  a literary banquet   charteris and welch were conversing in the study of which they were the joint proprietors that is to say charteris was talking and playing the banjo alternately while welch was deep in a book and refused to be drawn out of it under any pretext charteris banjo was the joy of his fellows and the bane of his housemaster being of a musical turn and owning a good deal of pocketmoney he had at the end of the summer holidays introduced the delights of a phonograph into the house this being vetoed by the housemaster he had returned at the beginning of the following term with a penny whistle which had suffered a similar fate upon this he had invested in a banjo and the dazed merevale feeling that matters were getting beyond his grip had effected a compromise with him having ascertained that there was no specific rule at st austins against the use of musical instruments he had informed charteris that if he saw fit to play the banjo before prep only and regarded the hours between seven and eleven as a close time all should be forgiven and he might play if so disposed till the crack of doom to this reasonable request charteris had promptly acceded and peace had been restored charteris and welch were a curious pair welch spoke very little charteris was seldom silent they were both in the sixthwelch high up charteris rather low down in games welch was one of those fortunate individuals who are good at everything he was captain of cricket and not only captain but also the best allround man in the team which is often a very different matter he was the best wing threequarter the school possessed played fives and racquets like a professor and only the day before had shared tonys glory by winning the silver medal for fencing in the aldershot competition  the abilities of charteris were more ordinary he was a sound bat and went in first for the eleven and played half for the fifteen as regards work he might have been brilliant if he had chosen but his energies were mainly devoted to the compilation of a monthly magazine strictly unofficial entitled the glow worm this he edited and for the most part wrote himself it was a clever periodical and rarely failed to bring him in at least ten shillings per number after deducting the expenses which the college bookseller who acted as sole agent did his best to make as big as possible only a very few of the elect knew the identity of the editor and they were bound to strict secrecy on the day before the publication of each number a notice was placed in the desk of the captain of each form notifying him of what the morrow would bring forth and asking him to pass it round the form that was all the school did the rest the glow worm always sold well principally because of the personal nature of its contents if the average mortal is told that there is something about him in a paper he will buy that paper at your own price  today he was giving his monthly tea in honour of the new number only contributors were invited and the menu was always of the best it was a punch dinner only more so for these teas were celebrated with musical honours and charteris on the banjo was worth hearing his rendering of extracts from the works of messrs gilbert and sullivan was an intellectual treat  when i take the chair at our harmonic club he chanted fixing the unconscious welch with a fiery glance welch  yes  if this is your idea of a harmonic club it isnt mine put down that book and try and be sociable  one second said welch burrowing still deeper  thats what you always say said charteris look herecome in  there had been a knock at the door as he was speaking tony entered accompanied by jim they were regular attendants at these banquets for between them they wrote most of what was left of the magazine when charteris had done with it there was only one other contributor jackson of dawsons house and he came in a few minutes later welch was the athletics expert of the paper and did most of the match reports  now were complete said charteris as jackson presented himself gentlemenyour seats there are only four chairs and we as wordsworth might have said but didnt are five all right ill sit on the table welch you worm away with melancholy take away his book somebody thats right who says what tea already made coffee published shortly if anybody wants cocoa ive got some only youll have to boil more water i regret the absence of menucards but as the entire feast is visible to the naked eye our loss is immaterial the offertory will be for the church expenses fund biscuits please  i wish youd given this tea after next saturday alderman said jim charteris was called the alderman on account of his figure which was inclined to stoutness and his general capacity for consuming food  never put off till tomorrowwhy  i simply must keep fit for the mile hows welch to run too if he eats this sort of thing he pointed to the wellspread board  yes theres something in that said tony thank goodness my little entertainments over i think i will try one of those chocolate things thanks  welch is all right said jackson he could win the hundred and the quarter on sausagerolls but think of the times  and there observed charteris there my young friend you have touched upon a sore subject before you came in i was administering a few wholesome words of censure to that miserable object on your right what is a fifth of a second more or less that it should make a man insult his digestion as welch does youll hardly credit it but for the last three weeks or more i have been forced to look on a fellowbeing refusing pastry and drinking beastly extracts of meat all for the sake of winning a couple of races it quite put me off my feed cake please good robust slice thanks  its rather funny when you come to think of it said tony welch lives on bovril for a month and then just as he thinks hes going to score a burglar with a sense of humour strolls into the pav carefully selects the only two cups he had a chance of winning and so to bed  leaving master j g welch an awful example of what comes of training said jim welch youre a rotter  it isnt my fault observed welch plaintively you chaps seem to think ive committed some sort of crime just because a man i didnt know from adam has bagged a cup or two  it looks to me said charteris as if welch thinking his chances of the quarter rather rocky hired one of his low acquaintances to steal the cup for him  shouldnt wonder welch knows some jolly low characters in stapleton  welch is a jolly low character himself said tony judicially i wonder you associate with him alderman  stand in loco parentis aunt of his asked me to keep an eye on him dear george is so wild she said  before welch could find words to refute this hideous slander tony cut in once more  the only reason he doesnt drink gin and play billiards at the blue lion is that gin makes him ill and his best break at pills is six including two flukes  as a matter of fact said welch changing the conversation with a jerk i dont much care if the cups are stolen one doesnt only run for the sake of the pot  charteris groaned oh well said he if youre going to take the high moral standpoint and descend to brazen platitudes like that i give you up  its a rum thing about those pots said welch meditatively  seems to me jim rejoined the rum thing is that a man who considers the pav a safe place to keep a lot of valuable prizes in should be allowed at large why couldnt they keep them in the board room as they used to  thought it ud save trouble i suppose save them carting the things over to the pav on sports day hazarded tony  saved the burglar a lot of trouble i should say observed jackson i could break into the pav myself in five minutes  good old jackson said charteris have a shot tonight ill hold the watch im doing a leader on the melancholy incident for next months glow worm it appears that master reginald robinson a member of mr merevales celebrated boardingestablishment was passing by the pavilion at an early hour on the morning of the second of aprilthats todaywhen his eye was attracted by an excavation or incision in one of the windows of that imposing edifice his narrative appears on another page interviewed by a glow worm representative master robinson who is a fine healthy bronzed young englishman of some thirteen summers with a delightful boyish flow of speech not wholly free from a suspicion of cheek gave it as his opinion that the outrage was the work of a burglara remarkable display of sagacity in one so young a portrait of master robinson appears on another page  everything seems to appear on another page said jim am i to do the portrait  i think it would be best you can never trust a photo to caricature a person enough your facial hbs the thing  have you heard whether anything else was bagged besides the cups asked welch  not that i know of said jim  yes there was said jackson it further appears that that lunatic adamson had left some money in the pocket of his blazer which he had left in the pav overnight on enquiry it was found that the money had also left  adamson was in the same house as jackson and had talked of nothing else throughout the whole of lunch he was an abnormally wealthy individual however and it was generally felt though he himself thought otherwise that he could afford to lose some of the surplus  how much asked jim  two pounds  at this jim gave vent to the exclamation which mr barry pain calls the englishmans shortest prayer  my dear sir said charteris my very dear sir we blush for you might i ask why you take the matter to heart so  jim hesitated  better have it out jim said tony these chapsll keep it dark all right and jim entered once again upon the recital of his doings on the previous night  so you see he concluded this two pound business makes it all the worse  i dont see why said welch  well you see moneys a thing everybody wants whereas cups wouldnt be any good to a fellow at school so that i should find it much harder to prove that i didnt take the two pounds than i should have done to prove that i didnt take the cups  but theres no earthly need for you to prove anything said tony theres not the slightest chance of your being found out  exactly observed charteris we will certainly respect your incog if you wish it wild horses shall draw no evidence from us it is of course very distressing but what is man after all are we not as the beasts that perish and is not our little life rounded by a sleep indeed yes and nowwith full chorus please     wee take him from the city or the plough    wee dress him up in uniform so neeeat  and at the third line some plaster came down from the ceiling and merevale came up and the meeting dispersed without the customary cheers     7  barrett explores   barrett stood at the window of his study with his hands in his pockets looking thoughtfully at the football field now and then he whistled that was to show that he was very much at his ease he whistled a popular melody of the day three times as slowly as its talented composer had originally intended it to be whistled and in a strange minor key some people when offended invariably whistle in this manner and these are just the people with whom if you happen to share a study with them it is rash to have differences of opinion reade who was deep in a bookthough not so deep as he would have liked the casual observer to fancy him to bewould have given much to stop barretts musical experiments to ask him to stop in so many words was of course impossible offended dignity must draw the line somewhere that is one of the curious results of a polite education when two gentlemen of hoxton or the borough have a misunderstanding they address one another with even more freedom than is their usual custom when one member of a public school falls out with another member his politeness in dealing with him becomes so chesterfieldian that one cannot help being afraid that he will sustain a strain from which he will never recover  after a time the tension became too much for barrett he picked up his cap and left the room reade continued to be absorbed in his book  it was a splendid day outside warm for april and with just that freshness in the air which gets into the blood and makes spring the best time of the whole year barrett had not the aesthetic soul to any appreciable extent but he did know a fine day when he saw one and even he realized that a day like this was not to be wasted in pottering about the school grounds watching the under thirteen hundred yards trial heats and the under fourteen broad jump or doing occasional exercises in the gymnasium it was a day for going far afield and not returning till lockup he had an object too everything seemed to shout eggs at him to remind him that he was an enthusiast on the subject and had a collection to which he ought to seize this excellent opportunity of adding the only question was where to go the surrounding country was a paradise for the naturalist who had no absurd scruples on the subject of trespassing to the west in the direction of stapleton the woods and hedges were thick with nests but then so they were to the east along the badgwick road he wavered but a recollection that there was water in the badgwick direction and that he might with luck beard a waterwagtail in its lair decided him what is life without a waterwagtails egg a mere mockery he turned east  hullo barrett where are you off to grey of praters house intercepted him as he was passing  going to see if i can get some eggs are you coming  grey hesitated he was a keen naturalist too  no i dont think i will thanks got an uncle coming down to see me  well cut off before he comes  no hed be too sick besides he added ingenuously theres a possible tip dont want to miss that im simply stony always am at end of term  oh said barrett realizing that further argument would be thrown away well so long then  so long hope you have luck  thanks i say  well  rollcall you know if you dont see me anywhere about you might answer my name  all right and if you find anything decent you might remember me you know pretty well what ive got already  right i will  magpies what i want particularly where are you going by the way  thought of having a shot at old venners woods im after a waterwagtail myself ought to be one or two in the dingle  heaps probably but i should advise you to look out you know venners awfully down on trespassing  yes the bounder but i dont think hell get me one gets the knack of keeping fairly quiet with practice  hes got thousands of keepers  millions  dogs too  dash his beastly dogs i like dogs why are you such a croaker today grey  well you know hes had two chaps sacked for going in his woods to my certain knowledge mortonsmith and ainsworth thats only since ive been at the coll too probably lots more before that  ainsworth was booked smoking there thats why he was sacked and venner caught mortonsmith himself simply staggering under dead rabbits they sack any chap for poaching  well i dont see how youre going to show youve not been poaching besides its miles out of bounds  grey said barrett severely im surprised at you go away and meet your beastly uncle fancy talking about bounds at your time of life  well dont forget me when youre hauling in the eggs  right you are so long  barrett proceeded on his way his last difficulty safely removed he could rely on grey not to bungle that matter of rollcall grey had been there before  a long white ribbon of dusty road separated st austins from the lodge gates of badgwick hall the country seat of sir alfred venner mp also of 49a lancaster gate london barrett walked rapidly for over halfanhour before he came in sight of the great iron gates flanked on the one side by a trim little lodge and green meadows and on the other by woods of a darker green having got so far he went on up the hill till at last he arrived at his destination a small hedge a sloping strip of green and then the famous dingle i am loath to inflict any scenic rhapsodies on the reader but really the dingle deserves a line or two it was the most beautiful spot in a country noted for its fine scenery dense woods were its chief feature and by dense i mean wellsupplied not only with trees excellent things in themselves but for the most part useless to the nest hunter but also with a fascinating tangle of undergrowth where every bush seemed to harbour eggs all carefully preserved too that was the chief charm of the place since the sad episodes of mortonsmith and ainsworth the school for the most part had looked askance at the dingle once a select party from dacres house headed by babington who always got himself into hot water when possible had ventured into the forbidden land and had returned hurriedly later in the afternoon with every sign of exhaustion hinting breathlessly at keepers dogs and a pursuit that had lasted fifty minutes without a check since then no one had been daring enough to brave the terrors so carefully prepared for them by milord sir venner and his minions and the proud owner of the dingle walked his woods in solitary state occasionally he would personally conduct some favoured guest thither and show him the wonders of the place but this was not a frequent occurrence on stillless frequent occasions there were large shooting parties in the dingle but as a rule the word was keepers only no others need apply  a futile iron railing some three feet in height shut in the dingle barrett jumped this lightly and entered forthwith into paradise the place was full of nests as barrett took a step forward there was a sudden whirring of wings and a bird rose from a bush close beside him he went to inspect and found a nest with seven eggs in it only a thrush of course as no one ever wants thrushes eggs the world is overstocked with them still it gave promise of good things to come barrett pushed on through the bushes and the promise was fulfilled he came upon another nest five eggs this time of a variety he was unable with his moderate knowledge to classify at any rate he had not got them in his collection nor to the best of his belief had grey he took one for each of them  now this was all very well thought barrett but what he had come for was the ovular deposit of the waterwagtail through the trees he could see the silver gleam of the brook at the foot of the hill the woods sloped down to the very edge then came the brook widening out here into the size of a small river then woods again all up the side of the opposite hill barrett hurried down the slope  he had put on flannels for this emergency he was prepared to wade to swim if necessary he hoped that it would not be necessary for in april water is generally inclined to be chilly of keepers he had up till now seen no sign once he had heard the distant bark of a dog it seemed to come from far across the stream and he had not troubled about it  in the midst of the bushes on the bank stood a tree it was not tall compared to the other trees of the dingle but standing alone as it did amongst the undergrowth it attracted the eye at once barrett looking at it saw something which made him forget waterwagtails for the moment in a fork in one of the upper branches was a nest an enormous nest roughly constructed of sticks it was a very jerrybuilt residence evidently run up for the season by some prudent bird who knew by experience that no nest could last through the winter and so had declined to waste his time in useless decorative work but what bird was it no doubt there are experts to whom a woodpigeons nest is something apart and distinct from the nest of the magpie but to your unsophisticated amateur a nest that is large may be anythingrooks magpies pigeons or great auks to such an one the only true test lies in the eggs solvitur ambulando barrett laid the pillboxes containing the precious specimens he had found in the nest at the top of the hill at the foot of the tree and began to climb  it was to be a day of surprises for him when he had got half way up he found himself on a kind of ledge which appeared to be a kind of junction at which the tree branched off into two parts to the left was the nest high up in its fork to the right was another shoot he realized at once with keen disappointment that it would be useless to go further the branches were obviously not strong enough to bear his weight he looked down preparatory to commencing the descent and to his astonishment found himself looking into a black cavern in his eagerness to reach the nest he had not noticed before that the tree was hollow  this made up for a great many things his disappointment became less keen few things are more interesting than a hollow tree  wonder how deep it goes down he said to himself he broke off a piece of wood and dropped it down the hollow it seemed to reach the ground uncommonly soon he tried another piece the sound of its fall came up to him almost simultaneously evidently the hole was not deep he placed his hands on the edge and let himself gently down into the darkness his feet touched something solid almost immediately as far as he could judge the depth of the cavity was not more than five feet standing up at his full height he could just rest his chin on the edge  he seemed to be standing on some sort of a floor roughly made but too regular to be the work of nature evidently someone had been here before he bent down to make certain there was more room to move about in than he suspected a man sitting down would find it not uncomfortable  he brushed his hand along the floor certainly it seemed to be constructed of boards then his hand hit something small and hard he groped about until his fingers closed on it it waswhat was it he could hardly make out for the moment suddenly as he moved it something inside it rattled now he knew what it was it was the very thing he most needed a box of matches  the first match he struck promptly and naturally went out no first match ever stays alight for more than threefifths of a second the second was more successful the sudden light dazzled him for a moment when his eyes had grown accustomed to it the match went out he lit a third and this time he saw all round the little chamber great scott he said the place is a regular poultry shop all round the sides were hung pheasants and partridges in various stages of maturity here and there the fur of a rabbit or a hare showed up amongst the feathers barrett hit on the solution of the problem directly he had been shown a similar collection once in a tree on his fathers land the place was the headquarters of some poacher barrett was full of admiration for the ingenuity of the man in finding so safe a hidingplace  he continued his search in one angle of the tree was a piece of sacking barrett lifted it he caught a glimpse of something bright but before he could confirm the vague suspicion that flashed upon him his match burnt down and lay smouldering on the floor his hand trembled with excitement as he started to light another it broke off in his hand at last he succeeded the light flashed up and there beside the piece of sacking which had covered them were two cups he recognized them instantly  jove he gasped the sports pots now how on earth  at this moment something happened which took his attention away from his discovery with painful suddenness from beneath him came the muffled whine of a dog he listened holding his breath no he was not mistaken the dog whined again and broke into an excited bark somebody at the foot of the tree began to speak     8  barrett ceases to explore   fetchimout said the voice all in one word  nice cheery remark to make thought barrett hell have to do a good bit of digging before he fetches me out im a fixture for the present  there was a sound of scratching as if the dog in his eagerness to oblige were trying to uproot the tree barrett realizing that unless the keeper took it into his head to climb which was unlikely he was as safe as if he had been in his study at philpotts chuckled within himself and listened intently  what is it then said the keeper good dog at em fetch him out jack  jack barked excitedly and redoubled his efforts  the sound of scratching proceeded  rrratsss said the mendacious keeper jack had evidently paused for breath barrett began quite to sympathize with him the thought that the animal was getting farther away from the object of his search with every ounce of earth he removed tickled him hugely he would have liked to have been able to see the operations though at present it was like listening to a conversation through a telephone he could only guess at what was going on  then he heard somebody whistling the lincolnshire poacher a strangely inappropriate air in the mouth of a keeper the sound was too far away to be the work of jacks owner unless he had gone for a stroll since his last remark no it was another keeper a new voice came up to him  ullo ned whats the dog after  thinks es smelt a rabbit seems to me  aint a rabbit hole ere  thinks there is anyhow look at the pore beast  they both laughed jack meanwhile unaware that he was turning himself into an exhibition to make a keepers holiday dug assiduously come away jack said the first keeper at length aint nothin there ought to know that clever dog like you  there was a sound as if he had pulled jack bodily from his hole  wait ere ned whats that on the ground there barrett gasped his pillboxes had been discovered surely they would put two and two together now and climb the tree after him  eggs two of em ow did they get ere then  its one of them young devils from the school master says to me this morning look out e says saunders for them boys as come in ere after eggs and frighten all the birds out of the dratted place you keep your eyes open saunders e says  well if es still in the woods well ave im safe  if hes still in the woods thought barrett with a shiver  after this there was silence barrett waited for what he thought was a quarter of an hourit was really five minutes or lessthen he peeped cautiously over the edge of his hidingplace yes they had certainly gone unlesshorrible thoughtthey were waiting so close to the trunk of the tree as to be invisible from where he stood he decided that the possibility must be risked he was down on the ground in record time nothing happened no hand shot out from its ambush to clutch him he breathed more freely and began to debate within himself which way to go up the hill it must be of course but should he go straight up or to the left or to the right he would have given much to know which way the keepers had gone particularly he of the dog they had separated he knew he began to reason the thing out in the first place if they had separated they must have gone different ways it did not take him long to arrive at that conclusion the odds therefore were that one had gone to the right upstream the other downstream to the left his knowledge of human nature told him that nobody would willingly walk uphill if it was possible for him to walk on the flat therefore assuming the two keepers to be human they had gone along the valley therefore his best plan would be to make straight for the top of the hill as straight as he could steer and risk it just as he was about to start his eye caught the two pillboxes lying on the turf a few yards from where he had placed them  may as well take what i can get he thought he placed them carefully in his pocket as he did so a faint bark came to him on the breeze from downstream that must be friend jack he waited no longer but dived into the bushes in the direction of the summit he was congratulating himself on being out of dangeralready he was more than half way up the hillwhen suddenly he received a terrible shock from the bushes to his left not ten yards from where he stood came the clear sharp sound of a whistle the sound was repeated and this time an answer came from far out to his right before he could move another whistle joined in again from the left but farther off and higher up the hill than the first he had heard he recalled what grey had said about millions of keepers the expression he thought had understated the true facts if anything he remembered the case of babington it was a moment for action no guile could save him now it must be a stern chase for the rest of the distance he drew a breath and was off like an arrow the noise he made was appalling no one in the wood could help hearing it  stop there shouted someone the voice came from behind a fact which he noted almost automatically and rejoiced at he had a start at any rate  stop shouted the voice once again the whistle blew like a steam siren and once more the other two answered it they were all behind him now surely a man of the public schools in flannels and gymnasium shoes and trained to the last ounce for just such a sprint as this could beat a handful of keepers in their leggings and heavy boots barrett raced on close behind him a crashing in the undergrowth and the sound of heavy breathing told him that keeper number one was doing his best to left and right similar sounds were to be heard but barrett had placed these competitors out of the running at once the race was between him and the man behind  fifty yards of difficult country bushes which caught his clothes as if they were trying to stop him in the interests of law and order branches which lashed him across the face and rabbitholes half hidden in the bracken and still he kept his lead he was increasing it he must win now the man behind was panting in deep gasps for the pace had been warm and he was not in training barrett cast a glance over his shoulder and as he looked the keepers foot caught in a hole and he fell heavily barrett uttered a shout of triumph victory was his  in front of him was a small hollow fringed with bushes collecting his strength he cleared these with a bound then another of the events of this eventful afternoon happened instead of the hard turf his foot struck something soft something which sat up suddenly with a yell barrett rolled down the slope and halfway up the other side like a shot rabbit dimly he recognized that he had jumped on to a human being the figure did not wear the official velveteens therefore he had no business in the dingle and close behind thundered the keeper now on his feet once more dust on his clothes and wrath in his heart in equal proportions look out man shouted barrett as the injured person rose to his feet run cut quick keeper there was no time to say more he ran another second and he was at the top over the railing and in the good honest public highroad again safe a hoarse shout of got yer from below told a harrowing tale of capture the stranger had fallen into the hands of the enemy very cautiously barrett left the road and crept to the railing again it was a rash thing to do but curiosity overcame him he had to see or if that was impossible to hear what had happened  for a moment the only sound to be heard was the gasping of the keeper after a few seconds a rapidly nearing series of crashes announced the arrival of the man from the right flank of the pursuing forces while almost simultaneously his colleague on the left came up  barrett could see nothing but it was easy to understand what was going on keeper number one was exhibiting his prisoner his narrative punctuated with gasps was told mostly in hoarse whispers and barrett missed most of it  foot gasp rabbitole more gasps up agen  minute  indistinct mutterings  and triumphantly cotched im  exclamations of approval from the other two i assure you said another voice the prisoner was having his say i assure you that i was doing no harm whatever in this wood i  better tell that tale to sir alfred cut in one of his captors  ell learn yer said the keeper previously referred to as number one vindictively he was feeling shaken up with his run and his heavy fall and his temper was proportionately short  i swear ive heard that voice before somewhere thought barrett wonder if its a coll chap  keeper number one added something here which was inaudible to barrett  i tell you im not a poacher said the prisoner indignantly and i object to your language i tell you i was lying here doing nothing and some fool or other came and jumped on me i  the rest was inaudible but barrett had heard enough  i knew id heard that voice before plunkett by jove golly what is the world coming to when heads of houses and schoolprefects go on the poach fancy plunkett of all people too this is a knockout im hanged if it isnt  from below came the sound of movement the keepers were going down the hill again to barretts guilty conscience it seemed that they were coming up he turned and fled  the hedge separating sir alfred venners land from the road was not a high one though the drop the other side was considerable barrett had not reckoned on this he leapt the hedge and staggered across the road at the same moment a greyclad cyclist who was pedalling in a leisurely manner in the direction of the school arrived at the spot a collision seemed imminent but the stranger in a perfectly composed manner as if he had suddenly made up his mind to take a sharp turning rode his machine up the bank whence he fell with easy grace to the road just in time to act as a cushion for barrett the two lay there in a tangled heap barrett was the first to rise     9  enter the sleuthhound   im awfully sorry he said disentangling himself carefully from the heap i hope youre not hurt  the man did not reply for a moment he appeared to be laying the question before himself as an impartial judge as who should say now tell me candidly are you hurt speak freely and without bias  no he said at last feeling his left leg as if he were not absolutely easy in his mind about that no not hurt thank you not much that is he added with the air of one who thinks it best to qualify too positive a statement left leg shin slight bruise nothing to signify  it was a rotten thing to do jumping over into the road like that said barrett didnt remember thered be such a big drop  my fault in a way said the man riding wrong side of road out for a run  more or less  excellent thing  yes  it occurred to barrett that it was only due to the man on whom he had been rolling to tell him the true facts of the case besides it might do something towards removing the impression which must he felt be forming in the strangers mind that he was mad  you see he said in a burst of confidence it was rather a close thing there were some keepers after me  ah said the man thought so trespassing  yes  ah keepers dont like trespassers curious thingdont know if it ever occurred to youif there were no trespassers there would be no need for keepers to their interest then to encourage trespassers but do they  barrett admitted that they did not very conspicuously  no same with all professions not poaching i suppose  rather not i was after eggs by jove that reminds me he felt in his pocket for the pillboxes could they have survived the stormy times through which they had been passing he heaved a sigh of relief as he saw that the eggs were uninjured he was so intent on examining them that he missed the strangers next remark  sorry what i didnt hear  asked if i was going right for st austins school  college said barrett with a convulsive shudder the most deadly error mortal man can make with the exception of calling a school a college is to call a college a school  college said the man is this the road  yes you cant miss it im going there myself its only about a mile  ah said the man with a touch of satisfaction in his voice going there yourself are you perhaps youre one of the scholars  not much said barrett ask our formbeak if im a scholar oh i see yes im there all right  barrett was a little puzzled as to how to class his companion no old public school man would talk of scholars and yet he was emphatically not a bargee barrett set him down as a sort of superior tourist a henry as opposed to an arry  been bit of a disturbance there hasnt there cricket pavilion cups  rather but how on earth  how on earth did i get to hear of it you were going to say well no need to conceal anything fact is down here to look into the matter detective name roberts scotland yard now we know each other and if you can tell me one or two things about this burglary it would be a great help to me and i should be very much obliged  barrett had heard that a detective was coming down to look into the affair of the cups his position was rather a difficult one in a sense it was simple enough he had found the cups he could keepers permitting go and fetch them now and there wouldno there would not be an end of the matter it would be very pleasant exceedingly pleasant to go to the headmaster and the detective and present the cups to them with a bless you my children air the headmaster would say barrett youre a marvel how can i thank you sufficiently while the detective would observe that he had been in the profession over twenty years but never had he seen so remarkable an exhibition of sagacity and acumen as this that at least was what ought to take place but barretts experience of life short as it was had taught him the difference between the ideal and the real the real he suspected would in this case be painful certain facts would come to light when had he found the cups about four in the afternoon oh rollcall took place at four in the afternoon how came it that he was not at rollcall furthermore how came it that he was marked on the list as having answered his name at that ceremony where had he found the cups in a hollow tree just so where was the hollow tree in sir alfred venners woods did he know that sir alfred venners woods were out of bounds did he know that in consequence of complaints from sir alfred venner sir alfred venners woods were more out of bounds than any other out of bounds woods in the entire county that did not belong to sir alfred venner he did ah no the word for his guidance in this emergency he felt instinctively was mum time might provide him with a solution he might for instance abstract the cups secretly from their restingplace place them in the middle of the football field and find them there dramatically after morning school or he might reveal his secret from the carriage window as his train moved out of the station on the first day of the holidays there was certain to be some way out of the difficulty but for the present silence  he answered his companions questions freely however of the actual burglary he knew no more than any other member of the school considerably less indeed than jim thomson of merevales at present staggering under the weight of a secret even more gigantic than barretts own in return for his information he extracted sundry reminiscences the scar on the detectives cheekbone barely visible now was the mark of a bullet which a certain burglar named singularly enough roberts had fired at him from a distance of five yards the gentleman in question who the detective hastened to inform barrett was no relation of his though owning the same name happened to be a poor marksman and only scored a bad outer assuming the detectives face to have been the bull he also turned up his cuff to show a larger scar this was another testimonial from the burglar world a kensington practitioner had had the bad taste to bite off a piece of that part of the detective in short barrett enlarged his knowledge of the seamy side of things considerably in the mile of road which had to be traversed before st austins appeared in sight the two parted at the big gates barrett going in the direction of philpotts the detective wheeling his machine towards the porters lodge  barretts condition when he turned in at philpotts door was critical he was so inflated with news that any attempt to keep it in might have serious results certainly he could not sleep that night in such a bomblike state  it was thus that he broke in upon reade reade had passed an absurdly useless afternoon he had not stirred from the study for all that it would have mattered to him it might have been raining hard the whole afternoon instead of being as it had been the finest afternoon of the whole term in a word and not to put too fine a point on the matter he had been frousting and consequently was feeling dull and sleepy and generally undervitalized and futile barrett entered the study with a rush and was carried away by excitement to such an extent that he addressed reade as if the deadly feud between them not only did not exist but never had existed  i say reade heave that beastly book away my aunt i have had an afternoon of it  oh said reade politely where did you go  after eggs in the dingle  reade was fairly startled out of his dignified reserve for the first time since they had had their little difference he addressed barrett in a sensible manner  you idiot he said  dont see it the dingles just the place to spend a happy day like rosherville jove its worth going there you should see the birds place is black with em  how about keepers see any  did i not three of them chased me like good uns all over the place  you got away all right though  only just i say do you know what happened you know that rotter plunkett used to be a day boy head of wards now wears specs  yes  well just as i was almost out of the wood i jumped a bush and landed right on top of him the man was asleep or something fancy choosing the dingle of all places to sleep in where you cant go a couple of yards without running into a keeper he hadnt even the sense to run i yelled to him to look out and then i hooked it myself and then the nearest keeper whod just come down a buster over a rabbithole sailed in and had him i couldnt do anything of course  jove therell be a fairsized row about this the old mans on to trespassing like tar i say think plunkettll say anything about you being there too  shouldnt think so for one thing i dont think he recognized me probably doesnt know me by sight and he was fast asleep too no i fancy im all right  well it was a jolly narrow shave anything else happen  anything else just a bit thats to say no nothing much else no  now then said reade briskly none of your beastly mysteries out with it  look here swear youll keep it dark  of course i will  on your word of honour  if you think began reade in an offended voice  no its all right dont get shirty the thing is though its so frightfully important to keep it dark  well buck up  well you neednt believe me of course but ive found the pots  reade gasped  what he cried the pot for the quarter  and the one for the hundred yards both of them its a fact  but where how what have you done with them  barrett unfolded his tale concisely  you see he concluded what a hole im in i cant tell the old man anything about it or i get booked for cutting rollcall and going out of bounds and then while im waiting and wondering what to do and all that the thief whoever he is will most likely go off with the pots what do you think i ought to do  reade perpended  well he said all you can do is to lie low and trust to luck as far as i can see besides theres one consolation this plunkett businessll make every keeper in the dingle twice as keen after trespassers so the pot man wont get a chance of getting the things away  yes theres something in that admitted barrett  its all you can do said reade  yes unless i wrote an anonymous letter to the old man explaining things how would that do  do for you probably anonymous letters always get traced to the person who wrote them or pretty nearly always no you simply lie low  right said barrett i will  the process of concealing ones superior knowledge is very irritating so irritating indeed that very few people do it barrett however was obliged to by necessity he had a good chance of displaying his abilities in that direction when he met grey the next morning  hullo said grey have a good time yesterday  not bad ive got an egg for you  good man what sort  hanged if i know i know you havent got it though  thanks awfully see anything of the million keepers  heard them oftener than i saw them  they didnt book you  rather fancy one of them saw me but i got away all right  find the place pretty lively  pretty fair  stay there long  not very  no thought you wouldnt what do you say to a small ice theres time before school  thanks are you flush  flush isnt the word for it im a plutocrat  uncle came out fairly strong then  rather to the tune of one sovereign cash hes a jolly good sort my uncle  so it seems said barrett  the meeting then adjourned to the school shop barrett enjoying his ice all the more for the thought that his secret still was a secret a thing which it would in all probability have ceased to be had he been rash enough to confide it to k st h grey who whatever his other merits was very far from being the safest sort of confidant his usual practice was to speak first and to think if at all afterwards     10  mr thompson investigates   the pavilion burglary was discussed in other places besides charteris study in the masters common room the matter came in for its full share of comment the masters were as at most schools divided into the athletic and nonathletic and it was for the former class that the matter possessed most interest if it had been that apple of the college librarys eye the original ms of st austins private diary or even that lesser treasure the blackletter eucalyptides that had disappeared the elder portion of the staff would have had a great deal to say upon the subject but apart from the excitement caused by the strangeness of such an occurrence the theft of a couple of sports prizes had little interest for them  on the borderline between these two castes came mr thompson the master of the sixth form spelt with a p and no relation to the genial james or the amiable allen with the former of whom indeed he was on very indifferent terms of friendship mr thompson though an excellent classic had no knowledge of the inwardness of the human boy he expected every member of his form not only to be earnestwhich very few members of a sixth form arebut also to communicate his innermost thoughts to him his aim was to be their confidant the wise friend to whom they were to bring their troubles and come for advice he was in fact poor man the good young master now it is generally the case at school that troubles are things to be worried through alone and any attempt at interference is usually resented mr thompson had asked jim to tea and while in the very act of passing him the muffins had embarked on a sort of unofficial sermon winding up by inviting confidences jim had naturally been first flippant and then rude and relations had been strained ever since  it must have been a professional alleged perkins the master of the upper fourth if it hadnt been for the fact of the money having been stolen as well as the cups i should have put it down to one of our fellows  my dear perkins expostulated merevale  my dear merevale my entire form is capable of any crime except the theft of money a boy might have taken the cups for a joke or just for the excitement of the thing meaning to return them in time for the sports but the two pounds knocks that on the head it must have been a professional  i always said that the pavilion was a very unsafe place in which to keep anything of value said mr thompson  you were profoundly right thompson replied perkins you deserve a diploma  this business is rather in your line thompson said merevale you must bring your powers to bear on the subject and scent out the criminal  mr thompson took a keen pride in his powers of observation he would frequently observe like the lamented sherlock holmes the vital necessity of taking notice of trifles the daily life of a sixth form master at a big public school does not afford much scope for the practice of the detective art but mr thompson had once detected a piece of cribbing when correcting some latin proses for the master of the lower third solely by the exercise of his powers of observation and he had never forgotten it he burned to add another scalp to his collection and this pavilion burglary seemed peculiarly suited to his talents he had given the matter his attention and as far as he could see everything pointed to the fact that skilled hands had been at work  from eleven until halfpast twelve that day the sixth were doing an unseen examination under the eye of the headmaster and mr thompson was consequently off duty he took advantage of this to stroll down to the pavilion and make a personal inspection of the first room from which what were left of the prizes had long been removed to a place of safety  he was making his way to the place where the groundman was usually to be found with a view to obtaining the keys when he noticed that the door was already open and on going thither he came upon biffen the groundman in earnest conversation with a stranger  morning sir said the groundman he was on speaking terms with most of the masters and all the boys then to his companion this is mr thompson one of our masters  morning sir said the latter weather keeps up i am inspector roberts scotland yard but i think were in for rain soon yes fraid so been asked to look into this business mr thompson queer business  very might i aski am very interested in this kind of thingwhether you have arrived at any conclusions yet  the detective eyed him thoughtfully as if he were hunting for the answer to a riddle  no not yet nothing definite  i presume you take it for granted it was the work of a professional burglar  no no take nothing for granted great mistake prejudices one way or other great mistake but i think yes i think it was probablyalmost certainlynot done by a professional  mr thompson looked rather blank at this it shook his confidence in his powers of deduction  but he expostulated surely no one but a practised burglar would have taken a pane of glass out soahneatly  inspector roberts rubbed a finger thoughtfully round the place where the glass had been then he withdrew it and showed a small cut from which the blood was beginning to drip  do you notice anything peculiar about that cut he enquired  mr thompson did not nor did the groundman  look carefully now do you see no well its not a clean cut ragged very ragged now if a professional had cut that pane out he wouldnt have left it jagged like that no he would have used a diamond done the job neatly  this destroyed another of mr thompsons premises he had taken it for granted that a diamond had been used  oh he said was that pane not cut by a diamond what did the burglar use then  no no diamond diamond would have left smooth surface smooth as a razor edge this is like a saw amateurish work cant say for certain but probably done with a chisel  with a chisel surely not  yes probably with a chisel probably the man knocked the pane out with one blow then removed all the glass so as to make it look like the work of an old hand very good idea but amateurish i am told that three cups have been taken could you tell me how long they had been in the pavilion  mr thompson considered  well he said of course its difficult to remember exactly but i think they were placed there soon after one oclock the day before yesterday  ah and the robbery took place yesterday in the early morning or the night before  yes  is the pavilion the usual place to keep the prizes for the sports  no it is not they were only put there temporarily the board room where they are usually kept and which is in the main buildings of the school happened to be needed until the next day most of us were very much against leaving them in the pavilion but it was thought that no harm could come to them if they were removed next day  but they were removed that night which made a great difference said mr roberts chuckling at his mild joke i see then i suppose none outside the school knew that they were not in their proper place  i imagine not  just so knocks the idea of professional work on the head none of the regular trade can have known this room held so much silver for one night no regular would look twice at a cricket pavilion under ordinary circumstances therefore it must have been somebody who had something to do with the school one of the boys perhaps  really i do not think that probable  you cant tell never does to form hasty conclusions boy might have done it for many reasons some boys would have done it for the sake of the excitement that perhaps is the least possible explanation but you get boy kleptomaniacs just as much in proportion as grownup kleptomaniacs i knew a man had a son couldnt keep him away from anything valuable had to take him away in a hurry from three schools good schools too  really what became of him he did not come to us i suppose  no somebody advised the father to send him to one of those northcountry schools where they flog great success stole some money got flogged instead of expelled did it again with same result gradually got tired of it reformed character now i dont say it is a boy mind you most probably not only say it may be  all the while he was talking his eyes were moving restlessly round the room he came to the window through which jim had effected his entrance and paused before the broken pane  i suppose he tried that window first before going round to the other hazarded mr thompson  yes most probably broke it and then remembered that anyone at the windows of the boarding houses might see him so left his job half done and shifted his point of action i think so yes  he moved on again till he came to the other window then he gave vent to an excited exclamation and picked up a piece of caked mud from the sill as carefully as if it were some fragile treasure  now see this he said this was wet when the robbery was done the man brought it in with him on his boot left it on the sill as he climbed in got out in a hurry startled by somethingyou can see he was startled and left in a hurry from the different values of the cups he tookand as he was going put his hand on this left a clear impression good as plaster of paris very nearly  mr thompson looked at the piece of mud and there sure enough was the distinct imprint of the palm of a hand he could see the larger of the lines quite clearly and under a magnifyingglass there was no doubt that more could be revealed  he drew in a long breath of satisfaction and excitement  yes said the detective that piece of mud couldnt prove anything by itself but bring it up at the end of a long string of evidence and if it fits your man it convicts him as much as a snapshot photograph would morning sir i must be going and he retired carrying the piece of mud in his hand leaving mr thompson in the full grip of the detectivefever hunting with might and main for more clues  after some time however he was reluctantly compelled to give up the search for the bell rang for dinner and he always lunched as did many of the masters in the great hall during the course of the meal he exercised his brains without pause in the effort to discover a fitting suspect did he know of any victim of kleptomania in the school no he was sorry to say he did not was anybody in urgent need of money he could not say very probably yes but he had no means of knowing  after lunch he went back to the common room there was a letter lying on the table he picked it up it was addressed to j thomson st austins now mr thompsons christian name was john he did not notice the omission of the p until he had opened the envelope and caught a glimpse of the contents the letter was so short that only a glimpse was needed and it was not till he had read the whole that he realized that it was somebody elses letter that he had opened  this was the letter  dear jimfrantic haste can you let me have that two pounds directly you come back beg borrow or steal it i simply must have ityours ever  allen     11  the sports   sports weather at st austins was as a rule a quaint but unpleasant solution of mud hail and iced rain these were taken as a matter of course and the school counted it as something gained when they were spared the usual cutting east wind  this year however occurred that invaluable exception which is so useful in proving rules there was no gale only a gentle breeze the sun was positively shining and there was a general freshness in the air which would have made a cripple cast away his crutches and after backing himself heavily both ways enter for the strangers hundred yards  jim had wandered off alone he was feeling too nervous at the thought of the coming mile and all it meant to him to move in society for the present charteris welch and tony going out shortly before lunch to inspect the track found him already on the spot and in a very low state of mind  hullo you chaps he said dejectedly as they came up  hullo  our james is preoccupied said charteris why this jaundiced air jim look at our other thompson over there  our other thompson was at that moment engaged in conversation with the headmaster at the opposite side of the field  look at him said charteris prattling away as merrily as a little cheild to the old man you should take a lesson from him  look here i say said jim after a pause i believe theres something jolly queer up between thompson and the old man and i believe its about me  what on earth makes you think that asked welch  its his evil conscience said charteris no one who hadnt committed the awful crime that jim has could pay the least attention to anything thompson said what does our friend thucydides remark on the subject     conscia mens recti nec si sinit esse dolorem    sed revocare gradum  very well then  but why should you think anythings up asked tony  perhaps nothing is but its jolly fishy you see thompson and the old un pacing along there well theyve been going like that for about twenty minutes ive been watching them  but you cant tell theyre talking about you you rotter said tony for all you know they may be discussing the exams  or why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings put in charteris  or anything added welch profoundly  well all i know is that thompsons been doing all the talking and the old mans been getting more and more riled  probably thompsons been demanding a rise of screw or asking for a small loan or something said charteris how long have you been watching them  about twenty minutes  from here  yes  why didnt you go and join them theres nothing like tact if you were to go and ask the old man why the whale wailed or something after that style it ud buck him up like a tonic i wish you would and then you could tell him to tell you all about it and see if you couldnt do something to smooth the wrinkles from his careworn brow and let the sunshine of happiness into his heart hed like it awfully  would he said jim grimly well i got the chance just now thompson said something to him and he spun round saw me and shouted thomson i went up and capped him and he was starting to say something when he seemed to change his mind and instead of confessing everything he took me by the arm and said no no thomson go away its nothing i will send for you later  and did you knock him down asked charteris  what happened said welch  he gave me a shove as if he were putting the weight and said again its no matter go away thomson now so i went  and youve kept an eye on him ever since said charteris didnt he seem at all restive  i dont think he noticed me thompson had the floor and he was pretty well full up listening to him  i suppose you dont know what its all about asked tony  must be this pavilion business  now my dear sweet cherub said charteris dont you go and make an utter idiot of yourself and think youre found out and all that sort of thing even if they suspect you theyve got to prove it theres no sense in your giving them a helping hand in the business what youve got to do is to look normal dont overdo it or youll look like a swashbuckler and thatll be worse than underdoing it cant you make yourself look less like a convicted forger for my sake  you really do look a bit off it said welch critically as if you were sickening for the flu or something doesnt he tony  rather said that expert in symptoms you simply must buck up jim or drakell walk away from you  its disappointing said charteris to find a chap who can crack a crib as neatly as you can doubling up like this think how charles peace would have behaved under the circs dont disgrace him poor man  besides said jim with an attempt at optimism it isnt as if id actually done anything is it  just so said charteris thats what ive been trying to get you to see all along keep that fact steadily before you and youll be all right  there goes the lunchbell said tony you can always tell merevales bell in a crowd william rings it as if he was doing it for his health  william also known in criminal circles as the moke was the gentleman who served the housein a perpetual grin and a suit of livery four sizes too large for himas a sort of butler  hes an artist agreed charteris as he listened to the performance does it as if he enjoyed it doesnt he well if we dont want to spoil merevales appetite by coming in at halftime we might be moving they moved accordingly  the sports were to begin at two oclock with a series of hundredyards races which commenced with the under twelve cameron of praters a warm man for this said those who had means of knowing and culminated at about a quarter past with the open event for which welch was a certainty by a quarter to the hour the places round the ropes were filled and more visitors were constantly streaming in at the two entrances to the school grounds while in the centre of the ring the band of the local police forcethe military being unavailable owing to exigencies of distancewere seating themselves with the grim determination of those who know that they are going to play the soldiers chorus out of faust the band at the sports had played the soldiers chorus out of faust every year for decades past and will in all probability play it for decades to come  the sports at st austins were always looked forward to by everyone with the keenest interest and when the day arrived were as regularly voted slow in all school sports there are too many foregone conclusions in the present instance everybody knew and none better than the competitors themselves that welch would win the quarter and hundred the high jump was an equal certainty for a boy named reece in hallidays house jackson unless he were quite out of form would win the long jump and the majority of the other events had already been decided the gem of the afternoon would be the mile for not even the shrewdest judge of form could say whether jim would beat drake or drake jim both had done equally good times in practice and both were known to be in the best of training the adherents of jim pointed to the fact that he had won the half off drakeby a narrow margin true but still he had won it the other side argued that a halfmile is no criterion for a mile and that if drake had timed his sprint better he would probably have won for he had finished up far more strongly than his opponent and so on the subject of the mile public opinion was for once divided  the field was nearly full by this time the only clear space outside the ropes was where the headmaster stood to greet and talk about the weather to such parents and guardians and other celebrities as might pass this habit of his did not greatly affect the unattached members of the school those whose parents lived in distant parts of the world and were not present on sports day but to st jones brown for instance of the lower third towing mr brown senior round the ring it was a nervous ordeal to have to stand by while his father and the head exchanged polite commonplaces he could not help feeling that there was just a chance horrible thought that the head searching for something to say might seize upon that little matter of broken bounds or shaky examination papers as a subject for discussion he was generally obliged when the interview was over to conduct his parent to the shop by way of pulling his system together again the latter of course paying  at intervals round the ropes old austinian number one was meeting old austinian number two whom he emphatically detested and had hoped to avoid and was conversing with him in a nervous manner the clearness of his replies being greatly handicapped by a feeling which grew with the minutes that he would never be able to get rid of him and go in search of old austinian number three his bosom friend  at other intervals present austinians of tender years were manoeuvring halfcompanies of sisters aunts and mothers and trying without much success to pretend that they did not belong to them a pretence which came down heavily when one of the aunts addressed them as willie or phil and wanted to know audibly if that boy who had just passed the one person in the school whom they happened to hate and despise was their best friend it was a little trying too to have to explain in the middle of a crowd that the reason why you were not running in that race the under thirteen hundred by jove which ought to have been a gift to you only etc was because you had been ignominiously knocked out in the trial heats  in short the afternoon wore on welch won the hundred by two yards and the quarter by twenty and the other events fell in nearly every case to the favourite the hurdles created something of a surprisejackson who ought to have won coming down over the last hurdle but two thereby enabling dallas to pull off an unexpected victory by a couple of yards vaughans enthusiastic watch made the time a little under sixteen seconds but the official timekeeper had other views there were no instances of the timid new boy at whom previously the world had scoffed walking away with the most important race of the day  and then the spectators were roused from a state of coma by the sound of the bell ringing for the mile old austinian number one gratefully seized the opportunity to escape from old austinian number two and lose himself in the crowd young pouncebygreen with equal gratitude left his father talking to the head and shot off without ceremony to get a good place at the ropes in fact there was a general stir of anticipation and all round the ring paterfamilias was asking his son and heir which was drake and which thomson and settling his glasses more firmly on the bridge of his nose  the staff of the glow worm conducted jim to the startingplace and did their best to relieve his obvious nervousness with light conversation  eh old chap said jim he had been saying eh to everything throughout the afternoon  i said is my hat on straight and does it suit the colour of my eyes said charteris  oh yes yes rather ripping in a faroff voice  and have you a theory of the universe  eh old chap  i said did you want your legs rubbed before you start i believe its an excellent specific for the gout  gout what no i dont think so thanks  and youll write to us sometimes jim and give my love to little henry and always wear flannel next your skin my dear boy said charteris  this seemed to strike even jim as irrelevant  do shut up for goodness sake alderman he said irritably why cant you go and rag somebody else  my place is by your side go my son or else theyll be starting without you give us your blazer and take my tip the tip of an old runner and dont pocket your opponents ball in your own twentyfive and come back victorious or on the shields of your soldiers all right sir to the starter hes just making his will goodbye jim buck up or ill lynch you after the race  jim answered by muffling him in his blazer and walking to the line there were six competitors in all each of whom owned a name ranking alphabetically higher than thomson jim therefore had the outside berth drake had the one next to the inside which fell to adamson the victim of the lost two pounds episode  both drake and jim got off well at the sound of the pistol and the pace was warm from the start jim evidently had his eye on the inside berth and after half a lap had been completed he got it drake falling back jim continued to make the running and led at the end of the first lap by about five yards then came adamson followed by a batch of three and finally drake taking things exceedingly coolly a couple of yards behind them the distance separating him from jim was little over a dozen yards a roar of applause greeted the runners as they started on the second lap and it was significant that while jims supporters shouted well run those of drake were fain to substitute advice for approval and cry go it drake however had not the least intention of going it in the generally accepted meaning of the phrase a yard or two to the rear meant nothing in the first lap and he was running quite well enough to satisfy himself with a nice springy stride which he hoped would begin to tell soon  with the end of the second lap the real business of the race began for the survival of the fittest had resulted in eliminations and changes of order jim still led but now by only eight or nine yards drake had come up to second and adamson had dropped to a bad third two of the runners had given the race up and retired and the last man was a long way behind and to all practical purposes out of the running there were only three laps and as the last lap began the pace quickened fast as it had been before jim was exerting every particle of his strength he was not a runner who depended overmuch on his final dash he hoped to gain so much ground before drake made his sprint as to neutralize it when it came adamson he did not fear  and now they were in the last two hundred yards jim by this time some thirty yards ahead but in great straits drake had quickened his pace and gained slowly on him as they rounded the corner and came into the straight the cheers were redoubled it was a great race then fifty yards from the tape drake began his final sprint if he had saved himself before he made up for it now the gap dwindled and dwindled neither could improve his pace it was a question whether there was enough of the race left for drake to catch his man or whether he had once more left his sprint till too late jim could hear the roars of the spectators and the frenzied appeals of merevales house to him to sprint but he was already doing his utmost everything seemed black to him a black surging mist and in its centre a thin white line the tape could he reach it before drake or would he collapse before he reached it there were only five more yards to go now and still he led four three two then something white swept past him on the right the white line quivered snapped and vanished and he pitched blindly forward on to the turf at the trackside drake had won by a foot     12  an interesting interview   for the rest of the afternoon jim had a wretched time to be beaten after such a race by a foot and to be beaten by a foot when victory would have cut the gordian knot of his difficulties once and for all was enough to embitter anybodys existence he found it hard to accept the wellmeant condolences of casual acquaintances and still harder to do the right thing and congratulate drake on his victory a refinement of selftorture which is by custom expected of the vanquished in every branch of work or sport but he managed it somehow and he also managed to appear reasonably gratified when he went up to take his prize for the halfmile tony and the others who knew what his defeat meant to him kept out of his way for which he was grateful after lockup however it was a different matter but by that time he was more ready for society even now there might be some way out of the difficulty he asked tonys advice on the subject tony was perplexed the situation was beyond his grip  i dont see what you can do jim he said unless the rugby chapll be satisfied with a pound on account its a beastly business do you think your pater will give you your money all the same as it was such a close finish  jim thought not in fact he was certain that he would not and tony relapsed into silence as he tried to bring another idea to the surface he had not succeeded when charteris came in  jim he said you have my sympathy it was an awfully near thing but ive got something more solid than sympathy i will take a seat  dont rag charteris said tony its much too serious  whos ragging you rotter i say i have something more solid than sympathy and instead of giving me an opening as a decent individual would by saying what you accuse me of ragging james my son if you will postpone your suicide for two minutes i will a tale unfold i have an idea  well  thats more like it now you are talking we will start at the beginning first you want a pound so do i secondly you want it before next tuesday thirdly you havent it on you how therefore are you to get it as the song hath it you dont know they dont know butnow we come to the pointi do know  yes said jim and tony together  it is a luminous idea why shouldnt we publish a special number of the glow worm before the end of term  jim was silent at the brilliance of the scheme then doubts began to harass him  is there time  time yards of it this is saturday we start tonight and keep at it all night if necessary we ought to manage it easily before tomorrow morning on sunday we jellygraph ititll have to be a jellygraphed number this time on monday and tuesday we sell it and there you are  how are you going to sell it in the ordinary way at the shop  yes ive arranged all that all weve got to do is to write the thing as the penalty for your sins you shall take on most of it ill do the editorial welch is pegging away at the sports account now and i waylaid jackson just before lockup and induced him by awful threats to knock off some verses so were practically published already  its grand said jim and its awfully decent of you chaps to fag yourselves like this for me ill start on something now  but can you raise a sovereign on one number asked tony  either that or ive arranged with the shop to give us a quid down and take all profits on this and the next number theyre as keen as anything on the takingallprofits idea but ive kept that back to be used only in case of necessity but the point is that jim gets his sovereign in any case i must be off to my editorial so long and he went  grand man charteris said tony as he leant back in his chair in search of a subject youd better weigh in with an account of the burglary its a pity you cant give the realistic description you gave us it would sell like anything  wouldnt do to risk it  at that moment the door swung violently open with merevale holding on to the handle and following it in its course merevale very rarely knocked at a study door a peculiarity of his which went far towards shattering the nervous systems of the various inmates who never knew when it was safe to stop work and read fiction ah thomson he said i was looking for you the headmaster wants to see you over at his house if you are feeling well enough after your exertions very close thing that mile i dont know when i have seen a betterrun race on the college grounds i suppose you are feeling pretty tired eh  i am rather sir but i had better see the head will he be in his study sir  yes i think so  jim took his cap and went off while merevale settled down to spend the evening in tonys study as he often did when the terms work was over and it was no longer necessary to keep up the pretence of preparation  parker the heads butler conducted jim into the presence  sit down thomson said the head  jim took a seat and he had just time to notice that his namesake mr thompson was also present and that in spite of the fact that his tie had crept up to the top of his collar he was looking quite unnecessarily satisfied with himself when he became aware that the head was speaking to him  i hope you are not feeling any bad effects from your race thomson  jim was half inclined to say that his effects were nil but he felt that the quip was too subtle and would be lost on his present audience so he merely said that he was not there was a rather awkward silence for a minute then the head coughed and said  thomson  yes sir  i think it would be fairest to you to come to the point at once and to tell you the reason why i wished to see you  jim ran over the sins which shot up in his mind like rockets as he heard these ominous words and he knew that this must be the matter of the pavilion he was therefore in a measure prepared for the heads next words  thomson  yessir  a very serious charge has been brought against you you are accused of nothing less than this unfortunate burglary of the prizes for the sports  yes sir is my accuser mr thompson  the headmaster hesitated for a moment and mr thompson spoke that is so he said  yes said the head the accusation is brought by mr thompson  yes sir said jim again and this time the observation was intended to convey the meaning my dear good sir when youve known him as long as i have you wont mind what mr thompson says or does its a kind of way hes got and if hes not under treatment for it he ought to be  i should like to hear from your own lips that the charge is groundless  anything to oblige thought jim then aloud yes sir  you say it is groundless this from mr thompson  yes sir  i must warn you thomson that the evidence against you is very strong indeed said the head without suggesting that you are guilty of this thing i think i ought to tell you that if you have any confession to make it will be greatly very greatly to your own advantage to make it at once  and give myself away free gratis and for nothing thought jim not for me thank you  might i hear mr thompsons evidence sir he asked  certainly thomson he effected a movement in mr thompsons direction midway between a bow and a nod  mr thompson coughed jim coughed too in the same key this put mr thompson out and he had to cough again  in the first place he began it has been conclusively proved that the burglary was the work of an unskilful hand  that certainly seems to point to me as the author said jim flippantly  silence thomson said the head and counsel for the prosecution resumed  in the second place it has been proved that you were at the time of the burglary in great need of money  this woke jim up it destroyed that feeling of coolness with which he had started the interview awful thoughts flashed across his mind had he been seen at the time of his burglarious entry at any rate how did mr thompson come to know of his pecuniary troubles  did you say it had been proved sir  yes  how sir  he felt the question was a mistake as he was uttering it your really injured innocent would have called all the elements to witness that he was a millionaire but it was too late to try that now and besides he really did want to know how mr thompson had got to hear of this skeleton in his cupboard  the headmaster interrupted hurriedly it is a very unfortunate affair altogether and this is quite the most unfortunate part a letter came to the college addressed to j thomson and mr thompson opened and read it inadvertently quite inadvertently  yes sir said jim in a tone which implied i am no george washington myself but when you say he read it inadvertently well  this letter was signed allen  my brother sir  exactly and it asked for two pounds evidently in payment of a debt and the tone of the letter certainly seemed to show that you were not then in possession of the money  could i have the letter sir then with respectful venom to mr thompson if you have finished with it the letter was handed over and pocketed and jim braced his moral pecker up for the next round of the contest  i take it then thomson resumed the head that you owe your brother this money  yes sir  two pounds is a great deal of money for one boy to lend another  it was not lent sir it was a bet  a bet in a nasty tone from the head  a bet in a sepulchral echo from mr thompson  there was a long pause  at any other time said the head i should feel it my duty to take serious notice of this but beside this other matter with which you are charged it becomes trivial i can only repeat that the circumstances are exceedingly suspicious and i think it would be in your interests to tell us all you know without further delay  you take it for granted i am guilty sir began jim hotly  i say that the circumstances seems to point to it in the first place you were in need of money you admit that  yes sir  in the second place said the head slowly in the second place i am told that you were nowhere to be found in the house at halfpast eight on the night of the burglary when you ought certainly to have been in your study at your work  bombshell number two and a worse one than the first for the moment jims head swam if he had been asked just then in so many words where he had been at that time it is likely that he would have admitted everything by some miracle the head did not press his point  you may go now thomson he said i should like to see you after morning school on monday goodnight  goodnight sir said jim and went without another word coming so soon after the exertion and strain of the mile this shock made him feel sick and dizzy  when he had gone the head turned to mr thompson with a worried look on his face i feel as certain as i do of anything he said thoughtfully that that boy is telling the truth if he had been guilty he would not have behaved like that i feel sure of it  mr thompson looked equally thoughtful the circumstances are certainly very suspicious he said echoing the heads own words i wish i could think he was innocent but i am bound to say i do not i regard the evidence as conclusive  circumstantial evidence is proverbially uncertain mr thompson that is principally the reason why i was so bent on making him confess if he had anything to confess i cant expel a boy and ruin his whole career on mere suspicion the matter must be proved doubly proved and even then i should feel uneasy until he owned himself guilty it is a most unpleasant affair a terrible affair  most agreed mr thompson  and exactly the same thing was occurring at that moment to jim as he sat on his bed in his dormitory and pondered hopelessly on this new complication that had presented itself so unexpectedly he was getting very near to the end of his tether was j thomson of merevales it seemed to him indeed that he had reached it already possibly if he had had a clearer conscience and a larger experience he might have recognized that the evidence which mr thompson had described as conclusive was in reality not strong enough to hang a cat on unfortunately he did not enjoy those advantages     13  sir alfred scores   soon after jim had taken his departure mr thompson after waiting a few minutes in case the headmaster had anything more to say drifted silently out of the room the head like the gentleman in the ballad continued to wear a worried look the more he examined the matter the less did he know what to make of it he believed as he had said to mr thompson that jim was entirely innocent it was an incredible thing he thought that a public school boy a schoolprefect too into the bargain should break out of his house and into a cricket pavilion however great a crisis his finances might be undergoing and then to steal two of the prizes for the sports impossible against this however must be placed the theft of the two pounds it might occur to a boy as indeed mr thompson had suggested to steal the cups in order to give the impression that a practised burglar had been at work there was certainly something to be said in favour of this view but he would never believe such a thing he was a good judge of charactera headmaster generally isand he thought he could tell when a boy was speaking the truth and when he was not  his reflections were interrupted by a knock at the door the butler entered with a card on a tray sir alfred venner mp badgwick hall saidalmost shoutedthe card he read the words without any apparent pleasure  is sir alfred here himself parker he said  he is sir  the headmaster sighed inaudibly but very wearily he was feeling worried already and he knew from experience that a teteatete with sir alfred venner mp of badgwick hall would worry him still more  the head was a man who tried his very hardest to like each and all of his fellowcreatures but he felt bound to admit that he liked most people a great a very great deal better than he liked the gentleman who had just sent in his card sir alfreds manner always jarred upon him it was so exactly the antithesis of his own he was quiet and dignified and addressed everybody alike courteously sir alfred was restless and fussy his manner was always dictatorial and generally rude when he had risen in the house to make his maiden speech calling the attention of the speaker to what he described as a thorough draught he had addressed himself with such severity to that official that a party of siamese noblemen who though not knowing a word of english had come to listen to the debate had gone away with the impression that he was the prime minister no wonder the headmaster sighed  show him in parker said he resignedly  yessir  parker retired leaving the head to wonder what his visitors grievance might be this time sir alfred rarely called without a grievance generally connected with the trespassing of the school on his land  good evening sir alfred he said as his visitor whirled into the room  ooo this sort of thing wont do you know mr perceval said sir alfred fussily adjusting a pair of gold pincenez on his nose the heads name which has not before been mentioned was the reverend herbert perceval ma he had shivered at the sound of the ooo which had preceded sir alfreds remark he knew as did other unfortunate people that the great man was at his worst when he said ooo in moments of comparative calm he said er  i cant put up with it you know mr perceval its too much a great deal too much  you refer to suggested the head with a patience that did him credit  this eternal trespassing and tramping in and out of my grounds all day  you have been misinformed i fear sir alfred i have not trespassed in your grounds foraha considerable time the head could not resist this thrust in his unregenerate varsity days he had been a power at the union where many a foeman had exposed himself to a verbal counter from him with disastrous results now the fencing must be done with buttons on the foils  youwhati dont follow you mr perceval  i understand you to reproach me for trespassing andahtramping in and out of your grounds all day was that not your meaning  sir alfred almost danced with impatience  no no no you misunderstand me you dont follow my drift  in that case i beg your pardon i gathered from the extreme severity of your attitude towards me that i was the person to whom you referred  no no no ive come here to complain of your boys  it occurred to the head to ask if the complaint embraced the entire six hundred of them or merely referred to one of them but he reflected that the longer he fenced the longer his visitor would stay and he decided in spite of the illicit pleasure to be derived from the exercise that it was not worth while  ah he said  yes continued sir alfred my keepers tell me the woods were full of them sir  the head suggested that possibly the keepers had exaggerated  possibly possibly they may have exaggerated but that is not the point the nuisance is becoming intolerable mr perceval perfectly intolerable it is time to take steps  i have already done all that can be done i have placed your land out of bounds considerably out of bounds indeed and i inflict the severest penalties when a breach of the rule is reported to me  its not enough its not nearly enough  i can scarcely do more i fear sir alfred there are more than six hundred boys at st austins and it is not within my power to place them all under my personal supervision  here the head who had an eye to the humorous conjured up a picture of six hundred austinians going for walks two and two the staff posted at intervals down the procession and himself bringing up the rear he made a mental mem to laugh when his visitor had retired  hm said the baffled mp thoughtfully adjusting his pincenez once more m no no perhaps not buthere he brightened upyou can punish them when they do trespass  that is so sir alfred i can and invariably do  then punish that whatshisname plinkett plunkettive got the name down somewhere yes plunkett i thought so punish plunkett  plunkett said the head taken completely by surprise he in common with the rest of the world had imagined plunkett to be a perfect pattern of what should be a headmaster like other judges of character has his failures  plunkett yes that is the name boy with spectacles good gracious mr perceval dont tell me the boy gave me a false name  no his name is plunkett am i to understand that he was trespassing on your land surely there is some mistake the boys a schoolprefect  here it suddenly flashed upon his mind that he had used that expression before in the course of the day on the occasion when mr thompson first told him of his suspicions in connection with jim why mr thompson the boys a schoolprefect had been his exact words schoolprefects had been in his eyes above suspicion it is a bad day for a school when they are not so had that day arrived for st austins he asked himself  he may be a schoolprefect mr perceval but the fact remains that he is a trespasser and ought from your point of view to be punished for breaking bounds  the head suddenly looked almost cheerful again  of course he said of course i thought that there must be an explanation the rules respecting bounds sir alfred do not apply to schoolprefects only to the rest of the school  indeed said sir alfred his tone should have warned the head that something more was coming but it did not he continued  of course it was very wrong of him to trespass on your land but i have no doubt that he did it quite unintentionally i will speak to him and i think i can guarantee that he will not do it again  oh said his visitor that is very gratifying i am sure might i ask mr perceval if schoolprefects at st austins have any other privileges  the head began to look puzzled there was something in his visitors manner which suggested unpleasant possibilities  a few he replied they have a few technical privileges which it would be a matter of some little time to explain  it must be very pleasant to be a prefect at st austins said sir alfred nastily very pleasant indeed might i ask mr perceval if the technical privileges to which you refer includesmoking  the head started as if supposing such a thing possible someone had pinched him he did not know what to make of the question from the expression on his face his visitor did not appear to be perpetrating a joke  no he said sharply they do not include smoking  i merely asked because this was found by my keeper on the boy when he caught him  he produced a small silver matchbox the head breathed again the reputation of the schoolprefect though shaky was still able to come up to the scratch  a matchbox is scarcely a proof that a boy has been smoking i think said he many boys carry matches for various purposes i believe i myself though a nonsmoker frequently place a box in my pocket  for answer sir alfred laid a bloated and exceedingly vulgarlooking plush tobaccopouch on the table beside the matchbox  that also he observed was found in his pocket by my keeper  he dived his hand once more into his coat and also this he said  and with the air of a cardplayer who trumps his opponents ace he placed on the pouch a pipe and to make the matter if possible worse the pipe was not a new pipe it was caked within and coloured without a pipe that had seen long service the only mitigating circumstance that could possibly have been urged in favour of the accused namely that of first offence had vanished  it is pleasant said sir alfred with laborious sarcasm to find a trespasser doing a thing which has caused the dismissal of several keepers smoking in my woods iwillnotpermit i will not have my property burnt down while i can prevent it good evening mr perceval with these words he made a dramatic exit  for some minutes after he had gone the head remained where he stood thinking then he went across the room and touched the bell  parker he said when that invaluable officer appeared go across to mr wards house and tell him i wish to see plunkett say i wish to see him at once  yessir  after ten minutes had elapsed plunkett entered the room looking nervous  sit down plunkett  plunkett collapsed into a seat his eye had caught sight of the smoking apparatus on the table  the head paced the room something after the fashion of the tiger at the zoo whose clock strikes lunch  plunkett he said suddenly you are a schoolprefect  yes sir murmured plunkett the fact was undeniable  you know the duties of a schoolprefect  yes sir  and yet you deliberately break one of the most important rules of the school how long have you been in the habit of smoking  plunkett evaded the question  my father lets me smoke sir when im at home  a hasty word in the readers ear if ever you are accused of smoking pleasefor my sake if not for your owntry to refrain from saying that your father lets you do it at home it is a fatal mistake  at this to employ a metaphor the champagne of the heads wrath which had been fermenting steadily during his late interview got the better of the cork of selfcontrol and he exploded if the mutual friend ever has grandchildren he will probably tell them with bated breath the story of how the head paced the room and the legend of the things he said but it will be some time before he will be able to speak about it with any freedom at last there was a lull in the storm  i am not going to expel you plunkett but you cannot come back after the holidays i will write to your father to withdraw you he pointed to the door plunkett departed in level time  what did the old un want you for asked dallas curiously when he returned to the study  plunkett had recovered himself by this time sufficiently to be able to tell a lie  he wanted to tell me hed heard from my father about my leaving  about your leaving dallas tried to keep his voice as free as possible from triumphant ecstasy  are you leaving when  this term  oh said dallas it was an uncomfortable moment he felt that at least some conventional expression of regret ought to proceed from him  dont trouble to lie about being sorry said plunkett with a sneer  thanks said dallas gratefully since you mention it i rather think i wont     14  the long run   vaughan came up soon afterwards and dallas told him the great news they were neither of them naturally vindictive but the mutual friend had been a heavy burden to them during his stay in the house and they did not attempt to conceal from themselves their unfeigned pleasure at the news of his impending departure  ill never say another word against mr plunkett senior in my life said vaughan hes a philanthropist i wonder what the mutuals going to do gentleman of leisure possibly unless hes going to the varsity  same thing rather i dont know a bit what hes going to do and i cant say i care much hes going thats the main point  i say said vaughan i believe the old man was holding a sort of reception tonight i know he had thomson over to his house do you think theres a row on  oh i dont know probably only wanted to see if he was all right after the mile by jove it was a bit of a race wasnt it and the conversation drifted off into matters athletic  there were two persons that night who slept badly jim lay awake until the college clock had struck three going over in his mind the various points of his difficulties on the chance of finding a solution of them he fell asleep at a quarter past without having made any progress the head also passed a bad night he was annoyed for many reasons principally perhaps because he had allowed sir alfred venner to score so signal a victory over him besides that he was not easy in his mind about jim he could not come to a decision the evidence was all against him but evidence is noted for its untrustworthiness the head would have preferred to judge the matter from his knowledge of jims character but after the plunkett episode he mistrusted his powers in that direction he thought the matter over for a time and then finding himself unable to sleep got up and wrote an article for a leading review on the subject of the doxology the article was subsequently rejectedwhich proves that providence is not altogether incapable of a kindly actionbut it served its purpose by sending its author to sleep  barrett too though he did not allow it to interfere with his slumbers was considerably puzzled as to what he ought to do about the cups which he had stumbled upon in the wood he scarcely felt equal to going to the dingle again to fetch them and yet every minute he delayed made the chances of their remaining there more remote he rather hoped that reade would think of some way out of it he had a great respect for reades intellect though he did not always show it the next day was the day of the interhouse crosscountry race it was always fixed for the afternoon after sports day a most inconvenient time for it as everybody who had exerted or overexerted himself the afternoon before was unable to do himself justice today contrary to general expectation both drake and thomson had turned out the knowing ones however were prepared to bet anything you liked except cash that both would drop out before the first mile was over merevales pinned their hopes on welch at that time welch had not done much longdistance running he confined himself to the hundred yards and the quarter but he had it in him to do great things as he proved in the following year when he won the half and would have beaten the great mitchelljones record for the mile but for an accident or rather an event which prevented his running the tale of which is told elsewhere  the course for the race was a difficult one there were hedges and brooks to be negotiated and worst of all ploughed fields the first ploughed field usually thinned the ranks of the competitors considerably the distance was about ten miles  the race started at three oclock jim and welch merevales first string set the pace from the beginning and gradually drew away from the rest drake came third and following him the rest of the houses in a crowd  welch ran easily and springily jim with more effort he felt from the start that he could not last he resolved to do his best for the honour of the house but just as the second mile was beginning the first of the ploughed fields appeared in view stretching so it appeared to jim right up to the horizon he groaned  go on welch he gasped im done  welch stopped short in his stride and eyed him critically  yes he said better get back to the house you overdid it yesterday lie down somewhere gbye and he got into his stride again jim watched his figure diminish until at last it was a shapeless dot of white against the brown surface then he lay down on his back and panted  it was in this attitude that drake found him for a moment an almost irresistible wish seized him to act in the same way there was an unstudied comfort about jims pose which appealed to him strongly his wind still held out but his legs were beginning to feel as if they did not belong to him at all he pulled up for an instant  hullo he said done up  for reply jim merely grunted  slacker said drake wheres welch  miles ahead  oh lord groaned drake and pulling himself together set out painfully once more across the heavy surface of the field  jim lay where he was a little longer the recollection of the other runners who might be expected to arrive shortly stirred him to action he did not wish to interview everyone on the subject of his dropping out he struck off at right angles towards the hedge on the left as he did so the first of the crowd entered the field simpson major wearing the colours of perkinss house on his manly bosom was leading behind him came a group of four two school house dallas of wards and a representative of praters a minute later they were followed by a larger group consisting this time of twenty or more runnersall that was left of the fifty who had started the rest had dropped out at the sight of the ploughed field  jim watched the procession vanish over the brow of the hill and as it passed out of sight began to walk slowly back to the school again  he reached it at last only to find it almost entirely deserted in merevales house there was nobody he had hoped that charteris and tony might have been somewhere about when he had changed into his ordinary clothes he made a tour of the school grounds the only sign of life as far as he could see was biffen who was superintending the cutting of the grass on the cricketfield during the winter biffen always disappeared nobody knew where returning at the beginning of sports week to begin preparations for the following cricket season it had been stated that during the winter he shut himself up and lived on himself after the fashion of a bear others believed that he went and worked in some welsh mine until he was needed again at the school biffen himself was not communicative on the subject a fact which led a third party to put forward the awful theory that he was a professional association player and feared to mention his crime in a school which worshipped rugby  why mr thomson he said as jim came up i thought you was running whoa the last remark was addressed to a boredlooking horse attached to the mowingmachine from the expression on its face the animal evidently voted the whole process pure foolishness he pulled up without hesitation and biffen turned to jim again  surely they aint come back yet he said  i have said jim i did myself up rather in the mile yesterday and couldnt keep up the pace i dropped out at that awfully long ploughed field by parkers spinney  biffen nodded  and oo was winning sir  well welch was leading the last i saw of it shouldnt wonder if he won either he was going all right i say the place seems absolutely deserted isnt anybody about  just what mr macarthur was saying to me just this minute sir e went into the pavilion  good ill go and hunt for him  biffen clicked the blase horse into movement again jim went to the pavilion and met the babe coming down the steps  hullo babe i was looking for you  hullo why arent you running  dropped out come and have tea in my study  no ill tell you what you come back with me ive got rather a decent dog i want to show you only got him yesterday  jim revelled in dogs so he agreed instantly the babe lived with his parents in a big house about a mile from the college and in so doing was the object of much envy amongst those who had to put up with life at the houses jim had been to his home once or twice before and had always had a very good time indeed there the two strolled off in another hour the place began to show signs of life again the school began to return by ones and twos most of them taking up a position near the big gates this was where the race was to finish there was a straight piece of road about two hundred yards in length before the high road was reached it was a sight worth seeing when the runners paced by their respective houses on each side of the road swept round the corner and did their best to sprint with all that was left in them after ten miles of difficult country suddenly a distant shouting began to be heard the leaders had been sighted the noise increased growing nearer and nearer until at last it swelled into a roar and a black mass of runners turned the corner in the midst of the black was one white figurewelch as calm and unruffled as if he had been returning from a short trot to improve his wind merevales surged round him in a cheering mob welch simply disregarded them he knew where he wished to begin his sprint and he would begin it at that spot and no other the spot he had chosen was well within a hundred yards from the gates when he reached it he let himself go and from the uproar the crowd appeared to be satisfied a long pause and still none of the other runners appeared five minutes went by before they began to appear first jones of the school house and simpson who raced every yard of the way and finished in the order named and then three of philpotts house in a body the rest dropped in at intervals for the next quarter of an hour  the headmaster always made a point of watching the finish of the crosscountry run indeed he was generally one of the last to leave with the majority of the spectators it was enough to see the first five safely in  the last man and lockup arrived almost simultaneously and the head went off to a wellearned dinner  he had just finished this meal and was congratulating himself on not being obliged to spend the evening in a series of painful interviews as had happened the night before when parker the butler entered the room  well parker what is it asked he  mr roberts sir wishes to see you  for a moment the head was at a loss he could not recall any friend or acquaintance of that name then he remembered that roberts was the name of the detective who had come down from london to look into the matter of the prizes  very well he said resignedly show him into the study  parker bowed and retired the head after an interval followed him and made his way to the study     15  mr roberts explains   inspector roberts was standing with his back to the door examining a photograph of the college when the head entered he spun round briskly good evening mr roberts pray be seated you wish to see me  the detective took a seat  this business of the cups sir  ah said the head have you made any progress  considerable yes very considerable progress ive found out who stole them  you have cried the head excellent i suppose it was thomson then i was afraid so  thomson sir that was certainly not the name he gave me stokes he called himself  stokes stokes this is curious perhaps if you were to describe his appearance was he a tall boy of a rather slight build  the detective interrupted  excuse me sir but i rather fancy we have different persons in our mind stokes is not a boy not at all well over thirty red moustache height five foot seven i should say not more works as a farmhand when required and does odd jobs at times thats the man  the heads face expressed relief as he heard this description then thomson did not do it after all he said  thomson queried mr roberts  thomson explained the head is the name of one of the boys at the school i am sorry to say that i strongly suspected him of this robbery  a boy at the school curious unusual i should have thought for a boy to be mixed up in an affair like this though i have known cases  i was very unwilling i can assure you to suspect him of such a thing but really the evidence all seemed to point to it i am afraid mr roberts that i have been poaching on your preserves without much success  curious thing evidence murmured mr roberts fixing with his eye a bust of socrates on the writingdesk as if he wished it to pay particular attention to his words very curious very seldom able to trust it case the other day man charged with robbery from the person with violence they gave the case to me worked up beautiful case against the man not a hitch anywhere whole thing practically proved man brings forward alibi proves it turned out that at time of robbery he had been serving seven days without the option for knocking down two porters and a guard on the district railway yet the evidence seemed conclusive yes curious thing evidence he nodded solemnly at socrates and resumed an interested study of the carpet  the head who had made several spirited attempts at speaking during this recital at last succeeded in getting in a word  you have the cups  no no cups still missing only flaw in the affair perhaps i had better begin from the beginning  exactly pray let me hear the whole story i am more glad than i can say that thomson is innocent there is no doubt of that i hope  not the least sir not the very least stokes is the man  i am very glad to hear it  the inspector paused for a moment coughed and drifted into his narrative   saw at once it was not the work of a practised burglar first place how could regular professional know that the cups were in the pavilion at all quite so second place work very clumsily done no neatness not the professional touch at all tell it in a minute no mistaking it very good must therefore have been amateurthis night onlyand connected with school next question who helped a little there by luck capital thing luck when its not bad luck was passing by the village innyou know the village inn i dare say sir  the head slightly scandalized explained that he was seldom in the village the detective bowed and resumed his tale  as i passed the door i ran into a man coming out in a very elevated not to say intoxicated state as a matter of fact barely able to stand reeled against wall and dropped handful of money i lent helping hand and picked up his money for him not my place to arrest drunken men constables no constable there of course noticed as i picked the money up that there was a good deal of it for ordinary rustic a very good deal sovereign and plenty of silver he paused mused for a while and went on again  yes sovereign and quite ten shillings worth of silver now the nature of my profession makes me a suspicious man it struck me as curious not to say remarkable that such a man should have thirty shillings or more about him so late in the week and then there was another thing i thought id seen this particular man somewhere on the school grounds couldnt recall his face exactly but just had a sort of general recollection of having seen him before i happened to have a camera with me as a matter of fact i had been taking a few photographs of the place pretty place sir  very agreed the head  you photograph yourself perhaps  no iahdo not  ah pity excellent hobby howeveri took a snapshot of this man to show to somebody who might know him better than i did this is the photograph drunk as a lord is he not  he exhibited a small piece of paper the head examined it gravely and admitted that the subject of the picture did not appear to be ostentatiously sober the sunlight beat full on his face which wore the intensely solemn expression of the man who knowing his own condition hopes by means of exemplary conduct to conceal it from the world the head handed the photograph back without further comment  i gave the man back his money went on mr roberts and saw him safely started again and then i set to work to shadow him not a difficult job he walked very slowly and for all he seemed to care the whole of scotland yard might have been shadowing him went up the street and after a time turned in at one of the cottages i marked the place and went home to develop the photograph took it to show the man who looks after the cricketfield  biffen  just so biffen very intelligent man given me a good deal of help in one way and another all along well i showed it to him and he said he thought he knew the face was almost certain it was one of the men at work on the grounds at the time of the robbery showed it to friend of his the other groundman he thought same that made it as certain as i had any need for went off at once to the mans cottage found him sober and got the whole thing out of him but not the cups he had been meaning to sell them but had not known where to go wanted combination of good price and complete safety very hard to find so had kept cups hidden till further notice  here the head interrupted  and the cups where are they  weell said the detective slowly it is this way we have only got his word to go on as regards the cups this man stokes it seems is a notorious poacher the night after the robbery he took the cups out with him on an expedition in some woods that lie in the direction of badgwick i think badgwick is the name  badgwick not sir alfred venners woods  sir alfred venner it was sir that was the name he mentioned stokes appears to have been in the habit of visiting that gentlemans property pretty frequently he had a regular hiding place a sort of store where he used to keep all the game he killed he described the place to me it is a big tree on the bank of the stream nearest the high road the tree is hollow one has to climb to find the opening to it inside are the cups and i should say a good deal of mixed poultry that is what he told me sir i should advise you if i may say so to write a note to sir alfred venner explaining the case and ask him to search the tree and send the cups on here  this idea did not appeal to the head at all why he thought bitterly was this wretched mp always mixed up with his affairs left to himself he could have existed in perfect comfort without either seeing writing to or hearing from the great man again for the rest of his life i will think it over he said though it seems the only thing to be done as for stokes i suppose i must prosecute  the detective raised a hand in protest  pardon my interruption sir but i really should advise you not to prosecute  indeed why  it is this way if you prosecute you get the man his term of imprisonment a year probably well and good but then what happens after his sentence has run out he comes out of prison an exconvict tries to get work no good nobody will look at him asks for a job people lock up their spoons and shout for the police what happens then not being able to get work tries another burglary being a clumsy hand at the game gets caught again and sent back to prison and so is ruined and becomes a danger to society now if he is let off this time he will go straight for the rest of his life run a mile to avoid a silver cup hes badly scared and i took the opportunity of scaring him more told him nothing would happen this time if the cups came back safely but that hed be watched ever afterwards to see he did not get into mischief of course he wont really be watched you understand but he thinks he will which is better for it saves trouble besides we know where the cups arei feel sure he was speaking the truth about them he was too frightened to invent a storyand here is most of the money so it all ends well if i may put it so my advice sir and i think you will find it good adviceis not to prosecute  very well said the head i will not  very good sir good morning sir and he left the room  the head rang the bell  parker said he go across to mr merevales and ask him to send thomson to me  it was with mixed feelings that he awaited jims arrival the detectives story had shown how unjust had been his former suspicions and he felt distinctly uncomfortable at the prospect of the apology which he felt bound to make to him on the other hand this feeling was more than equalled by his relief at finding that his faith in the virtue of the genus schoolprefect though at fault in the matter of plunkett was not altogether misplaced it made up for a good deal then his thoughts drifted to sir alfred venner struggle with his feelings as he might the head could not endure that local potentate the recent interview between them had had no parallel in their previous acquaintance but the head had always felt vaguely irritated by his manner and speech and he had always feared that matters would come to a head sooner or later the prospect of opening communication with him once more was not alluring in the meantime there was his more immediate duty to be performed the apology to thomson but that reminded him the apology must only be of a certain kind it must not be grovelling and this for a very excellent reason after the apology must come an official lecture on the subject of betting he had rather lost sight of that offence in the excitement of the greater crime of which thomson had been accused and very nearly convicted now the full heinousness of it came back to him betting scandalous  come in he cried as a knock at the door roused him from his thoughts he turned but instead of thomson there appeared parker parker carried a note it was from mr merevale  the head opened it  what he cried as he read it impossible parker made no comment he stood in the doorway trying to look as like a piece of furniture as possiblewhich is the duty of a good butler  impossible said the head again  what mr merevale had said in his note was this that thomson was not in the house and had not been in the house since lunchtime he ought to have returned at six oclock it was now halfpast eight and still there were no signs of him mr merevale expressed a written opinion that this was a remarkable thing and the head agreed with him unreservedly     16  the disappearance of j thomson   certainly the head was surprised  he read the note again no there was no mistake thomson is not in the house there could be no two meanings about that  go across to mr merevales he said at last and ask him if he would mind seeing me here for a moment  the butler bowed his head gently but with more than a touch of pained astonishment he thought the headmaster might show more respect for persons a butler is not an errandboy  sir he said giving the head a last chance as it were of realizing the situation  ask mr merevale to step over here for a moment  the poor man bowed once more the phantom of a halfsmoked cigar floated reproachfully before his eyes he had lit it a quarter of an hour ago in fond anticipation of a quiet evening unless a miracle had occurred it must be out by this time and he knew as well as anybody else that a relighted cigar is never at its best but he went and in a few minutes mr merevale entered the room  sit down mr merevale said the head am i to understand from your note that thomson is actually not in the house  mr merevale thought that if he had managed to understand anything else from the note he must possess a mind of no common order but he did not say so  no he said thomson has not been in the house since lunchtime as far as i know it is a curious thing  it is exceedingly serious exceedingly so for many reasons have you any idea where he was seen last  harrison in my house says he saw him at about three oclock  ah  according to harrison he was walking in the direction of stapleton  ah well it is satisfactory to know even as little as that  just so but macehe is in my house toodeclares that he saw thomson at about the same time cycling in the direction of badgwick both accounts can scarcely be correct  butdear me are you certain mr merevale  merevale nodded to imply that he was the head drummed irritably with his fingers on the arm of his chair this mystery coming as it did after the series of worries through which he had been passing for the last few days annoyed him as much as it is to be supposed the last straw annoyed the proverbial camel  as a matter of fact said merevale i know that thomson started to run in the long race this afternoon i met him going to the startingplace and advised him to go and change again he was not looking at all fit for such a long run it seems to me that welch might know where he is thomson and he got well ahead of the others after the start so that if as i expect thomson dropped out early in the race welch could probably tell us where it happened that would give us some clue to his whereabouts at any rate  have you questioned welch  not yet welch came back very tired quite tired out in fact and went straight to bed i hardly liked to wake him except as a last resource perhaps i had better do so now  i think you should most certainly something serious must have happened to thomson to keep him out of his house as late as this unless  he stopped merevale looked up enquiringly the head after a moments deliberation proceeded to explain  i have made a very unfortunate mistake with regard to thomson mr merevale a variety of reasons led me to think that he had had something to do with this theft of the sports prizes  thomson broke in merevale incredulously  there was a considerable weight of evidence against him which i have since found to be perfectly untrustworthy but which at the time seemed to me almost conclusive  but surely put in merevale again surely thomson would be the last boy to do such a thing why should he what would he gain by it  precisely i can understand that perfectly in the light of certain information which i have just received from the inspector but at the time as i say i believed him guilty i even went so far as to send for him and question him upon the subject now it has occurred to me mr merevaleyou understand that i put it forward merely as a conjectureit occurs to me  that thomson has run away said merevale bluntly  the head slightly discomposed by this sherlockholmeslike reading of his thoughts pulled himself together and said ahjust so i think it very possible  i do not agree with you said merevale i know thomson well and i think he is the last boy to do such a thing he is neither a fool nor a coward to put it shortly and he would need to have a great deal of both in him to run away  the head looked slightly relieved at this  youahthink so he said  i certainly do in the first place where unless he went home would he run to and as he would be going home in a couple of days in the ordinary course of things he would hardly be foolish enough to risk expulsion in such a way  mr merevale always rather enjoyed his straight talks with the headmaster unlike most of his colleagues he stood in no awe of him whatever he always found him ready to listen to sound argument and what was better willing to be convinced it was so in this case  then i think we may dismiss that idea said the head with visible relief the idea of such a scandal occurring at st austins had filled him with unfeigned horror and now i think it would be as well to go across to your house and hear what welch has to say about the matter unless thomson returns soonand it is already past nine oclockwe shall have to send out searchparties  five minutes later welch enjoying a sound beautysleep began to be possessed of a vague idea that somebody was trying to murder him his subsequent struggles for life partially woke him and enabled him to see dimly that two figures were standing by his bed  yes he murmured sleepily turning over on to his side again and preparing to doze off the shaking continued this was too much look here said he fiercely sitting up then he recognized his visitors as his eye fell on merevale he wondered whether anything had occurred to bring down his wrath upon him perhaps he had gone to bed without leave and was being routed out to read at prayers or do some work no he remembered distinctly getting permission to turn in what then could be the matter  at this point he recognized the headmaster and the last mists of sleep left him  yes sir he said wideawake now  merevale put the case briefly and clearly to him sorry to disturb you welch i know you are tired  not at all sir said welch politely  but there is something we must ask you you probably do not know that thomson has not returned  not returned  no nobody knows where he is you were probably the last to see him what happened when you and he started for the long run this afternoon you lost sight of the rest did you not  yes sir  well  and thomson dropped out  ah this from the headmaster  yes sir he said he couldnt go any farther he told me to go on and of course i did as it was a race i advised him to go back to the house and change he looked regularly done up i think he ran too hard in the mile yesterday  the head spoke  i thought that some such thing must have happened where was it that he dropped out welch  it was just as we came to a long ploughed field sir by the side of a big wood  parkers spinney i expect put in merevale  yes sir about a mile from the college  and you saw nothing more of him after that enquired the headmaster  no sir he was lying on his back when i left him i should think some of the others must have seen him after i did he didnt look as if he was likely to get up for some time  well said the head as he and merevale went out of the room leaving welch to his slumbers we have gained little by seeing welch i had hoped for something more i must send the prefects out to look for thomson at once  it will be a difficult business said merevale refrainingto his credit be it saidfrom a mention of needles and haystacks we have nothing to go upon he may be anywhere for all we know i suppose it is hardly likely that he is still where welch left him  the head seemed to think this improbable that would scarcely be the case unless he were very much exhausted it is more than five hours since welch saw him i can hardly believe that the worst exhaustion would last so long however if you would kindly tell your houseprefects of this  and send them out to search  yes we must do all we can tell them to begin searching where thomson was last seen i will go round to the other houses dear me this is exceedingly annoying exceedingly so  merevale admitted that it was and having seen his visitor out of the house went to the studies to speak to his prefects he found charteris and tony together in the formers sanctum  has anything been heard about thomson sir said tony as he entered  that is just what i want to see you about graham will you go and bring the rest of the prefects here  now he said as tony returned with swift and daintree the two remaining houseprefects you all know of course that thomson is not in the house the headmaster wants you to go and look for him welch seems to have been the last to see him and he left him lying in a ploughed field near parkers spinney you all know parkers spinney i suppose  yes sir  then you had better begin searching from there go in twos if you like or singly dont all go together i want you all to be back by eleven all got watches  yes sir  good youd better take lanterns of some sort i think i can raise a bicycle lamp each and there is a good moon look everywhere and shout as much as you like i think he must have sprained an ankle or something he is probably lying somewhere unable to move and too far away from the road to make his voice heard to anyone if you start now you will have just an hour and a half you should have found him by then the prefects from the other houses will help you  daintree put in a pertinent question  how about trespassing sir  oh go where you like in reason you know dont go getting the school mixed up in any unpleasantness of course but remember that your main object is to find thomson you all understand  yes sir  very good then start at once  by jove said swift when he had gone what an unholy rag this suits yours truly poor old jim though i wonder what the deuce has happened to him  at that very moment the headmaster leaving philpotts house to go to praters was wondering the same thing in spite of mr merevales argument he found himself drifting back to his former belief that jim had run away what else could keep him out of his house more than three hours after lockup and he had had some reason for running away for the conscia mens recti though an excellent institution in theory is not nearly so useful an ally as it should be in practice the head knocked at praters door pondering darkly within himself     17  well proceed to search for thomson if he be above the ground   how sweet the moonlight sleeps on yonder haystack observed charteris poetically as he and tony accompanied by swift and daintree made their way across the fields to parkers spinney each carried a bicycle lamp and at irregular intervals each broke into piercing yells to the marked discomfort of certain birds roosting in the neighbourhood who burst noisily from the trees and made their way with visible disgust to quieter spots  theres one thing said swift we ought to hear him if he yells on a night like this a yell ought to travel about a mile  suppose we try one now said charteris now a concerted piece andante in sixeight time ready  the next moment the stillness of the lovely spring night was shattered by a hideous uproar  rsvp said charteris to space in general as the echoes died away but there was no answer though they waited several minutes on the chance of hearing some sound that would indicate jims whereabouts  if he didnt hear that observed tony he cant be within three miles thats a cert wed better separate i think  they were at the ploughed field by parkers spinney now  anybody got a coin asked daintree lets toss for directions  charteris produced a shilling  my ewe lamb he said tails  tails it was charteris expressed his intention of striking westward and drawing the spinney he and tony made their way thither swift and daintree moving off together in the opposite direction  this is jolly rum said tony as they entered the spinney i wonder where the deuce the man has got to  yes its beastly serious really but im hanged if i can help feeling as if i were out on a picnic i suppose its the night air  i wonder if we shall find him  not the slightest chance in my opinion theres not the least good in looking through this forsaken spinney still wed better do it  yes dont make a row were trespassing  they moved on in silence halfway through the wood charteris caught his foot in a hole and fell  hurt said tony  only in spirit thanks the absolute dashed foolishness of this is being rapidly borne in upon me tony what is the good of it we shant find him here  tony put his foot down upon these opinions with exemplary promptitude  we must go on trying hang it all if it comes to the worst its better than frousting indoors  tony youre a philosopher lead on macduff  tony was about to do so when a form appeared in front of him blocking the way he flashed his lamp at the form and the form prefacing its remarks with a good honest swearwordof a variety peculiar to that part of the countryrequested him without any affectation of ceremonious courtesy to take his somethingorother lamp out of his the forms whatsitsnamed face and state his business briefly  surely i know that voice said charteris archibald my longlost brother  the keeper failed to understand him and said so tersely  can you tell me went on charteris if you have seen such a thing as a boy in this spinney lately we happen to have lost one an ordinary boy no special markings his name is thomson on the grampian hills  at this point the keeper felt that he had had enough he made a dive for the speaker  charteris dodged behind tony and his assailant not observing this proceeded to lay violent hands upon the latter who had been standing waiting during the conversation  let go you fool cried he the keepers hand had come smartly into contact with his left eye and from there had taken up a position on his shoulder in reply the keeper merely tightened his grip  ill count three said tony and  the keepers hand shifted to his collar  all right then said tony between his teeth he hit up with his left at the keepers wrist the hand on his collar loosed its grip its owner rushed and as he came tony hit him in the parts about the third waistcoatbutton with his right he staggered and fell tony hit very hard when the spirit moved him  come on man said charteris quickly before he gets his wind again we mustnt be booked trespassing  tony recognized the soundness of the advice they were out of the spinney in two minutes  now said charteris lets do a steady double to the road this is no place for us come on you man of blood  when they reached the road they slowed down to a walk again charteris laughed  i feel just as if wed done a murder somehow what an ass that fellow was to employ violence he went down all right didnt he  think therell be a row  no should think not he didnt see us properly anyhow he was interfering with an officer in the performance of his duty so were we i suppose well lets hope for the best hullo  whats up  all right its only somebody coming down the road thought it might be the keeper at first why its biffen  it was biffen he looked at them casually as he came up but stopped short in surprise when he saw who they were  mr charteris  the same said charteris enjoying a moonlight stroll biffen  but what are you doing out of the ouse at this time of night mr charteris  its this way said tony all the houseprefects have been sent out to look for thomson hes not come back  not come back sir  no bit queer isnt it the last anybody saw of him was when he dropped out of the long race near parkers spinney  i seen him later than that mr graham he come on to the grounds while i was mowing the cricket field  not really when was that  four alf past four nearly  what became of him  e went off with mr macarthur mr macarthur took im off ome with im i think sir  by jove said charteris with enthusiasm now we are on the track thanks awfully biffen ill remember you in my will come on tony  where are you going now  babes place of course the babe holds the clue to this business we must get it out of him night biffen  goodnight sir  arrived at the babes residence they rang the bell and in the interval of waiting for the door to be opened listened with envy to certain sounds of revelry which filtered through the windows of a room to the right of the porch  the babe seems to be making a night of it said charteris ohas the servant opened the doorcan we see mr macarthur please  the servant looked doubtful on the point  theres company tonight sir  i knew he was making a night of it said charteris to tony its not mr macarthur we want to see itsdash it whats the babes name  robert i believe wouldnt swear to it  mr robert is he in it seemed to charteris that the form of this question smacked of ollendorf he half expected the servant to say no but he has the mackintosh of his brothers cousin it produced the desired effect however for after inviting them to step in the servant disappeared and the babe came on the scene wearing a singularly prosperous expression as if he had dined well  hullo you chaps he said  sir to you said charteris look here babe we want to know what you have done with jim he was seen by competent witnesses to go off with you and hes not come back if youve murdered him you might let us have the body  not come back rot are you certain  my dear chap every houseprefect on the list has been sent out to look for him when did he leave here  the babe reflected  six i should think little after perhaps whyoh lord  he broke off suddenly  whats up asked tony  why i sent him by a short cut through some woods close by here and ive only just remembered theres a sort of quarry in the middle of them ill bet hes in there  great scott man what sort of a quarry i like the calm way the babe talks of sending unsuspecting friends into quarries deep  not very thank goodness still if he fell down he might not be able to get up again especially if hed hurt himself at all half a second let me get on some boots and ill come out and look shant be long  when he came back the three of them set out for the quarry  there you are cried the babe with an entirely improper pride in his voice considering the circumstances what did i tell you out of the darkness in front of them came a shout they recognized the voice at once as jims  tony uttered a yell of encouragement and was darting forward to the spot from which the cry had come when the babe stopped him dont do that man he said youll be over yourself if you dont look out its quite close here  he flashed one of the lamps in front of him the light fell on a black opening in the ground and jims voice sounded once more from the bowels of the earth this time quite close to where they stood  jim shouted charteris where are you  hullo said the voice whos that you might lug me out of here  are you hurt  twisted my ankle  how far down are you  not far ten feet about cant you get me out  half a second said the babe ill go and get help you chaps had better stay here and talk to him he ran off  how many of you are there up there asked jim  only tony and myself said charteris  thought i heard somebody else  oh that was the babe hes gone off to get help  oh when he comes back wring his neck and heave him down here said jim i want a word with him on the subject of short cuts i say is there much excitement about this  rather all the houseprefects are out after you weve been looking in parkers spinney and tony was reluctantly compelled to knock out a keeper who tried to stop us you should have been there it was a rag  wish i had been hullo is that the babe come back  it was the babe with his father and a party of friends arrayed in evening dress they carried a ladder amongst them  the pungent remarks jim had intended to address to the babe had no opportunity of active service it was not the babe who carried him up the ladder but two of the dinnerparty nor did the babe have a hand in the carrying of the stretcher that was done by as many of the eveningdress brigade as could get near enough they seemed to enjoy it one of them remarked that it reminded him of south africa to which another replied that it was far more like a party of policemen gathering in an early drunk in the marylebone road the procession moved on its stately way to the babes fathers house and the last tony and charteris saw of jim he was the centre of attraction and appeared to be enjoying himself very much  charteris envied him and did not mind saying so  why cant i smash my ankle he demanded indignantly of tony  he was nearing section five subsection three of his discourse when they reached merevales gates it was after eleven but they felt that the news they were bringing entitled them to be a little late charteris brought his arguments to a premature end and tony rang the bell merevale himself opened the door to them     18  in which the affairs of various persons are wound up   well he said youre rather late any luck  weve found him sir said tony  really thats a good thing where was he  hed fallen down a sort of quarry place near where macarthur lives macarthur took him home with him to tea and sent him back by a short cut forgetting all about the quarry and thomson fell in and couldnt get out again  is he hurt  only twisted his ankle sir  then where is he now  they carried him back to the house  macarthurs house  yes sir  oh well i suppose he will be all right then graham just go across and report to the headmaster will you youll find him in his study  the head was immensely relieved to hear tonys narrative after much internal debate he had at last come to the conclusion that jim must have run away and he had been wondering how he should inform his father of the fact  you are certain that he is not badly hurt graham he said when tony had finished his story  yes sir its only his ankle  very good goodnight graham  the head retired to bed that night filled with a virtuous resolve to seek jim out on the following day and speak a word in season to him on the subject of crime in general and betting in particular this plan he proceeded to carry out as soon as afternoon school was over when however he had arrived at the babes house he found that there was one small thing which he had left out of his calculations he had counted on seeing the invalid alone on entering the sickroom he found there mrs macarthur looking as if she intended to remain where she sat for several hourswhich indeed actually was her intentionand miss macarthur whose face and attitude expressed the same only if anything more so the fact was that the babe a very monument of resource on occasions had as he told jim given them the tip not to let the old man get at him unless he absolutely chucked them out you know when he had seen the headmaster approaching he had gone hurriedly to jims room to mention the fact with excellent results  the head took a seat by the bed and asked with a touch of nervousness after the injured ankle this induced mrs macarthur to embark on a disquisition concerning the ease with which ankles are twisted from which she drifted easily into a discussion of rugby football its merits and demerits the head after several vain attempts to jerk the conversation into other grooves gave it up and listened for some ten minutes to a series of anecdotes about various friends and acquaintances of mrs macarthurs who had either twisted their own ankles or known people who had twisted theirs the head began to forget what exactly he had come to say that afternoon jim lay and grinned covertly through it all when the head did speak his first words roused him effectually  i suppose mrs macarthur your son has told you that we have had a burglary at the school  hang it thought jim this isnt playing the game at all why talk shop especially that particular brand of shop here he wondered if the head intended to describe the burglary and then spring to his feet with a dramatic wave of the hand towards him and say there mrs macarthur is the criminal there lies the viper on whom you have lavished your hospitality the snaky and systematic serpent you have been induced by underhand means to pity look upon him and loathe him he stole the cups  yes indeed replied mrs macarthur i have heard a great deal about it i suppose you have never found out who it was that did it  jim lay back resignedly after all he had not done it and if the head liked to say he had well let him he didnt care  yes mrs macarthur we have managed to discover him  and who was it asked mrs macarthur much interested  now for it said jim to himself  we found that it was a man living in the village who had been doing some work on the school grounds he had evidently noticed the value of the cups and determined to try his hand at appropriating them he is well known as a poacher in the village it seems i think that for the future he will confine himself to thatahindustry for he is hardly likely ever toahshine as a professional housebreaker no  oh well that must be a relief to you i am sure mr perceval these poachers are a terrible nuisance they do frighten the birds so  she spoke as if it were an unamiable eccentricity on the part of the poachers which they might be argued out of if the matter were put before them in a reasonable manner the head agreed with her and rose to go jim watched him out of the room and then breathed a deep satisfying breath of relief his troubles were at an end  in the meantime barrett who having no inkling as to the rate at which affairs had been progressing since his visit to the dingle still imagined that the secret of the hollow tree belonged exclusively to reade himself and one other was much exercised in his mind about it reade candidly confessed himself baffled by the problem give him something moderately straightforward and he was all right this secret society and dark lantern style of affair was he acknowledged beyond him and so it came about that barrett resolved to do the only thing he could think of and go to the head about it but before he had come to this decision the head had received another visit from mr roberts as a result of which the table where sir alfred venner had placed plunketts pipe and other accessories so dramatically during a previous interview now bore another burdenthe missing cups  mr roberts had gone to the dingle in person and by adroit use of the divinity which hedges a detective had persuaded a keeper to lead him to the tree where as mr stokes had said the cups had been deposited  the heads first act on getting the cups was to send for welch to whom by right of conquest they belonged welch arrived shortly before barrett the head was just handing him his prizes when the latter came into the room it speaks well for barretts presence of mind that he had grasped the situation and decided on his line of action before welch went and the head turned his attention to him  well barrett said the head  if you please sir said barrett blandly may i have leave to go to stapleton  certainly barrett why do you wish to go  this was something of a poser but barretts brain worked quickly  i wanted to send a telegram sir  very well butwith suspicionwhy did you not ask mr philpott your housemaster can give you leave to go to stapleton  i couldnt find him sir this was true for he had not looked  ah very well  thank you sir  and barrett went off to tell reade that in some mysterious manner the cups had come back on their own account  when jim had congratulated himself that everything had ended happily at any rate as far as he himself was concerned he had forgotten for the moment that at present he had only one pound to his credit instead of the two which he needed charteris however had not the special number of the glow worm was due on the following day and jims accident left a considerable amount of copy to be accounted for he questioned tony on the subject  look here tony have you time to do any more stuff for the glow worm  my dear chap said tony ive not half done my own bits ask welch  i asked him just now he cant besides he only writes at about the rate of one word a minute and we must get it all in by tonight at bedtime im going to sit up as it is to jellygraph it whats up  tonys face had assumed an expression of dismay  why he said great scott i never thought of it before if we jellygraph it our handwritingll be recognized and that will give the whole show away  charteris took a seat and faced this difficulty in all its aspects the idea had never occurred to him before and yet it should have been obvious  ill have to copy the whole thing out in copperplate he said desperately at last my aunt what a job  ill help said tony welch will too i should think if you ask him how many jelly machine things can you raise  ive got three one for each of us wait a bit ill go and ask welch  welch having first ascertained that the matter really was a pressing one agreed without hesitation he had objections to spoiling his sleep without reason but in moments of emergency he put comfort behind him  good said charteris when this had been settled be here as soon as you can after eleven i tell you what well do the thing in style and brew it oughtnt to take more than an hour or so itll be rather a rag than otherwise  and how about jims stuff asked welch  i shall have to do that as you cant ive done my own bits i think id better start now he did and with success when he went to bed at halfpast ten the glow worm was ready in manuscript only the copying and printing remained to be done  charteris was out of bed and in the study just as eleven struck tony and welch arriving halfanhour later found him hard at work copying out an article of topical interest in a fair round hand quite unrecognizable as his own  it was an impressive scene the gas had been cut off as it always was when the house went to bed and they worked by the light of candles occasionally welch breathing heavily in his efforts to make his handwriting look like that of a member of a boardschool second standard blew one or more of the candles out and the others grunted fiercely that was all they could do for for evident reasons a vow of silence had been imposed charteris was the first to finish he leant back in his chair and the chair which at a reasonable hour of the day would have endured any treatment collapsed now with a noise like a pistolshot  now youve done it said tony breaking all rules by speaking considerably above a whisper  welch went to the door and listened the house was still they settled down once more to work charteris lit the spiritlamp and began to prepare the meal the others toiled painfully on at their roundhand they finished almost simultaneously  not another stroke do i do said tony till ive had something to drink is that water boiling yet  it was at exactly a quarter past two that the work was finished  never again said charteris looking with pride at the piles of glow worms stacked on the table this jelly business makes one beastly sticky i think well keep to print in future  and they did out of the twenty or more numbers of the glow worm published during charteris stay at school that was the only one that did not come from the press readers who have themselves tried jellygraphing will sympathize it is a curious operation but most people will find one trial quite sufficient that special number however reached a record circulation the school had got its journeymoney by the time it appeared and wanted something to read in the train jims pound was raised with ease  charteris took it round to him at the babes house together with a copy of the special number  by jove said jim thanks awfully do you know id absolutely forgotten all about the glow worm i was to have written something for this number wasnt i  and considering the circumstances that remark as charteris was at some pains to explain to him at the time containedwhen you came to analyse itmore cynical immorality to the cubic foot than any other halfdozen remarks he charteris had ever heard in his life  it passes out of the realm of the merely impudent he said with a happy recollection of a certain favourite author of his and soars into the boundless empyrean of pure cheek
