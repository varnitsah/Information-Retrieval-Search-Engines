37524651	illustration harar from the coffe stream  first footsteps in east africa or an exploration of harar  by richard f burton     to the honorable james grant lumsden member of council etc etc bombay   i have ventured my dear lumsden to address you in and inscribe to you these pages within your hospitable walls my project of african travel was matured in the fond hope of submitting on return to your friendly criticism the record of adventures in which you took so warm an interest dis aliter visum still i would prove that my thoughts are with you and thus request you to accept with your wonted bonhommie this feeble token of a sincere good will     preface   averse to writing as well as to reading diffuse prolegomena the author finds himself compelled to relate at some length the circumstances which led to the subject of these pages  in may 1849 the late viceadmiral sir charles malcolm formerly superintendent of the indian navy in conjunction with mr william john hamilton then president of the royal geographical society of great britain solicited the permission of the court of directors of the honorable east india company to ascertain the productive resources of the unknown somali country in east africa 1 the answer returned was to the following effect  if a fit and proper person volunteer to travel in the somali country he goes as a private traveller the government giving no more protection to him than they would to an individual totally unconnected with the service they will allow the officer who obtains permission to go during his absence on the expedition to retain all the pay and allowances he may be enjoying when leave was granted they will supply him with all the instruments required afford him a passage going and returning and pay the actual expenses of the journey  the project lay dormant until march 1850 when sir charles malcolm and captain smyth president of the royal geographical society of great britain waited upon the chairman of the court of directors of the honorable east india company he informed them that if they would draw up a statement of what was required and specify how it could be carried into effect the document should be forwarded to the governorgeneral of india with a recommendation that should no objection arise either from expense or other causes a fit person should be permitted to explore the somali country  sir charles malcolm then offered the charge of the expedition to dr carter of bombay an officer favourably known to the indian world by his services on board the palinurus brig whilst employed upon the maritime survey of eastern arabia dr carter at once acceded to the terms proposed by those from whom the project emanated but his principal object being to compare the geology and botany of the somali country with the results of his arabian travels he volunteered to traverse only that part of eastern africa which lies north of a line drawn from berberah to ras hafunin fact the maritime mountains of the somal his health not permitting him to be left on shore he required a cruizer to convey him from place to place and to preserve his store of presents and provisions by this means he hoped to land at the most interesting points and to penetrate here and there from sixty to eighty miles inland across the region which he undertook to explore  on the 17th of august 1850 sir charles malcolm wrote to dr carter in these termsi have communicated with the president of the royal geographical society and others the feeling is that though much valuable information could no doubt be gained by skirting the coast as you propose both in geology and botany yet that it does not fulfil the primary and great object of the london geographical society which was and still is to have the interior explored the viceadmiral however proceeded to say that under the circumstances of the case dr carters plans were approved of and asked him to confer immediately with commodore lushington then commander in chief of the indian navy  in may 1851 viceadmiral sir charles malcolm died geographers and travellers lost in him an influential and an energetic friend during the ten years of his superintendence over the indian navy that service rose despite the incubus of profound peace to the highest distinction he freely permitted the officers under his command to undertake the task of geographical discovery retaining their rank pay and batta whilst the actual expenses of their journeys were defrayed by contingent bills all papers and reports submitted to the local government were favourably received and the successful traveller looked forward to distinction and advancement  during the decade which elapsed between 1828 and 1838 officers of the indian navy journeyed as the phrase is with their lives in their hands through the wildest districts of the east of these we name the late commander j a young lieutenants wellsted wyburd wood and christopher retired commander ormsby the present capt h b lynch cb commanders felix jones and w c barker lieutenants cruttenden and whitelock their researches extended from the banks of the bosphorus to the shores of india of the vast the immeasurable value of such services to quote the words of the quarterly review no cxxix dec 1839 which able officers thus employed are in the mean time rendering to science to commerce to their country and to the whole civilized world we need say nothingnothing we could say would be too much  in five years the admirable maps of that coralbound gulfthe red sea were complete the terrors of the navigation had given place to the confidence inspired by excellent surveys in 1829 the thetis of ten guns under commander robert moresby convoyed the first coal ship up the red sea of the coasts of which this skilful and enterprising seaman made a cursory survey from which emanated the subsequent trigonometrical operations which form our present maps two ships were employed the benares and palinurus the former under commander elwon the latter under commander moresby it remained however for the latter officer to complete the work some idea may be formed of the perils these officers and men went through when we state the benares was fortytwo times aground  robert moresby the genius of the red sea conducted also the survey of the maldive islands and groups known as the chagos archipelago he narrowly escaped being a victim to the deleterious climate of his station and only left it when no longer capable of working a host of young and ardent officerschristopher young powell campbell jones barker and othersably seconded him death was busy amongst them for months and so paralyzed by disease were the living that the anchors could scarcely be raised for a retreat to the coast of india renovated by a three months stay occasionally in port where they were strengthened by additional numbers the undaunted remnants from time to time returned to their task and in 1837 gave to the world a knowledge of those singular groups which heretoforethough within 150 miles of our coastshad been a mystery hidden within the dangers that environed them the beautiful maps of the red sea drafted by the late commodore carless 2 then a lieutenant will ever remain permanent monuments of indian naval science and the daring of its officers and men those of the maldive and chagos groups executed by commander then acting lieutenant felix jones were we hear of such a high order that they were deemed worthy of special inspection by the queen  while these enlightening operations were in progress there were others of this profession no less distinguished employed on similar discoveries the coast of mekran westward from scinde was little known but it soon found a place in the hydrographical offices of india under captain then lieutenant stafford haines and his staff who were engaged on it the journey to the oxus made by lieut wood sir a burness companion in his lahore and afghan missions is a page of history which may not be opened to us again in our own times while in lieut carlesss drafts of the channels of the indus we trace those designs that the sword of sir charles napier only was destined to reveal  the ten years prior to that of 1839 were those of fitful repose such as generally precedes some great outbreak the repose afforded ample leisure for research and the shores of the island of socotra with the south coast of arabia were carefully delineated besides the excellent maps of these regions we are indebted to the survey for that unique work on oman by the late lieut wellsted of this service and for valuable notices from the pen of lieut cruttenden 3  besides the works we have enumerated there were others of the same nature but on a smaller scale in operation at the same period around our own coasts the gulf of cambay and the dangerous sands known as the molucca banks were explored and faithfully mapped by captain richard ethersey assisted by lieutenant now commander fell bombay harbour was delineated again on a grand scale by capt r cogan assisted by lieut peters now both dead and the ink of the maldive charts had scarcely dried when the labours of those employed were demanded of the indian government by her majestys authorities at ceylon to undertake trigonometrical surveys of that island and the dangerous and shallow gulfs on either side of the neck of sand connecting it with india they were the present captains f f powell and richard ethersey in the schooner royal tiger and shannon assisted by lieut now commander felix jones and the late lieut wilmot christopher who fell in action before mooltan the first of these officers had charge of one of the tenders under lieut powell and the latter another under lieut ethersey the maps of the pamban pass and the straits of manaar were by the hand of lieut felix jones who was the draftsman also on this survey they speak for themselves 4  in 1838 sir charles malcolm was succeeded by sir robert oliver an old officer of the old schoola strict disciplinarian a faithful and honest servant of government but a violent limited and prejudiced man he wanted sailors individuals conversant with ropes and rigging and steeped in knowledge of shot and shakings he loved the rule of thumb he hated literary razors and he viewed science with the profoundest contempt about twenty surveys were ordered to be discontinued as an inauguratory measure causing the loss of many thousand pounds independent of such contingencies as the memnon 5 batta was withheld from the few officers who obtained leave and the life of weary labour on board ship was systematically made monotonous and uncomfortablein local phrase it was described as many stripes and no stars few measures were omitted to heighten the shock of contrast no notice was taken of papers forwarded to government and the man who attempted to distinguish himself by higher views than quarterdeck duties found himself marked out for the angry commodores redhot displeasure no place was allowed for charts and plans valuable original surveys of which no duplicates existed lay tossed amongst the brick and mortar with which the marine office was being rebuilt no instruments were provided for ships even a barometer was not supplied in one case although duly indented for during five years whilst sir charles malcolm ruled the bombay dockyards the british name rose high in the indian african and arabian seas each vessel had its presents guns pistols and powder abbas crimson cloth and shawls watches telescopes and similar articleswith a suitable stock of which every officer visiting the interior on leave was supplied an order from sir robert oliver withdrew presents as well as instruments with them disappeared the just idea of our faith and greatness as a nation entertained by the maritime races who formerly looked forward to the arrival of our cruizers thus the indian navy was crushed by neglect and routine into a mere transport service remarkable for little beyond constant quarrels between sealieutenants and landlieutenants sailor officers and soldierofficers their passengers and thus resulted that dearth of enterprisealluded to ex cathedra by a late president of the royal geographical society of great britainwhich now characterises western india erst so celebrated for ardour in adventure  to return to the subject of east african discovery commodore lushington and dr carter met in order to concert some measures for forwarding the plans of a somali expedition it was resolved to associate three persons drs carter and stocks and an officer of the indian navy a vessel was also warned for service on the coast of africa this took place in the beginning of 1851 presently commodore lushington resigned his command and the project fell to the ground  the author of these pages after his return from el hajaz to bombay conceived the idea of reviving the somali expedition he proposed to start in the spring of 1854 and accompanied by two officers to penetrate via harar and gananah to zanzibar his plans were favourably received by the right hon lord elphinstone the enlightened governor of the colony and by the local authorities amongst whom the name of james grant lumsden then member of council will ever suggest the liveliest feelings of gratitude and affection but it being judged necessary to refer once more for permission to the court of directors an official letter bearing date the 28th april 1854 was forwarded from bombay with a warm recommendation lieut herne of the 1st bombay european regiment of fusileers an officer skilful in surveying photography and mechanics together with the writer obtained leave pending the reference and a free passage to aden in arabia on the 23rd august a favourable reply was despatched by the court of directors  meanwhile the most painful of events had modified the original plan the third member of the expedition assistant surgeon j ellerton stocks whose brilliant attainments as a botanist whose long and enterprising journeys and whose eminently practical bent of mind had twice recommended him for the honors and trials of african exploration died suddenly in the prime of life deeply did his friends lament him for many reasons a universal favourite he left in the social circle a void never to be filled up and they mourned the more that fate had not granted him the time as it had given him the will and the power to trace a deeper and more enduring mark upon the iron tablets of fame  no longer hoping to carry out his first project the writer determined to make the geography and commerce of the somali country his principal objects he therefore applied to the bombay government for the assistance of lieut william stroyan i n an officer distinguished by his surveys on the coast of western india in sindh and on the panjab rivers it was not without difficulty that such valuable services were spared for the deadly purpose of penetrating into eastern africa all obstacles however were removed by their ceaseless and energetic efforts who had fostered the authors plans and early in the autumn of 1854 lieut stroyan received leave to join the expedition at the same time lieut j h speke of the 46th regiment bengal n i who had spent many years collecting the fauna of thibet and the himalayan mountains volunteered to share the hardships of african exploration  in october 1854 the writer and his companions received at aden in arabia the sanction of the court of directors it was his intention to march in a body using berberah as a base of operations westwards to harar and thence in a southeasterly direction towards zanzibar  but the voice of society at aden was loud against the expedition the rough manners the fierce looks and the insolent threats of the somal the effects of our too peaceful rulehad prepossessed the timid colony at the eye of yemen with an idea of extreme danger the anglosaxon spirit suffers it has been observed from confinement within any but wooden walls and the european degenerates rapidly as do his bulldogs his gamecocks and other pugnacious animals in the hot enervating and unhealthy climates of the east the writer and his comrades were represented to be men deliberately going to their death and the somal at aden were not slow in imitating the example of their rulers the savages had heard of the costly shoa mission its 300 camels and 50 mules and they longed for another rehearsal of the drama according to them a vast outlay was absolutely necessary every village must be feasted every chief propitiated with magnificent presents and dollars must be dealt out by handfuls the political resident refused to countenance the scheme proposed and his objection necessitated a further change of plans  accordingly lieut herne was directed to proceed after the opening of the annual fairseason to berberah where no danger was apprehended it was judged that the residence of this officer upon the coast would produce a friendly feeling on the part of the somal and as indeed afterwards proved to be the case would facilitate the writers egress from harar by terrifying the ruler for the fate of his caravans 6 lieut herne who on the 1st of january 1855 was joined by lieut stroyan resided on the african coast from november to april he inquired into the commerce the caravan lines and the state of the slave trade visited the maritime mountains sketched all the places of interest and made a variety of meteorological and other observations as a prelude to extensive research  lieut speke was directed to land at bunder guray a small harbour in the arz el aman or land of safety as the windward somal style their country his aim was to trace the celebrated wady nogal noting its watershed and other peculiarities to purchase horses and camels for the future use of the expedition and to collect specimens of the reddish earth which according to the older african travellers denotes the presence of gold dust 7 lieut speke started on the 23rd october 1854 and returned after about three months to aden he had failed through the rapacity and treachery of his guide to reach the wady nogal but he had penetrated beyond the maritime chain of hills and his journal condensed in the appendix proves that he had collected some novel and important information  meanwhile the author assuming the disguise of an arab merchant prepared to visit the forbidden city of harar he left aden on the 29th of october 1854 arrived at the capital of the ancient hadiyah empire on the 3rd january 1855 and on the 9th of the ensuing february returned in safety to arabia with the view of purchasing stores and provisions for a second and a longer journey 8 what unforeseen circumstance cut short the career of the proposed expedition the postscript of the present volume will show  the following pages contain the writers diary kept daring his march to and from harar it must be borne in mind that the region traversed on this occasion was previously known only by the vague reports of native travellers all the abyssinian discoverers had traversed the dankali and other northern tribes the land of the somal was still a terra incognita harar moreover had never been visited and few are the cities of the world which in the present age when men hurry about the earth have not opened their gates to european adventure the ancient metropolis of a once mighty race the only permanent settlement in eastern africa the reported seat of moslem learning a walled city of stone houses possessing its independent chief its peculiar population its unknown language and its own coinage the emporium of the coffee trade the headquarters of slavery the birthplace of the kat plant 9 and the great manufactory of cottoncloths amply it appeared deserved the trouble of exploration that the writer was successful in his attempt the following pages will prove unfortunately it was found impossible to use any instruments except a pocket compass a watch and a portable thermometer more remarkable for convenience than correctness but the way was thus paved for scientific observation shortly after the authors departure from harar the amir or chief wrote to the acting political resident at aden earnestly begging to be supplied with a frank physician and offering protection to any european who might be persuaded to visit his dominions  the appendix contains the following papers connected with the movements of the expedition in the winter of 1854  1 the diary and observations made by lieut speke when attempting to reach the wady nogal  2 a sketch of the grammar and a vocabulary of the harari tongue this dialect is little known to european linguists the only notices of it hitherto published are in salts abyssinia appendix i p 610 by balbi atlas ethnogr tab xxxix no 297 kielmaier ausland 1840 no 76 and dr beke philological journal april 25 1845  3 meteorological observations in the cold season of 185455 by lieuts herne stroyan and the author  4 a brief description of certain peculiar customs noticed in nubia by brown and werne under the name of fibulation  5 the conclusion is a condensed account of an attempt to reach harar from ankobar 10 on the 14th october 1841 major sir william cornwallis harris then captain in the bombay engineers chief of the mission sent from india to the king of shoa advised lieut w barker i n whose services were imperatively required by sir robert oliver to return from abyssinia via harar over a road hitherto untrodden by europeans as his majesty sahalah selassie had offered friendly letters to the moslem amir capt harris had no doubt of the success of the enterprise although the adventurous explorer was prevented by the idle fears of the bedouin somal and the rapacity of his guides from visiting the city his pages as a narrative of travel will amply reward perusal they have been introduced into this volume mainly with the view of putting the reader in possession of all that has hitherto been written and not published upon the subject of harar 11 for the same reason the author has not hesitated to enrich his pages with observations drawn from lieutenants cruttenden and rigby the former printed in the transactions of the bombay geographical society two excellent papers one headed a report on the mijjertheyn tribe of somallies inhabiting the district forming the north east point of africa secondly a memoir on the western or edoor tribes inhabiting the somali coast of north east africa with the southern branches of the family of darood resident on the banks of the webbe shebayli commonly called the river webbe lieut c p rigby 16th regiment bombay n i published also in the transactions of the geographical society of bombay an outline of the somali language with vocabulary which supplied a great lacuna in the dialects of eastern africa  a perusal of the following pages will convince the reader that the extensive country of the somal is by no means destitute of capabilities though partially desert and thinly populated it possesses valuable articles of traffic and its harbours export the produce of the gurague abyssinian galla and other inland races the natives of the country are essentially commercial they have lapsed into barbarism by reason of their political conditionthe rude equality of the hottentotsbut they appear to contain material for a moral regeneration as subjects they offer a favourable contrast to their kindred the arabs of el yemen a race untameable as the wolf and which subjugated in turn by abyssinian persian egyptian and turk has ever preserved an indomitable spirit of freedom and eventually succeeded in skaking off the yoke of foreign dominion for half a generation we have been masters of aden filling southern arabia with our calicos and rupeeswhat is the present state of affairs there we are dared by the bedouins to come forth from behind our stone walls and fight like men in the plainbritish proteges are slaughtered within the range of our gunsour allies villages have been burned in sight of adenour deserters are welcomed and our fugitive felons protectedour supplies are cut off and the garrison is reduced to extreme distress at the word of a halfnaked banditthe miscreant bhagi who murdered capt mylne in cold blood still roams the hills unpunishedgross insults are the sole acknowledgments of our peaceful overturesthe british flag has been fired upon without return our cruizers being ordered to act only on the defensiveand our forbearance to attack is universally asserted and believed to arise from mere cowardice such is and such will be the character of the arab  the sublime porte still preserves her possessions in the tahamah and the regions conterminous to yemen by the stringent measures with which mohammed ali of egypt opened the robberhaunted suez road whenever a turk or a traveller is murdered a few squadrons of irregular cavalry are ordered out they are not too nice upon the subject of retaliation and rarely refuse to burn a village or two or to lay waste the crops near the scene of outrage  a civilized people like ourselves objects to such measures for many reasons of which none is more feeble than the fear of perpetuating a blood feud with the arabs our present relations with them are a very pretty quarrel and moreover one which time must strengthen cannot efface by a just wholesome and unsparing severity we may inspire the bedouin with fear instead of contempt the veriest visionary would deride the attempt to animate him with a higher sentiment  peace observes a modern sage is the dream of the wise war is the history of man to indulge in such dreams is but questionable wisdom it was not a peacepolicy which gave the portuguese a seaboard extending from cape non to macao by no peace policy the osmanlis of a past age pushed their victorious arms from the deserts of tartary to aden to delhi to algiers and to the gates of vienna it was no peace policy which made the russians seat themselves upon the shores of the black the baltic and the caspian seas gaining in the space of 150 years and despite war retaining a territory greater than england and france united no peace policy enabled the french to absorb region after region in northern africa till the mediterranean appears doomed to sink into a gallic lake the english of a former generation were celebrated for gaining ground in both hemispheres their broad lands were not won by a peace policy which however in this our day has on two distinct occasions well nigh lost for them the gem of the british empireindia the philanthropist and the political economist may fondly hope by outcry against territorial aggrandizement by advocating a compact frontier by abandoning colonies and by cultivating equilibrium to retain our rank amongst the great nations of the world never the facts of history prove nothing more conclusively than this a race either progresses or retrogrades either increases or diminishes the children of time like their sire cannot stand still  the occupation of the port of berberah has been advised for many reasons  in the first place berberah is the true key of the red sea the centre of east african traffic and the only safe place for shipping upon the western erythroean shore from suez to guardafui backed by lands capable of cultivation and by hills covered with pine and other valuable trees enjoying a comparatively temperate climate with a regular although thin monsoon this harbour has been coveted by many a foreign conqueror circumstances have thrown it as it were into our arms and if we refuse the chance another and a rival nation will not be so blind  secondly we are bound to protect the lives of british subjects upon this coast in ad 1825 the crew of the mary ann brig was treacherously murdered by the somal the consequence of a summary and exemplary punishment 12 was that in august 1843 when the heics warsteamer memnon was stranded at ras assayr near cape guardafui no outrage was attempted by the barbarians upon whose barren shores our seamen remained for months labouring at the wreck in ad 1855 the somal having forgotten the old lesson renewed their practices of pillaging and murdering strangers it is then evident that this people cannot be trusted without supervision and equally certain that vessels are ever liable to be cast ashore in this part of the red sea but a year ago the french steam corvette le caiman was lost within sight of zayla the bedouin somal principally eesa assembled a fanatic host which was however dispersed before blood had been drawn by the exertion of the governor and his guards it remains for us therefore to provide against such contingencies were one of the peninsular and oriental companys vessels cast by any accident upon this inhospitable shore in the present state of affairs the lives of the passengers and the cargo would be placed in imminent peril  in advocating the establishment of an armed post at berberah no stress is laid upon the subject of slavery to cut off that traffic the possession of the great export harbour is by no means necessary whenever a british cruizer shall receive positive and bona fide orders to search native craft and to sell as prizes all that have slaves on board the trade will receive a deathblow  certain measures have been taken during the last annual fair to punish the outrage perpetrated by the somal at berberah in ad 1855 the writer on his return to aden proposed that the several clans implicated in the offence should at once be expelled from british dominions this preliminary was carried out by the acting political resident at aden moreover it was judged advisable to blockade the somali coast from siyaro to zayla not concluded until in the first place lieut stroyans murderer and the ruffian who attempted to spear lieut speke in cold blood should be given up 13 and secondly that due compensation for all losses should be made by the plunderers the former condition was approved by the right honorable the governorgeneral of india who however objected it is said to the moneydemand 14 at present the he ics cruizers mahi and elphinstone are blockading the harbour of berberah the somal have offered 15000 dollars indemnity and they pretend as usual that the murderer has been slain by his tribe  to conclude the writer has had the satisfaction of receiving from his comrades assurances that they are willing to accompany him once more in task of african exploration the plans of the frank are now publicly known to the somali should the loss of life however valuable be an obstacle to prosecuting them he must fall in the esteem of the races around him on the contrary should he after duly chastising the offenders carry out the original plan he will command the respect of the people and wipe out the memory of a temporary reverse at no distant period the project will it is hoped be revived nothing is required but permission to renew the attemptan indulgence which will not be refused by a government raised by energy enterprise and perseverance from the ranks of merchant society to national wealth and imperial grandeur  14 st jamess square 10th february 1856   footnotes  1 it occupies the whole of the eastern horn extending from the north of bab el mandeb to several degrees south of cape guardafui in the former direction it is bounded by the dankali and the ittoo gallas in the latter by the sawahil or negrotic regions the red sea is its eastern limit and westward it stretches to within a few miles of harar  2 in ad 1838 lieut carless surveyed the seaboard of the somali country from ras hafun to burnt island unfortunately his labours were allowed by sir charles malcolms successor to lie five years in the obscurity of ms meanwhile the steam frigate memnon capt powell commanding was lost at ras assayr a nories chart an antiquated document with an error of from fifteen to twenty miles being the only map of reference on board thus the indian government by the dilatoriness and prejudices of its superintendent of marine sustained an unjustifiable loss of at least 50000l  3 in ad 183638 lieut cruttenden published descriptions of travel which will be alluded to in a subsequent part of this preface  4 this hasty sketch of the scientific labours of the indian navy is extracted from an able anonymous pamphlet unpromisingly headed grievances and present condition of our indian officers  5 in ad 1848 the late mr joseph hume called in the house of commons for a return of all indian surveys carried on during the ten previous years the result proved that no less than a score had been suddenly broken up by order of sir robert oliver  6 this plan was successfully adopted by messrs antoine and arnauld dabbadie when travelling in dangerous parts of abyssinia and the adjacent countries  7 in ad 1660 vermuyden found gold at gambia always on naked and barren hills embedded in a reddish earth  8 the writer has not unfrequently been blamed by the critics of indian papers for venturing into such dangerous lands with an outfit nearly 1500l in value in the somali as in other countries of eastern africa travellers must carry not only the means of purchasing passage but also the very necessaries of life money being unknown such bulky articles as cottoncloth tobacco and beads are necessary to provide meat and milk and he who would eat bread must load his camels with grain the somal of course exaggerate the cost of travelling every chief however may demand a small present and every pauper as will be seen in the following pages expects to be fed  9 it is described at length in chap iii  10 the author hoped to insert lieut bernes journal kept at berberah and the different places of note in its vicinity as yet however the paper has not been received  11 harar has frequently been described by hearsay the following are the principal authorities  rochet second voyage dans le pays des adels c paris 1846 page 263  sir w cornwallis harris highlands of aethiopia vol i ch 43 et passim  cruttenden

1825 the government of bombay received intelligence that a brig from the mauritius had been seized plundered and broken up near berberah and that part of her crew had been barbarously murdered by the somali the elphinstone sloop of war capt greer commanding was sent to blockade the coast when her guns opened fire the people fled with their wives and children and the spot where a horseman was killed by a cannon ball is still shown on the plain near the town through the intervention of el hajj sharmarkay the survivors were recovered the somal bound themselves to abstain from future attacks upon english vessels and also to refund by annual instalments the full amount of plundered property for the purpose of enforcing the latter stipulation it was resolved that a vessel of war should remain upon the coast until the whole was liquidated when attempts at evasion occurred the traffic was stopped by sending all craft outside the guardship and forbidding intercourse with the shore the coote capt pepper commanding the palinurus and the tigris in turn with the elphinstone maintained the blockade through the trading seasons till 1833 about 6000l were recovered and the people were strongly impressed with the fact that we had both the will and the means to keep their plundering propensities within bounds  13 the writer advised that these men should be hung upon the spot where the outrage was committed that the bodies should be burned and the ashes cast into the sea lest by any means the murderers might become martyrs this precaution should invariably be adopted when moslems assassinate infidels  14 the reason of the objection is not apparent a savage people is imperfectly punished by a few deaths the fine is the only true way to produce a lasting impression upon their heads and hearts moreover it is the custom of india and the east generally and is in reality the only safeguard of a travellers property   illustration map to illustrate lieut burtons route to

knows what to expect from the hand of st george thus the various travellers who appeared in beaver and black coats became persuaded that the city was inaccessible and europeans ceased to trouble themselves about harar  it is therefore a point of honor with me dear l to utilise my title of haji by entering the city visiting the ruler and returning in safety after breaking the guardian spell  the most auspicious day in the moslem year for beginning a journey is doubtless the 6th of the month safar 2 on which quoth the prophet el islam emerged from obscurity yet even at aden we could not avail ourselves of this lucky time our delays and difficulties were a fit prelude for a journey amongst those blameless ethiopians with whom no less a personage than august jove can dine and depart 3  on sunday the 29th october 1854 our manifold impediments were pronounced complete friend s threw the slipper of blessing at my back and about 4 pm embarking from maala bunder we shook out our muslin and sailed down the fiery harbour passing the guardboat we delivered our permit before venturing into the open sea we repeated the fatihah prayer in honor of the shaykh majid inventor of the mariners compass 4 and evening saw us dancing on the bright clear tide whose magic waves however murmured after another fashion the siren song which charmed the senses of the old arabian voyagers 5  suddenly every trace of civilisation fell from my companions as if it had been a garment at aden shaven and beturbaned arab fashion now they threw off all dress save the loin cloth and appeared in their dark morocco mohammed filled his mouth with a mixture of coarse surat tobacco and ashesthe latter article intended like the angloindian soldiers chili in his arrack to make it bite guled uncovered his head a member which in africa is certainly made to go bare and buttered himself with an unguent redolent of sheeps tail and ismail the rais or captain of our foyst 6 the sahalah applied himself to puffing his nicotiana out of a goats shankbone our crew consisting of seventyone men and boys prepared as evening fell a mess of jowari grain 7 and grease the recipe of which i spare you and it was despatched in a style that would have done credit to kafirs as regards gobbling bolting smearing lips licking fingers and using ankles as napkins then with a light easterly breeze and the ominous cliffs of little aden still in sight we spread our mats on deck and prepared to sleep under the moon 8  my companions however felt without perhaps comprehending the joviality arising from a return to nature every man was forthwith nicknamed and pitiless was the raillery upon the venerable subjects of long and short fat and thin one sang a warsong another a lovesong a third some song of the sea whilst the fourth an eesa youth with the villanous expression of face common to his tribe gave us a rain measure such as men chaunt during wet weather all these effusions were naive and amusing none however could bear english translation without an amount of omission which would change their nature each effort of minstrelsy was accompanied by roars of laughter and led to much manual pleasantry all swore that they had never spent intellectually speaking a more charming soiree and pitied me for being unable to enter thoroughly into the spirit of the dialogue truly it is not only the polished european as was said of a certain travelling notability that lapses with facility into pristine barbarism  i will now introduce you to my companions the managing man is one mohammed mahmud 9 generally called el hammal or the porter he is a havildar or sergeant in the aden police and was entertained for me by lieut dansey an officer who unfortunately was not confirmed in a political appointment at aden the hammal is a bullnecked roundheaded fellow of lymphatic temperament with a lampblack skin regular features and a pulpy figuretwo rarities amongst his countrymen who compare him to a banyan an orphan in early youth and becoming to use his own phrase sick of milk he ran away from his tribe the habr gerhajis and engaged himself as a coaltrimmer with the slaves on board an indian war steamer after rising in rank to the command of the crew he became servant and interpreter to travellers visited distant landsegypt and calcuttaand finally settled as a feringhee policeman he cannot read or write but he has all the knowledge to be acquired by fifteen or twenty years hard knocking about he can make a long speech and although he never prays a longer prayer he is an excellent mimic and delights his auditors by imitations and descriptions of indian ceremony egyptian dancing arab vehemence persian abuse european vivacity and turkish insolence with prodigious inventiveness and a habit of perpetual intrigue acquired in his travels he might be called a knowing man but for the truly somali weakness of showing in his countenance all that passes through his mind this people can hide nothing the blank eye the contracting brow the opening nostril and the tremulous lip betray despite themselves their innermost thoughts  the second servant whom i bring before you is guled another policeman at aden he is a youth of good family belonging to the ismail arrah the royal clan of the great habr gerhajis tribe his father was a man of property and his brethren near berberah are wealthy bedouins yet he ran away from his native country when seven or eight years old and became a servant in the house of a butter merchant at mocha thence he went to aden where he began with private service and ended his career in the police he is one of those long live skeletons common amongst the somal his shoulders are parallel with his ears his ribs are straight as a mummys his face has not an ounce of flesh upon it and his features suggest the idea of some lank bird we call him long guled to which he replies with the yemen saying length is honor even in wood he is brave enough because he rushes into danger without reflection his great defects are weakness of body and nervousness of temperament leading in times of peril to the trembling of hands the dropping of caps and the mismanagement of bullets besides which he cannot bear hunger thirst or cold  the third is one abdy abokr also of the habr gerhajis a personage whom from his smattering of learning and his prodigious rascality we call the mulla end of time 10 he is a man about forty very oldlooking for his age with small deepset cunning eyes placed close together a hook nose a thin beard a bulging brow scattered teeth 11 and a short scant figure remarkable only for length of back his gait is stealthy like a cats and he has a villanous grin this worthy never prays and can neither read nor write but he knows a chapter or two of the koran recites audibly a long ratib or task morning and evening 12 whence together with his store of hashed hadis tradition he derives the title of widad or hedgepriest his tongue primed with the satirical sayings of abn zayd el helali and humayd ibn mansur 13 is the terror of men upon whom repartee imposes his father was a wealthy shipowner in his day but cursed with abdy and another son the old man has lost all his property his children have deserted him and he now depends entirely upon the charity of the zayla chief the end of time has squandered considerable sums in travelling far and wide from harar to cutch he has managed everywhere to perpetrate some peculiar villany he is a pleasant companion and piques himself upon that power of quotation which in the east makes a polite man if we be disposed to hurry he insinuates that patience is of heaven haste of hell when roughly addressed he remarks    there are cures for the hurts of lead and steel   but the wounds of the tonguethey never heal  if a grain of rice adhere to our beards he says smilingly the gazelle is in the garden to which we reply we will hunt her with the five 14 despite these merits i hesitated to engage him till assured by the governor of zayla that he was to be looked upon as a son and moreover that he would bear with him one of those state secrets to an influential chief which in this country are never committed to paper i found him an admirable buffoon skilful in filling pipes and smoking them au reste an individual of many words and little work infinite intrigue cowardice cupidity and endowed with a truly evil tongue  the morning sun rose hot upon us showing mayyum and zubah the giant staples of the gate under the pleiades 15 shortly afterwards we came in sight of the barr el ajam barbarian land as the somal call their country 16 a low glaring flat of yellow sand desert and heatreeking tenanted by the eesa and a meet habitat for savages such to us at least appeared the land of adel 17 at midday we descried the ras el birheadland of the wellthe promontory which terminates the bold tajurrah range under which lie the sleeping waters of the maidens sea 18 during the day we rigged out an awning and sat in the shade smoking and chatting merrily for the weather was not much hotter than on english summer seas some of the crew tried praying but prostrations are not easily made on board ship and el islam as umar shrewdly suspected was not made for a seafaring race at length the big red sun sank slowly behind the curtain of skyblue rock where lies the not yet combusted village of tajurrah 19 we lay down to rest with the light of day and had the satisfaction of closing our eyes upon a fair though captious breeze  on the morning of the 31st october we entered the zayla creek which gives so much trouble to native craft we passed on the right the low island of masha belonging to the city of the slave merchant tajurrahand on the left two similar patches of seagirt sand called aybat and saad el din these places supply zayla in the kharif or hot season 20 with thousands of gulls eggsa great luxury at noon we sighted our destination zayla is the normal african porta strip of sulphuryellow sand with a deep blue dome above and a foreground of the darkest indigo the buildings raised by refraction rose high and apparently from the bosom of the deep after hearing the worst accounts of it i was pleasantly disappointed by the spectacle of whitewashed houses and minarets peering above a long low line of brown wall flanked with round towers  as we slowly threaded the intricate coral reefs of the port a bark came scudding up to us it tacked and the crew proceeded to give news in roaring tones friendship between the amir of harar and the governor of zayla had been broken the road through the eesa somal had been closed by the murder of masud a favourite slave and adopted son of sharmarkay all strangers had been expelled the city for some misconduct by the harar chief moreover smallpox was raging there with such violence that the galla peasantry would allow neither ingress nor egress 21 i had the pleasure of reflecting for some time dear l upon the amount of responsibility incurred by using the phrase i will and the only consolation that suggested itself was the stale assurance that    things at the worst most surely mend  no craft larger than a canoe can ride near zayla after bumping once or twice against the coral reefs it was considered advisable for our good ship the sahalat to cast anchor my companions caused me to dress put me with my pipe and other necessaries into a cockboat and wading through the water shoved it to shore lastly at bab el sahil the seaward or northern gate they proceeded to array themselves in the bravery of clean tobes and long daggers strapped round the waist each man also slung his targe to his left arm and in his right hand grasped lance and javelin at the gate we were received by a tall black spearman with a ho there to the governor and a crowd of idlers gathered to inspect the strangers marshalled by the warder we traversed the dusty roadsstreets they could not be calledof the old arab town ran the gauntlet of a gaping mob and finally entering a mat door found ourselves in the presence of the governor  i had met sharmarkay at aden where he received from the authorities strong injunctions concerning my personal safety the character of a moslem merchant however requiring us to appear strangers an introduction by our master of ceremonies the hammal followed my entrance sharmarkay was living in an apartment by no means splendid preferring an arish or kind of cowhouseas the angloindian nabobs do the bungalow            with mat half hung   the walls of plaster and the floors of      to all his substantial doublestoried houses the ground was wet and comfortless a part of the reed walls was lined with cots bearing mattresses and silkcovered pillows a cross between a divan and a couch the only ornaments were a few weapons and a necklace of gaudy beads suspended near the door i was placed upon the principal seat on the right were the governor and the hammal whilst the lowest portion of the room was occupied by mohammed sharmarkay the son and heir the rest of the company squatted upon chairs or rather stools of peculiar construction nothing could be duller than this assemblee pipes and coffee are here unknown and there is nothing in the east to act substitute for them 22  the governor of zayla el hajj sharmarkay bin ali salih is rather a remarkable man he is sixteenth according to his own account in descent from ishak el hazrami 23 the saintly founder of the great gerhajis and awal tribes his enemies derive him from a less illustrious stock and the fairness of his complexion favours the report that his grandfather salih was an abyssinian slave originally the nacoda or captain of a native craft he has raised himself chiefly by british influence to the chieftainship of his tribe 24 as early as may 1825 he received from captain bagnold then our resident at mocha a testimonial and a reward for a severe sword wound in the left arm received whilst defending the lives of english seamen 25 he afterwards went to bombay where he was treated with consideration and about fifteen years ago he succeeded the sayyid mohammed el barr as governor of zayla and its dependencies under the ottoman pasha in western arabia  the hajj sharmarkay in his youth was a man of valour he could not read or write but he carried in battle four spears 26 and his swordcut was recognisable he is now a man about sixty years old at least six feet two inches in stature largelimbed and rawboned his leanness is hidden by long wide robes he shaves his head and upper lip shafeifashion and his beard is represented by a ragged tuft of redstained hair on each side of his chin a visit to aden and a doctor cost him one eye and the other is now white with age his dress is that of an arab and he always carries with him a broadbladed silverhilted sword despite his years he is a strong active and energetic man ever looking to the main chance with one foot in the grave he meditates nothing but the conquest of harar and berberah which making him master of the seaboard would soon extend his power as in days of old even to abyssinia 27 to hear his projects you would fancy them the offspring of a brain in the prime of youth in order to carry them out he would even assist in suppressing the profitable slavetrade 28  after half an hours visit i was led by the hajj through the streets of zayla 29 to one of his substantial houses of coralline and mud plastered over with glaring whitewash the ground floor is a kind of warehouse full of bales and boxes scales and buyers a flight of steep steps leads into a long room with shutters to exclude the light floored with tamped earth full of evening flyers 30 and destitute of furniture parallel to it are three smaller apartments and above is a terraced roof where they who fear not the dew and the landbreeze sleep 31 i found a room duly prepared the ground was spread with mats and cushions against the walls denoted the divan for me was placed a kursi or cot covered with fine persian rugs and gaudy silk and satin pillows the hajj installed us with ceremony and insisted despite my remonstrances upon occupying the floor whilst i sat on the raised seat after ushering in supper he considerately remarked that travelling is fatiguing and left us to sleep  the wellknown sounds of el islam returned from memory again the melodious chant of the muezzinno evening bell can compare with it for solemnity and beautyand in the neighbouring mosque the loudly intoned amin and allaho akbarfar superior to any organrang in my ear the evening gun of camp was represented by the nakkarah or kettledrum sounded about seven pm at the southern gate and at ten a second drumming warned the paterfamilias that it was time for home and thieves and loversthat it was the hour for bastinado nightfall was ushered in by the song the dance and the marriage festivalhere no permission is required for native music in the linesand muffled figures flitted mysteriously through the dark alleys                                       after a peep through the open window i fell asleep feeling once more at home   footnotes  1 a tradition exists says lieut cruttenden amongst the people of harar that the prosperity of their city depends upon the exclusion of all travellers not of the moslem faith and all christians are specially interdicted these freaks of interdiction are common to african rulers who on occasions of war famine or pestilence struck with some superstitious fear close their gates to strangers  2 the 6th of safar in 1864 corresponds with our 28th october the hadis is arabic when the 6th of safar went forth my faith from the cloud came forth  3 the abyssinian law of detaining guestspedro covilhao the

omitted to romance about the origin of such an invention as the dayrah or compass shaykh majid is said to have been a syrian saint to whom allah gave the power of looking upon earth as though it were a ball in his hand most moslems agree in assigning this origin to the dayrah and the fatihah in honor of the holy man is still repeated by the pious mariner  easterns do not box the compass after our fashion with them each point has its own name generally derived from some prominent star on the horizon of these i subjoin a list as in use amongst the somal hoping that it may be useful to oriental students the names in hyphens are those given in a paper on the nautical instrument of the arabs by jas prinseps journal of the as soc december 1836 the learned secretary appears not to have heard the

of these seas  7 holcus sorghum the common grain of africa and arabia the somali call it hirad the people of yemen taam  8 the somal being a people of less nervous temperament than the arabs and indians do not fear the moonlight  9 the first name is that of the individual as the christian name with us the second is that of the father in the somali country as in india they are not connected by the arab binson of  10 abdy is an abbreviation of abdullah abokr a corruption of abubekr the end of time alludes to the prophesied corruption of the moslem priesthood in the last epoch of the world  11 this peculiarity is not uncommon amongst the somal it is considered by them a sign of warm temperament  12 the moslem should first recite the farz prayers or those ordered in the koran secondly the sunnat or practice of the prophet and thirdly the nafilah or supererogatory the ratib or selfimposed task is the last of all our mulla placed it first because he could chaunt it upon his mule within hearing of the people  13 two modern poets and wits well known in yemen  14 that is to say we will remove it with the five fingers these are euphuisms to avoid speaking broadly and openly of that venerable feature the beard  15 bab el mandeb is called as above by humayd from its astronomical position jebel mayyum is in africa jebel zubah or muayyin celebrated as the last restingplace of a great saint shaykh said is in arabia  16 ajam properly means all nations not arab in egypt and central asia it is now confined to persians on the west of the red sea it is invariably used to denote the somali country thence bruce draws the greek and latin name of the coast azamia and de sacy derives the word ajan which in our maps is applied to the inner regions of the eastern horn so in africa el sham which properly means damascus and syria is applied to el hejaz  17 adel according to m krapf derived its name from the ad ali a tribe of the afar or danakil nation erroneously used by arab synecdoche for the whole race mr johnston travels in southern abyssinia ch 1 more correctly derives it from adule a city which as proved by the monument which bears its name existed in the days of ptolemy euergetes bc 247222 had its own dynasty and boasted of a conqueror who overcame the troglodytes sabaeans homerites c and pushed his conquests as far as the frontier of egypt mr johnston however incorrectly translates barr el ajam land of fire and seems to confound avalites and adulis  18 bahr el banatin the bay of tajurrah  19 a certain german missionary well known in this part of the world exasperated by the seizure of a few dollars and a claim to the droit daubaine advised the authorities of aden to threaten the combustion of tajurrah the measure would have been equally unjust and unwise a traveller even a layman is bound to put up peaceably with such trifles and to threaten combustion without being prepared to carry out the threat is the readiest way to secure contempt  20 the kharif in most parts of the oriental world corresponds with our autumn in eastern africa it invariably signifies the hot season preceding the monsoon rains  21 the circumstances of masuds murder were truly african the slave caravans from abyssinia to tajurrah were usually escorted by the rer guleni a clan of the great eesa tribe and they monopolised the profits of the road summoned to share their gains with their kinsmen generally they refused upon which the other clans rose about august 1854 and cut off the road a large caravan was travelling down in two bodies each of nearly 300 slaves the eesa attacked the first division carried off the wives and female slaves whom they sold for ten dollars a head and savagely mutilated upwards of 100 wretched boys this event caused the tajurrah line to be permanently closed the rer guleni in wrath at once murdered masud a peaceful traveller because inna handun his abban or protector was of the party who had attacked their proteges they came upon him suddenly as he was purchasing some article and stabbed him in the back before he could defend himself  22 in zayla there is not a single coffeehouse the settled somal care little for the arab beverage and the bedouins reasons for avoiding it are not bad if we drink coffee once say they we shall want it again and then where are we to get it the abyssinian christians probably to distinguish themselves from moslems object to coffee as well as to tobacco the gallas on the other hand eat it the powdered bean is mixed with butter and on forays a lump about the size of a billiardball is preferred to a substantial meal  23 the following genealogical table was given to me by mohammed sharmarkay    1 ishak ibn ahmed ibn abdillah   2 gerhajis his eldest son   3 said the eldest son daud being the second   4 arrah also the eldest ili ie ali being the second   5 musa the third son the eldest was ismail then in      succession ishak misa mikahil gambah dandan c   6 ibrahim   7 fikih ie fakih   8 adan ie adam   9 mohammed   10 hamid   11 jibril ie jibrail   12 ali   13 awaz   14 salih   15 ali   16 sharmarkay  the last is a peculiarly somali name meaning one who sees no harm sharmaarkay  24 not the hereditary chieftainship of the habr gerhajis which belongs to a particular clan  25 the following is a copy of the document  this testimonial together with an honorary dress is presented by the british resident at mocha to nagoda shurmakey ally sumaulley in token of esteem and regard for his humane and gallant conduct at the port of burburra on the coast of africa april 10 1825 in saving the lives of captain william lingard chief officer of the brig mary anne when that vessel was attacked and plundered by the natives the said nagoda is therefore strongly recommended to the notice and good offices of europeans in general but particularly so to all english gentlemen visiting these seas  26 two spears being the usual number the difficulty of three or four would mainly consist in their management during action  27 in july 1855 the hajj sharmarkay was deposed by the turkish pasha of hodaydah ostensibly for failing to keep some road open or according to others for assisting to plunder a caravan belonging to the dankali tribe it was reported that he had been made a prisoner and the political resident at aden saw the propriety of politely asking the turkish authorities to be easy upon the old man in consequence of this representation he was afterwards allowed on paying a fine of 3000 dollars to retire to aden  i deeply regret that the hajj should have lost his government he has ever clung to the english party even in sore temptation a few years ago the late m rochet soidisant dhericourt french agent at jeddah paying treble its value bought from mohammed sharmarkay in the absence of the hajj a large stone house in order to secure a footing at zayla the old man broke off the bargain on his return knowing how easily an agency becomes a fort and preferring a considerable loss to the presence of dangerous friends  28 during my residence at zayla few slaves were imported owing to the main road having been closed in former years the market was abundantly stocked the numbers annually shipped to mocha hodaydah jeddah and berberah varied from 600 to 1000 the hajj received as duty one gold kirsh or about three fourths of a dollar per head  29 zayla called audal or auzal by the somal is a town about the size of suez built for 3000 or 4000 inhabitants and containing a dozen large whitewashed stone houses and upwards of 200 arish or thatched huts each surrounded by a fence of wattle and matting the situation is a low and level spit of sand which high tides make almost an island there is no harbour a vessel of 250 tons cannot approach within a mile of the landingplace the open roadstead is exposed to the terrible north wind and when gales blow from the west and south it is almost unapproachable every ebb leaves a sandy flat extending half a mile seaward from the town the reefy anchorage is difficult of entrance after sunset and the coralline bottom renders wading painful  the shape of this once celebrated town is a tolerably regular parallelogram of which the long sides run from east to west the walls without guns or embrasures are built like the houses of coralline rubble and mud in places dilapidated there are five gates the bab el sahil and the bab el jadd a new postern open upon the sea from the northern wall at the ashurbara in the southern part of the enceinte the bedouins encamp and above it the governor holds his durbar the bab abd el kadir derives its name from a saint buried outside and eastward of the city and the bab el saghir is pierced in the western wall  the public edifices are six mosques including the jami or cathedral for friday prayer these buildings have queer little crenelles on whitewashed walls and a kind of elevated summerhouse to represent the minaret near one of them are remains of a circular turkish munar manifestly of modern construction there is no mahkamah or kazis court that dignitary transacts business at his own house and the festival prayers are recited near the saints tomb outside the eastern gate the northeast angle of the town is occupied by a large graveyard with the usual deleterious consequences  the climate of zayla is cooler than that of aden and the site being open all around it is not so unhealthy much spare room is enclosed by the town walls evaporation and natures scavengers act succedanea for sewerage  zayla commands the adjacent harbour of tajurrah and is by position the northern port of aussa the ancient capital of adel of harar and of southern abyssinia the feuds of the rulers have however transferred the main trade to berberah it sends caravans northwards to the dankali and southwestwards through the eesa and gudabirsi tribes as far as efat and gurague it is visited by cafilas from abyssinia and the different races of bedouins extending from the hills to the seaboard the exports are valuableslaves ivory hides honey antelope horns clarified butter and gums the coast abounds in sponge coral and small pearls which arab divers collect in the fair season in the harbour i found about twenty native craft large and small of these ten belonged to the governor they trade with berberah arabia and western india and are navigated by rajput or hindu pilots  provisions at zayla are cheap a family of six persons live well for about 30l per annum the general food is mutton a large sheep costs one dollar a small one half the price camels meat beef and in winter kid abound fish is rare and fowls are not commonly eaten holcus when dear sells at forty pounds per dollar at seventy pounds when cheap it is usually levigated with slab and roller and made into sour cakes some however prefer the arab form balilah boiled and mixed with ghee wheat and rice are imported the price varies from forty to sixty pounds the riyal or dollar of the former grain the people make a sweet cake called sabaya resembling the fatirah of egypt a favourite dish also is harisahflesh rice flour and boiled wheat all finely pounded and mixed together milk is not procurable during the hot weather after rain every house is full of it the bedouins bring it in skins and sell it for a nominal sum  besides a large floating population zayla contains about 1500 souls they are comparatively a fine race of people and suffer from little but fever and an occasional ophthalmia their greatest hardship is the want of the pure element the hissi or well is about four miles distant from the town and all the pits within the walls supply brackish or bitter water fit only for external use this is probably the reason why vegetables are unknown and why a horse a mule or even a dog is not to be found in the place  30 fidmer or the evening flyer is the somali name for a bat these little animals are not disturbed in houses because they keep off flies and mosquitoes the plagues of the somali country flies abound in the very jungles wherever cows have been and settle in swarms upon the traveller before the monsoon their bite is painful especially that of the small green species and there is a red variety called diksi as whose venom according to the people causes them to vomit the latter abounds in gulays and the hill ranges of the berberah country it is innocuous during the cold season the mosquito bites bring on according to the same authority deadly fevers the superstition probably arises from the fact that mosquitoes and fevers become formidable about the same time  31 such a building at zayla would cost at most 500 dollars at aden 2000 rupees or nearly double the sum would be paid for a matted shed which excludes neither sun nor wind nor rain     chap ii  life in zayla   i will not weary you dear l with descriptions of twentysix quiet similar uninteresting daysdays of sleep and pipes and coffeespent at zayla whilst a route was traced out guides were propitiated camels were bought mules sent for and all the wearisome preliminaries of african travel were gone through but a journee in the somali country may be a novelty to you its events shall be succinctly depicted  with earliest dawn we arise thankful to escape from mosquitoes and close air we repair to the terrace where devotions are supposed to be performed and busy ourselves in watching our neighbours two in particular engage my attention sisters by different mothers the daughter of an indian woman is a young person of fast propensitiesher chocolate coloured skin long hair and parrotlike profile 1 are much admired by the elegants of zayla and she coquettes by combing dancing singing and slapping the slavegirls whenever an adorer may be looking we sober minded men seeing her quote the wellknown lines    without justice a king is a cloud without rain   without goodness a sage is a field without fruit   without manners a youth is a bridleless horse   without lore an old man is a waterless wady   without modesty woman is bread without salt  the other is a matron of abyssinian descent as her skin scarcely darker than a gipsys her long and bright blue fillet and her gaudily fringed dress denote she tattoos her face 2 a livid line extends from her front hair to the tip of her nose between her eyebrows is an ornament resembling a fleurdelis and various beautyspots adorn the corners of her mouth and the flats of her countenance she passes her day superintending the slavegirls and weaving mats 3 the worsted work of this part of the world we soon made acquaintance as far as an exchange of salams i regret however to say that there was some scandal about my charming neighbour and that more than once she was detected making signals to distant persons with her hands 4  at 6 am we descend to breakfast which usually consists of sour grain cakes and roast muttonat this hour a fine trial of health and cleanly living a napkin is passed under my chin as if i were a small child and a sound scolding is administered when appetite appears deficient visitors are always asked to join us we squat on the uncarpeted floor round a circular stool eat hard and never stop to drink the appetite of africa astonishes us we dispose of six ounces here for every one in arabia probably the effect of sweet water after the briny produce of the eye of yemen we conclude this early breakfast with coffee and pipes and generally return after it to the work of sleep  then provided with some sanctified arabic book i prepare for the reception of visitors they come in by dozensno man having apparently any business to occupy himdoff their slippers at the door enter wrapped up in their tobes or togas 5 and deposit their spears point upwards in the corner those who have swordsthe mark of respectability in eastern africaplace them at their feet they shake the full hand i was reproved for offering the fingers only and when politely disposed the inferior wraps his fist in the hem of his garment they have nothing corresponding with the european idea of manners they degrade all ceremony by the epithet shughl el banat or girls work and pique themselves upon downrightness of mannera favourite mask by the by for savage cunning to assume but they are equally free from affectation shyness and vulgarity and after all no manners are preferable to bad manners  sometimes we are visited at this hour by mohammed sharmarkay eldest son of the old governor he is in age about thirty a fine tall figure slender but well knit beardless and of light complexion with large eyes and a length of neck which a lady might covet his only detracting feature is a slight projection of the oral region that unmistakable proof of african blood his movements have the grace of strength and suppleness he is a good jumper runs well throws the spear admirably and is a tolerable shot having received a liberal education at mocha he is held a learned man by his fellowcountrymen like his father he despises presents looking higher with some trouble i persuaded him to accept a common map of asia and a revolver his chief interest was concentrated in books he borrowed my abu kasim to copy 6 and was never tired of talking about the religious sciences he had weakened his eyes by hard reading and a couple of blisters were sufficient to win his gratitude mohammed is now the eldest son 7 he appears determined to keep up the family name having already married ten wives the issue however two infant sons were murdered by the eesa bedouins whenever he meets his father in the morning he kisses his hand and receives a salute upon the forehead he aspires to the government of zayla and looks forward more reasonably than the hajj to the day when the possession of berberah will pour gold into his coffers he shows none of his fathers softness he advocates the bastinado and to keep his people at a distance he has married an arab wife who allows no adult to enter the doors the somal spaniardlike remark he is one of ourselves though a little richer but when times change and luck returns they are not unlikely to find themselves mistaken  amongst other visitors we have the amir el bahr or port captain and the nakib el askar commandant de place mohammed umar el hamumi this is one of those hazramaut adventurers so common in all the countries bordering upon arabia they are the swiss of the east a people equally brave and hardy frugal and faithful as long as pay is regular feared by the soft indians and africans for their hardness and determination the common proverb concerning them is if you meet a viper and a hazrami spare the viper natives of a poor and rugged region they wander far and wide preferring every country to their own and it is generally said that the sun rises not upon a land that does not contain a man from hazramaut 8 this commander of an army of forty men 9 often read out to us from the kitab el anwar the book of lights the tale of abu jahl that judas of el islam made ridiculous sometimes comes the sayyid mohammed el barr a stout personage formerly governor of zayla and still highly respected by the people on acount of his pure pedigree with him is the fakih adan a savan of ignoble origin 10 when they appear the conversation becomes intensely intellectual sometimes we dispute religion sometimes politics at others history and other humanities yet it is not easy to talk history with a people who confound miriam and mary or politics to those whose only idea of a king is a robber on a large scale or religion to men who measure excellence by forbidden meats or geography to those who represent the earth in this guise yet though few of our ideas are in common there are many words the verbosity of these antilaconic oriental dialects 11 renders at least half the subject intelligible to the most opposite thinkers when the society is wholly somal i write arabic copy some useful book or extract from it as bentley advised what is fit to quote when arabs are present i usually read out a tale from the thousand and one nights that wonderful work so often translated so much turned over and so little understood at home the most familiar of books in england next to the bible it is one of the least known the reason being that about one fifth is utterly unfit for translation and the most sanguine orientalist would not dare to render literally more than three quarters of the remainder consequently the reader loses the contrast the very essence of the bookbetween its brilliancy and dulness its moral putrefaction and such pearls as    cast the seed of good works on the least fit soil   good is never wasted however it may be laid out  and in a page or two after such divine sentiment the ladies of bagdad sit in the porters lap and indulge in a facetiousness which would have killed pietro aretino before his time  illustration  often i am visited by the topchibashi or master of the ordnancehalf a dozen honeycombed gunsa wild fellow bashi buzuk in the hejaz and commandant of artillery at zayla he shaves my head on fridays and on other days tells me wild stories about his service in the holy land how kurdi usman slew his soninlaw ibn rumi and how turkcheh bilmez would have murdered mohammed ali in his bed 12 sometimes the room is filled with arabs sayyids merchants and others settled in the place i saw nothing amongst them to justify the oftquoted saw koraysh pride and zaylas boastfulness more generally the assembly is one of the somal who talk in their own tongue laugh yell stretch their legs and lie like cattle upon the floor smoking the common hukkah which stands in the centre industriously cleaning their teeth with sticks and eating snuff like swedes meanwhile i occupy the kursi or couch sometimes muttering from a book to excite respect or reading aloud for general information or telling fortunes by palmistry or drawing out a horoscope  it argues peculiarity i own to enjoy such a life in the first place there is no womans society el islam seems purposely to have loosened the ties between the sexes in order to strengthen the bonds which connect man and man 13 secondly your house is by no means your castle you must open your doors to your friend at all hours if when inside it suit him to sing sing he will and until you learn solitude in a crowd or the art of concentration you are apt to become ennuye and irritable you must abandon your prejudices and for a time cast off all european prepossessions in favour of indian politeness persian polish arab courtesy or turkish dignity    they are as free as nature eer made man  and he who objects to having his head shaved in public to seeing his friends combing their locks in his sittingroom to having his property unceremoniously handled or to being addressed familiarly by a perfect stranger had better avoid somaliland  you will doubtless dear l convict me by my own sentiments of being an amateur barbarian you must however remember that i visited africa fresh from aden with its dull routine of meaningless parades and tiresome courts martial where society is broken by ridiculous distinctions of staffmen and regimentalmen madrasmen and bombaymen european officers and black officers where literature is confined to acquiring the art of explaining yourself in the jargons of halfnaked savages where the business of life is comprised in ignoble official squabbles dislikes disapprobations and references to superior authority where social intercourse is crushed by gup gossip and the scandal of small colonial circles wherepleasant predicament for those who really love womens societyit is scarcely possible to address fair dame preserving at the same time her reputation and your own and if seen with her twice all camp will swear it is an affair where briefly the march of mind is at a dead halt and the march of matter is in double quick time to the hospital or sickquarters then the fatal struggle for name and the painful necessity of doing the most with the smallest materials for a reputation in europe there are a thousand grades of celebrity from statesmanship to taxidermy all therefore coexist without rivalry whereas in these small colonies there is but one fame and as that leads directly to rupees and rank no man willingly accords it to his neighbour and finally such semicivilised life abounds in a weary ceremoniousness it is highly improper to smoke outside your bungalow you shall pay your visits at 11 am when the glass stands at 120° you shall be generally shunned if you omit your waistcoat no matter what the weather be and if you venture to object to these median lawsas i am now doingyou elicit a chorus of disapproval and acquire some evil name  about 11 am when the fresh water arrives from the hissi or wells the hajj sends us dinner mutton stews of exceeding greasiness boiled rice maize cakes sometimes fish and generally curds or milk we all sit round a primitive form of the round table and i doubt that king arthurs knights ever proved doughtier trenchermen than do my companions we then rise to pipes and coffee after which excluding visitors my attendants apply themselves to a siesta i to my journal and studies  at 2 pm there is a loud clamour at the door if it be not opened in time we are asked if we have a nazarene inside enters a crowd of visitors anxious to pass the afternoon we proceed with a copy of the forenoon till the sun declines when it is time to escape the flies to repair to the terrace for fresh air or to dress for a walk generally our direction is through the town eastwards to a plain of dilapidated graves and salt sand peopled only by landcrabs at the extremity near the sea is a little mosque of wattlework we sit there under the shade and play a rude form of draughts called shantarah or at shahh a modification of the former 14 more often eschewing these effeminacies we shoot at a mark throw the javelin leap or engage in some gymnastic exercise the favourite somali weapons are the spear dagger and warclub the bow and poisoned arrows are peculiar to the servile class who know            the dreadful art   to taint with deadly drugs the barbed dart  and the people despise at the same time that they fear firearms declaring them to be cowardly weapons 15 with which the poltroon can slay the bravest  the somali spear is a form of the cape assegai a long thin pliant and knotty shaft of the dibi diktab and makari trees is dried polished and greased with rancid butter it is generally of a dull yellow colour and sometimes bound as in arabia with brass wire for ornament care is applied to make the rod straight or the missile flies crooked it is garnished with an iron button at the head and a long thin tapering head of coarse bad iron 16 made at berberah and other places by the tomal the length of the shaft may be four feet eight inches the blade varies from twenty to twentysix inches and the whole weapon is about seven feet long some polish the entire spearhead others only its socket or ferule commonly however it is all blackened by heating it to redness and rubbing it with cows horn in the towns one of these weapons is carried on a journey and in battle two as amongst the tibboosa small javelin for throwing and a large spear reserved for the thrust some warriors especially amongst the eesa prefer a coarse heavy lance which never leaves the hand the somali spear is held in various ways generally the thumb and forefinger grasp the third nearest to the head and the shaft resting upon the palm is made to quiver in action the javelin is rarely thrown at a greater distance than six or seven feet and the heavier weapon is used for jobbing stripped to his waist the thrower runs forward with all the action of a kafir whilst the attacked bounds about and crouches to receive it upon the round targe which it cannot pierce he then returns the compliment at the same time endeavouring to break the weapon thrown at him by jumping and stamping upon it the harmless missiles being exhausted both combatants draw their daggers grapple with the left hand and with the right dig hard and swift at each others necks and shoulders when matters come to this point the duel is soon decided and the victor howling his slogan pushes away from his front the dying enemy and rushes off to find another opponent a puerile weapon during the day when a steady man can easily avoid it the spear is terrible in night attacks or in the bush whence it can be hurled unseen for practice we plant a pair of slippers upright in the ground at the distance of twelve yards and a skilful spearman hits the mark once in every three throws  the somali dagger is an iron blade about eighteen inches long by two in breadth pointed and sharp at both edges the handle is of buffalo or other horn with a double scoop to fit the grasp and at the hilt is a conical ornament of zinc it is worn strapped round the waist by a thong sewed to the sheath and long enough to encircle the body twice the point is to the right and the handle projects on the left when in town the somal wear their daggers under the tobe in battle the strap is girt over the cloth to prevent the latter being lost they always stab from above this is as it should be a thrust with a short weapon underhand may be stopped if the adversary have strength enough to hold the stabbers forearm the thrust is parried with the shield and a wound is rarely mortal except in the back from the great length of the blade the least movement of the man attacked causes it to fall upon the shoulderblade  the budd or somali club resembles the kafir tonga it is a knobstick about a cubit long made of some hard wood the head is rounded on the inside and the outside is cut to an edge in quarrels it is considered a harmless weapon and is often thrown at the opponent and wielded viciously enough where the spear point would carefully be directed at the buckler the gashan or shield is a round targe about eighteen inches in diameter some of the bedouins make it much larger rhinoceros skin being rare the usual material is common bulls hide or preferably that of the oryx called by the arabs waal and by the somal baid these shields are prettily cut and are always protected when new with a covering of canvass the boss in the centre easily turns a spear and the strongest throw has very little effect even upon the thinnest portion when not used the gashan is slung upon the left forearm during battle the handle which is in the middle is grasped by the left hand and held out at a distance from the body  we are sometimes joined in our exercises by the arab mercenaries who are far more skilful than the somal the latter are unacquainted with the sword and cannot defend themselves against it with the targe they know little of dagger practice and were beaten at their own weapon the javelin by the children of bir hamid though unable to jump for the honour of the turban i soon acquired the reputation of being the strongest man in zayla this is perhaps the easiest way of winning respect from a barbarous people who honour body and degrade mind to mere cunning  when tired of exercise we proceed round the walls to the ashurbara or southern gate here boys play at hockey with sticks and stones energetically as in england they are fine manly specimens of the race but noisy and impudent like all young savages at two years of age they hold out the right hand for sweetmeats and if refused become insolent the citizens amuse themselves with the ball 17 at which they play roughly as scotch linkers they are divided into two parties bachelors and married men accidents often occur and no player wears any but the scantiest clothing otherwise he would retire from the conflict in rags the victors sing and dance about the town for hours brandishing their spears shouting their slogans boasting of ideal victoriesthe abyssinian donfatu or warvauntand advancing in deathtriumph with frantic gestures a battle won would be celebrated with less circumstance in europe this is the effect of no occupationthe primum mobile of the indian princes kiteflying and all the puerilities of the pompous east  we usually find an encampment of bedouins outside the gate their tents are worse than any gipsys low smoky and of the rudest construction these people are a spectacle of savageness their huge heads of shock hair dyed red and dripping with butter are garnished with a firin or long threepronged comb a stick which acts as scratcher when the owner does not wish to grease his fingers and sometimes with the ominous ostrich feather showing that the wearer has killed his man a soiled and ragged cotton cloth covers their shoulders and a similar article is wrapped round their loins18 all wear coarse sandals and appear in the bravery of targe spear and dagger some of the women would be pretty did they not resemble the men in their scowling satanic expression of countenance they are decidedly en deshabille but a black skin always appears a garb the cantonment is surrounded by asses camels and a troop of naked flibertigibbets who dance and jump in astonishment whenever they see me the white man the white man they shriek run away run away or we shall be eaten 19 on one occasion however my amour propre was decidedly flattered by the attentions of a small black girl apparently four or five years old who followed me through the streets ejaculating wa wanaksan0 fine the bedouins despite their fierce scowls appear goodnatured the women flock out of the huts to stare and laugh the men to look and wonder i happened once to remark lo we come forth to look at them and they look at us we gaze at their complexion and they gaze at ours a bedouin who understood arabic translated this speech to the others and it excited great merriment in the mining counties of civilised england where the genial brickbat is thrown at the passing stranger or in enlightened scotland where hair a few inches too long or a pair of mustachios justifies mobbing it would have been impossible for me to have mingled as i did with these wild people  we must return before sunset when the gates are locked and the keys are carried to the hajj a vain precaution when a donkey could clear half a dozen places in the town wall the call to evening prayer sounds as we enter none of my companions pray 20 but all when asked reply in the phrase which an englishman hates inshallah bukraif allah please to morrowand they have the decency not to appear in public at the hours of devotion the somal like most africans are of a somewhat irreverent turn of mind 21 when reproached with gambling and asked why they persist in the forbidden pleasure they simply answer because we like one night encamped amongst the eesa i was disturbed by a female voice indulging in the loudest lamentations an elderly lady it appears was suffering from toothache and the refrain of her groans was o allah may thy teeth ache like mine o allah may thy gums be sore as mine are a wellknown and characteristic tale is told of the gerad hirsi now chief of the berteri tribe once meeting a party of unarmed pilgrims he asked them why they had left their weapons at home they replied in the usual phrase nahnu mutawakkilinwe are trusters in allah that evening having feasted them hospitably the chief returned hurriedly to the hut declaring that his soothsayer ordered him at once to sacrifice a pilgrim and begging the horrorstruck auditors to choose the victim they cast lots and gave over one of their number the gerad placed him in another hut dyed his dagger with sheeps blood and returned to say that he must have a second life the unhappy pilgrims rose en masse and fled so wildly that the chief with all the cavalry of the desert found difficulty in recovering them he dismissed them with liberal presents and not a few jibes about their trustfulness the wilder bedouins will inquire where allah is to be found when asked the object of the question they reply if the eesa could but catch him they would spear him upon the spotwho but he lays waste their homes and kills their cattle and wives yet conjoined to this truly savage incapability of conceiving the idea of a supreme being they believe in the most ridiculous exaggerations many will not affront a common pilgrim for fear of being killed by a glance or a word  our supper also provided by the hospitable hajj is the counterpart of the midday dinner after it we repair to the roof to enjoy the prospect of the far tajurrah hills and the white moonbeams sleeping upon the nearer sea the evening star hangs like a diamond upon the still horizon around the moon a pink zone of light mist shading off into turquoise blue and a delicate green like chrysopraz invests the heavens with a peculiar charm the scene is truly suggestive behind us purpling in the nightair and silvered by the radiance from above lie the wolds and mountains tenanted by the fiercest of savages their shadowy mysterious forms exciting vague alarms in the travellers breast sweet as the harp of david the night breeze and the music of the water come up from the sea but the ripple and the rustling sound alternate with the hyenas laugh the jackals cry and the wild dogs lengthened howl  or the weather becoming cold we remain below and mohammed umar returns to read out more book of lights or some pathetic ode i will quote in free translation the following production of the celebrated poet abd el rahman el burai as a perfect specimen of melancholy arab imagery    no exile is the banished to the latter end of earth   the exile is the banished to the coffin and the tomb    he hath claims on the dwellers in the places of their birth   who wandereth the world for he lacketh him a home    then blamer blame me not were my heart within thy breast   the sigh would take the place of thy laughter and thy scorn    let me weep for the sin that debars my soul of rest   the tear may yet availall in vain i may not mourn 22    woe woe to thee fleshwith a purer spirit now   the deathday were a hope and the judgmenthour a joy    one morn i woke in pain with a pallor on my brow   as though the dreaded angel were descending to destroy    they brought to me a leech saying heal him lest he die   on that day by allah were his drugs a poor deceit    they stripped me and bathed me and closed the glazing eye   and dispersed unto prayers and to haggle for my sheet    the prayers without a bow 23 they prayed over me that day   brought nigh to me the bier and disposed me within    four bare upon their shoulders this tenement of clay   friend and kinsmen in procession bore the dust of friend and kin    they threw upon me mould of the tomb and went their way   a guest twould seem had flitted from the dwellings of the tribe    my gold and my treasures each a share they bore away   without thanks without praise with a jest and with a jibe    my gold and my treasures each his share they bore away   on me they left the weightwith me they left the sin    that night within the grave without hoard or child i lay   no spouse no friend were there no comrade and no kin    the wife of my youth soon another husband found   a stranger sat at home on the hearthstone of my sire    my son became a slave though not purchased nor bound   the hireling of a stranger who begrudged him his hire    such alas is human life such the horror of his death   man grows like a grass like a god he sees no end    be wise then ere too late brother praise with every breath   the hand that can chastise the arm that can defend    and bless thou the prophet the averter of our ills   while the lightning flasheth bright oer the ocean and the hills  at this hour my companions become imaginative and superstitious one salimayn a black slave from the sawahil 24 now secretary to the hajj reads our fortunes in the rosary the fal 25 as it is called acts a prominent part in somali life some men are celebrated for accuracy of prediction and in times of danger when the human mind is ever open to the fooleries of faith perpetual reference is made to their art the worldly wise salimayn i observed never sent away a questioner with an illomened reply but he also regularly insisted upon the efficacy of sacrifice and almsgiving which as they would assuredly be neglected afforded him an excuse in case of accident then we had a recital of the tales common to africa and perhaps to all the world in modern france as in ancient italy versipelles become wolves and hide themselves in the woods in persia they change themselves into bears and in bornou and shoa assume the shapes of lions hyenas and leopards 26 the origin of this metamorphic superstition is easily traceable like mans fetisism or demonology to his fears a bedouin for instance becomes dreadful by the reputation of sorcery bears and hyenas are equally terrible and the two objects of horror are easily connected curious to say individuals having this power were pointed out to me and people pretended to discover it in their countenances at zayla i was shown a bedouin by name farih badaun who notably became a hyena at times for the purpose of tasting human blood 27 about forty years ago three brothers kayna fardayna and sollan were killed on gulays near berberah for the crime of metamorphosis the charge is usually substantiated either by the bestial tail remaining appended to a part of the human shape which the owner has forgotten to rub against the magic tree or by some peculiar wound which the beast received and the man retained kindred to this superstition is the belief that many of the bedouins have learned the languages of birds and beasts another widely diffused fancy is that of the aksar 28 which in this pastoral land becomes a kind of wood wonderful tales are told of battered milkpails which by means of some peg accidentally cut in the jungle have been found full of silver or have acquired the qualities of cornucopiae it is supposed that a red heifer always breaks her fast upon the wonderful plant consequently much time and trouble have been expended by the somal in watching the morning proceedings of red heifers at other times we hear fearful tales of old women who like the jigar khwar of persia feed upon mans liver they are fond of destroying young children even adults are not ashamed of defending themselves with talismans in this country the crone is called bidaa or kumayyo words signifying a witch the worst is she that destroys her own progeny no wound is visible in this vampyres victim generally he names his witch and his friends beat her to death unless she heal him many are thus martyred and in somali land scant notice is taken of such a peccadillo as murdering an old woman the sex indeed has by no means a good name here as elsewhere those who degrade it are the first to abuse it for degradation at zayla almost all quarrels are connected with women the old bewitch in one way the young in another and both are equally maligned wit in a woman exclaims one man is a habit of running away in a dromedary allah declares another made woman of a crooked bone he who would straighten her breaketh her perhaps however by these generalisms of abuse the sex gains they prevent personal and individual details and no society of french gentlemen avoids mentioning in public the name of a woman more scrupulously than do the misogynist moslems  after a conversazione of two hours my visitors depart and we lose no timefor we must rise at cockcrowin spreading our mats round the common room you would admire the somali pillow 29 a dwarf pedestal of carved wood with a curve upon which the greasy poll and its elaborate frisure repose like the abyssinian article it resembles the headrest of ancient egypt in all points except that it is not worked with typhons and other horrors to drive away dreadful dreams sometimes the sound of the kettledrum the song and the clapping of hands summon us at a later hour than usual to a dance the performance is complicated and as usual with the trivialities easily learned in early youth it is uncommonly difficult to a stranger each dance has its own song and measure and contrary to the custom of el islam the sexes perform together they begin by clapping the hands and stamping where they stand to this succeed advancing retiring wheeling about jumping about and the other peculiarities of the jim crow school the principal measures are those of ugadayn and batar these again are divided and subdividedi fancy that the description of dileho jibwhayn and hobala would be as entertaining and instructive to you dear l as polka gavotte and mazurka would be to a somali  on fridayour sundaya drunken crier goes about the town threatening the bastinado to all who neglect their five prayers at halfpast eleven a kettledrum sounds a summons to the jami or cathedral it is an old barn rudely plastered with whitewash posts or columns of artless masonry support the low roof and the smallness of the windows or rather air holes renders its dreary length unpleasantly hot there is no pulpit the only ornament is a rude representation of the meccan mosque nailed like a pothouse print to the wall and the sole articles of furniture are ragged mats and old boxes containing tattered chapters of the koran in greasy bindings i enter with a servant carrying a prayer carpet encounter the stare of 300 pair of eyes belonging to parallel rows of squatters recite the customary twobow prayer in honor of the mosque placing sword and rosary before me and then taking up a koran read the cow chapter no 18 loud and twangingly at the zohr or midday hour the muezzin inside the mosque standing before the khatib or preacher repeats the call to prayer which the congregation sitting upon their shins and feet intone after him this ended all present stand up and recite every man for himself a twobow prayer of sunnat or example concluding with the blessing on the prophet and the salam over each shoulder to all brother believers the khatib then ascends his hole in the wall which serves for pulpit and thence addresses us with the peace be upon you and the mercy of allah and his benediction to which we respond through the muezzin and upon you be peace and allahs mercy after sundry other religious formulas and their replies concluding with a second call to prayer our preacher rises and in the voice with which sir hudibras was wont    to blaspheme custard through the nose  preaches el waaz 30 or the advicesermon he sits down for a few minutes and then rising again recites el naat or the praise of the prophet and his companions these are the two heads into which the moslem discourse is divided unfortunately however there is no application our preacher who is also kazi or judge makes several blunders in his arabic and he reads his sermons a thing never done in el islam except by the modice docti the discourse over our clerk who is if possible worse than the curate repeats the form of call termed el ikamah then entering the mihrab or niche he recites the twobow friday litany with and in front of the congregation i remarked no peculiarity in the style of praying except that all followed the practice of the shafeis in el yemenraising the hands for a moment instead of letting them depend along the thighs between the rukaat or bow and the sujdah or prostration this public prayer concluded many people leave the mosque a few remain for more prolonged devotions  there is a queer kind of family likeness between this scene and that of a village church in some quiet nook of rural england old sharmarkay the squire attended by his son takes his place close to the pulpit and although the honoratiores have no padded and cushioned pews they comport themselves very much as if they had recognitions of the most distant description are allowed before the service commences looking around is strictly forbidden during prayers but all do not regard the prohibition especially when a new moustache enters leaving the church men shake hands stand for a moment to exchange friendly gossip or address a few words to the preacher and then walk home to dinner there are many salient points of difference no bonnets appear in public the squire after prayers gives alms to the poor and departs escorted by two dozen matchlockmen who perseveringly fire their shotted guns   footnotes  1 this

in the somali country it is a cotton sheet eight cubits long and two breadths sewn together an article of various uses like the highland plaid it is worn in many ways sometimes the right arm is bared in cold weather the whole person is muffled up and in summer it is allowed to full below the waist generally it is passed behind the back rests upon the left shoulder is carried forward over the breast surrounds the body and ends hanging on the left shoulder where it displays a gaudy silk fringe of red and yellow this is the mans tobe the womans dress is of similar material but differently worn the edges are knotted generally over the right sometimes over the left shoulder it is girdled round the waist below which hangs a lappet which in cold weather can be brought like a hood over the head though highly becoming and picturesque as the roman toga the somali tobe is by no means the most decorous of dresses women in the towns often prefer the arab costumea shortsleeved robe extending to the knee and a futah or loincloth underneath  as regards the word tobe it signifies in arabic a garment generally the somal call it maro and the half tobe a shukkah  6 abu kasim of gaza a well known commentator upon abu shujaa of isfahan who wrote a textbook of the shafei school  7 the hajj had seven sons three of whom died in infancy ali and mahmud the latter a fine young man fell victims

stipend of two dollars and a half  10 the system of caste which prevails in el yemen though not in the northern parts of arabia is general throughout the somali country the principal families of outcasts are the following  the yebir correspond with the dushan of southern arabia the males are usually jesters to the chiefs and both sexes take certain parts at festivals marriages and circumcisions the number is said to be small amounting to about 100 families in the northern somali country  the tomal or handad the blacksmiths originally of aydur race have become vile by intermarriage with serviles they must now wed maidens of their own class and live apart from the community their magical practices are feared by the peoplethe connection of wits and witchcraft is obviousand all private quarrels are traced to them it has been observed that the blacksmith has ever been looked upon with awe by barbarians on the same principle that made vulcan a deity in abyssinia all artisans are budah sorcerers especially the blacksmith and he is a social outcast as among the somal even in el hejaz a land unlike yemen opposed to distinctions amongst moslems the khalawiyah who work in metal are considered vile throughout the rest of el islam the blacksmith is respected as treading in the path of david the father of the craft  the word tomal opposed to somal is indigenous handad is palpably a corruption of the arabic haddad ironworker  the midgan onehand corresponds with the khadim of yemen he is called kami or archer by the arabs there are three distinct tribes of this people who are numerous in the somali country the best genealogists cannot trace their origin though some are silly enough to derive them like the akhdam from shimr all however agree in expelling the midgan from the gentle blood of somali land and his position has been compared to that of freedman amongst the romans these people take service under the different chiefs who sometimes entertain great numbers to aid in forays and frays they do not however confine themselves to one craft many midgans employ themselves in hunting and agriculture instead of spear and shield they carry bows and a quiver full of diminutive arrows barbed and poisoned with the wabaa weapon used from faizoghli to the cape of good hope like the veddah of ceylon the midgan is a poor shot and scarcely strong enough to draw his stiff bow he is accused of maliciousness and the twanging of his string will put to flight a whole village the poison is greatly feared it causes say the people the hair and nails to drop off and kills a man in half an hour the only treatment known is instant excision of the part and this is done the more frequently because here as in other parts of africa such stigmates are deemed ornamental  in appearance the midgan is dark and somewhat stunted he is known to the people by peculiarities of countenance and accent  11 the reason why europeans fail to explain their thoughts to orientals generally is that they transfer the laconism of western to eastern tongues we for instance say fetch the book i gave you last night this in hindostani to choose a wellknown tongue must be smothered with words thus what book was by me given to you yesterday by night that book bringing to me come  12 i have alluded to these subjects in a previous work upon the subject of meccah and el medinah  13 this is one of the stock complaints against the moslem scheme yet is it not practically the case with ourselves in european society the best are generally those who prefer the companionship of their own sex the ladies man and the woman who avoids women are rarely choice specimens  14 the shantarah board is thus made with twentyfive points technically called houses illustration the players have twelve counters a piece and each places two at a time upon any of the unoccupied angles till all except the centre are filled up the player who did not begin the game must now move a man his object is to inclose one of his adversarys between two of his own in which case he removes it and is entitled to continue moving till he can no longer take it is a game of some skill and perpetual practice enables the somal to play it as the persians do backgammon with great art and little reflection the game is called kurkabod when as in our draughts the piece passing over one of the adversarys takes it  shahh is another favourite game the board is made thus illustration and the pieces as at shantarah are twelve in number the object is to place three men in lineas the german muhle and the afghan kitar when any one of the adversarys pieces may be removed  children usually prefer the game called indifferently togantog and saddikiya a double line of five or six holes is made in the ground four counters are placed in each and when in the course of play four men meet in the same hole one of the adversarys is removed it resembles the bornou game played with beans and holes in the sand citizens and the more civilised are fond of bakkis which as its name denotes is a corruption of the wellknown indian pachisi none but the travelled know chess and the damal draughts and tavola backgammon of the turks  15 the same objection against villanous saltpetre was made by ourselves in times of old the french knights called gunpowder the grave of honor this is natural enough the bravest weapon being generally the shortestthat which places a man hand to hand with his opponent some of the kafir tribes have discontinued throwing the assegai and enter battle wielding it as a pike usually also the shorter the weapon is the more fatal are the conflicts in which it is employed the old french briquet the afghan charay and the goorka kukkri exemplify this fact in the history of arms  16 in the latter point it differs from the assegai which is worked by the kafirs to the finest temper  17 it is called by the arabs kubabah by the somal goasa johnston travels in southern abyssinia chap 8 has described the game he errs however in supposing it peculiar to the dankali tribes  18 this is in fact the pilgrim dress of el islam its wide diffusion to the eastward as well as west of the red sea proves its antiquity as a popular dress  19 i often regretted having neglected the precaution of a bottle of walnut juicea white colour is decidedly too conspicuous in this part of the east  20 the strict rule of the moslem faith is this if a man neglect to pray he is solemnly warned to repent should he simply refuse without however disbelieving in prayer he is to be put to death and receive moslem burial in the other contingency he is not bathed prayed for or interred in holy ground this severe order however lies in general abeyance  21 tuarick grandiloquence says richardson vol i p 207 savours of blasphemy eg the lands rocks and mountains of ghat do not belong to god but to the azghar equally irreverent are the kafirs of the cape they have proved themselves good men in wit as well as war yet like the old greenlanders and some of the burmese tribes they are apparently unable to believe in the existence of the supreme a favourite question to the missionaries was this is your god white or black if the european startled by the question hesitated for a moment they would leave him with open signs of disgust at having been made the victims of a hoax  the assertion generally passes current that the idea of an omnipotent being is familiar to all people even the most barbarous my limited experience argues the contrary savages begin with fetisism and demon worship they proceed to physiolatry the religion of the vedas and sabaeism the deity is the last and highest pinnacle of the spiritual temple not placed there except by a comparatively civilised race of high development which leads them to study and speculate upon cosmical and psychical themes this progression is admirably wrought out in professor max mullers rig veda

the moslem rosary consists of ninetynine beads divided into sets of thirtythree each by some peculiar sign as a bit of red coral illustration the consulter beginning at a chance place counts up to the mark if the number of beads be odd he sets down a single dot if even two this is done four times when a figure is produced as in the margin of these there are sixteen each having its peculiar name and properties the art is merely geomancy in its rudest shape a mode of vaticination which from its wide diffusion must be of high antiquity the arabs call it el baml and ascribe its present form to the imam jaafar el sadik amongst them it is a ponderous study connected as usual with astrology napoleons book of fate is a specimen of the old eastern superstition presented to europe in a modern and simple form  26 in this country as in western and southern africa the leopard not the wolf is the shepherds scourge  27 popular superstition in abyssinia attributes the same power to the felashas or jews  28 our elixir a corruption of the arabic el iksir  29 in the somali tongue its name is barki they make a stool of similar shape and call it barjimo  30 specimens of these discourses have been

saad el din the larger of the two patches of ground which lie about two miles north of the town reaching our destination after an hours lively sail we passed through a thick belt of underwood tenanted by swarms of midges with a damp chill air crying fever and a fetor of decayed vegetation smelling death to this succeeded a barren flat of silt and sand white with salt and ragged with salsolaceous stubble reeking with heat and covered with old vegetation here says local tradition was the ancient site of zayla 1 built by arabs from yemen the legend runs that when saad el din was besieged and slain by david king of ethiopia the wells dried up and the island sank something doubtless occurred which rendered a removal advisable the sons of the moslem hero fled to ahmed bin el ashraf prince of senaa offering their allegiance if he would build fortifications for them and aid them against the christians of abyssinia the consequence was a walled circuit upon the present site of zayla of its old locality almost may be said periere ruinae  during my stay with sharmarkay i made many inquiries about historical works and the kazi mohammed khatib a harar man of the hawiyah tribe was at last persuaded to send his daftar or office papers for my inspection they formed a kind of parish register of births deaths marriages divorces and manumissions from them it appeared that in ah 1081 ad 167071 the shanabila sayyids were kazis of zayla and retained the office for 138 years it passed two generations ago into the hands of mohammed musa a hawiyah and the present kazi is his nephew  the origin of zayla or as it is locally called audal is lost in the fogs of phoenician fable the avalites 2 of the periplus and pliny it was in earliest ages dependent upon the kingdom of axum 3 about the seventh century when the southern arabs penetrated into the heart of abyssinia 4 it became the great factory of the eastern coast and rose to its height of splendour taki el din makrizi 5 includes under the name of zayla a territory of fortythree days march by forty and divides it into seven great provinces speaking about fifty languages and ruled by amirs subject to the hati hatze of abyssinia  in the fourteenth century it became celebrated by its wars with the kings of abyssinia sustaining severe defeats the moslems retired upon their harbour which after an obstinate defence fell into the hands of the christians the land was laid waste the mosques were converted into churches and the abyssinians returned to their mountains laden with booty about ad 1400 saad el din the heroic prince of zayla was besieged in his city by the hatze david the second slain by a spear thrust he left his people powerless in the hands of their enemies till his sons sabr el din ali mansur and jemal el din retrieved the cause of el islam  ibn batuta a voyager of the fourteenth century thus describes the place i then went from aden by sea and after four days came to the city of zayla this is a settlement of the berbers 6 a people of sudan of the shafia sect their country is a desert of two months extent the first part is termed zayla the last makdashu the greatest number of the inhabitants however are of the rafizah sect 7 their food is mostly camels flesh and fish 8 the stench of the country is extreme as is also its filth from the stink of the fish and the blood of camels which are slaughtered in its streets  about ad 1500 the turks conquered yemen and the lawless janissaries who lived upon the very bowels of commerce 9 drove the peaceable arab merchants to the opposite shore the trade of india flying from the same enemy took refuge in adel amongst its partners 10 the turks of arabia though they were blind to the cause were sensible of the great influx of wealth into the opposite kingdoms they took possession therefore of zayla which they made a den of thieves established there what they called a customhouse 11 and by means of that post and galleys cruising in the narrow straits of bab el mandeb they laid the indian trade to adel under heavy contributions that might indemnify them for the great desertion their violence and injustice had occasioned in arabia  this step threatened the very existence both of adel and abyssinia and considering the vigorous government of the one and the weak politics and prejudices of the other it is more than probable that the turks would have subdued both had they not in india their chief object met the portuguese strongly established  bartema travelling in ad 1503 treats in his 15th chapter of zeila in aethiopia and the great fruitlessness thereof and of certain strange beasts seen there  in this city is great frequentation of merchandise as in a most famous mart there is marvellous abundance of gold and iron and an innumerable number of black slaves sold for small prices these are taken in war by the mahomedans out of aethiopia of the kingdom of presbyter johannes or preciosus johannes which some also call the king of jacobins or abyssins being a christian and are carried away from thence into persia arabia felix babylonia of nilus or alcair and meccah in this city justice and good laws are observed 12  it hath an innumerable multitude of merchants the walls are greatly decayed and the haven rude and despicable the king or sultan of the city is a mahomedan and entertaineth in wages a great multitude of footmen and horsemen they are greatly given to war and wear only one loose single vesture they are of dark ash colour inclining to black  in july 1516 zayla was taken and the town burned by a portuguese armament under lopez suarez alberguiera when the turks were compelled to retire from southern arabia it became subject to the prince of senaa who gave it in perpetuity to the family of a senaani merchant  the kingdom of yemen falling into decay zayla passed under the authority of the sherif of mocha who though receiving no part of the revenue had yet the power of displacing the governor by him it was farmed out to the hajj sharmarkay who paid annually to sayyid mohammed el barr at mocha the sum of 750 crowns and reserved all that he could collect above that sum for himself in ad 1848 zayla was taken from the family el barr and farmed out to sharmarkay by the turkish governor of mocha and hodaydah  the extant remains at saad el din are principally those of watercourses rude lines of coralline stretching across the plain towards wells now lost 13 and diminutive tanks made apparently to collect rain water one of these latter is a work of some arta long sunken vault with a pointed arch projecting a few feet above the surface of the ground outside it is of rough stone the interior is carefully coated with fine lime and from the roof long stalactites depend near it is a cemetery the graves are for the most part provided with large slabs of close black basalt planted in the ground edgeways and in the shape of a small oblong the material was most probably brought from the mountains near tajurrah at another part of the island i found it in the shape of a gigantic millstone half imbedded in the loose sand near the cemetery we observed a mound of rough stones surrounding an upright pole this is the tomb of shaykh saad el din formerly the hero now the favourite patron saint of zaylastill popularly venerated as was proved by the remains of votive banquets broken bones dried garbage and stones blackened by the fire  after wandering through the island which contained not a human being save a party of somal boatmen cutting firewood for aden and having massacred a number of large fishing hawks and small seabirds to astonish the natives our companions we returned to the landingplace here an awning had been spread the goat destined for our dinneri have long since conquered all dislike dear l to seeing dinner perambulatinghad been boiled and disposed in hunches upon small mountains of rice and jars of sweet water stood in the air to cool after feeding regardless of quartana and her weird sisterhood we all lay down for siesta in the light seabreeze our slumbers were heavy as the zayla people say is ever the case at saad el din and the sun had declined low ere we awoke the tide was out and we waded a quarter of a mile to the boat amongst giant crabs who showed grisly claws sharp coralline and seaweed so thick as to become almost a mat you must believe me when i tell you that in the shallower parts the sun was painfully hot even to my well tried feet we picked up a few specimens of fine sponge and coral white and red which if collected might be valuable to zayla and our picnic concluded we returned home  on the 14th november we left the town to meet a caravan of the danakil 14 and to visit the tomb of the great saint abu zarbay the former approached in a straggling line of asses and about fifty camels laiden with cows hides ivories and one abyssinian slavegirl the men were wild as ourangoutangs and the women fit only to flog cattle their animals were small meagrelooking and loosely made the asses of the bedouins however are far superior to those of zayla and the camels are comparatively speaking well bred 15 in a few minutes the beasts were unloaded the gurgis or wigwams pitched and all was prepared for repose a caravan so extensive being an unusual eventsmall parties carrying only grain come in once or twice a weekthe citizens abandoned even their favourite game of ball with an eye to speculation we stood at government house over the ashurbara gate to see the bedouins and we quizzed as town men might denounce a tie or scoff at a boot the huge round shields and the uncouth spears of these provincials presently they entered the streets where we witnessed their frantic dance in presence of the hajj and other authorities this is the wild mens way of expressing their satisfaction that fate has enabled them to convoy the caravan through all the dangers of the desert  the shaykh ibrahim abu zarbay 16 lies under a whitewashed dome close to the ashurbara gate of zayla an inscription cut in wood over the doorway informs us that the building dates from ah 1155ad 17412 it is now dilapidated the lintel is falling in the walls are decaying and the cupola which is rudely built with primitive gradientseach step supported as in cashmere and other parts of india by wooden beams threatens the heads of the pious the building is divided into two compartments forming a mosque and a mazar or place of pious visitation in the latter are five tombs the two largest covered with common chintz stuff of glaring colours ibrahim was one of the fortyfour hazrami saints who landed at berberah sat in solemn conclave upon auliya kumbo or holy hill and thence dispersed far and wide for the purpose of propagandism he travelled to harar about ad 1430 17 converted many to el islam and left there an honored memory his name is immortalised in el yemen by the introduction of el kat 17  tired of the town i persuaded the hajj to send me with an escort to the hissi or well at daybreak i set out with four arab matchlockmen and taking a direction nearly due west waded and walked over an alluvial plain flooded by every high tide on our way we passed lines of donkeys and camels carrying waterskins from the town they were under guard like ourselves and the sturdy dames that drove them indulged in many a loud joke at our expense after walking about four miles we arrived at what is called the takhushshahthe sandy bed of a torrent nearly a mile broad 19 covered with a thin coat of caked mud in the centre is a line of pits from three to four feet deep with turbid water at the bottom around them were several frameworks of four upright sticks connected by horizontal bars and on these were stretched goatsskins forming the cattletrough of the somali country about the wells stood troops of camels whose eesa proprietors scowled fiercely at us and stalked over the plain with their long heavy spears for protection against these people the citizens have erected a kind of round tower with a ladder for a staircase near it are some large tamarisks and the wild henna of the somali country which supplies a sweetsmelling flower but is valueless as a dye a thick hedge of thorntrees surrounds the only cultivated ground near zayla as ibn said declared in old times the people have no gardens and know nothing of fruits the variety and the luxuriance of growth however prove that industry is the sole desideratum i remarked the castorplantno one knows its name or nature 20the rayhan or basil the kadi a species of aloe whose strongly scented flowers the arabs of yemen are fond of wearing in their turbans 21 of vegetables there were cucumbers eggplants and the edible hibiscus the only fruit was a small kind of watermelon  after enjoying a walk through the garden and a bath at the well i started gun in hand towards the jungly plain that stretches towards the sea it abounds in hares and in a large description of spurfowl 22 the beautiful little sand antelope scarcely bigger than an english rabbit 23 bounded over the bushes its thin legs being scarcely perceptible during the spring i was afraid to fire with ball the place being full of bedouins huts herds and dogs and the vicinity of man made the animals too wild for small shot in revenge i did considerable havoc amongst the spurfowl who proved equally good for sport and the pot besides knocking over a number of old crows whose gall the arab soldiers wanted for collyrium 24 beyond us lay warabalay or hyaenas hill 25 we did not visit it as all its tenants had been driven away by the migration of the nomads  returning we breakfasted in the garden and rain coming on we walked out to enjoy the oriental luxury of a wetting ali iskandar an old arab mercenary afforded us infinite amusement a little opium made him half crazy when his sarcastic pleasantries never ceased we then brought out the guns and being joined by the other escort proceeded to a trial of skill the arabs planted a bone about 200 paces from usa long distance for a people who seldom fire beyond fifty yardsmoreover the wind blew the flash strongly in their faces some shot two or three dozen times wide of the mark and were derided accordingly one man hit the bone he at once stopped practice as the wise in such matters will do and shook hands with all the party he afterwards showed that his success on this occasion had been accidental but he was a staunch old sportsman remarkable as the arab bedouins generally are for his skill and perseverance in stalking having no rifle i remained a spectator my revolvers excited abundant attention though none would be persuaded to touch them the largest which fitted with a stock became an excellent carbine was at once named abu sittah the father of six and the shaytan or devil the pocket pistol became the malunah or accursed and the distance to which it carried ball made every man wonder the arabs had antiquated matchlocks mostly worn away to paper thinness at the mouth as usual they fired with the right elbow raised to the level of the ear and the left hand grasping the barrel where with us the breech would be hassan turki had one of those fine old shishkhanah rifles formerly made at damascus and senaa it carried a twoounce ball with perfect correctness but was so badly mounted in its blockbutt shaped like a dutch cheese that it always required a rest  on our return home we met a party of eesa girls who derided my colour and doubted the fact of my being a moslem the arabs declared me to be a shaykh of shaykhs and translated to the prettiest of the party an impromptu proposal of marriage she showed but little coyness and stated her price to be an audulli or necklace 26 a couple of tobesshe asked one too manya few handfuls of beads 27 and a small present for her papa she promised naively enough to call next day and inspect the goods the publicity of the town did not deter her but the shamefacedness of my two companions prevented our meeting again arrived at zayla after a sunny walk the arab escort loaded their guns formed a line for me to pass along fired a salute and entered to coffee and sweetmeats  on the 24th of november i had an opportunity of seeing what a timid people are these somal of the towns who as has been well remarked are like the settled arabs the worst specimens of their race three eesa bedouins appeared before the southern gate slaughtered a cow buried its head and sent for permission to visit one of their number who had been imprisoned by the hajj for the murder of his son masud the place was at once thrown into confusion the gates were locked and the walls manned with arab matchlock men my three followers armed themselves and i was summoned to the fray some declared that the bedouins were doing 28 the town others that they were the van of a giant host coming to ravish sack and slay it turned out that these bedouins had preceded their comrades who were bringing in as the price of blood 29 an abyssinian slave seven camels seven cows a white mule and a small black mare the prisoner was visited by his brother who volunteered to share his confinement and the meeting was described as most pathetic partly from mental organisation and partly from the peculiarities of society the only real tie acknowledged by these people is that which connects male kinsmen the hajj after speaking big had the weakness to let the murderer depart alive this measure like peacepolicy in general is the best and surest way to encourage bloodshed and mutilation but a few months before an eesa bedouin enticed out of the gates a boy about fifteen and slaughtered him for the sake of wearing the feather his relations were directed to receive the diyat or blood fine and the wretch was allowed to depart unhurta silly clemency  you must not suppose dear l that i yielded myself willingly to the weary necessity of a month at zayla but how explain to you the obstacles thrown in our way by african indolence petty intrigue and interminable suspicion four months before leaving aden i had taken the precaution of meeting the hajj requesting him to select for us an abban 30 or protector and to provide camels and mules two months before starting i had advanced to him the money required in a country where nothing can be done without a whole or partial prepayment the protector was to be procured anywhere the cattle at tajurrah scarcely a days sail from zayla when i arrived nothing was forthcoming i at once begged the governor to exert himself he politely promised to start a messenger that hour and he delayed doing so for ten days an easterly wind set in and gave the crew an excuse for wasting another fortnight 31 travellers are an irritable genus i stormed and fretted at the delays to show earnestness of purpose all the effect was a paroxysm of talking the hajj and his son treated me like a spoilt child to a double allowance of food and milk they warned me that the smallpox was depopulating harar that the road swarmed with brigands and that the amir or prince was certain destructioni contented myself with determining that both were true oriental hyperbolists and fell into more frequent fits of passion the old man could not comprehend my secret if the english he privately remarked wish to take harar let them send me 500 soldiers if not i can give all information concerning it when convinced of my determination to travel he applied his mind to calculating the benefit which might be derived from the event and as the following pages will show he was not without success  towards the end of november four camels were procured an abban was engaged we hired two women cooks and a fourth servant my baggage was reformed the cloth and tobacco being sewn up in matting and made to fit the camels sides 32 sandals were cut out for walking letters were written messages of dreary lengthtoo important to be set down in black and whitewere solemnly entrusted to us palavers were held and affairs began to wear the semblance of departure the hajj strongly recommended us to one of the principal families of the gudabirsi tribe who would pass us on to their brotherinlaw adan the gerad or prince of the girhi and he in due time to his kinsman the amir of harar the chain was commenced by placing us under the protection of one raghe a petty eesa chief of the mummasan clan by the good aid of the hajj and our sweetmeats he was persuaded for the moderate consideration of ten tobes 33 to accompany us to the frontier of his clan distant about fifty miles to introduce us to the gudabirsi and to provide us with three men as servants and a suitable escort a score or so in dangerous places he began with us in an extravagant manner declaring that nothing but name induced him to undertake the perilous task that he had left his flocks and herds at a season of uncommon risk and that all his relations must receive a certain honorarium but having paid at least three pounds for a few days of his society we declined such liberality and my companions i believe declared that it would be next timeon all such occasions i make a point of leaving the room since for one thing given at least five are promised on oath raghe warned us seriously to prepare for dangers and disasters and this seemed to be the general opinion of zayla whose timid citizens determined that we were tired of our lives the cold had driven the nomads from the hills to the warm maritime plains 34 we should therefore traverse a populous region and as the end of time aptly observed man eats you up the desert does not moreover this year the ayyal nuh ismail a clan of the habr awal tribe is out and has been successful against the eesa who generally are the better men they sweep the country in kaum or commandos 35 numbering from twenty to two hundred troopers armed with assegai dagger and shield and carrying a water skin and dried meat for a three days ride sufficient to scour the length of the low land the honest fellows are not so anxious to plunder as to ennoble themselves by taking life every man hangs to his saddle bow an ostrich 36 featheremblem of truthand the moment his javelin has drawn blood he sticks it into his tufty pole with as much satisfaction as we feel when attaching a medal to our shelljackets it is by no means necessary to slay the foe in fair combat spartanlike treachery is preferred to standup fighting and you may measure their ideas of honor by the fact that women are murdered in cold blood as by the amazulus with the hope that the unborn child may prove a male the hero carries home the trophy of his prowess 37 and his wife springing from her tent utters a long shrill scream of joy a preliminary to boasting of her mans valour and bitterly taunting the other possessors of noirs faineants the derided ladies abuse their lords with peculiar virulence and the lords fall into paroxysms of envy hatred and malice during my short stay at zayla six or seven murders were committed close to the walls the abban brought news a few hours before our departure that two eesas had been slaughtered by the habr awal the eesa and dankali also have a blood feud which causes perpetual loss of life but a short time ago six men of these two tribes were travelling together when suddenly the last but one received from the hindermost a deadly spear thrust in the back the wounded man had the presence of mind to plunge his dagger in the side of the wayfarer who preceded him thus dying as the people say in company one of these events throws the country into confusion for the vendetta is rancorous and bloody as in ancient germany or in modern corsica our abban enlarged upon the unpleasant necessity of travelling all night towards the hills and lying perdu during the day the most dangerous times are dawn and evening tide the troopers spare their horses during the heat and themselves during the dewfall whenever in the desertwhere says the proverb all men are enemiesyou sight a fellow creature from  afar you wave the right arm violently up and down shouting war joga war jogastand still stand still if they halt you send a parliamentary to within speaking distance should they advance 38 you fire taking especial care not to miss when two saddles are emptied the rest are sure to decamp  i had given the abban orders to be in readinessmy patience being thoroughly exhaustedon sunday the 26th of november and determined to walk the whole way rather than waste another day waiting for cattle as the case had become hopeless a vessel was descried standing straight from tajurrah and suddenly as could happen in the arabian nights four fine mules saddled and bridled abyssinian fashion appeared at the door 39   footnotes  1 brace describes zayla as a small island on the very coast of adel to reconcile discrepancy he adopts the usual clumsy expedient of supposing two cities of the same name one

waterskins to and from the walls  16 he is generally called abu zerbin more rarely abu zarbayn and abu zarbay i have preferred the latter orthography upon the authority of the shaykh jami most learned of the somal  17 in the same year ad 142930 the shaykh el shazili buried under a dome at mocha introduced coffee into arabia  18 the following is an extract from the pharmaceutical journal vol xii no v nov 1 1852 notes upon the drugs observed at aden arabia by james vaughan esq mrcse assist surg ba civil and port surg aden arabia  kat arabic the name of a drug which is brought into aden from the interior and largely used especially by the arabs as a pleasurable excitant it is generally imported in small camelloads consisting of a number of parcels each containing about forty slender twigs with the leaves attached and carefully wrapped so as to prevent as much as possible exposure to the atmosphere the leaves form the edible part and these when chewed are said to produce great hilarity of spirits and an agreeable state of wakefulness some estimate may be formed of the strong predilection which the arabs have for this drug from the quantity used in aden alone which averages about 280 camelloads annually the market price is one and a quarter rupees per parcel and the exclusive privilege of selling it is farmed by the government for 1500 rupees per year forskal found the plant growing on the mountains of yemen and has enumerated it as a new genus in the class pentandria under the name of catha he notices two species and distinguishes them as catha edulis and catha spinosa according to his account it is cultivated on the same ground as coffee and is planted from cuttings besides the effects above stated the arabs he tells us believe the land where it grows to be secure from the inroads of plague and that a twig of the kat carried in the bosom is a certain safeguard against infection the learned botanist observes with respect to these supposed virtues gustus foliorum tamen virtutem tantam indicare non videtur like coffee kat from its acknowledged stimulating effects has been a fertile theme for the exercise of mahomedan casuistry and names of renown are ranged on both sides of the question whether the use of kat does or does not contravene the injunction of the koran thou shalt not drink wine or anything intoxicating the succeeding notes borrowed chiefly from de sacys researches may be deemed worthy of insertion here  sheikh abdool kader ansari jezeri a learned mahomedan author in his treatise on the use of coffee quotes the following from the writings of fakr ood deen mekkiit is said that the first who introduced coffee was the illustrious saint aboo abdallah mahomed dhabhani ibn said but we have learned by the testimony of many persons that the use of coffee in yemen its origin and first introduction into that country are due to the learned all shadeli ibn omar one of the disciples of the learned doctor nasr ood deen who is regarded as one of the chiefs among the order shadeli and whose worth attests the high degree of spirituality to which they had attained previous to that time they made coffee of the vegetable substance called cafta which is the same as the leaf known under the name of kat and not of boon the coffee berry nor any preparation of boon the use of this beverage extended in course of time as far as aden but in the days of mahomed dhabhani the vegetable substance from which it was prepared disappeared from aden then it was that the sheik advised those who had become his disciples to try the drink made from the boon which was found to produce the same effect as the kat inducing sleeplessness and that it was attended with less expense and trouble the use of coffee has been kept up from that time to the present  dherbelot states that the beverage called calmat al catiat or caftah was prohibited in yemen in consequence of its effects upon the brain on the other hand a synod of learned mussulmans is said to have decreed that as beverages of kat and cafta do not impair the health or impede the observance of religious duties but only increase hilarity and good humour it was lawful to use them as also the drink made from the boon or coffeeberry i am not aware that kat is used in aden in any other way than for mastication from what i have heard however i believe that a decoction resembling tea is made from the leaf by the arabs in the interior and one who is well acquainted with our familiar beverage assures me that the effects are not unlike those produced by strong green tea with this advantage in favour of kat that the excitement is always of a pleasing and agreeable kind note mr vaughan has transmitted two specimens called tubbare kat and muktaree kat from the districts in which they are produced the latter fetches the lower price catha edulis forsk nat ord celastraceae is figured in dr lindleys vegetable kingdom p 588 london 1846 but there is a still more complete

hanulae 1790 fol pars i p 21 daniel hanbury signed  19 this is probably the river of zayla alluded to by ibn said and others like all similar features in the low country it is a mere surface drain  20 in the upper country i found a large variety growing wild in the fiumaras the bedouins named it buamado but ignored its virtues  21 this ornament is called musbgur  22 a large brown bird with black legs not unlike the domestic fowl the arabs call it dijajat el barr the wild hen the somal digarin a word also applied to the guinea fowl which it resembles in its short strong fight and habit of running owing to the bedouin prejudice against eating birds it is found in large coveys all over the country  23 it has been described by salt and others the somal call it sagaro the arabs ghezalah it is found throughout the land generally in pairs and is fond of ravines under the hills beds of torrents and patches of desert vegetation it is easily killed by a single pellet of shot striking the neck the somal catch it by a loop of strong twine hung round a gap in a circuit of thorn hedge or they run it down on foot an operation requiring half a day on account of its fleetness which enables it to escape the jackal and wild dog when caught it utters piercing cries some bedouins do not eat the flesh generally however it is considered a delicacy and the skulls and bones of these little animals lie strewed around the kraals  24 the somal hold the destruction of the tuka next in religious merit to that of the snake they have a tradition that the crow originally white became black for his sins when the prophet and abubekr were concealed in the cave the pigeon hid there from their pursuers the crow on the contrary sat screaming ghar ghar the cave the cave upon which mohammed ordered him into eternal mourning and ever to repeat the traitorous words  there are several species of crows in this part of africa besides the largebeaked bird of the harar hills i found the common european variety with however the breast feathers white tipped in small semicircles as far as the abdomen the little kingcrow of india is common its bright red eye and purplish plume render it a conspicuous object as it perches upon the tall camels back or clings to waving plants  25 the waraba or durwa is according to mr blyth the distinguished naturalist now curator of the asiatic societys museum at calcutta the canis pictus seu venaticus lycaon pictus or wilde honde of the cape boers it seems to be the chien sauvage or cynhyene cynhyaena venatica of the french traveller m delegorgue who in his voyage dans lafrique australe minutely and diffusely describes it mr gordon cumming supposes it to form the connecting link between the wolf and the hyaena this animal swarms throughout the somali country prowls about the camps all night dogs travellers and devours every thing he can find at times pulling down children and camels and when violently pressed by hunger men the somal declare the waraba to be a hermaphrodite so the ancients supposed the hyaena to be of both sexes an error arising from the peculiar appearance of an orifice situated near two glands which secrete an unctuous fluid  26 men wear for ornament round the neck a bright red leather thong upon which are strung in front two square bits of true or imitation amber or honey stone this mekkawi however is seldom seen amongst the bedouins the audulli or womans necklace is a more elaborate affair of amber glass beads generally coloured and coral every matron who can afford it possesses at least one of these ornaments both sexes carry round the necks or hang above the right elbow a talisman against danger and disease either in a silver box or more generally sewn up in a small case of red morocco the bedouins are fond of attaching a toothstick to the neck thong  27 beads are useful in the somali country as presents and to pay for trifling purchases like tobacco they serve for small change the kind preferred by women and children is the binnur large and small white porcelain the others are the red white green and spotted twisted beads round and oblong before entering a district the traveller should ascertain what may be the especial variety some kind are greedily sought for in one place and in another rejected with disdain  28 the somali word fal properly means to do to bewitch is its secondary sense  29 the price of blood in the somali country is the highest sanctioned by el islam it must be remembered that amongst the pagan arabs the korayah diyat was twenty shecamels abd el muttaleb grandfather of mohammed sacrificed 100 animals to ransom the life of his son forfeited by a rash vow and from that time the greater became the legal number the somal usually demand 100 shecamels or 300 sheep and a few cows here as in arabia the sum is made up by all the near relations of the slayer 30 of the animals may be aged and 30 under age but the rest must be sound and good many tribes take lessfrom strangers 100 sheep a cow and a camelbut after the equivalent is paid the murderer or one of his clan contrary to the spirit of el islam is generally killed by the kindred or tribe of the slain when blood is shed in the same tribe the full reparation if accepted by the relatives is always exacted this serves the purpose of preventing fratricidal strife for in such a nation of murderers only the diyat prevents the taking of life  blood money however is seldom accepted unless the murdered man has been slain with a lawful weapon those who kill with the dankaleh a poisonous juice rubbed upon meat are always put to death by the members of their own tribe  30 the abban or protector of the somali country is the mogasa of the gallas the akh of el hejaz the ghafir of the sinaitic peninsula and the rabia of eastern arabia it must be observed however that the word denotes the protege as well as the protector in the latter sense it is the polite address to a somali as ya abbaneh o protectress would be to his wife  the abban acts at once as broker escort agent and interpreter and the institution may be considered the earliest form of transit dues in all sales he receives a certain percentage his food and lodging are provided at the expense of his employer and he not unfrequently exacts small presents from his kindred in return he is bound to arrange all differences and even to fight the battles of his client against his fellowcountrymen should the abban be slain his tribe is bound to take up the cause and to make good the losses of their protege el taabanah the office being one of name the eastern synonym for our honour as well as of lucre causes frequent quarrels which become exceedingly rancorous  according to the laws of the country the abban is master of the life and property of his client the travellers success will depend mainly upon his selection if inferior in rank the protector can neither forward nor defend him if timid he will impede advance and if avaricious he will by means of his relatives effectually stop the journey by absorbing the means of prosecuting it the best precaution against disappointment would be the registering abbans at aden every donkeyboy will offer himself as a protector but only the chiefs of tribes should be provided with certificates during my last visit to africa i proposed that english officers visiting the country should be provided with servants not protectors the former however to be paid like the latter all the people recognised the propriety of the step  in the following pages occur manifold details concerning the complicated subject el taabanah  31 future travellers would do well either to send before them a trusty servant with orders to buy cattle or what would be better though a little more expensive to take with them from aden all the animals required  32 the somal use as camel saddles the mats which compose their huts these lying loose upon the animals back cause by slipping backwards and forwards the loss of many a precious hour and in wet weather become half a load the more civilised make up of canvass or gunny bags stuffed with hay and provided with cross bars a rude packsaddle which is admirably calculated to gall the animals back future travellers would do well to purchase camelsaddles at aden where they are cheap and well made  33 he received four cloths of cutch canvass and six others of coarse american sheeting at zayla these articles are double the aden value which would be about thirteen rupees or twentysix shillings in the bush the price is quadrupled before leaving us the abban received at least double the original hire besides small presents of cloth dates tobacco and rice to his friends he had six cubits of sauda wilayati or english indigodyed calico for womens fillets and two of sauda kashshi a cutch imitation a shukkah or half tobe for his daughter and a sheep for himself together with a large bundle of tobacco  34 when the pastures are exhausted and the monsoon sets in the bedouins return to their cool mountains like the iliyat of persia they have their regular kishlakh and yaylakh  35 kaum is the arabic all the somali term for these raids  36 amongst the old egyptians the ostrich feather was the symbol of truth the somal call it bal the arabs rish it is universally used here as the sign and symbol of victory generally the white feather only is stuck in the hair the eesa are not particular in using black when they can procure no other all the clans wear it in the back hair but each has its own rules some make it a standard decoration others discard it after the first few days the learned have an aversion to the custom stigmatising it as pagan and idolatrous the vulgar look upon it as the highest mark of honor  37 this is an ancient practice in asia as well as in africa the egyptian temples show heaps of trophies placed before the monarchs as eyes or heads were presented in persia thus in 1 sam xviii 25 david brings the spoils of 200 philistines and shows them in full tale to the king that he might be the kings soninlaw any work upon the subject of abyssinia bruce book 7 chap 8 or the late afghan war will prove that the custom of mutilation opposed as it is both to christianity and el islam is still practised in the case of hated enemies and infidels and de bey remarks of the cape kafirs victores caesis excidunt greek tu aidoui quae exsiccata regi afferunt  38 when attacking cattle the plundering party endeavour with shoots and noise to disperse the herds whilst the assailants huddle them together and attempt to face the danger in parties  39 for the cheapest i paid twentythree for the dearest twentysix dollars besides a riyal upon each under the names of custom dues and carriage the hajj had doubtless exaggerated the price but all were good animals and the traveller has no right to complain except when he pays dear for a bad article     chap iv  the somal their origin and peculiarities   before leaving zayla i must not neglect a short description of its inhabitants and the remarkable somal races around it  eastern africa like arabia presents a population composed of three markedly distinct races  1 the aborigines or hamites such as the negro sawahili the bushmen hottentots and other races having such physiological peculiarities as the steatopyge the tablier and other developments described in 1815 by the great cuvier  2 the almost pure caucasian of the northern regions west of egypt their immigration comes within the range of comparatively modern history  3 the halfcastes in eastern africa are represented principally by the abyssinians gallas somals and kafirs the firstnamed people derive their descent from menelek son of solomon by the queen of sheba it is evident from their features and figurestoo well known to require descriptionthat they are descended from semitic as well as hamitic progenitors 1 about the origin of the gallas there is a diversity of opinion 2 some declare them to be meccan arabs who settled on the western coast of the red sea at a remote epoch according to the abyssinians however and there is little to find fault with in their theory the gallas are descended from a princess of their nation who was given in marriage to a slave from the country south of gurague she bare seven sons who became mighty robbers and founders of tribes their progenitors obtained the name of gallas after the river gala in gurague where they gained a decisive victory over their kinsmen the abyssins 3 a variety of ethnologic and physiological reasonsinto which space and subject prevent my enteringargue the kafirs of the cape to be a northern people pushed southwards by some to us as yet unknown cause the origin of the somal is a matter of modern history  barbarah berberah 4 according to the kamus is a well known town in el maghrib and a race located between el zanjzanzibar and the negrotic coastand el habash 5 they are descended from the himyar chiefs sanhaj arabic and sumamah arabic and they arrived at the epoch of the conquest of africa by the king afrikus scipio africanus a few details upon the subject of mutilation and excision prove these to have been the progenitors of the somal 6 who are nothing but a slice of the great galla nation islamised and semiticised by repeated immigrations from arabia in the kamus we also read that samal arabic is the name of the father of a tribe so called because he thrust out arabic samala his brothers eye 7 the shaykh jami a celebrated genealogist informed me that in ah 666  ad 12667 the sayyid yusuf el baghdadi visited the port of siyaro near berberah then occupied by an infidel magician who passed through mountains by the power of his gramarye the saint summoned to his aid mohammed bin tunis el siddiki of bayt el fakih in arabia and by their united prayers a hill closed upon the pagan deformed by fable the foundation of the tale is fact the numerous descendants of the holy men still pay an annual fine by way of bloodmoney to the family of the infidel chief the last and most important arab immigration took place about fifteen generations or 450 years ago when the sherif ishak bin ahmed 8 left his native country hazramaut and with fortyfour saints before mentioned landed on makharthe windward coast extending from karam harbour to cape guardafui at the town of met near burnt island where his tomb still exists he became the father of all the gentle blood and the only certain descent in the somali country by magaden a free woman he had gerhajis awal and arab and by a slave or slaves jailah sambur and rambad hence the great clans habr gerhajis and awal who prefer the matronymic habr signifying a mothersince according to their dictum no man knows who may be his sire 9 these increased and multiplied by connection and affiliation to such an extent that about 300 years ago they drove their progenitors the galla from berberah and gradually encroached upon them till they intrenched themselves in the highlands of harar  the old and pagan genealogies still known to the somal are dirr aydur darud and according to some hawiyah dirr and aydur of whom nothing is certainly known but the name 10 are the progenitors of the northern somal the eesa gudabirsi ishak and bursuk tribes darud jabarti 11 bin ismail bin akil or ukayl is supposed by his descendants to have been a noble arab from el hejaz who obliged to flee his country was wrecked on the northeast coast of africa where he married a daughter of the hawiyah tribe rival races declare him to have been a galla slave who stealing the prophets slippers 12 was dismissed with the words inna taradnahu verily we have rejected him hence his name tarud arabic or darud the rejected 13 the etymological part of the story is doubtless fabulous it expresses however the popular belief that the founder of the eastward or windward tribes now extending over the seaboard from bunder jedid to ras hafun and southward from the sea to the webbes 14 was a man of ignoble origin the children of darud are now divided into two great bodies harti is the family name of the dulbahanta ogadayn warsangali and mijjarthayn who call themselves sons of harti bin kombo bin kabl ullah bin darud the other darud tribes not included under that appellation are the girhi berteri marayhan and bahabr ali the hawiyah are doubtless of ancient and pagan origin they call all somal except themselves hashiyah and thus claim to be equivalent to the rest of the nation some attempt as usual to establish a holy origin deriving themselves like the shaykhash from the caliph abubekr the antiquity and consequently the pagan origin of the hawiyah are proved by its present widely scattered state it is a powerful tribe in the mijjarthayn country and yet is found in the hills of harar  the somal therefore by their own traditions as well as their strongly marked physical peculiarities their customs and their geographical position may be determined to be a halfcaste tribe an offshoot of the great galla race approximated like the originally negroegyptian to the caucasian type by a steady influx of pure asiatic blood  in personal appearance the race is not unprepossessing the crinal hair is hard and wiry growing like that of a halfcaste west indian in stiff ringlets which sprout in tufts from the scalp and attaining a moderate length which they rarely surpass hang down a few elders savans and the wealthy who can afford the luxury of a turban shave the head more generally each filament is duly picked out with the comb or a wooden scratcher like a knittingneedle and the mass made to resemble a childs pudding an old bobwig a mop a counsellors peruke or an old fashioned coachmans wigthere are a hundred ways of dressing the head the bedouins true specimens of the greasy african race wear locks dripping with rancid butter and accuse their citizen brethren of being more like birds than men the colouring matter of the hair naturally a bluishblack is removed by a mixture of quicklime and water or in the desert by a lessive of ashes 15 this makes it a dull yellowishwhite which is converted into red permanently by henna temporarily by ochreish earth kneaded with water the ridiculous somali peruke of crimsoned sheepskinalmost as barbarous an article as the welshis apparently a foreign invention i rarely saw one in the low country although the hill tribes about harar sometimes wear a black or white scratchwig the head is rather long than round and generally of the amiable variety it is gracefully put on the shoulders belongs equally to africa and arabia and would be exceedingly weak but for the beauty of the brow as far as the mouth the face with the exception of high cheekbones is good the contour of the forehead ennobles it the eyes are large and wellformed and the upper features are frequently handsome and expressive the jaw however is almost invariably prognathous and african the broad turned out lips betray approximation to the negro and the chin projects to the detriment of the facial angle the beard is represented by a few tufts it is rare to see anything equal to even the arab development the long and ample eyebrows admired by the people are uncommon and the mustachios are short and thin often twisted outwards in two dwarf curls the mouth is coarse as well as thicklipped the teeth rarely project as in the negro but they are not good the habit of perpetually chewing coarse surat tobacco stains them 16 the gums become black and mottled and the use of ashes with the quid discolours the lips the skin amongst the tribes inhabiting the hot regions is smooth black and glossy as the altitude increases it becomes lighter and about harar it is generally of a cafe au lait colour the bedouins are fond of raising beauty marks in the shape of ghastly seams and the thickness of the epidermis favours the size of these stigmates the male figure is tall and somewhat ungainly in only one instance i observed an approach to the steatopyge making the shape to resemble the letter s but the shoulders are high the trunk is straight the thighs fall off the shin bones bow slightly forwards and the feet like the hands are coarse large and flat yet with their hair of a light straw colour decked with the light waving feather and their coalblack complexions set off by that most graceful of garments the clean white tobe 17 the contrasts are decidedly effective  in mind the somal are peculiar as in body they are a people of most susceptible character and withal uncommonly hard to please they dislike the arabs fear and abhor the turks have a horror of franks and despise all other asiatics who with them come under the general name of hindi indians the latter are abused on all occasions for cowardice and a want of generosity which has given rise to the following piquant epigram    ask not from the hindi thy want   impossible that the hindi can be generous   had there been one liberal man in el hind   allah had raised up a prophet in el hind  they have all the levity and instability of the negro character light minded as the abyssiniansdescribed by gobat as constant in nothing but inconstancysoft merry and affectionate souls they pass without any apparent transition into a state of fury when they are capable of terrible atrocities at aden they appear happier than in their native country there i have often seen a man clapping his hands and dancing childlike alone to relieve the exuberance of his spirits here they become as the mongols and other pastoral people a melancholy race who will sit for hours upon a bank gazing at the moon or croning some old ditty under the trees this state is doubtless increased by the perpetual presence of danger and the uncertainty of life which make them think of other things but dancing and singing much learning seems to make them mad like the halfcrazy fakihs of the sahara in northern africa the widad or priest is generally unfitted for the affairs of this world and the hafiz or koranreciter is almost idiotic as regards courage they are no exception to the generality of savage races they have none of the recklessness standing in lieu of creed which characterises the civilised man in their great battles a score is considered a heavy loss usually they will run after the fall of half a dozen amongst a kraal full of braves who boast a hundred murders not a single maimed or wounded man will be seen whereas in an arabian camp half the male population will bear the marks of lead and steel the bravest will shirk fighting if he has forgotten his shield the sight of a lion and the sound of a gun elicit screams of terror and their kaum or forays much resemble the style of tactics rendered obsolete by the great turenne when the tacticians chief aim was not to fall in with his enemy yet they are by no means deficient in the wily valour of wild men two or three will murder a sleeper bravely enough and when the passions of rival tribes between whom there has been a blood feud for ages are violently excited they will use with asperity the dagger and spear their massacres are fearful in february 1847 a small sept the ayyal tunis being expelled from berberah settled at the roadstead of bulhar where a few merchants principally indian and arab joined them the men were in the habit of leaving their women and children sick and aged at the encampment inland whilst descending to the beach they carried on their trade one day as they were thus employed unsuspicious of danger a foraging party of about 2500 eesas attacked the camp men women and children were indiscriminately put to the spear and the plunderers returned to their villages in safety laden with an immense amount of booty at present a man armed with a revolver would be a terror to the country the day however will come when the matchlock will supersede the assegai and then the harmless spearman in his strong mountains will become like the arab a formidable foe travelling among the bedouins i found them kind and hospitable a pinch of snuff or a handful of tobacco sufficed to win every heart and a few yards of coarse cotton cloth supplied all our wants i was petted like a child forced to drink milk and to eat mutton girls were offered to me in marriage the people begged me to settle amongst them to head their predatory expeditions free them from lions and kill their elephants and often a man has exclaimed in pitying accents what hath brought thee delicate as thou art to sit with us on the cowhide in this cold under a tree of course they were beggars princes and paupers lairds and loons being all equally unfortunate the arabs have named the country bilad wa issithe land of give me somethingbut their wants were easily satisfied and the open hand always made a friend  the somal hold mainly to the shafei school of el islam their principal peculiarity is that of not reciting prayers over the dead even in the towns the marriage ceremony is simple the price of the bride and the feast being duly arranged the formula is recited by some priest or pilgrim i have often been requested to officiate on these occasions and the end of time has done it by irreverently reciting the fatihah over the happy pair 18 the somal as usual amongst the heterogeneous mass amalgamated by el islam have a diversity of superstitions attesting their pagan origin such for instance are their oaths by stones their reverence of cairns and holy trees and their ordeals of fire and water the bolungo of western africa a man accused of murder or theft walks down a trench full of live charcoal and about a spears length or he draws out of the flames a smiths anvil heated to redness some prefer picking four or five cowries from a large pot full of boiling water the member used is at once rolled up in the intestines of a sheep and not inspected for a whole day they have traditionary seers called tawuli like the greegreemen of western africa who by inspecting the fat and bones of slaughtered cattle do medicine predict rains battles and diseases of animals this class is of both sexes they never pray or bathe and are therefore considered always impure thus being feared they are greatly respected by the vulgar their predictions are delivered in a rude rhyme often put for importance into the mouth of some deceased seer during the three months called rajalo 19 the koran is not read over graves and no marriage ever takes place the reason of this peculiarity is stated to be imitation of their ancestor ishak who happened not to contract a matrimonial alliance at such epoch it is however a manifest remnant of the pagans auspicious and inauspicious months thus they sacrifice she camels in the month sabuh and keep holy with feasts and bonfires the dubshid or new years day 20 at certain unlucky periods when the moon is in illomened asterisms those who die are placed in bundles of matting upon a tree the idea being that if buried a loss would result to the tribe 21  though superstitious the somal are not bigoted like the arabs with the exception of those who wishing to become learned visit yemen or el hejaz and catch the complaint nominal mohammedans el islam hangs so lightly upon them that apparently they care little for making it binding upon others  the somali language is no longer unknown to europe it is strange that a dialect which has no written character should so abound in poetry and eloquence there are thousands of songs some local others general upon all conceivable subjects such as camel loading drawing water and elephant hunting every man of education knows a variety of them the rhyme is imperfect being generally formed by the syllable ay pronounced as in our word hay which gives the verse a monotonous regularity but assisted by a tolerably regular alliteration and cadence it can never be mistaken for prose even without the song which invariably accompanies it the country teems with poets poetasters poetitos and poetaccios every man has his recognised position in literature as accurately defined as though he had been reviewed in a century of magazinesthe fine ear of this people 22 causing them to take the greatest pleasure in harmonious sounds and poetical expressions whereas a false quantity or a prosaic phrase excite their violent indignation many of these compositions are so idiomatic that arabs settled for years amongst the somal cannot understand them though perfectly acquainted with the conversational style every chief in the country must have a panegyric to be sung by his clan and the great patronise light literature by keeping a poet the amatory is of course the favourite theme sometimes it appears in dialogue the rudest form we are told of the drama the subjects are frequently pastoral the lover for instance invites his mistress to walk with him towards the well in lahelo the arcadia of the land he compares her legs to the tall straight libi tree and imprecates the direst curses on her head if she refuse to drink with him the milk of his favourite camel there are a few celebrated ethical compositions in which the father lavishes upon his son all the treasures of somali good advice long as the somniferous sermons of mentor to the insipid son of ulysses sometimes a black tyrtaeus breaks into a wild lament for the loss of warriors or territory he taunts the clan with cowardice reminds them of their slain kindred better men than themselves whose spirits cannot rest unavenged in their gory graves and urges a furious onslaught upon the exulting victor  and now dear l i will attempt to gratify your just curiosity concerning the sex in eastern africa  the somali matron is distinguishedexternallyfrom the maiden by a fillet of blue network or indigodyed cotton which covering the head and containing the hair hangs down to the neck virgins wear their locks long parted in the middle and plaited in a multitude of hard thin pigtails on certain festivals they twine flowers and plaster the head like kafir women with a red ochrethe coiffure has the merit of originality with massive rounded features large flat craniums long big eyes broad brows heavy chins rich brown complexions and round faces they greatly resemble the stony beauties of egyptthe models of the land ere persia greece and rome reformed the profile and bleached the skin they are of the venus kallipyga order of beauty the feature is scarcely ever seen amongst young girls but after the first child it becomes remarkable to a stranger the arabs have not failed to make it a matter of jibe    tis a wonderful fact that your hips swell   like boiled rice or a skin blown out  sings a satirical yemeni the somal retort by comparing the lank haunches of their neighbours to those of tadpoles or young frogs one of their peculiar charms is a soft low and plaintive voice derived from their african progenitors always an excellent thing in woman here it has an undefinable charm i have often lain awake for hours listening to the conversation of the bedouin girls whose accents sounded in my ears rather like music than mere utterance  in muscular strength and endurance the women of the somal are far superior to their lords at home they are engaged all day in domestic affairs and tending the cattle on journeys their manifold duties are to load and drive the camels to look after the ropes and if necessary to make them to pitch the hut to bring water and firewood and to cook both sexes are equally temperate from necessity the mead and the milletbeer so common among the abyssinians and the danakil are entirely unknown to the somal of the plains as regards their morals i regret to say that the traveller does not find them in the golden state which teetotal doctrines lead him to expect after much wandering we are almost tempted to believe the bad doctrine that morality is a matter of geography that nations and races have like individuals a pet vice and that by restraining one you only exasperate another as a general rule somali women prefer amourettes with strangers following the wellknown arab proverb the new comer filleth the eye in cases of scandal the womans tribe revenges its honour upon the man should a wife disappear with a fellow clansman and her husband accord divorce no penal measures are taken but she suffers in reputation and her female friends do not spare her generally the somali women are of cold temperament the result of artificial as well as natural causes like the kafirs they are very prolific but peculiarly bad mothers neither loved nor respected by their children the fair sex lasts longer in eastern africa than in india and arabia at thirty however charms are on the wane and when old age comes on they are no exceptions to the hideous decrepitude of the east  the somal when they can afford it marry between the ages of fifteen and twenty connections between tribes are common and entitle the stranger to immunity from the bloodfeud men of family refuse however to ally themselves with the servile castes contrary to the arab custom none of these people will marry cousins at the same time a man will give his daughter to his uncle and take to wife like the jews and gallas a brothers relict some clans the habr yunis for instance refuse maidens of the same or even of a consanguineous family this is probably a political device to preserve nationality and provide against a common enemy the bride as usual in the east is rarely consulted but frequent tete a tetes at the well and in the bush when tending cattle effectually obviate this inconvenience her relatives settle the marriage portion which varies from a cloth and a bead necklace to fifty sheep or thirty dollars and dowries are unknown in the towns marriage ceremonies are celebrated with feasting and music on first entering the nuptial hut the bridegroom draws forth his horsewhip and inflicts memorable chastisement upon the fair person of his bride with the view of taming any lurking propensity to shrewishness 23 this is carrying out with a will the arab proverb    the slave girl from her capture the wife from her wedding  during the space of a week the spouse remains with his espoused scarcely ever venturing out of the hut his friends avoid him and no lesser event than a plundering party or dollars to gain would justify any intrusion if the correctness of the wife be doubted the husband on the morning after marriage digs a hole before his door and veils it with matting or he rends the skirt of his tobe or he tears open some new hutcovering this disgraces the womans family polygamy is indispensable in a country where children are the principal wealth 24 the chiefs arrived at manhood immediately marry four wives they divorce the old and unfruitful and as amongst the kafirs allow themselves an unlimited number in peculiar cases especially when many of the sons have fallen daughters as usual in oriental countries do not count as part of the family they are however utilised by the father who disposes of them to those who can increase his wealth and importance divorce is exceedingly common for the men are liable to sudden fits of disgust there is little ceremony in contracting marriage with any but maidens i have heard a man propose after half an hours acquaintance and the fair ones reply was generally the question direct concerning settlements old men frequently marry young girls but then the portion is high and the menage a trois common  the somal know none of the exaggerated and chivalrous ideas by which passion becomes refined affection amongst the arab bedouins and the sons of civilisation nor did i ever hear of an african abandoning the spear and the sex to become a darwaysh their hudhudu however reminds the traveller of the abyssinian eyelove the afghans namzadbazi and the semites ishkuzri which for want of a better expression we translate platonic love 25 this meeting of the sexes however is allowed in africa by male relatives in arabia and central asia it provokes their direst indignation curious to say throughout the somali country kissing is entirely unknown  children are carried on their mothers backs or laid sprawling upon the ground for the first two years 26 they are circumcised at the age of seven or eight provided with a small spear and allowed to run about naked till the age of puberty they learn by conversation not books eat as much as they can beg borrow and steal and grow up healthy strong and well proportioned according to their race  as in el islam generally so here a man cannot make a will the property of the deceased is divided amongst his childrenthe daughters receiving a small portion if any of it when a man dies without issue his goods and chattels are seized upon by his nearest male relatives one of them generally marries the widow or she is sent back to her family relicts as a rule receive no legacies  you will have remarked dear l that the people of zayla are by no means industrious they depend for support upon the desert the bedouin becomes the nazil or guest of the townsman and he is bound to receive a little tobacco a few beads a bit of coarse cotton cloth or on great occasions a penny lookingglass and a cheap german razor in return for his slaves ivories hides gums milk and grain any violation of the tie is severely punished by the governor and it can be dissolved only by the formula of triple divorce of course the wild men are hopelessly cheated 27 and their citizen brethren live in plenty and indolence after the early breakfast the male portion of the community leave their houses on business that is to say to chat visit and flaner about the streets and mosques 28 they return to dinner and the siesta after which they issue forth again and do not come home till night friday is always an idle day festivals are frequent and there is no work during weddings and mournings the women begin after dawn to plait mats and superintend the slaves who are sprinkling the house with water grinding grain for breakfast cooking and breaking up firewood to judge however from the amount of chatting and laughter there appears to be far less work than play  in these small places it is easy to observe the mechanism of a government which en grand becomes that of delhi teheran and constantinople the governor farms the place from the porte he may do what he pleases as long as he pays his rent with punctuality and provides presents and douceurs for the pasha of mocha he punishes the petty offences of theft quarrels and arson by fines the bastinado the stocks or confinement in an arish or thatchhut the latter is a severe penalty as the prisoner must provide himself with food in cases of murder he either refers to mocha or he carries out the kisaslex talionisby delivering the slayer to the relatives of the slain the kazi has the administration of the shariat or religious law he cannot however pronounce sentence without the governors permission and generally his powers are confined to questions of divorce alimony manumission the woundmulct and similar cases which come within koranic jurisdiction thus the religious code is ancillary and often opposed to el jabrthe tyrannythe popular designation of what we call civil law 29 yet is el jabr despite its name generally preferred by the worldly wise the governor contents himself with a moderate bribe the kazi is insatiable the former may possibly allow you to escape unplundered the latter assuredly will not this i believe to be the history of religious jurisdiction in most parts of the world

arabic which would allude to the hardihood of the wild people an intelligent modern traveller derives somali from the abyssinian soumahe or heathens and asserts that it corresponds with the arabic

advise polygamy amongst highly civilised races where the sexes are nearly equal and where reproduction becomes a minor duty monogamy is the growth of civilisation a plurality of wives is the natural condition of man in thinly populated countries where he who has the largest family is the greatest benefactor of his kind  25 the old french term la petite oie explains it better some trace of the

through the eesa country and the last two among the nole gallas who own the rule of waday a makad or chief of christian persuasion the hajj objected to this way on account of his recent bloodfeud with the rer guleni he preferred for me the more winding road which passes south along the coast through the eesa bedouins dependent upon zayla to the nearest hills and thence strikes southwestwards among the gudabirsi and girhi somal who extend within sight of harar i cannot but suspect that in selecting this route the good sharmarkay served another purpose besides my safety petty feuds between the chiefs had long closed the path and perhaps the somal were not unwilling that british cloth and tobacco should reopen it  early in the morning of the 27th of november 1854 the mules and all the paraphernalia of travel stood ready at the door the five camels were forced to kneel growling angrily the while by repeated jerks at the halter their forelegs were duly tied or stood upon till they

religious ablution he is accompanied by some men who carry a little stock of town goods and drive a camel colt which by the by they manage to lose before midnight  my other attendants must now be introduced to you as they are to be for the next two months companions of our journey  first in the list are the fair samaweda yusuf and aybla farih 4 buxom dames about thirty years old who presently secured the classical nicknames of shehrazade and deenarzade they look each like three average women rolled into one and emphatically belong to that race for which the article of feminine attire called i believe a bussle would be quite superfluous wonderful truly is their endurance of fatigue during the march they carry pipe and tobacco lead and flog the camels adjust the burdens and will never be induced to ride in sickness or in health at the halt they unload the cattle dispose the parcels in a semicircle pitch over them the gurgi or mat tent cook our food boil tea and coffee and make themselves generally useful they bivouack outside our abode modesty not permitting the sexes to mingle and in the severest cold wear no clothing but a head fillet and an old tobe they have curious soft voices which contrast agreeably with the harsh organs of the males at first they were ashamed to see me but that feeling soon wore off and presently they enlivened the way with pleasantries far more naive than refined to relieve their greatest fatigue nothing seems necessary but the jogsi 5 they lie at full length prone stand upon each others backs trampling and kneading with the toes and rise like giants much refreshed always attendant upon these dames is yusuf a zayla lad who being oneeyed was pitilessly named by my companions the kalendar he prays frequently is strict in his morals and has conceived like mrs brownrigg so exalted an idea of discipline that but for our influence he certainly would have beaten the two female prentices to death they hate him therefore and he knows it  immediately behind raghe and his party walk shehrazade and deenarzade the former leading the head camel the latter using my chibouque stick as a staff she has been at aden and sorely suspects me her little black eyes never meet mine and frequently with affected confusion she turns her sable cheek the clean contrary way strung together by their tails and soundly beaten when disposed to lag the five camels pace steadily along under their burdensbales of wilayati or american sheeting duwwarah or cutch canvass with indigodyed stuff slung along the animals sides and neatly sewn up in a case of matting to keep off dust and raina cows hide which serves as a couch covering the whole they carry a load of mushakkar bad mocha dates for the somal with a parcel of better quality for ourselves and a half hundredweight of coarse surat tobacco 6 besides which we have a box of beads and another of trinkets mosaicgold earrings necklaces watches and similar nicknacks our private provisions are represented by about 300 lbs of ricehere the travellers staff of lifea large pot full of kawurmeh 7 dates salt 8 clarified butter tea coffee sugar a box of biscuits in case of

proper tail in these regions where camels start if followed by a horse or mule an illfated sheep a parting present from the hajj races and frisks about the cafilah it became so tame that the somal received an order not to cut it one day however i found myself dining and that pet lamb was the menu  by the side of the camels ride my three attendants the pink of somali fashion their frizzled wigs are radiant with grease their tobes are splendidly white with borders dazzlingly red their new shields are covered with canvass cloth and their two spears poised over the right shoulder are freshly scraped oiled blackened and polished they have added my spare rifle and guns to the camelload such weapons are well enough at aden in somaliland men would deride the outlandish tool i told them that in my country women use bows and arrows moreover that lancers are generally considered a corps of noncombatants in vain they adhered as stronglyso mighty a thing is prejudiceto their partiality for bows arrows and lances their horsemanship is peculiar they balance themselves upon little abyssinian saddles extending the leg and raising the heel in the louis quinze style of equitation and the stirrup is an iron ring admitting only the big toe i follow them mounting a fine white mule which with its gaudily galonne arab pad and wrapper cloth has a certain dignity of look a doublebarrelled gun lies across my lap and a rude pair of holsters the work of hasan turki contains my colts six shooters  marching in this order which was to serve as a model we travelled due south along the coast over a hard stoneless and alluvial plain here dry there muddy where the tide reaches across boggy creeks broad watercourses and warty flats of black mould powdered with nitrous salt and bristling with the salsolaceous vegetation familiar to the arab voyager such is the general formation of the plain between the mountains and the sea whose breadth in a direct line may measure from fortyfive to fortyeight miles near the first zone of hills or subghauts it produces a thicker vegetation thorns and acacias of different kinds appear in clumps and ground broken with ridges and ravines announces the junction after the monsoon this plain is covered with rich grass at other seasons it affords but a scanty supply of an aqueous matter resembling bilgewater the land belongs to the mummasan clan of the eesa how these kurrahjog or sundwellers as the bedouins are called by the burgher somal can exist here in summer is a mystery my arms were peeled even in the month of december and my companions panting with the heat like the atlantes of herodotus poured forth reproaches upon the rising sun the townspeople when forced to hurry across it in the hotter season cover themselves during the day with tobes wetted every half hour in sea water yet they are sometimes killed by the fatal thirst which the simum engenders even the bedouins are now longing for rain a few weeks drought destroys half their herds  early in the afternoon our abban and a woman halted for a few minutes performed their ablutions and prayed with a certain display satisfied apparently with the result they never repeated the exercise about sunset we passed on the right clumps of trees overgrowing a water called warabod the hyenas well this is the first marhalah or haltingplace usually made by travellers to the interior hence there is a direct path leading southsouthwest by six short marches to the hills our abban however was determined that we should not so easily escape his kraal half an hour afterwards we passed by the second station hangagarri a well near the sea frequent lights twinkling through the darkening air informed us that we were in the midst of the eesa at 8 pm we reached gagab the third marhalah where the camels casting themselves upon the ground imperatively demanded a halt raghe was urgent for an advance declaring that already he could sight the watchfires of his rer or tribe 12 but the animals carried the point against him they were presently unloaded and turned out to graze and the lariats of the mules who are addicted to running away were fastened to stones for want of pegs 13 then lighting a fire we sat down to a homely supper of dates  the air was fresh and clear and the night breeze was delicious after the steamy breath of day the weary confinement of walls made the splendid expanse a luxury to the sight whilst the tumbling of the surf upon the near shore and the music of the jackal predisposed to sweet sleep we now felt that at length the die was cast placing my pistols by my side with my rifle butt for a pillow and its barrel as a bedfellow i sought repose with none of that apprehension which even the most stouthearted traveller knows before the start it is the difference between fancy and reality between anxiety and certainty to men gifted with any imaginative powers the anticipation must ever be worse than the event thus it happens that he who feels a thrill of fear before engaging in a peril exchanges it for a throb of exultation when he finds himself hand to hand with the danger  the end of time volunteered to keep watch that night when the early dawn glimmered he aroused us and blew up the smouldering fire whilst our women proceeded to load the camels we pursued our way over hard alluvial soil to sand and thence passed into a growth of stiff yellow grass not unlike a stubble in english september day broke upon a somali arcadia whose sole flaws were salt water and simum whistling shepherds 14 carried in their arms the younglings of the herds or spear in hand drove to pasture long regular lines of camels that waved their vulture like heads and arched their necks to bite in play their neighbours faces humps and hind thighs they were led by a patriarch to whose throat hung a kor or wooden bell the preventive for straggling and most of them were followed for winter is the breeding season by colts in every stage of infancy 15 patches of sheep with snowy skins and jetty faces flocked the yellow plain and herds of goats resembling deer were driven by hideclad children to the bush women in similar attire accompanied them some chewing the inner bark of trees others spinning yarns of a white creeper called sagsug for ropes and tentmats the boys carried shepherds crooks 16 and bore their watering pails 17 foolscap fashion upon their heads sometimes they led the ram around whose neck a cord of white leather was bound for luck at other times they frisked with the dog an animal by no means contemptible in the eyes of the bedouins 18 as they advanced the graceful little sand antelope bounded away over the bushes and above them soaring high in the cloudless skies were flights of vultures and huge percnopters unerring indicators of mans habitation in somaliland 19  a network of paths showed that we were approaching a populous place and presently men swarmed forth from their hiveshaped tents testifying their satisfaction at our arrival the hostile habr awal having threatened to eat them up we rode cautiously as is customary amongst the yeaning shecamels who are injured by a sudden start and about 8 am arrived at our guides kraal the fourth station called gudingaras or the low place where the garas tree grows the encampment lay southeast 165° of and about twenty miles from zayla  raghe disappeared and the bedouins flocked out to gaze upon us as we approached the kraal meanwhile shehrazade and deenarzade fetched tent sticks from the village disposed our luggage so as to form a wall rigged out a wigwam spread our beds in the shade and called aloud for sweet and sour milk i heard frequently muttered by the redheaded spearmen the ominous term faranj 20 and although there was no danger it was deemed advisable to make an impression without delay presently they began to deride our weapons the hammal requested them to put up one of their shields as a mark they laughed aloud but shirked compliance at last a large brown barenecked vulture settled on the ground at twenty paces distance the somal hate the gurgur because he kills the dying and devours the dead on the battlefield a bullet put through the birds body caused a cry of wonder and some ran after the lead as it span whistling over the ridge then loading with swanshot which these bedouins had never seen i knocked over a second vulture flying fresh screams followed the marvellous feat the women exclaimed lo he bringeth down the birds from heaven and one old man putting his forefinger in his mouth praised allah and prayed to be defended from such a calamity the effect was such that i determined always to carry a barrel loaded with shot as the best answer for all who might object to faranj  we spent our day in the hut after the normal manner with a crowd of woollyheaded bedouins squatting perseveringly opposite our quarters spear in hand with eyes fixed upon every gesture before noon the door mat was let downa precaution also adopted whenever box or package was openedwe drank milk and ate rice with a kitchen of kawurmah about midday the crowd retired to sleep my companions followed their example and i took the opportunity of sketching and jotting down notes 21 early in the afternoon the bedouins returned and resumed their mute form of pleading for tobacco each man as he received a handful rose slowly from his hams and went his way the senior who disliked the gun was importunate for a charm to cure his sick camel having obtained it he blessed us in a set speech which lasted at least half an hour and concluded with spitting upon the whole party for good luck 22 it is always well to encourage these nestors they are regarded with the greatest reverence by the tribes who believe that            old experience doth attain   to something like prophetic strain  and they can either do great good or cause much petty annoyance  in the evening i took my gun and accompanied by the end of time went out to search for venison the plain however was full of men and cattle and its hidden denizens had migrated during our walk we visited the tomb of an eesa brave it was about ten feet long heaped up with granite pebbles bits of black basalt and stones of calcareous lime two upright slabs denoted the position of the head and feet and upon these hung the deceaseds milkpails much the worse for sun and wind round the grave was a thin fence of thorns opposite the single narrow entrance were three blocks of stone planted in line and showing the number of enemies slain by the brave 23 beyond these trophies a thorn roofing supported by four bare poles served to shade the relatives when they meet to sit feast weep and pray  the bedouin funerals and tombs are equally simple they have no favourite cemeteries as in sindh and other moslem and pastoral lands men are buried where they die and the rarity of the graves scattered about the country excited my astonishment the corpse is soon interred these people like most barbarians have a horror of death and all that reminds them of it on several occasions i have been begged to throw away a hutstick that had been used to dig a grave the bier is a rude framework of poles bound with ropes of hide some tie up the body and plant it in a sitting posture to save themselves the trouble of excavating deep this perhaps may account for the circular tombs seen in many parts of the country usually the corpse is thrust into a long hole covered with wood and matting and heaped over with earth and thorns halfprotected by an oval mass of loose stones and abandoned to the jackals and hyenas  we halted a day at gudingaras wishing to see the migration of a tribe before dawn on the 30th november the somali stentor proclaimed from the ridgetop fetch your camelsload your goodswe march about 8 am we started in the rear the spectacle was novel to me some 150 spearmen assisted by their families were driving before them divisions which in total might amount to 200 cows 7000 camels and 11000 or 12000 sheep and goats only three wore the bal or feather which denotes the brave several however had the other decorationan ivory armlet 24 assisted by the boys whose heads were shaved in a cristated fashion truly ridiculous and large pariah dogs with bushy tails they drove the beasts and carried the colts belaboured runaway calves and held up the hind legs of struggling sheep the sick of whom there were manydysentery being at the time prevalentwere carried upon camels with their legs protruding in front from under the hidecover many of the dromedaries showed the habr awal brand 25 laden with hutting materials and domestic furniture they were led by the maidens the matrons followed bearing their progeny upon their backs bundled in the shoulderlappets of cloth or hide the smaller girls who in addition to the boys crest wore a circlet of curly hair round the head carried the weakling lambs and kids or aided their mammas in transporting the baby apparently in great fear of the all or commando the bedouins anxiously inquired if i had my fire with me 26 and begged us to take the post of honourthe van as our little party pricked forward the camels started in alarm and we were surprised to find that this tribe did not know the difference between horses and mules whenever the boys lost time in sport or quarrel they were threatened by their fathers with the jaws of that ogre the white stranger and the women exclaimed as they saw us approach here comes the old man who knows knowledge 27  having skirted the sea for two hours i rode off with the end of time to inspect the dihh silil 28 a fiumara which runs from the western hills northeastwards to the sea its course is marked by a long line of graceful tamarisks whose vivid green looked doubly bright set off by tawny stubble and amethystblue sky these freshets are the edens of adel the banks are charmingly wooded with acacias of many varieties some thorned like the fabled zakkum others parachuteshaped and planted in impenetrable thickets huge white creepers snakeshaped enclasp giant trees or connect with their cordage the higher boughs or depend like cables from the lower branches to the ground luxuriant parasites abound here they form domes of flashing green there they surround with verdure decayed trunks and not unfrequently cluster into sylvan bowers under whichgrateful sightappears succulent grass from the thinner thorns the bellshaped nests of the loxia depend waving in the breeze and the wood resounds with the cries of brightwinged choristers the torrentbeds are of the clearest and finest white sand glittering with goldcoloured mica and varied with nodules of clear and milky quartz red porphyry and granites of many hues sometimes the centre is occupied by an islet of torn trees and stones rolled in heaps supporting a clump of thick jujube or tall acacia whilst the lower parts of the beds are overgrown with long lines of lively green colocynth 29 here are usually the wells surrounded by heaps of thorns from which the leaves have been browsed off and dwarf sticks that support the waterhide when the flocks and herds are absent troops of gazelles may be seen daintily pacing the yielding surface snake trails streak the sand and at night the fiercer kind of animals lions leopards and elephants take their turn in somaliland the well is no place of social meeting no man lingers to chat near it no woman visits it and the traveller fears to pitch hut where torrents descend and where enemies human and bestial meet  we sat under a tree watching the tribe defile across the watercourse then remounting after a ride of two miles we reached a ground called kuranyali 30 upon which the wigwams of the nomads were already rising the parched and treeless stubble lies about eight miles from and 145° se of gudingaras both places are supplied by angagarri a well near the sea which is so distant that cattle to return before nightfall must start early in the morning  my attendants had pitched the gurgi or hut the hammal and long guled were however sulky on account of my absence and the kalendar appeared disposed to be mutinous the end of time who never lost an opportunity to make mischief whispered in my ear despise thy wife thy son and thy servant or they despise thee the old saw was not wanted however to procure for them a sound scolding nothing is worse for the eastern traveller than the habit of sending to coventryit does away with all manner of discipline  we halted that day at kuranyali preparing water and milk for two long marches over the desert to the hills being near the shore the air was cloudy although men prayed for a shower in vain about midday the pleasant seabreeze fanned our cheeks and the plain was thronged with tall pillars of white sand 31  the heat forbade egress and our wigwam was crowded with hungry visitors raghe urged thereto by his tribe became importunate now for tobacco then for rice now for dates then for provisions in general no wonder that the prophet made his paradise for the poor a mere place of eating and drinking the halffamished bedouins somal or arab think of nothing beyond the stomachtheir dreams know no higher vision of bliss than mere repletion a single article of diet milk or flesh palling upon mans palate they will greedily suck the stones of eaten dates yet abyssinian like they are squeamish and fastidious as regards food they despise the excellent fish with which nature has so plentifully stocked their seas 32 speak not to me with that mouth which eateth fish is a favourite insult amongst the bedouins if you touch a bird or a fowl of any description you will be despised even by the starving beggar you must not eat marrow or the flesh about the sheeps thighbone especially when travelling and the kidneys are called a womans dish none but the northern somal will touch the hares which abound in the country and many refuse the sand antelope and other kinds of game not asserting that the meat is unlawful but simply alleging a disgust those who chew coffee berries are careful not to place an even number in their mouths and camels milk is never heated for fear of bewitching the animal 33 the somali however differs in one point from his kinsman the arab the latter prides himself upon his temperance the former like the north american indian measures manhood by appetite a son of the somal is taught as soon as his teeth are cut to devour two pounds of the toughest mutton and ask for more if his powers of deglutition fail he is derided as degenerate  on the next day friday 1st dec we informed the abban that we intended starting early in the afternoon and therefore warned him to hold himself and his escort together with the water and milk necessary for our march in readiness he promised compliance and disappeared about 3 pm the bedouins armed as usual with spear and shield began to gather round the hut andnothing in this country can be done without that terrible palaverthe speechifying presently commenced raghe in a lengthy harangue hoped that the tribe would afford us all the necessary supplies and assist us in the arduous undertaking his words elicited no hear hearthere was an evident unwillingness on the part of the wild men to let us or rather our cloth and tobacco depart one remarked with surly emphasis that he had seen no good and eaten no bori 34 from that caravan why should he aid it when we asked the applauding hearers what they had done for us they rejoined by inquiring whose the land was another smitten by the fair shehrazades bulky charms had proposed matrimony and offered as dowry a milch camel she temporised not daring to return a positive refusal and the suitor betrayed a certain hibernian velleite to consider consent an unimportant part of the ceremony the mules had been sent to the well with orders to return before noon at 4 pm they were not visible i then left the hut and sitting on a cowshide in the sun ordered my men to begin loading despite the remonstrances of the abban and the interference of about fifty bedouins as we persisted they waxed surlier and declared that all which was ours became theirs to whom the land belonged we did not deny the claim but simply threatened sorcerydeath by wild beasts and foraging parties to their camels children and women this brought them to their senses the usual effect of such threats and presently arose the senior who had spat upon us for lucks sake with his toothless jaws he mumbled a vehement speech and warned the tribe that it was not good to detain such strangers they lent ready ears to the words of nestor saying let us obey him he is near his end the mules arrived but when i looked for the escort none was forthcoming at zayla it was agreed that twenty men should protect us across the desert which is the very passage of plunder now however five or six paupers offered to accompany us for a few miles we politely declined troubling them but insisted upon the attendance of our abban and three of his kindred as some of the bedouins still opposed us our aged friend once more arose and by copious abuse finally silenced them we took leave of him with many thanks and handfuls of tobacco in return for which he blessed us with fervour then mounting our mules we set out followed for at least a mile by a long tail of howling boys who ignorant of clothing except a string of white beads round the neck but armed with dwarf spears bows and arrows showed all the impudence of baboons they derided the end of times equitation till i feared a scenesailorlike he prided himself upon graceful horsemanship and the imps were touching his tenderest point  hitherto for the abbans convenience we had skirted the sea far out of the direct road now we were to strike southwestwards into the interior at 6 p m we started across a goban 35 which eternal summer gilds with a dull ochreish yellow towards a thin blue strip of hill on the far horizon the somal have no superstitious dread of night and its horrors like arabs and abyssinians our abban however showed a wholesome mundane fear of plundering parties scorpions and snakes 36 i had been careful to fasten round my ankles the twists of black wool called by the arabs zaal 37 and universally used in yemen a stock of garlic and opium here held to be specifics fortified the courage of the party whose fears were not wholly ideal for in the course of the night shehrazade nearly trod upon a viper  at first the plain was a network of holes the habitations of the jir ad 38 a field rat with ruddy back and white belly the mullah or parson a smoothskinned lizard and the dabagalla a ground squirrel with a brilliant and glossy coat as it became dark arose a cheerful moon exciting the howlings of the hyenas the barkings of their attendant jackals 39 and the chattered oaths of the hidinhitu bird 40 dotted here and there over the misty landscape appeared dark clumps of a tree called kullan a thorn with an edible berry not unlike the jujube and banks of silvery mist veiled the far horizon from the sight  we marched rapidly and in silence stopping every quarter of an hour to raise the camels loads as they slipped on one side i had now an opportunity of seeing how feeble a race is the somal my companions on the line of march wondered at my being able to carry a gun they could scarcely support even whilst riding the weight of their spears and preferred sitting upon them to spare their shoulders at times they were obliged to walk because the saddles cut them then they remounted because their legs were tired briefly an english boy of fourteen would have shown more bottom than the sturdiest this cannot arise from poor diet for the citizens who live generously are yet weaker than the bedouins it is a peculiarity of race when fatigued they become reckless and impatient of thirst on this occasion though want of water stared us in the face one skin of the three was allowed to fall upon the road and burst and the seconds contents were drunk before we halted  at 11 pm after marching twelve miles in direct line we bivouacked upon the plain the night breeze from the hills had set in and my attendants chattered with cold long guled in particular became stiff as a mummy raghe was clamorous against a fire which might betray our whereabouts in the bush inn but after such a march the pipe was a necessity and the point was carried against him  after a sound sleep under the moon we rose at 5 am and loaded the camels it was a raw morning a large nimbus rising from the east obscured the sun the line of blue sea was raised like a ridge by refraction and the hills towards which we were journeying now showed distinct falls and folds troops of dera or gazelles herding like goats stood stared at us turned their white tails faced away broke into a long trot and bounded over the plain as we approached a few ostriches appeared but they were too shy even for bullet 41 at 8 pm we crossed one of the numerous drains which intersect this desertbiya hablod or the girls water a fiumara running from southwest to east and northeast although dry it abounded in the marer a tree bearing yellowish red berries full of viscous juice like green gumedible but not niceand the brighter vegetation showed that water was near the surface about two hours afterwards as the sun became oppressive we unloaded in a watercourse called by my companions adad or the acacia gum 42 the distance was about twentyfive miles and the direction s w 225° of kuranyali  we spread our couches of cowhide in the midst of a green mass of tamarisk under a tall kud tree a brightleaved thorn with balls of golden gum clinging to its boughs dry berries scattered in its shade and armies of ants marching to and from its trunk all slept upon the soft white sand with arms under their hands for our spoor across the desert was now unmistakeable at midday rice was boiled for us by the indefatigable women and at 3 pm we resumed our march towards the hills which had exchanged their shadowy blue for a coat of pronounced brown journeying onwards we reached the barragid fiumara and presently exchanged the plain for rolling ground covered with the remains of an extinct race and probably alluded to by el makrizi when he records that the moslems of adel had erected throughout the country a vast number of mosques and oratories for friday and festival prayers places of worship appeared in the shape of parallelograms unhewed stones piled upon the ground with a semicircular niche in the direction of meccah the tombs different from the heaped form now in fashion closely resembled the older erections in the island of saad el din near zaylaoblong slabs planted deep in the soil we also observed frequent hollow rings of rough blocks circles measuring about a cubit in diameter i had not time to excavate them and the end of time could only inform me that they belonged to the awwalin or olden inhabitants  at 7 pm as evening was closing in we came upon the fresh trail of a large habr awal cavalcade the celebrated footprint seen by robinson crusoe affected him not more powerfully than did this daaseh my companions the voice of song suddenly became mute the women drove the camels hurriedly and all huddled together except raghe who kept well to the front ready for a run whistling with anger i asked my attendants what had slain them the end of time in a hollow voice replied verily 0 pilgrim whoso seeth the track seeth the foe and he quoted in tones of terror those dreary lines    man is but a handful of dust   and life is a violent storm  we certainly were a small party to contend against 200 horsemennine men and two women moreover all except the hammal and long guled would infallibly have fled at the first charge  presently we sighted the trails of sheep and goats showing the proximity of a village their freshness was ascertained by my companions after an eager scrutiny in the moons bright beams about half an hour afterwards rough ravines with sharp and thorny descents warned us that we had exchanged the dangerous plain for a place of safety where horsemen rarely venture raghe not admiring the open hurried us onward in hope of reaching some kraal at 8 pm however seeing the poor women lamed with thorns and the camels casting themselves upon the ground i resolved to halt despite all objections we lighted a fire finished our store of bad milkthe water had long ago been exhaustedand lay down in the cold clear air covering ourselves with hides and holding our weapons  at 6 am we resumed our ride over rough stony ground the thorns tearing our feet and naked legs and the camels slipping over the rounded waste of drift pebbles the bedouins with ears applied to the earth listened for a village but heard none suddenly we saw two strangers and presently we came upon an eesa kraal it was situated in a deep ravine called damal backed by a broad and hollow fiumara at the foot of the hills running from west to east and surrounded by lofty trees upon which brown kites black vultures and percnopters like flakes of snow were mewing we had marched over a winding path about eleven miles from and in a southwest direction 205° of adad painful thoughts suggested themselves in consequence of wandering southwards only six had been taken off thirty stages by the labours of seven days  as usual in eastern africa we did not enter the kraal uninvited but unloosed and pitched the wigwam under a tree outside presently the elders appeared bringing with soft speeches sweet water new milk fat sheep and goats for which they demanded a tobe of cutch canvass we passed with them a quiet luxurious day of coffee and pipes fresh cream and roasted mutton after the plainheats we enjoyed the cool breeze of the hills the cloudy sky and the verdure of the glades made doubly green by comparison with the parched stubbles below  the eesa here mixed with the gudabirsi have little power we found them poor and proportionally importunate the men wildlooking as open mouths staring eyes and tangled hair could make them gazed with extreme eagerness upon my scarlet blanket for very shame they did not beg it but the inviting texture was pulled and fingered by the greasy multitude we closed the hut whenever a valuable was produced but eager eyes peeped through every cranny till the end of time ejaculated praised be allah 43 and quoted the arab saying show not the somal thy door and if he find it block it up the women and children were clad in chocolate coloured hides fringed at the tops to gratify them i shot a few hawks and was rewarded with loud exclamationsallah preserve thy handmay thy skill never fail thee before the foe  a crone seeing me smoke inquired if the fire did not burn i handed my pipe which nearly choked her and she ran away from a steaming kettle thinking it a weapon as my companions observed there was not a miskal of sense in a maund of heads yet the people looked upon my sunburnt skin with a favour they denied to the limewhite face  i was anxious to proceed in the afternoon but raghe had arrived at the frontier of his tribe he had blood to settle amongst the gudabirsi and without a protector he could not enter their lands at night we slept armed on account of the lions that infest the hills and our huts were surrounded with a thorn fencea precaution here first adopted and never afterwards neglected early on the morning of the 4th of december heavy clouds rolled down from the mountains and a scotch mist deepened into a shower our new abban had not arrived and the hutmats saturated with rain had become too heavy for the camels to carry  in the forenoon the eesa kraal loading their asses 44 set out towards the plain this migration presented no new features except that several sick and decrepid were barbarously left behind for lions and hyaenas to devour 45 to deceive warhawks who might be on the lookout the migrators set fire to logs of wood and masses of sheeps earth which even in rain will smoke and smoulder for weeks  about midday arrived the two gudabirsi who intended escorting us to the village of our abbans the elder rirash was a blackskinned wild looking fellow with a shock head of hair and a deep scowl which belied his good temper and warm heart the other was a dunfaced youth betrothed to raghes daughter they both belonged to the mahadasan clan and commenced operations by an obstinate attempt to lead us far out of our way eastwards the pretext was the defenceless state of their flocks and herds the real reason an itching for cloth and tobacco we resisted manfully this time nerved by the memory of wasted days and despite their declarations of absi 46 we determined upon making westward for the hills  at 2 pm the caravan started along the fiumara course in rear of the deserted kraal and after an hours ascent rirash informed us that a well was near the hammal and i taking two water skins urged our mules over stones and thorny ground presently we arrived at a rocky ravine where surrounded by brambles rude walls and tough frame works lay the wells three or four holes sunk ten feet deep in the limestone whilst we bathed in the sulphureous spring which at once discolored my silver ring rirash baling up the water in his shield filled the bags and bound them to the saddles in haste we rejoined the caravan which we found about sunset halted by the vain fears of the guides the ridge upon which they stood was a mass of old mosques and groves showing that in former days a thick population tenanted these hills from the summit appeared distant herds of kine and white flocks scattered like patches of mountain quartz riding in advance we traversed the stony ridge fell into another ravine and soon saw signs of human life a shepherd descried us from afar and ran away reckless of property causing the end of time to roll his head with dignity and to ejaculate of a truth said the prophet of allah fear is divided presently we fell in with a village from which the people rushed out some exclaiming lo let us look at the kings others come see the white man he is governor of zayla i objected to such dignity principally on account of its price my companions however were inexorable they would be salatinkingsand my colour was against claims to low degree this fairness and the arab dress made me at different times the ruler of aden the chief of zayla the hajjs son a boy an old woman a man painted white a warrior in silver armour a merchant a pilgrim a hedgepriest ahmed the indian a turk an egyptian a frenchman a banyan a sherif and lastly a calamity sent down from heaven to weary out the lives of the somal every kraal had some conjecture of its own and each fresh theory was received by my companions with roars of laughter  as the gudabirsi pursued us with shouts for tobacco and cries of wonder i dispersed them with a gunshot the women and children fled precipitately from the horrid sound and the men covering their heads with their shields threw themselves face foremost upon the ground pursuing the fiumara course we passed a number of kraals whose inhabitants were equally vociferous out of one came a zayla man who informed us that the gudabirsi abbans to whom we bore sharmarkays letter of introduction were encamped within three days march it was reported however that a quarrel had broken out between them and the gerad adan their brotherin law no pleasant newsin africa under such circumstances  it is customary for friends to detain and for foes to oppose the traveller we rode stoutly on till the air darkened and the moon tipped the distant hill peaks with a dim mysterious light i then called a halt we unloaded on the banks of the darkaynlay fiumara so called from a tree which contains a fiery milk fenced ourselves intaking care to avoid being trampled upon by startled camels during our sleep by securing them in a separate but neighbouring inclosurespread our couches ate our frugal suppers and lost no time in falling asleep we had travelled five hours that day but the path was winding and our progress in a straight line was at most eight miles  and now dear l being about to quit the land of the eesa i will sketch the tribe  the eesa probably the most powerful branch of the somali nation extends northwards to the wayma family of the dankali southwards to the gudabirsi and midway between zayla and berberah eastwards it is bounded by the sea and westwards by the gallas around harar it derives itself from dirr and aydur without however knowing aught beyond the ancestral names and is twitted with paganism by its enemies this tribe said to number 100000 shields is divided into numerous clans 47 these again split up into minor septs 48 which plunder and sometimes murder one another in time of peace  a fierce and turbulent race of republicans the eesa own nominal allegiance to a ugaz or chief residing in the hadagali hills he is generally called roblayprince rainythe name or rather title being one of good omen for a drought here like a dinner in europe justifies the change of a dynasty every kraal has its oddai shaikh or head man after whose name the settlement as in sindh and other pastoral lands is called he is obeyed only when his orders suit the taste of king demos is always superior to his fellows in wealth of cattle sometimes in talent and eloquence and in deliberations he is assisted by the wail or akill the peetzocouncil of southern africaelders obeyed on account of their age despite however this apparatus of rule the bedouins have lost none of the characteristics recorded in the periplus they are still uncivilised and under no restraint every freeborn man holds himself equal to his ruler and allows no royalties or prerogatives to abridge his birthright of liberty 49 yet i have observed that with all their passion for independence the somal when subject to strict rule as at zayla and harar are both apt to discipline and subservient to command  in character the eesa are childish and docile cunning and deficient in judgment kind and fickle goodhumoured and irascible warmhearted and infamous for cruelty and treachery even the protector will slay his protege and citizens married to eesa girls send their wives to buy goats and sheep from but will not trust themselves amongst their connexions traitorous as an eesa is a proverb at zayla where the people tell you that these bedouins with the left hand offer a bowl of milk and stab with the right conscience i may observe does not exist in eastern africa and repentance expresses regret for missed opportunities of mortal crime robbery constitutes an honorable man murderthe more atrocious the midnight crime the bettermakes the hero honor consists in taking human life hyaenalike the bedouins cannot be trusted where blood may be shed glory is the having done all manner of harm yet the eesa have their good points they are not noted liars and will rarely perjure themselves they look down upon petty pilfering without violence and they are generous and hospitable compared with the other somal personally i had no reason to complain of them they were importunate beggars but a pinch of snuff or a handful of tobacco always made us friends they begged me to settle amongst them they offered me sundry wives andthe somali bedouin unlike the arab readily affiliates strangers to his tribethey declared that after a few days residence i should become one of themselves  in appearance the eesa are distinguished from other somal by blackness ugliness of feature and premature baldness of the temples they also shave or rather scrape off with their daggers the hair high up the nape of the neck the locks are dyed dun frizzled and greased the widads or learned men remove them and none but paupers leave them in their natural state the mustachios are clipped close the straggling whisker is carefully plucked and the pileerroneously considered impureis removed either by vellication or by passing the limbs through the fire the eyes of the bedouins also are less prominent than those of the citizens the brow projects in penthouse fashion and the organ exposed to bright light and accustomed to gaze at distant objects acquires more concentration and power i have seen amongst them handsome profiles and some of the girls have fine figures with piquant if not pretty features  flocks and herds form the true wealth of the eesa according to them sheep and goats are of silver and the cow of gold they compare camels to the rock and believe like most moslems the horse to have been created from the wind their diet depends upon the season in hot weather when forage and milk dry up the flocks are slaughtered and supply excellent mutton during the monsoon men become fat by drinking all day long the produce of their cattle in the latter article of diet the eesa are delicate and curious they prefer cows milk then the goats and lastly the ewes which the arab loves best the first is drunk fresh and the two latter clotted whilst the camels is slightly soured the townspeople use camels milk medicinally according to the bedouins he who lives on this beverage and eats the meat for fortyfour consecutive days acquires the animals strength it has perhaps less body than any other milk and is deliciously sweet shortly after foaling presently it loses flavour and nothing can be more nauseous than the produce of an old camel the somal have a name for creamlabenbut they make no use of the article churning it with the rest of the milk they have no buffaloes shudder at the tartar idea of maresmilk like the arabs hold the name labban 50 a disgrace and make it a point of honor not to draw supplies from their cattle during the day  the life led by these wild people is necessarily monotonous they rest but littlefrom 11 pm till dawnand never sleep in the bush for fear of plundering parties few begin the day with prayer as moslems should for the most part they apply themselves to counting and milking their cattle the animals all of which have names 51 come when called to the pail and supply the family with a morning meal then the warriors grasping their spears and sometimes the young women armed only with staves drive their herds to pasture the matrons and children spinning or ropemaking tend the flocks and the kraal is abandoned to the very young the old and the sick the herdsmen wander about watching the cattle and tasting nothing but the pure element or a pinch of coarse tobacco sometimes they play at shahh shantarah and other games of which they are passionately fond with a board formed of lines traced in the sand and bits of dry wood or camels earth acting pieces they spend hour after hour every lookeron vociferating his opinion and catching at the men till apparently the two players are those least interested in the game or to drive off sleep they sit whistling to their flocks or they perform upon the forimo a reed pipe generally made at harar which has a plaintive sound uncommonly pleasing 52 in the evening the kraal again resounds with lowing and bleating the camels milk is all drunk the cows and goats reserved for butter and ghee which the women prepare the numbers are once more counted and the animals are carefully penned up for the night this simple life is varied by an occasional birth and marriage dance and foray disease and murder their maladies are few and simple 53 death generally comes by the spear and the bedouin is naturally longlived i have seen macrobians hale and strong preserving their powers and faculties in spite of eighty and ninety years   footnotes  1 by this route the mukattib or courier travels on foot from zayla to harar in five days at the most the somal reckon their journeys by the gedi or march the arab hamleh which varies from four to five hours they begin before dawn and halt at about 11 am the time of the morning meal when a second march is made they load at 3 pm and advance till dark thus fifteen miles would be the average of fast travelling in places of danger they will cover twentysix or twentyseven miles of ground without halting to eat or rest nothing less however than regard for dear life can engender such activity generally two or three hours work per diem is considered sufficient and where provisions abound halts are long and frequent  2 the mikahil is a clan of the habr awal tribe living near berberah and celebrated for their bloodthirsty and butchering propensities many of the midgan or serviles a term explained in chap ii are domesticated amongst them  3 so the abyssinian chief informed m krapf that he loved the french but could not endure ussimply the effect of manner  4 the first is the name of the individual the second is that of her father  5 this delicate operation is called by the arabs daasah whence the dosch ceremony at cairo it is used over most parts of the eastern world as a remedy for sickness and fatigue and is generally preferred to takbis or dugmo the common style of shampooing which say many easterns loosens the skin  6 the somal from habit enjoy no other variety they even showed disgust at my latakia tobacco is grown in some places by the gudabirsi and other tribes bat it is rare and bad without this article it would be impossible to progress in east africa every man asks for a handful and many will not return milk for what they expect to receive as a gift their importunity reminds the traveller of the galloway beggars some generations agothey are for the most part great chewers of tobacco and are so addicted to it that they will ask for a piece thereof from a stranger as he is riding on his way and therefore let not a traveller want an ounce or two of roll tobacco in his pocket and for an inch or two thereof he need not fear the want of a guide by day or night  7 flesh boiled in large slices sundried broken to pieces and fried in ghee  8 the bahr assal or salt lake near tajurrah annually sends into the interior thousands of little matted parcels containing this necessary inland the bedouins will rub a piece upon the tongue before eating or pass about a lump as the dutch did with sugar in the last war at harar a donkeyload is the price of a slave and the abyssinians say of a millionaire he eateth salt  9 the element found upon the maritime plain is salt or brackish there is nothing concerning which the african traveller should be so particular as water bitter with nitre and full of organic matter it causes all those dysenteric diseases which have made research in this part of the world a upas tree to the discoverer pocket filters are invaluable the water of wells should be boiled and passed through charcoal and even then it might be mixed to a good purpose with a few drops of proof spirit the somal generally carry their store in large wickerwork pails i preferred skins as more portable and less likely to taint the water  10 here as in arabia boxes should be avoided the bedouins always believe them to contain treasures day after day i have been obliged to display the contents to crowds of savages who amused themselves by lifting up the case with loud cries of hoo hoo hoo the popular exclamation of astonishment and by speculating upon the probable amount of dollars contained therein  11 the following list of my expenses may perhaps be useful to future travellers it must be observed that had the whole outfit been purchased at aden a considerable saving would have resulted                                                            cos rs   passage money from aden to zayla

sideline their horses and mules with stout stiff leathern thongs provided with loops and wooden buttons we found them upon the whole safer than lariats or tethers  14 arabs hate el sifr or whistling which they hold to be the chit chat of the jinns some say that the musicians mouth is not to be purified for forty days others that satan touching a mans person causes him to produce the offensive sound the hejazis objected to burckhardt that he could not help talking to devils and walking about the room like an unquiet spirit the somali has no such prejudice like the kafir of the cape he passes his day whistling to his flocks and herds moreover he makes signals by changing the note and is skilful in imitating the song of birds  15 in this country camels foal either in the gugi monsoon or during the cold season immediately after the autumnal rains  16 the shepherds staff is a straight stick about six feet long with a crook at one end and at the other a fork to act as a rake  17 these utensils will be described in a future chapter  18 the settled somal have a holy horror of dogs and wahhabilike treat mans faithful slave most cruelly the wild people are more humane they pay two ewes for a good colley and demand a twoyearold sheep as diyat or bloodmoney for the animal if killed  19 vultures and percnopters lie upon the wing waiting for the garbage of the kraals consequently they are rare near the cowvillages where animals are not often killed  20 they apply this term to all but themselves an indian trader who had travelled to harar complained to me that he had always been called a frank by the bedouins in consequence of his wearing shalwar or drawers  21 generally it is not dangerous to write before these bedouins as they only suspect accountkeeping and none but the educated recognise a sketch the traveller however must be on his guard in the remotest villages he will meet somal who have returned to savage life after visiting the seaboard arabia and possibly india or egypt  22 i have often observed this ceremony performed upon a new turban or other article of attire possibly it may be intended as a mark of contempt assumed to blind the evil eye  23 such is the general form of the somali grave sometimes two stumps of wood take the place of the upright stones at the head and foot and around one grave i counted twenty trophies  24 some braves wear above the right elbow an ivory armlet called fol or aj in the south this denotes the elephantslayer other eesa clans assert their warriorhood by small disks of white stone fashioned like rings and fitted upon the little finger of the left hand others bind a bit of red cloth round the brow  25 it is sufficient for a bedouin to look at the general appearance of an animal he at once recognises the breed each clan however in this part of eastern africa has its own mark  26 they found no better word than fire to denote my gun  27 oddai an old man corresponds with the arab shaykh in etymology the somal however give the name to men of all ages after marriage  28 the dihh is the arab wadya fiumara or freshet webbe obbay abbai c is a large river durdur a running stream  29 i saw these dihhs only in the dry season at times the torrent must be violent cutting ten or twelve feet deep into the plain  30 the name is derived from kuranyo an ant it means the place of ants and is so called from the abundance of a tree which attracts them  31 the arabs call these pillars devils the somal sigo  32 the cape kafirs have the same prejudice against fish comparing its flesh to that of serpents in some points their squeamishness resembles that of the somal he for instance who tastes the rhinoceros simus is at once dubbed om fogazan or outcast  33 this superstition may have arisen from the peculiarity that the camels milk however fresh if placed upon the fire breaks like some cows milk  34 bori in southern arabia popularly means a waterpipe here it is used for tobacco  35 goban is the low maritime plain lying below the bor or ghauts and opposed to ogu the tableland above ban is an elevated grassy prairie where few trees grow dir a small jungle called haija by the arabs and khain is a forest or thick bush bor is a mountain rock or hill a stony precipice is called jar and the high clay banks of a ravine gebi  36 snakes are rare in the cities but abound in the wilds of eastern africa and are dangerous to night travellers though seldom seen by day to kill a serpent is considered by the bedouins almost as meritorious as to slay an infidel the somal have many names for the reptile tribe the subhanyo a kind of whipsnake and a large yellow rock snake called got are little feared the abesi in arabic el hayyehthe cobra is so venomous that it kills the camel the mas or hanash and a long black snake called jilbis are considered equally dangerous serpents are in somaliland the subject of many superstitions one horn of the cerastes for instance contains a deadly poison the other pounded and drawn across the eye makes man a seer and reveals to him the treasures of the earth there is a flying snake which hoards precious stones and is attended by a hundred guards a somali horseman once it is said carried away a jewel he was pursued by a reptile army and although he escaped to his tribe the importunity of the former proprietors was so great that the plunder was eventually restored to them centipedes are little feared their venom leads to inconveniences more ridiculous than dangerous scorpions especially the large yellow variety are formidable in hot weather i can speak of the sting from experience the first symptom is a sensation of nausea and the pain shoots up after a few minutes to the groin causing a swelling accompanied by burning and throbbing which last about twelve hours the somal bandage above the wound and wait patiently till the effect subsides  37 these are tightened in case of accident and act as superior ligatures i should however advise every traveller in these regions to provide himself with a pneumatic pump and not to place his trust in zaal garlic or opium  38 the grey rat is called by the somal baradublay in eastern africa it is a minor plague after india and arabia where neglecting to sleep in boots i have sometimes been lamed for a week by their venomous bites  39 in this country the jackal attends not upon the lion but the waraba his morning cry is taken as an omen of good or evil according to the note  40 of this bird a red and longlegged plover the somal tell the following legend originally her diet was meat and her society birds of prey one night however her companions having devoured all the provisions whilst she slept she swore never to fly with friends never to eat flesh and never to rest during the hours of darkness when she sees anything in the dark she repeat her oaths and according to the somal keeps careful watch all night there is a larger variety of this bird which purblind daring daytime rises from under the travellers feet with loud cries the somal have superstitions similar to that above noticed about several kinds of birds when the cry of the galu so called from his note gal gal come in come in is heard over a kraal the people say let us leave this place the galu hath spoken at night they listen for the fin also an illomened bird when a man declares the fin did not sleep last night it is considered advisable to shift ground  41 throughout this country ostriches are exceedingly wild the rev mr erhardt of the mombas mission informs me that they are equally so farther south the somal stalk them during the day with camels and kill them with poisoned arrows it is said that about 3 pm the birds leave their feeding places and traverse long distances to roost the people assert that they are blind at night and rise up under the pursuers feet  42 several acacias afford gums which the bedouins eat greedily to strengthen themselves the towns people declare that the food produces nothing but flatulence  43 subhan allah an exclamation of pettishness or displeasure  44 the hills not abounding in camels like the maritime regions asses become the principal means of transport  45 this barbarous practice is generally carried out in cases of small pox where contagion is feared  46 feardanger it is a word which haunts the traveller in somaliland  47 the somali tol or tul corresponds with the arabic kabilah a tribe under it is the kola or jilib ar fakhizah a clan gob is synonymous with the arabic kabail men of family opposed to gum the casteless in the following pages i shall speak of the somali nation the eesa tribe the rer musa clan and the rer galan sept though by no means sure that such verbal gradation is generally recognised  48 the eesa for instance are divided into    1 rer wardik the royal clan    6 rer hurroni   2 rer abdullah                   7 rer urwena   3 rer musa                       8 rer furlabah   4 rer mummasan                   9 rer gada   5 rer guleni                    10 rer ali addah  these are again subdivided the rer musa numbering half the eesa split up for instance into    1 rer galan                      4 rer dubbah   2 rer harlah                     5 rer kul   3 rer gadishah                   6 rer gedi  49 traces of this turbulent equality may be found amongst the slavish kafirs in general meetings of the tribe on the occasion of harvest home when the chief who at other times destroys hundreds by a gesture is abused and treated with contempt by the youngest warrior  50 milkseller  51 for instance anfarr the spotted tarren wheatflour c c  52 it is used by the northern people the abyssinians gallas adail eesa and gudabirsi the southern somal ignore it  53 the most dangerous disease is smallpox which history traces to eastern abyssinia where it still becomes at times a violent epidemic sweeping off its thousands the patient if a man of note is placed upon the sand and fed with rice or millet bread till he recovers or dies the chickenpox kills many infants they are treated by bathing in the fresh blood of a sheep covered with the skin and exposed to the sun smoke and glare dirt and flies cold winds and naked extremities cause ophthalmia especially in the hills this disease rarely blinds any save the citizens and no remedy is known dysentery is cured by rice and sour milk patients also drink clarified cows butter and in bad cases the stomach is cauterized fire and disease according to the somal never coexisting haemorroids when dry are reduced by a stick used as a bougie and allowed to remain in loco all night sometimes the part affected is cupped with a horn and knife or a leech performs excision the diet is camels or goats flesh and milk clarified butter and bussorab datesrice and mutton are carefully avoided for a certain local disease they use senna or colocynth anoint the body with sulphur boiled in ghee and expose it to the sun or they leave the patient all night in the dewabstinence and perspiration generally effect a cure for the minor form the afflicted drink the melted fat of a sheeps tail consumption is a family complaint and therefore considered incurable to use the somali expression they address the patient with allah have mercy upon thee not with allah cure thee  there are leeches who have secret simples for curing wounds generally the blood is squeezed out the place is washed with water the lips are sewn up and a dressing of astringent leaves is applied they have splints for fractures and they can reduce dislocations a medical friend at aden partially dislocated his knee which halfadozen of the faculty insisted upon treating as a sprain of all his tortures none was more severe than that inflicted by my somali visitors they would look at him distinguish the complaint ask him how long he had been invalided and hearing the replyfour monthswould break into exclamations of wonder in our country they cried when a man falls two pull his body and two his legs then they tie sticks round it give him plenty of camels milk and he is well in a month a speech which made friend s groan in spirit  firing and clarified butter are the farriers panaceas camels are cured by sheeps head broth asses by chopping one ear mules by cutting off the tail and horses by ghee or a drench of melted fat     chap vi  from the zayla hills to the marar prairie   i have now dear l quitted the maritime plain or first zone to enter the ghauts that threshold of the ethiopian highlands which beginning at tajurrah sweeps in semicircle round the bay of zayla and falls about berberah into the range of mountains which fringes the bold somali coast this chain has been inhabited within historys memory by three distinct racesthe gallas the ancient moslems of adel and by the modern somal as usual however in the east it has no general vernacular name 1  the aspect of these ghauts is picturesque the primitive base consists of micaceous granite with veins of porphyry and dykes of the purest white quartz above lie strata of sandstone and lime here dun there yellow or of a dull grey often curiously contorted and washed clear of vegetable soil by the heavy monsoon on these heights which are mostly conoid with rounded tops joined by ridges and saddlebacks various kinds of acacia cast a pallid and sickly green like the olive tree upon the hills of provence they are barren in the cold season and the nomads migrate to the plains when the monsoon covers them with rich pastures the people revisit their deserted kraals the kloofs or ravines are the most remarkable features of this country in some places the sides rise perpendicularly like gigantic walls the breadth varying from one hundred yards to half a mile in others cliffs and scaurs sapped at their foundations encumber the bed and not unfrequently a broad band of white sand stretches between two fringes of emerald green delightful to look upon after the bare and ghastly basalt of southern arabia the jujube grows to a height already betraying signs of african luxuriance through its foliage flit birds gaudycoloured as kingfishers of vivid red yellow and changinggreen i remarked a longtailed jay called gobiyan or fat 2 russethued ringdoves the modest honeybird corn quails canarycoloured finches sparrows gay as those of surinam hummingbirds with a plume of metallic lustre and especially a whiteeyed kind of maina called by the somal shimbir load or the cowbird the armocreeper 3 with large fleshy leaves pale green red or crimson and clusters of bright berries like purple grapes forms a conspicuous ornament in the valleys there is a great variety of the cactus tribe some growing to the height of thirty and thirtyfive feet of these one was particularly pointed out to me the vulgar somal call it guraato the more learned shajarat el zakkum it is the mandrake of these regions and the round excrescences upon the summits of its fleshy arms are supposed to resemble mens heads and faces on tuesday the 5th december we arose at 6 am after a night so dewy that our clothes were drenched and we began to ascend the wady darkaynlay which winds from east to south after an hours march appeared a small cairn of rough stones called siyaro or mazar 4 to which each person in token of honor added his quotum the abban opined that auliya or holy men had sat there but the end of time more sagaciously conjectured that it was the site of some galla idol or superstitious rite presently we came upon the hills of the white ant 5 a characteristic feature in this part of africa here the land has the appearance of a turkish cemetery on a grand scale there it seems like a city in ruins in some places the pillars are truncated into a resemblance to beehives in others they cluster together suggesting the idea of a portico whilst many of them veiled by trees and overrun with gay creepers look like the remains of sylvan altars generally the hills are conical and vary in height from four to twelve feet they are counted by hundreds and the somal account for the number by declaring that the insects abandon their home when dry and commence building another the older erections are worn away by wind and rain to a thin tapering spire and are frequently hollowed and arched beneath by rats and ground squirrels the substance fine yellow mud glued by the secretions of the ant is hard to break it is pierced sievelike by a network of tiny shafts i saw these hills for the first time in the wady darkaynlay in the interior they are larger and longer than near the maritime regions  we travelled up the fiumara in a southerly direction till 8 am when the guides led us away from the bed they anticipated meeting gudabirsis pallid with fear they also trembled with cold and hunger anxious consultations were held one man alisurnamed doso because he did nothing but eat drink and stand over the firedetermined to leave us as however he had received a tobe for pay we put a veto upon that proceeding after a march of two hours over ground so winding that we had not covered more than three miles our guides halted under a tree near a deserted kraal at a place called el armo the armocreeper water or more facetiously dabadalashay from damal it bore s w 190° one of our bedouins mounting a mule rode forward to gather intelligence and bring back a skin full of water i asked the end of time what they expected to hear he replied with the proverb news liveth the somali bedouins have a passion for knowing how the world wags in some of the more desert regions the whole population of a village will follow the wanderer no traveller ever passes a kraal without planting spear in the ground and demanding answers to a lengthened string of queries rather than miss intelligence he will inquire of a woman thus it is that news flies through the country among the wild gudabirsi the russian war was a topic of interest and at harar i heard of a violent storm which had damaged the shipping in bombay harbour but a few weeks after the event  the bedouin returned with an empty skin but a full budget i will offer you dear l a specimen of the palaver 6 which is supposed to prove the aphorism that all barbarians are orators demosthenes leisurely dismounts advances stands for a moment crossleggedthe favourite posture in this regionsupporting each hand with a spear planted in the ground thence he slips to squat looks around ejects saliva shifts his quid to behind his ear places his weapons before him takes up a bit of stick and traces lines which he carefully smooths awayit being ill omened to mark the earth the listeners sit gravely in a semicircle upon their heels with their spears from whose bright heads flashes a ring of troubled light planted upright and look stedfastly on his countenance over the upper edges of their shields with eyes apparently planted like those of the blemmyes in their breasts when the moment for delivery is come the head man inquires what is the news the informant would communicate the important fact that he has been to the well he proceeds as follows noting emphasis by raising his voice at times about six notes and often violently striking at the ground in front  it is good news if allah please  wa siddaeven so respond the listeners intoning or rather groaning the response  i mounted mule this morning  even so  i departed from ye riding  even so  there with a scream and pointing out the direction with a stick  even so  there i went  even so  i threaded the wood  even so  i traversed the sands  even so  i feared nothing  even so  at last i came upon cattle tracks  hoo hoo hoo an ominous pause follows this exclamation of astonishment  they were fresh  even so  so were the earths  even so  i distinguished the feet of women  even so  but there were no camels  even so  at last i saw sticks  even so  stones  even so  water  even so  a well  then follows the palaver wherein as occasionally happens further west he distinguishes himself who can rivet the attention of the audience for at least an hour without saying anything in particular the advantage of their circumlocution however is that by considering a subject in every possible light and phase as regards its cause and effect antecedents actualities and consequences they are prepared for any emergency which without the palaver might come upon them unawares  although the thermometer showed summer heat the air was cloudy and raw blasts poured down from the mountains at half past 3 pm our camels were lazily loaded and we followed the course of the fiumara which runs to the w and s w after half an hours progress we arrived at the gully in which are the wells and the guides halted because they descried halfa dozen youths and boys bathing and washing their tobes all cattle as well as men were sadly thirsty many of us had been chewing pebbles during the morning yet afraid of demands for tobacco the bedouins would have pursued the march without water had i not forced them to halt we found three holes in the sand one was dry a second foul and the third contained a scanty supply of the pure element from twenty to twentyfive feet below the surface a youth stood in the water and filled a wicker pail which he tossed to a companion perched against the side half way up the latter in his turn hove it to a third who catching it at the brink threw the contents by this time half wasted into the skin cattle trough we halted about half an hour to refresh man and beast and then resumed our way up the wady quitting it where a short cut avoids the frequent windings of the bed this operation saved but little time the ground was stony the rough ascents fatigued the camels and our legs and feet were lacerated by the spearlike thorns here the ground was overgrown with aloes 7 sometimes six feet high with pink and pale pomona green leaves bending in the line of beauty towards the ground graceful in form as the capitals of corinthian columns and crowned with gaycoloured bells but barbarously supplied with woody thorns and strong serrated edges there the hig an aloetic plant with a point so hard and sharp that horses cannot cross ground where it grows stood in bunches like the largest and stiffest of rushes 8 senna sprang spontaneously on the banks and the gigantic ushr or asclepias shed its bloom upon the stones and pebbles of the bed my attendants occupied themselves with gathering the edible pod of an acacia called kura 9 whilst i observed the view frequent anthills gave an appearance of habitation to a desert still covered with the mosques and tombs of old adel and the shape of the country had gradually changed basins and broad slopes now replacing the thickly crowded conoid peaks of the lower regions  as the sun sank towards the west long guled complained bitterly of the raw breeze from the hills we passed many villages distinguished by the barking of dogs and the bleating of flocks on their way to the field the unhappy raghe however who had now become our protege would neither venture into a settlement nor bivouac amongst the lions he hurried us forwards till we arrived at a hollow called gud the hole which supplied us with the protection of a deserted kraal where our camels halfstarved and knockedup by an eight miles march were speedily unloaded whilst pitching the tent we were visited by some gudabirsi who attempted to seize our abban alleging that he owed them a cow we replied doughtily that he was under our sandals as they continued to speak in a high tone a pistol was discharged over their heads after which they cringed like dogs a blazing fire a warm supper dry beds broad jests and funny stories soon restored the flagging spirits of our party towards night the moon dispersed the thick mists which gathering into clouds threatened rain and the cold sensibly diminished there was little dew and we should have slept comfortably had not our hungry mules hobbled as they were hopped about the kraal and fought till dawn  on the 6th december we arose late to avoid the cold morning air and at 7 am set out over rough ground hoping to ascend the ghauts that day after creeping about two miles the camels unable to proceed threw themselves upon the earth and we unwillingly called a halt at jiyaf a basin below the dobo 10 fiumara here white flocks dotting the hills and the scavengers of the air warned us that we were in the vicinity of villages our wigwam was soon full of fairfaced gudabirsi mostly loajira 11 or cowherd boys who according to the custom of their class wore their tobes bound scarflike round their necks they begged us to visit their village and offered a heifer for each lion shot on mount libahlay unhappily we could not afford time these youths were followed by men and women bringing milk sheep and goats for which grass being rare they asked exorbitant priceseighteen cubits of cutch canvass for a lamb and two of blue cotton for a bottle of ghee amongst them was the first really pretty face seen by me in the somali country the head was well formed and gracefully placed upon a long thin neck and narrow shoulders the hair brow and nose were unexceptionable there was an arch look in the eyes of jet and pearl and a suspicion of african protuberance about the lips which gave the countenance an exceeding naivete her skin was a warm rich nutbrown an especial charm in these regions and her movements had that grace which suggests perfect symmetry of limb the poor girls costume a coif for the back hair a cloth imperfectly covering the bosom and a petticoat of hides made no great mystery of forms equally rude were her ornaments an armlet and pewter earrings the work of some blacksmith a necklace of white porcelain beads and sundry talismans in cases of tarnished and blackened leather as a tribute to her prettiness i gave her some cloth tobacco and a bit of salt which was rapidly becoming valuable her husband stood by and although the preference was marked he displayed neither anger nor jealousy she showed her gratitude by bringing us milk and by assisting us to start next morning in the evening we hired three fresh camels 12 to carry our goods up the ascent and killed some antelopes which in a stew were not contemptible the end of time insisted upon firing a gun to frighten away the lions who make night hideous with their growls but never put in an appearance  the morning cold greatly increased and we did not start till 8 am after half an hours march up the bed of a fiumara leading apparently to a cul de sac of lofty rocks in the hills we quitted it for a rude zigzag winding along its left side amongst bushes thorn trees and huge rocks the walls of the opposite bank were strikingly perpendicular in some places stratified in others solid and polished by the course of stream and cascade the principal material was a granite so coarse that the composing mica quartz and felspar separated into detached pieces as large as a mans thumb micaceous grit which glittered in the sunbeams and various sandstones abounded the road caused us some trouble the camels loads were always slipping from their mats i found it necessary to dismount from my mule and sitting down we were stung by the large black ants which infest these hills 13  about half way up we passed two cairns and added to them our mite like good somal after two hours of hard work the summit of this primitive pass was attained and sixty minutes more saw us on the plateau above the hillsthe second zone of east africa behind us lay the plains of which we vainly sought a view the broken ground at the foot of the mountains is broad and mists veiled the reeking expanse of the low country 14 the plateau in front of us was a wide extent of rolling ground rising slightly towards the west its colour was brown with a threadbare coat of verdure and at the bottom of each rugged slope ran a stony watercourse trending from southwest to northeast the mass of tangled aloes ragged thorn and primlooking poison trees 15 must once have been populous tombs and houses of the early moslems covered with ruins the hills and ridges  about noon we arrived at a spot called the kafirs grave it is a square enceinte of rude stones about one hundred yards each side and legends say that one misr a galla chief when dying ordered the place to be filled seven times with shecamels destined for his ahan or funeral feast this is the fourth stage upon the direct road from zayla to harar we had wasted ten days and the want of grass and water made us anxious about our animals the camels could scarcely walk and my mules spine rose high beneath the arab padsuch are the effects of jilal 16 the worst of travelling seasons in eastern africa  at 1 pm we unloaded under a sycamore tree called after a galla chieftain 17 halimalah and giving its name to the surrounding valley this ancient of the forest is more than half decayed several huge limbs lie stretched upon the ground whence for reverence no one removes them upon the trunk or rather trunks for its bifurcates are marks deeply cut by a former race and time has hollowed in the larger stem an arbour capable of containing halfadozen men this holy tree was according to the somal a place of prayer for the infidel and its ancient honors are not departed here probably to commemorate the westward progress of the tribe the gudabirsi ugaz or chief has the white canvass turban bound about his brows and hence rides forth to witness the equestrian games in the harawwah valley as everyone who passes by visits the halimalah tree foraging parties of the northern eesa and the jibril abokr a clan of the habr awal frequently meet and the traveller wends his way in fear and trembling  the thermometer showed an altitude of 3350 feet under the trees cool shade the climate reminded me of southern italy in winter i found a buttercup and heard a woodpecker 18 tapping on the hollow trunk a reminiscence of english glades the abban and his men urged an advance in the afternoon but my health had suffered from the bad water of the coast and the camels were faint with fatigue we therefore dismissed the hired beasts carried our property into a deserted kraal and lighting a fire prepared to make all snug for the night the bedouins chattering with cold stood closer to the comfortable blaze than ever did pater familias in england they smoked their faces toasted their hands broiled their backs with intense enjoyment and waved their legs to and fro through the flame to singe away the pile which at this season grows long the end of time who was surly compared them to demons and quoted the arabs sayingallah never bless smooth man or hairy woman on the 8th of december at 8 am we travelled slowly up the halimalah valley whose clayey surface glistened with mica and quartz pebbles from the hills all the trees are thorny except the sycamore and the asclepias the gub or jujube grows luxuriantly in thickets its dried wood is used by women to fumigate their hair 19 the kedi a tree like the porcupineall spikessupplies the bedouins with hatchethandles i was shown the abol with its edible gum and a kind of acacia here called galol its bark dyes cloth a dull red and the thorn issues from a bulb which when young and soft is eaten by the somal when old it becomes woody and hard as a nut at 9 am we crossed the lesser abbaso a fiumara with high banks of stiff clay and filled with large rolled stones issuing from it we traversed a thorny path over ascending ground between higher hills and covered with large boulders and steplike layers of grit here appeared several gudabirsi tombs heaps of stones or pebbles surrounded by a fence of thorns or an enceinte of loose blocks in the latter slabs are used to make such houses as children would build in play to denote the number of establishments left by the deceased the new grave is known by the conical milkpails surmounting the stick at the head of the corpse upon the neighbouring tree is thrown the mat which bore the dead man to his last home and hard by are the blackened stones upon which his funeral feast was cooked at 11 am we reached the greater abbaso a fiumara about 100 yards wide fringed with lovely verdure and full of the antelope called gurnuk its watershed was as usual in this region from west and southwest to east and northeast about noon we halted having travelled eight miles from the holy tree  at half past three reloading we followed the course of the abbaso valley the most beautiful spot we had yet seen the presence of mankind however was denoted by the cut branches of thorn encumbering the bed we remarked too the tracks of lions pursued by hunters and the frequent streaks of serpents sometimes five inches in diameter towards evening our party closed up in fear thinking that they saw spears glancing through the trees i treated their alarm lightly but the next day proved that it was not wholly imaginary at sunset we met a shepherd who swore upon the stone 20 to bring us milk in exchange for tobacco and presently after a five miles march we halted in a deserted kraal on the left bank of a fiumara clouds gathered black upon the hill tops and a comfortless blast threatening rain warned us not to delay pitching the gurgi a large fire was lighted and several guns were discharged to frighten away the lions that infest this place twice during the night our camels started up and rushed round their thorn ring in alarm                                       late in the morning of saturday the 9th december i set out accompanied by rirash and the end of time to visit some ruins a little way distant from the direct road after an hours ride we turned away from the abbaso fiumara and entered a basin among the hills distant about sixteen miles from the holy tree this is the site of darbiyah kolakolas fortso called from its galla queen it is said that this city and its neighbour aububah fought like certain cats in kilkenny till both were eaten up the gudabirsi fix the event at the period when their forefathers still inhabited bulhar on the coastabout 300 years ago if the date be correct the substantial ruins have fought a stern fight with time remnants of houses cumber the soil and the carefully built wells are filled with rubbish the palace was pointed out to me with its walls of stone and clay intersected by layers of woodwork the mosque is a large roofless building containing twelve square pillars of rude masonry and the mihrab or prayer niche is denoted by a circular arch of tolerable construction but the voice of the muezzin is hushed for ever and creepers now twine around the ruined fane the scene was still and dreary as the grave for a mile and a half in length all was ruinsruinsruins  leaving this dead city we rode towards the southwest between two rugged hills of which the loftiest summit is called wanauli as usual they are rich in thorns the tall wadi affords a gum useful to clothdyers and the leaves of the lofty wumba are considered after the daumpalm the best material for mats on the ground appeared the blue flowers of the man or himbah a shrub resembling a potatoe it bears a gay yellow apple full of brown seeds which is not eaten by the somal my companions made me taste some of the karir berries which in color and flavor resemble red currants the leaves are used as a dressing to ulcers topping the ridge we stood for a few minutes to observe the view before us beneath our feet lay a long grassy plainthe sight must have gladdened the hearts of our starving mulesand for the first time in africa horses appeared grazing free amongst the bushes a little further off lay the aylonda valley studded with graves and dark with verdure beyond it stretched the wady harawwah a long gloomy hollow in the general level the background was a bold sweep of blue hill the second gradient of the harar line and on its summit closing the western horizon lay a golden streakthe marar prairie already i felt at the end of my journey about noon reaching a kraal whence but that morning our gudabirsi abbans had driven off their kine we sat under a tree and with a pistol reported arrival presently the elders came out and welcomed their old acquaintance the end of time as a distinguished guest he eagerly inquired about the reported quarrel between the abbans and their brotherinlaw the gerad adan when assured that it was the offspring of somali imagination he rolled his head and with dignity remarked what man shutteth to us that allah openeth we complimented each other gravely upon the purity of our intentionsamongst moslems a condition of successand not despising second causes lost no time in sending a horseman for the abbans presently some warriors came out and inquired if we were of the caravan that was travelling last evening up a valley with laden camels on our answering in the affirmative they laughingly declared that a commando of twelve horsemen had followed us with the intention of a shamattack this is favourite sport with the bedouin when however the traveller shows fright the feint is apt to turn out a fact on one occasion a party of arab merchants not understanding the fun of the thing shot two somal the tribe had the justice to acquit the strangers mulcting them however a few yards of cloth for the families of the deceased in reply i fired a pistol unexpectedly over the heads of my new hosts and improved the occasion of their terror by deprecating any practical facetiousness in future  we passed the day under a tree the camels escorted by my two attendants and the women did not arrive till sunset having occupied about eight hours in marching as many miles fearing lions we pitched inside the kraal despite crying children scolding wives cattle rushing about barking dogs flies and ticks filth and confinement  i will now attempt a description of a village in eastern africa  the rer or kraal 21 is a line of scattered huts on plains where thorns are rare beast of prey scarce and raids not expected in the hills it is surrounded by a strong fence to prevent cattle straying this where danger induces caution is doubled and trebled yet the lion will sometimes break through it and the leopard clears it prey in mouth with a bound the abattis has usually four entrances which are choked up with heaps of bushes at night the interior space is partitioned off by dwarf hedges into rings which contain and separate the different species of cattle sometimes there is an outer compartment adjoining the exterior fence set apart for the camels usually they are placed in the centre of the kraal horses being most valuable are sidelined and tethered close to the owners hut and rude bowers of brush and fire wood protect the weaklings of the flocks from the heat of the sun and the inclement night breeze  at intervals around and inside the outer abattis are built the gurgi or wigwamshemispheric huts like old beehives about five feet high by six in diameter they are even smaller in the warm regions but they increase in size as the elevation of the country renders climate less genial the material is a framework of digo or sticks bent and hardened in the fire to build the hut these are planted in the ground tied together with cords and covered with mats of two different kinds the aus composed of small bundles of grass neatly joined is hard and smooth the kibid has a long pile and is used as couch as well as roof the single entrance in front is provided with one of these articles which serves as a curtain hides are spread upon the top during the monsoon and little heaps of earth are sometimes raised outside to keep out wind and rain  the furniture is simple as the building three stones and a hole form the fireplace near which sleep the children kids and lambs there being no chimney the interior is black with soot the cowskin couches are suspended during the day like arms and other articles which suffer from rats and white ants by loops of cord to the sides the principal ornaments are basketwork bottles gaily adorned with beads cowris and stained leather pottery being here unknown the bedouins twist the fibres of a root into various shapes and make them watertight with the powdered bark of another tree 22 the han is a large wickerwork bucket mounted in a framework of sticks and used to contain water on journeys the guraf a word derived from the arabic ghurfah is a conicalshaped vessel used to bale out the contents of a well the del or milk pail is shaped like two cones joined at the base by lateral thongs the upper and smaller half acting as cup and cover and finally the wesi or water bottle contains the travellers store for drinking and religious ablution  when the kraal is to be removed the huts and furniture are placed upon the camels and the hedges and earth are sometimes set on fire to purify the place and deceive enemies throughout the country black circles of cinders or thorn diversify the hill sides and show an extensive population travellers always seek deserted kraals for security of encampment as they swarm with vermin by night and flies by day 23 i frequently made strong objections to these favourite localities the utmost conceded to me was a fresh enclosure added by a smaller hedge to the outside abattis of the more populous cowkraals  on the 10th december we halted the bad water the noonday sun of 107° and the cold mornings51° being the averagehad seriously affected my health all the population flocked to see me darkening the hut with nodding wigs and staring faces andthe gudabirsi are polite knaves apologised for the intrusion men women and children appeared in crowds bringing milk and ghee meat and water several of the elders remembered having seen me at berberah 24 and the bleareyed maidens who were in no wise shy insisted upon admiring the white stranger  feeling somewhat restored by repose i started the next day with a tail on to inspect the ruins of aububah after a rough ride over stony ground we arrived at a grassy hollow near a line of hills and dismounted to visit the shaykh aububahs remains he rests under a little conical dome of brick clay and wood similar in construction to that of zayla it is falling to pieces and the adjoining mosque long roofless is overgrown with trees that rustle melancholy sounds in the light joyous breeze creeping in by a dwarf door or rather hole my gudabirsi guides showed me a bright object forming the key of the arch as it shone they suspected silver and the end of time whispered a sacrilegious plan for purloining it inside the vault were three graves apparently empty and upon the dark sunken floor lay several rounded stones resembling cannon balls and used as weights by the more civilised somal thence we proceeded to the battle field a broad sheet of sandstone apparently dinted by the hoofs of mules and horses on this ground which according to my guides was in olden days soft and yielding took place the great action between aububah and darbiyah kola a second mosque was found with walls in tolerable repair but like the rest of the place roofless long guled ascended the broken staircase of a small square minaret and delivered a most ignorant and bedouinlike azan or call to prayer passing by the shells of houses we concluded our mornings work with a visit to the large graveyard apparently it did not contain the bones of moslems long lines of stones pointed westward and one tomb was covered with a coating of hard mortar in whose sculptured edge my benighted friends detected magical inscriptions i heard of another city called ahammed in the neighbouring hills but did not visit it these are all remains of galla settlements which the ignorance and exaggeration of the somal fill with writings and splendid edifices  returning home we found that our gudabirsi bedouins had at length obeyed the summons the six sons of a noted chief ali addah or white ali by three different mothers beuh igah khayri nur ismail and yunis all advanced towards me as i dismounted gave the hand of friendship and welcomed me to their homes with the exception of the firstnamed a hard featured man at least forty years old the brothers were goodlooking youths with clear brown skins regular features and graceful figures they entered the gurgi when invited but refused to eat saying that they came for honor not for food the hajj sharmarkays introductory letter was read aloud to their extreme delight and at their solicitation i perused it a second and a third time then having dismissed with sundry small presents the two abbans raghe and rirash i wrote a flattering account of them to the hajj and entrusted it to certain citizens who were returning in caravan zaylawards after a commercial tour in the interior  before they departed there was a feast after the homeric fashion a sheep was cut disembowelled dismembered tossed into one of our huge caldrons and devoured within the hour the almost live food 25 was washed down with huge draughts of milk the feasters resembled wordsworths cows forty feeding like one in the left hand they held the meat to their teeth and cut off the slice in possession with long daggers perilously close were their noses longer and their mouths less obtrusive during the dinner i escaped from the place of flies and retired to a favourite tree here the end of time seeing me still in pain insisted upon trying a somali medicine he cut two pieces of dry wood scooped a hole in the shorter and sharpened the longer applied point to socket which he sprinkled with a little sand placed his foot upon the female stick and rubbed the other between his palms till smoke and char appeared he then cauterized my stomach vigorously in six different places quoting a tradition the end of physic is fire  on tuesday the 12th december i vainly requested the two sons of white ali who had constituted themselves our guides to mount their horses they feared to fatigue the valuable animals at a season when grass is rare and dry i was disappointed by seeing the boasted faras 26 of the somal in the shape of ponies hardly thirteen hands high the head is pretty the eyes are well opened and the ears are small the form also is good but the original arab breed has degenerated in the new climate they are soft docile andlike all other animals in this part of the world timid the habit of climbing rocks makes them surefooted and they show the remains of blood when forced to fatigue the gudabirsi will seldom sell these horses the great safeguard against their conterminous tribes the eesa and girhi who are all infantry a village seldom contains more than six or eight and the lowest value would be ten cows or twenty tobes 27 careful of his beast when at rest the somali bedouin in the saddle is rough and cruel whatever beauty the animal may possess in youth completely disappears before the fifth year and few are without spavin or sprained backsinews in some parts of the country 28 to ride violently to your hut two or three times before finally dismounting is considered a great compliment and the same ceremony is observed on leaving springing into the saddle if he has one with the aid of his spear the somali cavalier first endeavours to infuse a little spirit into his halfstarved hack by persuading him to accomplish a few plunges and capers then his heels raining a hurricane of blows against the animals ribs and occasionally using his spearpoint as a spur away he gallops and after a short circuit in which he endeavours to show himself to the best advantage returns to his starting point at full speed when the heavy arab bit brings up the blown horse with a shock that half breaks his jaw and fills his mouth with blood the affection of the true arab for his horse is proverbial the cruelty of the somal to his may i think be considered equally so the bedouins practise horseracing and run for bets which are contested with ardor on solemn occasions they have rude equestrian games in which they display themselves and their animals the gudabirsi and indeed most of the somal sit loosely upon their horses their saddle is a demipique a highbacked wooden frame like the egyptian fellahs two light splinters leave a clear space for the spine and the tree is tightly bound with wet thongs a sheepskin shabracque is loosely spread over it and the dwarf iron stirrup admits only the big toe as these people fear a stirrup which if the horse fall would entangle the foot their bits are cruelly severe a solid iron ring as in the arab bridle embracing the lower jaw takes the place of a curb chain some of the headstalls made at berberah are prettily made of cut leather and bright steel ornaments like diminutive quoits the whip is a hard hide handle plated with zinc and armed with a single short broad thong  with the two sons of white ali and the end of time at 8 am on the 12th december i rode forward leaving the jaded camels in charge of my companions and the women we crossed the plain in a southwesterly direction and after traversing rolling ground we came to a ridge which commanded an extensive view behind lay the wanauli hills already purple in the distance on our left was a mass of cones each dignified by its own name no one it is said can ascend them which probably means that it would be a fatiguing walk here are the visitationplaces of three celebrated saints amud sau and shaykh sharlagamadi or the hidden from evil to the northwest i was shown some blue peaks tenanted by the eesa somal in front backed by the dark hills of harar lay the harawwah valley the breadth is about fifteen miles it runs from southwest to northeast between the highlands of the girhi and the rolling ground of the gudabirsi somal as far it is said as the dankali country of old this luxuriant waste belonged to the former tribe about twelve years ago it was taken from them by the gudabirsi who carried off at the same time thirty cows forty camels and between three and four hundred sheep and goats  large herds tended by spearmen and grazing about the bush warned us that we were approaching the kraal in which the sons of white ali were camped at halfpast 10 am after riding eight miles we reached the place which occupies the lower slope of the northern hills that enclose the harawwah valley we spread our hides under a tree and were soon surrounded by bedouins who brought milk sundried beef ghee and honey in one of the painted wooden bowls exported from cutch after breakfast at which the end of time distinguished himself by dipping his meat into honey we went out gun in hand towards the bush it swarmed with sandantelope and gurnuk the groundsquirrels haunted every anthill hoopoos and spur fowls paced among the thickets in the trees we heard the frequent cry of the gobiyan and the bird facetiously termed from its cry dobodogon guswen and the brightcoloured hawk the abodi or bakiyyah 29 lay on wing high in the cloudless air  when tired of killing we returned to our cowhides and sat in conversation with the bedouins they boasted of the skill with which they used the shield and seemed not to understand the efficiency of a sword parry to illustrate the novel idea i gave a stick to the best man provided myself in the same way and allowed him to cut at me after repeated failures he received a sounding blow upon the least bony portion of his person the crowd laughed long and loud and the pretending knightatarms retired in confusion  darkness fell but no caravan appeared it had been delayed by a runaway muleperhaps by the desire to restrain my vagrant propensitiesand did not arrive till midnight my hosts cleared a gurgi for our reception brought us milk and extended their hospitality to the full limits of even savage complaisance  expecting to march on the 13th december soon after dawn i summoned beuh and his brethren to the hut reminding him that the hajj had promised me an escort without delay to the village of the gerad adan to my instances they replied that although they were most anxious to oblige the arrival of mudeh the eldest son rendered a consultation necessary and retiring to the woods sat in palaver from 8 am to past noon at last they came to a resolution which could not be shaken they would not trust one of their number in the gerads country a horseman however should carry a letter inviting the girhi chief to visit his brothersinlaw i was assured that adan would not drink water before mounting to meet us but fear is reciprocal there was evidently bad blood between them and already a knowledge of somali customs caused me to suspect the result of our mission however a letter was written reminding the gerad of the word spoken under the tree and containing in case of recusance a threat to cut off the salt well at which his cows are periodically driven to drink then came the bargain for safe conduct after much haggling especially on the part of the handsome igah they agreed to receive twenty tobes three bundles of tobacco and fourteen cubits of indigodyed cotton in addition to this i offered as a bribe one of my handsome abyssinian shirts with a fine silk fringe made at aden to be received by the man beuh on the day of entering the gerads village  i arose early in the next morning having been promised by the abbans grand sport in the harawwah valley the somal had already divided the elephants spoils they were to claim the heros feather i was to receive two thirds of the ivorynothing remained to be done but the killing after sundry pretences and prayers for delay beuh saddled his hack the hammal mounted one mule a stouthearted bedouin called fahi took a second and we started to find the herds the end of time lagged in the rear the reflection that a mule cannot outrun an elephant made him look so ineffably miserable that i sent him back to the kraal dost thou believe me to be a coward 0 pilgrim thereupon exclaimed the mullah waxing bold in the very joy of his heart of a truth i do was my reply nothing abashed he hammered his mule with heel and departed ejaculating what hath man but a single life and he who throweth it away what is he but a fool then we advanced with cocked guns beuh singing boanerges like the song of the elephant  in the somali country as amongst the kafirs after murdering a man or boy the death of an elephant is considered the act of heroism most tribes wear for it the hairfeather and the ivory bracelet some hunters like the bushmen of the cape 30 kill the titan of the forests with barbed darts carrying wabapoison the general way of hunting resembles that of the abyssinian agageers described by bruce one man mounts a white pony and galloping before the elephant induces him as he readily does firearms being unknownto charge and chivy the rider directs his course along and close to some bush where a comrade is concealed and the latter as the animal passes at speed cuts the back sinew of the hind leg where in the human subject the tendon achilles would be with a sharp broad and heavy knife 31 this wound at first occasions little inconvenience presently the elephant fancying it is supposed that a thorn has stuck in his foot stamps violently and rubs the scratch till the sinew is fairly divided the animal thus disabled is left to perish wretchedly of hunger and thirst the tail as amongst the kafirs is cut off to serve as trophy and the ivories are removed when loosened by decomposition in this part of africa the elephant is never tamed 32  for six hours we rode the breadth of the harawwah valley it was covered with wild vegetation and surfacedrains that carry off the surplus of the hills enclosing it in some places the torrent beds had cut twenty feet into the soil the banks were fringed with milkbush and asclepias the armocreeper a variety of thorns and especially the yellowberried jujube here numberless birds followed brightwinged butterflies and the shaykhs of the blind as the people call the black fly settled in swarms upon our hands and faces as we rode by the higher ground was overgrown with a kind of cactus which here becomes a tree forming shady avenues its quadrangular fleshy branches of emerald green sometimes forty feet high support upon their summits large round bunches of a bright crimson berry when the plantation is close domes of extreme beauty appear scattered over the surface of the country this hassadin abounds in burning milk and the somal look downwards when passing under its branches the elephant is said to love it and in many places the trees were torn to pieces by hungry trunks the nearest approaches to game were the last years earths likely places however shady trees and green thorns near water were by no means uncommon when we reached the valleys southern wall beuh informed us that we might ride all day if we pleased with the same result at zayla i had been informed that elephants are thick as sand in harawwah even the gudabirsi when at a distance declared that they fed there like sheep and after our failure swore that they killed thirty but last year the animals were probably in the high harirah valley and would be driven downwards by the cold at a later period some future gordon cumming may therefore succeed where the hajj abdullah notably failed  on the 15th december i persuaded the valiant beuh with his two brothers and his bluff cousin fahi to cross the valley with us after recovering a mule which had strayed five miles back to the well and composing sundry quarrels between shehrazade whose swains had detained her from camel loading and the kalendar whose one eye flashed with indignation at her conduct we set out in a southerly direction an hours march brought us to an open space surrounded by thin thorn forest in the centre is an ancient grave about which are performed the equestrian games when the turban of the ugaz has been bound under the holy tree shepherds issued from the bush to stare at us as we passed and stretched forth the hand for bori the maidens tripped forwards exclaiming come girls let us look at this prodigy and they never withheld an answer if civilly addressed many of them were grown up and not a few were old maids the result of the tribes isolation for here as in somaliland generally the union of cousins is abhorred the ground of the valley is a stiff clay sprinkled with pebbles of primitive formation the hills are mere rocks and the torrent banks with strata of small stones showed a watermark varying from ten to fifteen feet in height in these fiumaras we saw frequent traces of the edlergame deer and hog at 1 pm our camels and mules were watered at wells in a broad wady called jannahgaban or the little garden its course i was told lies northwards through the harawwah valley to the odla and waruf two depressions in the wayma country near tajurrah about half an hour afterwards we arrived at a deserted sheepfold distant six miles from our last station after unloading we repaired to a neighbouring well and found the water so hard that it raised lumps like nettle stings in the bathers skin the only remedy for the evil is an unguent of oil or butter a precaution which should never be neglected by the african traveller at first the sensation of grease annoys after a few days it is forgotten and at last the pat of butter is expected as pleasantly as the pipe or the cup of coffee it prevents the skin from chaps and sores obviates the evil effects of heat cold and wet and neutralises the proteuslike malaria poison the somal never fail to anoint themselves when they can afford ghee and the bedouin is at the summit of his bliss when sitting in the blazing sun orheat acts upon these people as upon serpentswith his back opposite a roaring fire he is being smeared rubbed and kneaded by a companion  my guides fearing lions and hyenas would pass the night inside a foul sheepfold i was not without difficulty persuaded to join them at eight next morning we set out through an uninteresting thornbush towards one of those tetes or isolated hills which form admirable benchmarks in the somali country koralay a terra corresponding with our saddleback exactly describes its shape pommel and crupper in the shape of two huge granite boulders were all complete and between them was a depression for a seat as day advanced the temperature changed from 50° to a maximum of 121° after marching about five miles we halted in a broad watercourse called gallajab the plentiful water there we bathed and dined on an excellent camel which had broken its leg by falling from a bank  resuming our march at 5 pm we travelled over ascending ground which must be most fertile after rain formerly it belonged to the girhi and the gudabirsi boasted loudly of their conquest after an hours march we reached the base of koralay upon whose lower slopes appeared a pair of the antelopes called alakud 33 they are tame easily shot and eagerly eaten by the bedouins another hour of slow travelling brought us to a broad fiumara with high banks of stiff clay thickly wooded and showing a watermark eighteen feet above the sand the guides named these wells agjogsi probably a generic term signifying that water is standing close by crossing the fiumara we ascended a hill and found upon the summit a large kraal alive with heads of kine the inhabitants flocked out to stare at us and the women uttered cries of wonder i advanced towards the prettiest and fired my rifle by way of salute over her head the people delighted exclaimed mod modhonor to theeand we replied with shouts of kullibanmay heaven aid ye 34 at 5 pm after five miles march the camels were unloaded in a deserted kraal whose high fence denoted danger of wild beasts the cowherds bade us beware of lions but a day before a girl had been dragged out of her hut and moslem burial could be given to only one of her legs a bedouin named uddao whom we hired as mulekeeper was ordered to spend the night singing and as is customary with somali watchmen to address and answer himself dialoguewise with a different voice in order to persuade thieves that several men are on the alert he was a spectacle of wildness as he sat before the blazing fire his joy by day his companion and protector in the shades the only step made by him in advance of his brethren the cynocephali  we were detained four days at agjogsi by the nonappearance of the gerad adan this delay gave me an opportunity of ascending to the summit of koralay the saddleback which lay about a mile north of our encampment as we threaded the rocks and hollows of the side we came upon dens strewed with cows bones and proving by a fresh taint that the tenants had lately quitted them in this country the lion is seldom seen unless surprised asleep in his lair of thicket during my journey although at times the roaring was heard all night i saw but one the people have a superstition that the king of beasts will not attack a single traveller because such a person they say slew the mother of all the lions except in darkness or during violent storms which excite the fiercer carnivors he is a timid animal much less feared by the people than the angry and agile leopard unable to run with rapidity when pressed by hunger he pursues a party of travellers stealthily as a cat and arrived within distance springs strikes down the hindermost and carries him away to the bush  from the summit of koralay we had a fair view of the surrounding country at least forty kraals many of them deserted lay within the range of sight on all sides except the northwest and southeast was a mass of sombre rock and granite hill the course of the valleys between the several ranges was denoted by a lively green and the plains scattered in patches over the landscape shone with dull yellow the effect of clay and stubble whilst a light mist encased the prospect in a circlet of blue and silver here the end of time conceived the jocose idea of crowning me king of the country with loud cries of buh buh buh he showered leaves of a gum tree and a little water from a prayer bottle over my head and then with all solemnity bound on the turban 35 it is perhaps fortunate that this facetiousness was not witnessed a crowd of bedouins assembled below the hill suspecting as usual some magical practices and had they known the truth our journey might have ended abruptly descending i found porcupines quills in abundance 36 and shot a rock pigeon called elal jogthe dweller at wells at the foot a baune or hyrax abyssinicus resembling the coney of palestine 37 was observed at its favourite pastime of sunning itself upon the rocks  on the evening of the 20th december the mounted messenger returned after a six hours hard ride bringing back unopened the letter addressed by me to the gerad and a private message from their sister to the sons of white ali advising them not to advance ensued terrible palavers it appeared that the gerad was upon the point of mounting horse when his subjects swore him to remain and settle a dispute with the amir of harar our abbans however withdrew their hired camels positively refuse to accompany us and beuh privily informed the end of time that i had acquired through the land the evil reputation of killing everything from an elephant to a bird in the air one of the younger brethren indeed declared that we were forerunners of good and that if the gerad harmed a hair of our heads he would slaughter every girhi under the sun we had however learned properly to appreciate such vaunts and the end of time drily answered that their sayings were honey but their doings myrrh being a lowcaste and a shameless tribe they did not reply to our reproaches at last a manoeuvre was successful beuh and his brethren who squatted like sulky children in different places were dismissed with thankswe proposed placing ourselves under the safeguard of gerad hirsi the berteri chief this would have thrown the protectionprice originally intended for their brotherinlaw into the hands of a rival and had the effect of altering their resolve presently we were visited by two widad or hedge priests ao samattar and ao nur 38 both halfwitted fellows but active and kindhearted the former wore a dirty turban the latter a zebid cap a wickerwork calotte composed of the palm leafs midrib they carried dressed goatskins as prayer carpets over their right shoulders dangled huge wooden ink bottles with lauh or wooden tablets for writing talismans 39 and from the left hung a greasy bag containing a tattered copy of the koran and a small ms of prayers they read tolerably but did not understand arabic and i presented them with cheap bombay lithographs of the holy book the number of these idlers increased as we approached harar the alma mater of somali landthe people seldom listen to their advice but on this occasion ao samattar succeeded in persuading the valiant beuh that the danger was visionary soon afterwards rode up to our kraal three cavaliers who proved to be sons of adam the future ugaz of the gudabirsi tribe this chief had fully recognized the benefits of reopening to commerce a highway closed by their petty feuds and sent to say that in consequence of his esteem for the hajj sharmarkay if the sons of white ali feared to escort us he in person would do the deed thereupon beuh became a gesi or hero as the end of time ironically called him he sent back his brethren with their horses and camels and valorously prepared to act as our escort i tauntingly asked him what he now thought of the danger for all reply he repeated the words with which the bedouinswho like the arabs have a holy horror of townshad been dinning daily into my ears they will spoil that white skin of thine at harar  at 3 pm on the 21st december we started in a westerly direction through a gap in the hills and presently turned to the southwest over rapidly rising ground thickly inhabited and covered with flocks and herds about 5 pm after marching two miles we raised our wigwam outside a populous kraal a sheep was provided by the hospitality of ao samattar and we sat deep into the night enjoying a genial blaze  early the next morning we had hoped to advance water however was wanting and a small caravan was slowly gatheringthese details delayed us till 4 pm our line lay westward over rising ground towards a conspicuous conical hill called konti nothing could be worse for camels than the rough ridges at the foot of the mountain full of thickets cut by deep fiumaras and abounding in dangerous watercourses the burdens slipped now backwards then forwards sometimes the load was almost dragged off by thorns and at last we were obliged to leave one animal to follow slowly in the rear after creeping on two miles we bivouacked in a deserted cowkraalsub dio as it was warm under the hills that evening our party was increased by a gudabirsi maiden in search of a husband she was surlily received by shehrazade and deenarzade but we insisted upon her being fed and superintended the operation her style of eating was peculiar she licked up the rice from the hollow of her hand next morning she was carried away in our absence greatly against her will by some kinsmen who had followed her  and now bidding adieu to the gudabirsi i will briefly sketch the tribe  the gudabirsi or gudabursi derive themselves from dir and aydur thus claiming affinity with the eesa others declare their tribe to be an offshoot from the bahgoba clan of the habr awal originally settled near jebel almis and bulhar on the seashore the somal unhesitatingly stigmatize them as a bastard and ignoble race a noted genealogist once informed me that they were little better than midgans or serviles their ancestors mother it is said could not name the father of her child some proposed to slay it others advocated its preservation saying perhaps we shall increase by it hence the name of the tribe 40  the gudabirsi are such inveterate liars that i could fix for them no number between 3000 and 10000 they own the rough and rolling ground diversified with thorny hill and grassy vale above the first or seaward range of mountains and they have extended their lands by conquest towards harar being now bounded in that direction by the marar prairie as usual they are subdivided into a multitude of clans 41  in appearance the gudabirsi are decidedly superior to their limitrophes the eesa i have seen handsome faces amongst the men as well as the women some approach closely to the caucasian type one old man with olive coloured skin bald brow and white hair curling round his temples and occiput exactly resembled an angloindian veteran generally however the prognathous mouth betrays an african origin and chewing tobacco mixed with ashes stains the teeth blackens the gums and mottles the lips the complexion is the abyssinian cafe au lait contrasting strongly with the sooty skins of the coast and the hair plentifully anointed with rancid butter hangs from the head in lank corkscrews the colour of a russian pointers coat the figure is rather squat but broad and well set  the gudabirsi are as turbulent and unmanageable though not so bloodthirsty as the eesa their late chief ugaz roblay of the bait samattar sept left children who could not hold their own the turban was at once claimed by a rival branch the rer abdillah and a civil war ensued the lovers of legitimacy will rejoice to hear that when i left the country galla son of the former prince rainy was likely to come to his own again  the strangers life is comparatively safe amongst this tribe as long as he feeds and fees them he may even walk about unarmed they are however liars even amongst the somal bobadils amongst boasters inveterate thieves and importunate beggars the smoothspoken fellows seldom betray emotion except when cloth or tobacco is concerned dissimulation is as natural to them as breathing and i have called one of their chiefs dog without exciting his indignation  the commerce of these wild regions is at present in a depressed state were the road safe traffic with the coast would be considerable the profit on hides for instance at aden would be at least cent per cent the way however is dangerous and detention is frequent consequently the gain will not remunerate for risk and loss of time no operation can be undertaken in a hurry consequently demand cannot readily be supplied what laing applies to western may be repeated of eastern africa the endeavour to accelerate an undertaking is almost certain to occasion its failure nowhere is patience more wanted in order to perform perfect work the wealth of the gudabirsi consists principally in cattle peltries hides gums and ghee the asses are duncoloured small and weak the camels large loose and lazy the cows are pretty animals with small humps long horns resembling the damara cattle and in the grazing season with plump wellrounded limbs there is also a bigger breed not unlike that of tuscany the standard is the tobe of coarse canvass worth about three shillings at aden here it doubles in value the price of a good camel varies from six to eight cloths one tobe buys a twoyearold heifer three a cow between three and four years old a ewe costs half a cloth the goat although the flesh is according to the somal nutritive whilst mutton is disease is a little cheaper than the sheep hides and peltries are usually collected at and exported from harar on the coast they are rubbed over with salt and in this state carried to aden cows skins fetch a quarter of a dollar or about one shilling in cloth and two dollars are the extreme price for the kurjah or score of goats skins the people of the interior have a rude way of tanning 42 they macerate the hide dress and stain it of a deep calfskin colour with the bark of a tree called jirmah and lastly the leather is softened with the hand the principal gum is the adad or acacia arabica foreign merchants purchase it for about half a dollar per farasilah of twenty pounds cows and sheeps butter may fetch a dollars worth of cloth for the measure of thirtytwo pounds this great article of commerce is good and pure in the country whereas at berberah the habr awal adulterate it previous to exportation with melted sheeps tails  the principal wants of the country which we have traversed are coarse cotton cloth surat tobacco beads and indigodyed stuffs for womens coifs the people would also be grateful for any improvement in their breed of horses and when at aden i thought of taking with me some old arab stallions as presents to chiefs fortunately the project fell to the ground a strange horse of unusual size or beauty in these regions would be stolen at the end of the first march   footnotes  1 every hill and peak ravine and valley will be known by some striking epithet as borad the white hill libahlay the lions mountain and so forth  2 the arabs call it kakatua and consider it a species of parrot the name cacatoes is given by the cape boers according to delegorgue to the coliphymus concolor the gobiyan resembles in shape and flight our magpie it has a crest and a brown coat with patches of white and a noisy note like a frog it is very cunning and seldom affords a second shot  3 the berries of the armo are eaten by children and its leaves which never dry up by the people in times of famine they must be boiled or the acrid juice would excoriate the mouth  4 siyaro is the somali corruption of the arabic ziyarat which synonymous with mazar means a place of pious visitation  5 the somal call the insect abor and its hill dundumo  6 the corrupted portuguese word used by african travellers in the western regions it is called kelder and the arabs term it kalam  7 three species of the dar or aloe grow everywhere in the higher regions of the somali country the first is called dar main the inside of its peeled leaf is chewed when water cannot be procured the dar murodi or elephants aloe is larger and useless the dar digwen or longeared resembles that of socotra  8 the hig is called salab by the arabs who use its long tough fibre for ropes patches of this plant situated on moist ground at the foot of hills are favourite places with sand antelope spurfowl and other game  9 the darnel or pod has a sweetish taste not unlike that of a withered pea pounded and mixed with milk or ghee it is relished by the bedouins when vegetable food is scarce  10 dobo in the somali tongue signifies mud or clay  11 the loajira from loh a cow is a neatherd the geljira is the man who drives camels  12 for these we paid twentyfour oubits of canvass and two of blue cotton equivalent to about three shillings  13 the natives call them jana they are about threefourths of an inch long and armed with stings that prick like thorns and burn violently for a few minutes  14 near berberah where the descents are more rapid such panoramas are common  15 this is the celebrated waba which produces the somali wabayo a poison applied to darts and arrows it is a round stiff evergreen not unlike a bay seldom taller than twenty feet affecting hill sides and torrent banks growing in clumps that look black by the side of the acacias thornless with a laurelcoloured leaf which cattle will not touch unless forced by famine pretty bunches of pinkish white flowers and edible berries black and ripening to red the bark is thin the wood yellow compact exceedingly tough and hard the root somewhat like liquorice the latter is prepared by trituration and other processes and the produce is a poison in substance and colour resembling pitch  travellers have erroneously supposed the arrow poison of eastern africa to be the sap of a euphorbium the following observations accompanying a substance procured near aden and used by the somalis to poison their arrows by f s arnott esq md will be read with interest  in february 1853 dr arnott had forwarded to him a watery extract prepared from the root of a tree described as wabie a toxicodendron from the somali country on the habr gerhajis range of the goolies mountains the tree grows to the height of twenty feet the poison is obtained by boiling the root in water until it attains the consistency of an inspissated juice when cool the barb of the arrow is anointed with the juice which is regarded as a virulent poison and it renders a wound tainted therewith incurable dr arnott was informed that death usually took place within an hour that the hairs and nails dropped off after death and it was believed that the application of heat assisted its poisonous qualities he could not however ascertain the quantity made use of by the somalis and doubted if the point of an arrow would convey a sufficient quantity to produce such immediate effects he had tested its powers in some other experiments besides the ones detailed and although it failed in several instances yet he was led to the conclusion that it was a very powerful narcotic irritant poison he had not however observed the local effect said to be produced upon the point of insertion  the following trials were described  1 a little was inserted into the inside of the ear of a sickly sheep and death occurred in two hours  2 a little was inserted into the inside of the ear of a healthy sheep and death occurred in two hours preceded by convulsions  3 five grains were given to a dog vomiting took place after an hour and death in three or four hours  4 one grain was swallowed by a fowl but no effect produced  5 three grains were given to a sheep but without producing any effect  6 a small quantity was inserted into the ear and shoulder of a dog but no effect was produced  7 upon the same dog two days after the same quantity was inserted into the thigh death occurred in less than two hours  8 seven grains were given to a sheep without any effect whatever  9 to a dog five grains were administered but it was rejected by vomiting this was again repeated on the following day with the same result on the same day four grains were inserted into a wound upon the same dog it produced violent effects in ten and death in thirtyfive minutes  10 to a sheep two grains in solution were given without any effect being produced the postmortem appearances observed were absence of all traces of inflammation collapse of the lungs and distension of the cavities of the heart  further experiments of the somali arrow poison by b haines m b assistant surgeon from transactions of the medical and physical society of bombay no 2 new series 18531854  having while at ahmednuggur received from the secretary a small quantity of somali arrow poison alluded to by mr vaughan in his notes on articles of the materia medica and published in the last volume of the societys transactions and called wabie the following experiments were made with it  september 17th 1 a small healthy rabbit was taken and the skin over the hip being divided a piece of the poisonous extract about the size of a corn of wheat was inserted into the cellular tissue beneath thirty minutes afterwards seems disinclined to move breathing quicker passed   one hour again passed    followed by    has eaten a little one hour and a half appears quite to have recovered from his uneasiness and has become as lively as before this rabbit was made use of three days afterwards for the third experiment  2 a fullgrown rabbit some of the poison being dissolved in water a portion of the solution corresponding to about fifteen grains was injected into an opening in the peritoneum so large a quantity being used in consequence of the apparent absence of effect in the former case five minutes he appears to be in pain squeaking occasionally slight convulsive retractions of the head and neck begin to take place passed a small quantity of   ten minutes the spasms are becoming more frequent but are neither violent nor prolonged respiration scarcely perceptible he now fell on his side twelve minutes several severe general convulsions came on and at the end of another minute he was quite dead the pulsation being for the last minute quite imperceptible the chest was instantly opened but there was no movement of the heart whatever  september 20th 3 the rabbit used for the first experiment was taken and an attempt was made to inject a little filtered solution into the jugular vein which failed from the large size of the nozzle of the syringe a good deal of blood was lost a portion of the solution corresponding to about two grains and a half of the poison was then injected into a small opening made in the pleura nine minutes afterwards symptoms precisely resembling those in number two began to appear fourteen minutes convulsions more violent fell on his side sixteen minutes died  4 a portion of the poison as much as could be applied was smeared over the square iron head of an arrow and allowed to dry the arrow was then shot into the buttock of a goat with sufficient force to carry the head out of sight twenty minutes afterwards no effect whatever having followed the arrow was extracted the poison had become softened and was wiped completely off two of the sides and partly off the two other sides the animal appeared to suffer very little pain from the wound he was kept for a fortnight and then died but not apparently from any cause connected with the wound in fact he was previously diseased unfortunately the seat of the wound was not then examined but a few days previously it appeared to have healed of itself in the rabbit of the former experiment three days after the insertion of the poison in the wound the latter was closed with a dry coagulum and presented no marks of inflammation around it  5 two goodsized village dogs being secured to each after several hours fasting were given about five grains enveloped in meat the smaller one chewed it a long time and frothed much at the mouth he appeared to swallow very little of it but the larger one ate the whole up without difficulty after more than two hours no effect whatever being perceptible in either animal they were shot to get rid of them these experiments though not altogether complete certainly establish the fact that it is a poison of no very great activity the quantity made use of in the second experiment was too great to allow a fair deduction to be made as to its properties when a fourth to a sixth of the quantity was employed in the third experiment the same effects followed but with rather less rapidity death resulting in the one case in ten in the other in sixteen minutes although the death in the latter case was perhaps hastened by the loss of blood the symptoms more resemble those produced by nux vomica than by any other agent no apparent drowsiness spasms slight at first beginning in the neck increasing in intensity extending over the whole body and finally stopping respiration and with it the action of the heart experiments first and fourth show that a moderate quantity such as may be introduced on the point of an arrow produced no sensible effect either on a goat or a rabbit and it could scarcely be supposed that it would have more on a man than on the latter animal and the fifth experiment proves that a full dose taken into the stomach produces no result within a reasonable time  the extract appeared to have been very carelessly prepared it contained much earthy matter and even small stones and a large proportion of what seemed to be oxidized extractive matter also was left undisturbed when it was treated with water probably it was not a good specimen it seems however to keep well and shows no disposition to become mouldy  16 the somal divide their year into four seasons  1 gugi monsoon from gug rain begins in april is violent for forty four days and subsides in august many roads may be traversed at this season which are death in times of drought the country becomes barwako in arabic rakha a place of plenty forage and water abound the air is temperate and the light showers enliven the traveller  2 haga is the hot season after the monsoon and corresponding with our autumn the country suffers from the fora a violent dusty simum which is allayed by a fall of rain called karan  3 dair the beginning of the cold season opens the sea to shipping the rain which then falls is called dairti or hais it comes with a west southwest wind from the hills of harar  4 jilal is the dry season from december to april the country then becomes abar in arabic jahr a place of famine the nomads migrate to the low plains where pasture is procurable some reckon as a fifth season kalil or the heats between jilal and the monsoon  17 according to bruce this tree flourishes everywhere on the low hot plains between the red sea and the abyssinian hills the gallas revere it and plant it over sacerdotal graves it suggests the fetiss trees of western africa and the hierosykaminon of egypt  18 there are two species of this bird both called by the somal daudaulay from their tapping  19 the limbs are perfumed with the hedi and karanli products of the ugadayn or southern country  20 this great oath suggests the litholatry of the arabs derived from the abyssinian and galla sabaeans it is regarded by the eesa and gudabirsi bedouins as even more binding than the popular religious adjurations when a suspected person denies his guilt the judge places a stone before him saying tabo feel the liar will seldom dare to touch it sometimes a somali will take up a stone and say dagaha it is a stone he may then generally be believed  21 kariyah is the arabic word  22 in the northern country the waterproofing matter is according to travellers the juice of the quolquol a species of euphorbium  23 the flies are always most troublesome where cows have been kraals of goats and camels are comparatively free from the nuisance  24 some years ago a french lady landed at berberah her white face according to the end of time made every man hate his wife and every wife hate herself i know not who the fair dame was her charms and black silk dress however have made a lasting impression upon the somali heart from the coast to harar she is still remembered with rapture  25 the abyssinian brindo of omophagean fame is not eaten by the somal who always boil broil or sundry their flesh they have however no idea of keeping it whereas the more civilised citizens of harar hang their meat till tender  26 whilst other animals have indigenous names the horse throughout the somali country retains the arab appellation faras this proves that the somal like their progenitors the gallas originally had no cavalry the gudabirsi tribe has but lately mounted itself by making purchases of the habr gerhajis and the habr awal herds  27 the milch cow is here worth two tobes or about six shillings  28 particularly amongst the windward tribes visited by lieut cruttenden from whom i borrow this description  29 this beautiful bird with a black and crimson plume and wings lined with silver soars high and seldom descends except at night its shyness prevented my shooting a specimen the abodi devours small deer and birds the female lays a single egg in a large loose nest on the summit of a tall tree and she abandons her home when the hand of man has violated it the somal have many superstitions connected with this hawk if it touch a child the latter dies unless protected by the talismanic virtues of the hajar abodi a stone found in the birds body as it frequently swoops upon children carrying meat the belief has doubtlessly frequently fulfilled itself  30 the bushman creeps close to the beast and wounds it in the leg or stomach with a diminutive dart covered with a couch of black poison if a drop of blood appear death results from the almost unfelt wound  31 so the veddahs of ceylon are said to have destroyed the elephant by shooting a tiny arrow into the sole of the foot the kafirs attack it in bodies armed with sharp and broadhead omkondo or assegais at last one finds the opportunity of cutting deep into the hind back sinew and so disables the animal  32 the traveller delegorgue asserts that the boers induce the young elephant to accompany them by rubbing upon its trunk the hand wetted with the perspiration of the huntsmans brow and that the calf deceived by the similarity of smell believes that it is with its dam the fact is that the orphan elephant like the bison follows man because it fears to be left alone  33 an antelope about five hands high with small horns which inhabits the high ranges of the mountains generally in couples resembles the musk deer and is by no means shy seldom flying till close pressed when running it hops awkwardly upon the toes and never goes far  34 these are solemn words used in the equestrian games of the somal  35 sometimes milk is poured over the head as gold and silver in the nuzzeranah of india these ceremonies are usually performed by lowcaste men the freeborn object to act in them  36 the somal call it hiddik or anukub the quills are used as head scratchers and are exported to aden for sale  37 i it appears to be the ashkoko of the amharas identified by bruce with the saphan of the hebrews this coney lives in chinks and holes of rocks it was never seen by me on the plains the arabs eat it the somal generally do not  38 the prefix appears to be a kind of title appropriated by saints and divines  39 these charms are washed off and drunk by

were destined to escort across the marar prairie upon this neutral ground the eesa berteri and habr awal meet to rob and plunder unhappy travellers the somal shuddered at the sight of a wayfarer who rushed into our encampment in cuerpo having barely run away with his life not that our caravan carried much to losea few hides and pots of clarified butter to be exchanged for the holcus grain of the girhi cultivatorsstill the smallest contributions are thankfully received by these plunderers our material consisted of four or five halfstarved camels about fifty donkeys with ears cropped as a mark and their eternal accompaniments in somali land old women the latter seemed to be selected for age hideousness and strength all day they bore their babes smothered in hides upon their backs and they carried heavy burdens apparently without fatigue amongst them was a bedouin widow known by her wer a strip of the inner bark of a tree tied round the greasy fillet 1 we were accompanied by three widads provided with all the instruments of their craft and uncommonly tiresome companions they recited koran a tort et a travers at every moment they proposed fatihahs the name of allah was perpetually upon their lips and they discussed questions of divinity like gil blas and his friends with a violence bordering upon frenzy one of them was celebrated for his skill in the fal or omens he was constantly consulted by my companions and informed them that we had nought to fear except from wild beasts the prediction was a good hit i must own however that it was not communicated to me before fulfilment  at half past six am we began our march over rough and rising ground a network of thorns and watercourses and presently entered a stony gap between two ranges of hills on our right was a conical peak bearing the remains of buildings upon its summit here said abtidon a wild gudabirsi hired to look after our mules rests the venerable shaykh samawai of old a number of wells existed in the gaps between the hills these have disappeared with those who drank of them  presently we entered the barr or prairie of marar one of the long strips of plain which diversify the somali country its breadth bounded on the east by the rolling ground over which we had passed on the west by gurays a range of cones offshooting from the highlands of harar is about twentyseven miles the general course is north and south in the former direction it belongs to the eesa in the latter may be seen the peaks of kadau and madir the property of the habr awal tribes and along these ranges it extends i was told towards ogadayn the surface of the plain is gently rolling ground the black earth filled with the holes of small beasts would be most productive and the outer coat is an expanse of tall waving sunburnt grass so unbroken that from a distance it resembles the nap of yellow velvet in the frequent wadys which carry off the surplus rain of the hills scrub and thorn trees grow in dense thickets and the grass is temptingly green yet the land lies fallow water and fuel are scarce at a distance from the hills and the wildest bedouins dare not front the danger of foraging parties the fatal heats of day and the killing colds of night on the edges of the plain however are frequent vestiges of deserted kraals  about midday we crossed a depression in the centre where acacias supplied us with gum for luncheon and sheltered flocks of antelope i endeavoured to shoot the whitetailed sig and the large dun oryx but the brouhaha of the caravan prevented execution shortly afterwards we came upon patches of holcus which had grown wild from seeds scattered by travellers this was the first sight of grain that gladdened my eyes since i left bombay the grave of the first murderer never knew a triptolemus 2 and zayla is a barren flat of sand my companions eagerly devoured the pith of this african sweet cane despite its ill reputation for causing fever i followed their example and found it almost as good as bad sugar the bedouins loaded their spare asses with the bitter gourd called ubbah externally it resembles the water melon and becomes when shaped dried and smoked the wickerwork of the somal and the pottery of more civilized people  towards evening as the setting sun sank slowly behind the distant western hills the colour of the prairie changed from glaring yellow to a golden hue mantled with a purple flush inexpressibly lovely the animals of the waste began to appear shy lynxes 3 and jackals fattened by many sheeps tails 4 warned my companions that fierce beasts were nigh ominous anecdotes were whispered and i was told that a caravan had lately lost nine asses by lions as night came on the bedouin kafilah being lightly loaded preceded us and our tired camels lagged far behind we were riding in rear to prevent straggling when suddenly my mule the hindermost pricked his ears uneasily and attempted to turn his head looking backwards i distinguished the form of a large animal following us with quick and stealthy strides my companions would not fire thinking it was a man at last a rifleball pinging through the airthe moon was too young for correct shootingput to flight a huge lion the terror excited by this sort of an adventure was comical to look upon the valiant beuh who according to himself had made his preuves in a score of foughten fields threw his arms in the air wildly shouting libah libahthe lion the lionand nothing else was talked of that evening  the ghostly western hills seemed to recede as we advanced over the endless rolling plain presently the ground became broken and stony the mules stumbled in deep holes and the camels could scarcely crawl along as we advanced our widads who poor devils had been roasted by the women all day on account of their poverty began to recite the koran with might in gratitude for having escaped many perils night deepening our attention was rivetted by a strange spectacle a broad sheet of bright blaze reminding me of hannos fiery river swept apparently down a hill and according to my companions threatened the whole prairie these accidents are common a huntsman burns a tree for honey or cooks his food in the dry grass the wind rises and the flames spread far and wide on this occasion no accident occurred the hills however smoked like a solfatara for two days  about 9 pm we heard voices and i was told to discharge my rifle lest the kraal be closed to us in due time we reached a long low dark line of sixty or seventy huts disposed in a circle so as to form a fence with a few bushesthorns being hereabouts rarein the gaps between the abodes the people a mixture of girhi and gudabirsi bedouins swarmed out to gratify their curiosity but we were in no humour for long conversations our luggage was speedily disposed in a heap near the kraal the mules and camels were tethered for the night then supperless and shivering with cold we crept under our mats and fell asleep that day we had ridden nearly fifteen hours our halting place lay about thirty miles from and 240° southwest of koralay  after another delay and a second vain message to the gerad adan about noon appeared that dignitarys sixth wife sister to the valiant beuh her arrival disconcerted my companions who were too proud to be protected by a woman dahabo however relieved their anxiety by informing us that the gerad had sent his eldest son sherwa as escort this princess was a gipsylooking dame coarsely dressed about thirty years old with a gay leer a jaunty demeanour and the reputation of being fast she showed little shamefacedness when i saluted her and received with noisy joy the appropriate present of a new and handsome tobe about 4 pm returned our second messenger bearing with him a reproving message from the gerad for not visiting him without delay in token of sincerity he forwarded his baton a knobstick about two feet long painted in rings of cutch colours red black and yellow alternately and garnished on the summit with a ball of similar material  at dawn on the 26th december mounted upon a little pony came sherwa heir presumptive to the gerad adans knobstick his father had sent him to us three days before but he feared the gudabirsi as much as the gudabirsi feared him and he probably hung about our camp till certain that it was safe to enter we received him politely and he in acknowledgment positively declared that beuh should not return before eating honey in his cottage our abbans heroism now became infectious even the end of time whose hot valour had long since fallen below zero was inspired by the occasion and recited as usual with him in places and at times of extreme safety the arabs warrior lines    i have crossed the steed since my eyes saw light   i have fronted death till he feared my sight   and the cleaving of helm and the riving of mail   were the dreams of my youthare my manhoods delight  as we had finished loading a mules bridle was missed sherwa ordered instant restitution to his fathers stranger on the ground that all the property now belonged to the gerad and we by no means idle fiercely threatened to bewitch the kraal the article was presently found hard by on a hedge this was the first and last case of theft which occurred to us in the somali countryi have travelled through most civilised lands and have lost more  at 8 am we marched towards the northwest along the southern base of the gurays hills and soon arrived at the skirt of the prairie where a welltrodden path warned us that we were about to quit the desert after advancing six miles in line we turned to the right and recited a fatihah over the heap of rough stones where shadowed by venerable trees lie the remains of the great shaykh abd el malik a little beyond this spot rises suddenly from the plain a mass of castellated rock the subject of many a wild superstition caravans always encamp beneath it as whoso sleeps upon the summit loses his senses to evil spirits at some future day harar will be destroyed and jannah siri will become a flourishing town we ascended it and found no life but hawks coneys an owl 5 and a graceful species of black eagle 6 there were many traces of buildings walls ruined houses and wells whilst the sides and summit were tufted with venerable sycamores this act was an imprudence the bedouins at once declared that we were prospecting for a fort and the evil report preceded us to harar  after a miles march from jannah siri we crossed a ridge of rising ground and suddenly as though by magic the scene shifted  before us lay a little alp the second step of the ethiopian highland around were high and jagged hills their sides black with the saj 7 and somali pine 8 and their upper brows veiled with a thin growth of cactus beneath was a deep valley in the midst of which ran a serpentine of shining waters the gladdest spectacle we had yet witnessed further in front masses of hill rose abruptly from shady valleys encircled on the far horizon by a straight blue line of ground resembling a distant sea behind us glared the desert we had now reached the outskirts of civilization where man abandoning his flocks and herds settles cultivates and attends to the comforts of life  the fields are either terraces upon the hill slopes or the sides of valleys divided by flowery hedges with lanes between not unlike those of rustic england and on a nearer approach the daisy the thistle and the sweet briar pleasantly affected my european eyes the villages are no longer moveable the kraal and wigwam are replaced by the gambisa or bell shaped hut of middle africa 9 circular cottages of holcus wattle covered with coarse dab and surmounted by a stiff conical thatch roof above which appears the central supporting post crowned with a gourd or ostrich egg 10 strong abbatis of thorns protects these settlements which stud the hills in all directions near most of them are clumps of tall trees to the southern sides of which are hung like birdcages long cylinders of matting the hives of these regions yellow crops of holcus rewarded the peasants toil in some places the long stems tied in bunches below the ears as piled muskets stood ready for the reaper in others the barer ground showed that the task was done the boys sat perched upon reed platforms 11 in the trees and with loud shouts drove away thieving birds whilst their fathers cut the crop with diminutive sickles or thrashed heaps of straw with rude flails 12 or winnowed grain by tossing it with a flat wooden shovel against the wind the women husked the pineappleformed heads in mortars composed of a hollowed trunk 13 smeared the threshing floor with cowdung and water to defend it from insects piled the holcus heads into neat yellow heaps spanned and crossed by streaks of various colours brickred and brownishpurple 14 and stacked the karbi or straw which was surrounded like the grain with thorn as a defence against the wild hog all seemed to consider it a labour of love the harvesthome song sounded pleasantly to our ears and contrasting with the silent desert the hum of mans habitation was a music  descending the steep slope we reposed after a seven miles march on the banks of a bright rivulet which bisects the kobbo or valley it runs according to my guides from the north towards ogadayn and the direction is significantabout harar i found neither hill nor stream trending from east to west the people of the kutti 15 flocked out to gaze upon us they were unarmed and did not like the bedouins receive us with cries of bori during the halt we bathed in the waters upon whose banks were a multitude of huge mantidae pink and tender green returning to the camels i shot a kind of crow afterwards frequently seen 16 it is about three times the size of our english bird of a bluishblack with a snowwhite poll and a beak of unnatural proportions the quantity of lead which it carried off surprised me a number of widads assembled to greet us and some habr awal who were returning with a caravan gave us the salam and called my people cousins verily remarked the hammal amongst friends we cut one anothers throats amongst enemies we become sons of uncles  at 3 pm we pursued our way over rising ground dotted with granite blocks fantastically piled and everywhere in sight of fields and villages and flowing water a furious wind was blowing and the end of time quoted the somali proverb heat hurts but cold kills the camels were so fatigued and the air became so raw 17 that after an hour and a halfs march we planted our wigwams near a village distant about seven miles from the gurays hills till late at night we were kept awake by the crazy widads ao samattar had proposed the casuistical question is it lawful to pray upon a mountain when a plain is at hand some took the pro others the contra and the wordy battle raged with uncommon fury  on wednesday morning at half past seven we started down hill towards wilensi a small tablemountain at the foot of which we expected to find the gerad adan awaiting us in one of his many houses crossed a fertile valley and ascended another steep slope by a bad and stony road passing the home of sherwa who vainly offered hospitality we toiled onwards and after a mile and a halfs march which occupied at least two hours our wayworn beasts arrived at the gerads village on inquiry it proved that the chief who was engaged in selecting two horses and two hundred cows the price of blood claimed by the amir of harar for the murder of a citizen had that day removed to sagharrah another settlement  as we entered the long straggling village of wilensi our party was divided by the gerads two wives the hammal the kalendar shehrazade and deenarzade remained with beuh and his sister in her gurgi whilst long guled the end of time and i were conducted to the cottage of the gerads prettiest wife sudiyah she was a tall woman with a light complexion handsomely dressed in a large harar tobe with silver earrings and the kind of necklace called jilbah or kardas 18 the geradah princess at once ordered our hides to be spread in a comfortable part of the hut and then supplied us with foodboiled beef pumpkin and jowari cakes during the short time spent in that gambisa i had an opportunity dear l of seeing the manners and customs of the settled somal  the interior of the cottage is simple entering the door a single plank with pins for hinges fitted into sockets above and below the lintelin fact as artless a contrivance as ever seen in spain or corsicayou find a space divided by dwarf walls of wattle and dab into three compartments for the men women and cattle the horses and cows tethered at night on the left of the door fill the cottage with the wherewithal to pass many a nuit blanche the wives lie on the right near a large fireplace of stones and raised clay and the males occupy the most comfortable part opposite to and farthest from the entrance the thatched ceiling shines jetty with smoke which when intolerable is allowed to escape by a diminutive window this seldom happens for smoke like grease and dirt keeping man warm is enjoyed by savages equally simply is the furniture the stem of a tree with branches hacked into pegs supports the shields the assegais are planted against the wall and divers bits of wood projecting from the sides and the central rooftree of the cottage are hung with clothes and other articles that attract white ants gourds smoked inside and coffee cups of coarse black harar pottery with deep wooden platters and prettily carved spoons of the same material compose the household supellex the inmates are the geradah and her baby siddik a galla serf the slave girls and sundry somal thus we hear at all times three languages 19 spoken within the walls  long before dawn the goodwife rises wakens her handmaidens lights the fire and prepares for the afur or morning meal the quern is here unknown 20 a flat smooth oval slab weighing about fifteen pounds and a stone roller six inches in diameter worked with both hands and the weight of the body kneeling ungracefully upon it on all fours are used to triturate the holcus grain at times water must be sprinkled over the meal until a finely powdered paste is ready for the oven thus several hours labour is required to prepare a few pounds of bread about 6 am there appears a substantial breakfast of roast beef and mutton with scones of jowari grain the whole drenched in broth of the men few perform any ablutions but all use the tooth stick before sitting down to eat after the meal some squat in the sun others transact business and drive their cattle to the bush till 11 am the dinner hour there is no variety in the repasts which are always flesh and holcus these people despise fowls and consider vegetables food for cattle during the day there is no privacy men women and children enter in crowds and will not be driven away by the geradah who inquires screamingly if they come to stare at a baboon my kettle especially excites their surprise some opine that it is an ostrich others a serpent sudiyah however soon discovered its use and begged irresistibly for the unique article throughout the day her slave girls are busied in grinding cooking and quarrelling with dissonant voices the men have little occupation beyond chewing tobacco chatting and having their wigs frizzled by a professional coiffeur in the evening the horses and cattle return home to be milked and stabled this operation concluded all apply themselves to supper with a will they sleep but little and sit deep into the night trimming the fire and conversing merrily over their cups of farshu or millet beer 21 i tried this mixture several times and found it detestable the taste is sour and it flies directly to the head in consequence of being mixed with some poisonous bark it is served up in gourd bottles upon a basket of holcus heads and strained through a pledget of cotton fixed across the narrow mouth into cups of the same primitive material the drinkers sit around their liquor and their hilarity argues its intoxicating properties in the morning they arise with headaches and heavy eyes but these symptoms which we an industrious race deprecate are not disliked by the somalthey promote sleep and give something to occupy the vacant mind

the gerads second son to summon his father i had to compose many disputes between the hammal and the end of time the latter was swelling with importance he was now accredited ambassador from the hajj to the girhi chief consequently he aimed at commanding the caravan we then made preparations for departure in case of the gerad being unable to escort us shehrazade and deenarzade hearing that the smallpox raged at harar and fearing for their charms begged hard to be left behind the kalendar was directed despite his manly objections to remain in charge of these dainty dames the valiant beuh was dressed in the grand tobe promised to him as no consideration would induce him towards the city he was dismissed with small presents and an old girhi bedouin generally known as said wal or mad said was chosen as our escort camels being unable to travel over these rough mountain paths our weary brutes were placed for rest and pasture under the surveillance of sherwa and not wishing the trouble and delay of hiring asses the only transport in this country certain moreover that our goods were safer here than nearer harar we selected the most necessary objects and packed them in a pair of small leathern saddlebags which could be carried by a single mule  all these dispositions duly made at 10 am on the 29th december we mounted our animals and guided by mad said trotted round the northern side of the wilensi tablemountain down a lane fenced with fragrant dog roses then began the descent of a steep rocky hill the wall of a woody chasm through whose gloomy depths the shrunken stream of a large fiumara wound like a thread of silver the path would be safe to nought less surefooted than a mule we rode slowly over rolling stones steps of micaceous grit and through thorny bush for about half an hour in the plain below appeared a village of the gerads midgans who came out to see us pass and followed the strangers to some distance one happening to say of what use is his gunbefore he could fetch fire i should put this arrow through him i discharged a barrel over their heads and derided the convulsions of terror caused by the unexpected sound  passing onwards we entered a continuation of the wady harirah it is a long valley choked with dense vegetation through which meandered a line of water brightly gilt by the suns rays my somal remarked that were the elephants now infesting it destroyed rice the favourite luxury might be grown upon its banks in abundance our road lay under clumps of shady trees over rocky watercourses through avenues of tall cactus and down tranchees worn by man eight and ten feet below stiff banks of rich red clay on every side appeared deep clefts ravines and earth cracks all at this season dry the unarmed cultivators thronged from the frequent settlements to stare and my somal being no longer in their own country laid aside for guns their ridiculous spears on the way passing ao samattars village the worthy fellow made us halt whilst he went to fetch a large bowl of sour milk about noon the fresh western breeze obscured the fierce sun with clouds and we watered our mules in a mountain stream which crossed our path thrice within as many hundred yards after six miles ride reaching the valleys head we began the descent of a rugged pass by a rough and rocky path the scenery around us was remarkable the hill sides were well wooded and black with pine their summits were bared of earth by the heavy monsoon which spreads the valleys with rich soil in many places the beds of waterfalls shone like sheets of metal upon the black rock villages surrounded by fields and fences studded the country and the distance was a mass of purple peak and blue table in long vanishing succession ascending the valleys opposite wall we found the remains of primaeval forestslittle glades which had escaped the axe they resounded with the cries of pintados and cynocephali 22 had the yellow crops of holcus been wheat i might have fancied myself once more riding in the pleasant neighbourhood of tuscan sienna  at 4 pm after accomplishing fifteen miles on rough ground we sighted sagharrah a snug highfenced village of eight or nine huts nestling against a hill side with trees above and below a fertile grainvalley presently mad said pointed out to us the gerad adan who attended by a little party was returning homewards we fired our guns as a salute he however hurried on to receive us with due ceremony in his cottage dismounting at the door we shook hands with him were led through the idle mob into a smoky closet contrived against the inside wall and were regaled with wheaten bread steeped in honey and rancid butter the host left us to eat and soon afterwards returnedi looked with attention at a man upon whom so much then depended  adan bin kaushan was in appearance a strong wiry bedouinbefore obtaining from me a turban he wore his bushy hair dyed dunabout forty five years old at least six feet high with decided features a tricky smile and an uncertain eye in character he proved to be one of those cunning idiots so peculiarly difficult to deal with ambitious and wild with greed of gain he was withal so fickle that his head appeared ever changing its contents he could not sit quiet for half an hour and this physical restlessness was an outward sign of the uneasy inner man though reputed brave his treachery has won him a permanent ill fame some years ago he betrothed a daughter to the eldest son of gerad hirsi of the berteri tribe and then contrary to somali laws of honor married her to mahommed waiz of the jibril abokr this led to a feud in which the disappointed suitor was slain adan was celebrated for polygamy even in eastern africa by means of his five sons and dozen daughters he has succeeded in making extensive connexions 23 and his sister the gisti 24 fatimah was married to abubakr father of the present amir yet the gerad would walk into a crocodiles mouth as willingly as within the walls of harar his main reason for receiving us politely was an ephemeral fancy for building a fort to control the countrys trade and rival or overawe the city still did he not neglect the main chance whatever he saw he asked for and after receiving a sword a koran a turban an arab waistcoat of gaudy satin about seventy tobes and a similar proportion of indigodyed stuff he privily complained to me that the hammal had given him but twelve cloths a list of his wants will best explain the man he begged me to bring him from berberah a silverhilted sword and some soap 1000 dollars two sets of silver bracelets twenty guns with powder and shot snuff a scarlet cloth coat embroidered with gold some poison that would not fail and any other little article of luxury which might be supposed to suit him in return he was to present us with horses mules slaves ivory and other valuables he forgot however to do so before we departed  the gerad adan was powerful being the head of a tribe of cultivators not split up like the bedouins into independent clans and he thus exercises a direct influence upon the conterminous races 25 the girhi or giraffes inhabiting these hills are like most of the other settled somal a derivation from darud and descended from kombo despite the unmerciful persecutions of the gallas they gradually migrated westwards from makhar their original nest now number 5000 shields possess about 180 villages and are accounted the power paramount though friendly with the habr awal the girhi seldom descend unless compelled by want of pasture into the plains  the other inhabitants of these hills are the gallas and the somali clans of berteri bursuk shaykhash hawiyah usbayhan marayhan and abaskul  the gallas 26 about harar are divided into four several clans separating as usual into a multitude of septs the alo extend westwards from the city the nole inhabit the land to the east and northeast about two days journey between the eesa somal and harar on the south are situated the babuli and the jarsa at wilensi sagharrah and kondura places described in these pages  the berteri who occupy the gurays range south of and limitrophe to the gallas and thence extend eastward to the jigjiga hills are estimated at 3000 shields 27 of darud origin they own allegiance to the gerad hirsi and were when i visited the country on bad terms with the girhi the chiefs family has for several generations been connected with the amirs of harar and the caravans route to and from berberah lying through his country makes him a useful friend and a dangerous foe about the gerad hirsi different reports were rife some described him as cruel violent and avaricious others spoke of him as a godly and a prayerful person all however agreed that he had sowed wild oats in token of repentance he was fond of feeding widads and the shaykh jami of harar was a frequent guest at his kraal  the bursuk number about 5000 shields own no chief and in 1854 were at war with the girhi the berteri and especially the gallas in this country the feuds differ from those of the plains the hillmen fight for three days as the end of time phrased it and make peace for three days the maritime clans are not so abrupt in their changes moreover they claim bloodmoney a thing here unknown  the shaykhash or reverend as the term means are the only somal of the mountains not derived from dir and darud claiming descent from the caliph abubakr they assert that ten generations ago one ao khutab bin fakih umar crossed over from el hejaz and settled in eastern africa with his six sons umar the greater umar the less two abdillahs ahmed and lastly siddik this priestly tribe is dispersed like that of levi amongst its brethren and has spread from efat to ogadayn its principal subfamilies are ao umar the elder and bah dumma the junior branch  the hawiyah has been noticed in a previous chapter of the usbayhan i saw but few individuals they informed me that their tribe numbered forty villages and about 1000 shields that they had no chief of their own race but owned the rule of the girhi and berteri gerads their principal clans are the rer yusuf rer said rer abokr and yusuf liyo  in the eastern horn of africa and at ogadayn the marayhan is a powerful tribe here it is unconsequential and affiliated to the girhi the abaskul also lies scattered over the harar hills and owns the gerad adan as its chief this tribe numbers fourteen villages and between 400 and 500 shields and is divided into the rer yusuf the jibrailah and the warra digthe latter clan is said to be of galla extraction  on the morning after my arrival at sagharrah i felt too ill to rise and was treated with unaffected kindness by all the establishment the gerad sent to harar for millet beer ao samattar went to the gardens in search of kat the sons yusuf dera and a dwarf 28 insisted upon firing me with such ardour that no refusal could avail and khayrah the wife with her daughters two tall dark smiling and wellfavoured girls of thirteen and fifteen sacrificed a sheep as my fida or expiatory offering even the galla christians who flocked to see the stranger wept for the evil fate which had brought him so far from his fatherland to die under a tree nothing indeed would have been easier than such operation all required was the turning face to the wall for four or five days but to expire of an ignoble colicthe thing was not to be thought of and a firm resolution to live on sometimes methinks effects its object  on the 1st january 1855 feeling stronger i clothed myself in my arab best and asked a palaver with the gerad we retired to a safe place behind the village where i read with pomposity the hajj sharmarkays letter the chief appeared much pleased by our having preferred his country to that of the eesa he at once opened the subject of the new fort and informed me that i was the builder as his eldest daughter had just dreamed that the stranger would settle in the land having discussed the project to the gerads satisfaction we brought out the guns and shot a few birds for the benefit of the vulgar whilst engaged in this occupation appeared a party of five strangers and three mules with ornamented morocco saddles bridles bells and brass neck ornaments after the fashion of harar two of these men haji umar and nur ambar were citizens the others ali hasan husayn araleh and haji mohammed were somal of the habr awal tribe high in the amirs confidence they had been sent to settle with adan the weighty matter of bloodmoney after sitting with us almost half an hour during which they exchanged grave salutations with my attendants inspected our asses with portentous countenances and asked me a few questions concerning my business in those parts they went privily to the gerad told him that the arab was not one who bought and sold that he had no design but to spy out the wealth of the land and that the whole party should be sent prisoners in their hands to harar the chief curtly replied that we were his friends and bade them throw far those words disappointed in their designs they started late in the afternoon driving off their 200 cows and falsely promising to present our salams to the amir  it became evident that some decided step must be taken the gerad confessed fear of his harari kinsman and owned that he had lost all his villages in the immediate neighbourhood of the city i asked him point blank to escort us he as frankly replied that it was impossible the request was loweredwe begged him to accompany us as far as the frontier he professed inability to do so but promised to send his eldest son sherwa  nothing then remained dear l but payer daudace and throwing all forethought to the dogs to rely upon what has made many a small man great the good star i addressed my companions in a set speech advising a mount without delay they suggested a letter to the amir requesting permission to enter his city this device was rejected for two reasons in the first place had a refusal been returned our journey was cut short and our labours stultified secondly the end of time had whispered that my two companions were plotting to prevent the letter reaching its destination he had charged his own sin upon their shoulders the hammal and long guled were incapable of such treachery but our hedgepriest was thoroughly terrified a coward body after a his face brightened when ordered to remain with the gerad at sagharrah and though openly taunted with poltroonery he had not the decency to object my companions were then informed that hitherto our acts had been those of old women not soldiers and that something savouring of manliness must be done before we could return they saw my determination to start alone if necessary and to do them justice they at once arose this was the more courageous in them as alarmists had done their worst but a day before some travelling somali had advised them as they valued dear life not to accompany that turk to harar once in the saddle they shook off sad thoughts declaring that if they were slain i should pay their bloodmoney and if they escaped that their reward was in my hands when in some danger the hammal especially behaved with a sturdiness which produced the most beneficial results yet they were true easterns wearied by delay at harar i employed myself in meditating flight they drily declared that afterwit serves no good purpose whilst i considered the possibility of escape they looked only at the prospect of being dragged back with pinioned arms by the amirs guard such is generally the effect of the vulgar moslems blind fatalism  i then wrote an english letter 29 from the political agent at aden to the amir of harar proposing to deliver it in person and throw off my disguise two reasons influenced me in adopting this neck or nothing plan all the races amongst whom my travels lay hold him nidering who hides his origin in places of danger and secondly my white face had converted me into a turk a nation more hated and suspected than any europeans without our prestige before leaving sagharrah i entrusted to the end of time a few lines addressed to lieut herne at berberah directing him how to act in case of necessity our baggage was again decimated the greater part was left with adan and an ass carried only what was absolutely necessarya change of clothes a book or two a few biscuits ammunition and a little tobacco my girhi escort consisted of sherwa the bedouin abtidon and mad said mounted on the end of times mule  at 10 am on the 2nd january all the villagers assembled and recited the fatihah consoling us with the information that we were dead men by the worst of footpaths we ascended the rough and stony hill behind sagharrah through bush and burn and over ridges of rock at the summit was a village where sherwa halted declaring that he dared not advance a swordsman however was sent on to guard us through the galla pass after an hours ride we reached the foot of a tall tablemountain called kondura where our road a goatpath rough with rocks or fallen trees and here and there arched over with giant creepers was reduced to a narrow ledge with a forest above and a forest below i could not but admire the beauty of this valombrosa which reminded me of scenes whilome enjoyed in fair touraine high up on our left rose the perpendicular walls of the misty hill fringed with tufted pine and on the right the shrubclad folds fell into a deep valley the cool wind whistled and sunbeams like golden shafts darted through tall shady trees    bearded with moss and in garments green  the ground was clothed with dank grass and around the trunks grew thistles daisies and blue flowers which at a distance might well pass for violets  presently we were summarily stopped by half a dozen gallas attending upon one rabah the chief who owns the pass 30 this is the african style of tolltaking the pike appears in the form of a plump of spearmen and the gate is a pair of lances thrown across the road not without trouble for they feared to depart from the mos majorum we persuaded them that the ass carried no merchandise then rounding konduras northern flank we entered the amirs territory about thirty miles distant and separated by a series of blue valleys lay a dark speck upon a tawny sheet of stubble harar  having paused for a moment to savour success we began the descent the ground was a slippery black soilmist ever settles upon konduraand frequent springs oozing from the rock formed beds of black mire a few huge birbisa trees the remnant of a forest still thick around the mountains neck marked out the road they were branchy from stem to stern and many had a girth of from twenty to twentyfive feet 31  after an hours ride amongst thistles whose flowers of a bright redlike worsted were not less than a childs head we watered our mules at a rill below the slope then remounting we urged over hill and dale where galla peasants were threshing and storing their grain with loud songs of joy they were easily distinguished by their african features mere caricatures of the somal whose type has been arabized by repeated immigrations from yemen and hadramaut late in the afternoon having gained ten miles in a straight direction we passed through a hedge of plantains defending the windward side of gafra a village of midgans who collect the gerad adans grain they shouted delight on recognising their old friend mad said led us to an empty gambisa swept and cleaned it lighted a fire turned our mules into a field to graze and went forth to seek food their hospitable thoughts however were marred by the two citizens of harar who privately threatened them with the amirs wrath if they dared to feed that turk  as evening drew on came a message from our enemies the habr awal who offered if we would wait till sunrise to enter the city in our train the gerad adan had counselled me not to provoke these men so contrary to the advice of my two companions i returned a polite answer purporting that we would expect them till eight oclock the next morning  at 7 pm on the 3rd january we heard that the treacherous habr awal had driven away their cows shortly after midnight seeing their hostile intentions i left my journal sketches and other books in charge of an old midgan with directions that they should be forwarded to the gerad adan and determined to carry nothing but our arms and a few presents for the amir we saddled our mules mounted and rode hurriedly along the edge of a picturesque chasm of tender pink granite here and there obscured by luxuriant vegetation in the centre fringed with bright banks a shallow rill called doghlah now brawls in tiny cascades then whirls through huge boulders towards the erar river presently descending by a ladder of rock scarcely safe even for mules we followed the course of the burn and emerging into the valley beneath we pricked forwards rapidly for day was wearing on and we did not wish the habr awal to precede us  about noon we crossed the erar river the bed is about one hundred yards broad and a thin sheet of clear cool and sweet water covered with crystal the greater part of the sand according to my guides its course like that of the hills is southerly towards the webbe of ogadayn 32 none however could satisfy my curiosity concerning the course of the only perennial stream which exists between harar and the coast  in the lower valley a mass of waving holcus we met a multitude of galla peasants coming from the city market with new potlids and the empty gourds which had contained their butter ghee and milk all wondered aloud at the turk concerning whom they had heard many horrors as we commenced another ascent appeared a harar grandee mounted upon a handsomely caparisoned mule and attended by seven servants who carried gourds and skins of grain he was a palefaced senior with a white beard dressed in a fine tobe and a snowy turban with scarlet edges he carried no shield but an abyssinian broadsword was slung over his left shoulder we exchanged courteous salutations and as i was thirsty he ordered a footman to fill a cup with water half way up the hill appeared the 200 girhi cows but those traitors the habr awal had hurried onwards upon the summit was pointed out to me the village of elaoda in former times it was a wealthy place belonging to the gerad adan  at 2 pm we fell into a narrow fenced lane and halted for a few minutes near a spreading tree under which sat women selling ghee and unspun cotton about two miles distant on the crest of a hill stood the city the end of my present travela long sombre line strikingly contrasting with the whitewashed towns of the east the spectacle materially speaking was a disappointment nothing conspicuous appeared but two grey minarets of rude shape many would have grudged exposing three lives to win so paltry a prize but of all that have attempted none ever succeeded in entering that pile of stones the thoroughbred traveller dear l will understand my exultation although my two companions exchanged glances of wonder  spurring our mules we advanced at a long trot when mad said stopped us to recite a fatihah in honor of ao umar siyad and ao rahmah two great saints who repose under a clump of trees near the road the soil on both sides of the path is rich and red masses of plantains limes and pomegranates denote the gardens which are defended by a bleached cows skull stuck upon a short stick 33 and between them are plantations of coffee bastard saffron and the graceful kat about half a mile eastward of the town appears a burn called jalah or the coffee water the crowd crossing it did not prevent my companions bathing and whilst they donned clean tobes i retired to the wayside and sketched the town  these operations over we resumed our way up a rough tranchee ridged with stone and hedged with tall cactus this ascends to an open plain on the right lie the holcus fields which reach to the town wall the left is a heap of rude cemetery and in front are the dark defences of harar with groups of citizens loitering about the large gateway and sitting in chat near the ruined tomb of ao abdal we arrived at 3 pm after riding about five hours which were required to accomplish twenty miles in a straight direction 34  advancing to the gate mad said accosted a warder known by his long wand of office and sent our salams to the amir saying that we came from aden and requested the honor of audience whilst he sped upon his errand we sat at the foot of a round bastion and were scrutinised derided and catechized by the curious of both sexes especially by that conventionally termed the fair the three habr awal presently approached and scowlingly inquired why we had not apprised them of our intention to enter the city it was now war to the knifewe did not deign a reply   footnotes  1 it is worn for a year during which modest women will not

waiting half an hour at the gate we were told by the returned warder to pass the threshold and remounting guided our mules along the main street a narrow uphill lane with rocks cropping out from a surface more irregular than a perote pavement long guled had given his animal into the hands of our two bedouins they did not appear till after our audience when they informed us that the people at the entrance had advised them to escape with the beasts an evil fate having been prepared for the proprietors  arrived within a hundred yards of the gate of holcusstalks which opens into the courtyard of this african st james our guide a bleareyed surlyfaced angryvoiced fellow made signsnone of us understanding his hararito dismount we did so he then began to trot and roared out apparently that we must do the same 1 we looked at one another the hammal swore that he would perish foully rather than obey andconceive dear l the idea of a petticoated pilgrim venerable as to beard and turban breaking into a long doublei expressed much the same sentiment leading our mules leisurely in spite of the guides wrath we entered the gate strode down the yard and were placed under a tree in its left corner close to a low building of rough stone which the clanking of frequent fetters argued to be a stateprison  this part of the court was crowded with gallas some lounging about others squatting in the shade under the palace walls the chiefs were known by their zinc armlets composed of thin spiral circlets closely joined and extending in mass from the wrist almost to the elbow all appeared to enjoy peculiar privilegesthey carried their long spears wore their sandals and walked leisurely about the royal precincts a delay of half an hour during which stateaffairs were being transacted within gave me time to inspect a place of which so many and such different accounts are current the palace itself is as clapperton describes the fellatah sultans statehall a mere shed a long single storied windowless barn of rough stone and reddish clay with no other insignia but a thin coat of whitewash over the door this is the royal and vizierial distinction at harar where no lesser man may stucco the walls of his house the courtyard was about eighty yards long by thirty in breadth irregularly shaped and surrounded by low buildings in the centre opposite the outer entrance was a circle of masonry against which were propped divers doors 2  presently the bleareyed guide with the angry voice returned from within released us from the importunities of certain forward and inquisitive youth and motioned us to doff our slippers at a stone step or rather line about twelve feet distant from the palacewall we grumbled that we were not entering a mosque but in vain then ensued a long dispute in tongues mutually unintelligible about giving up our weapons by dint of obstinacy we retained our daggers and my revolver the guide raised a door curtain suggested a bow and i stood in the presence of the dreaded chief  the amir or as he styles himself the sultan ahmad bin sultan abibakr sat in a dark room with whitewashed walls to which hungsignificant decorationsrusty matchlocks and polished fetters his appearance was that of a little indian rajah an etiolated youth twentyfour or twenty five years old plain and thinbearded with a yellow complexion wrinkled brows and protruding eyes his dress was a flowing robe of crimson cloth edged with snowy fur and a narrow white turban tightly twisted round a tall conical cap of red velvet like the old turkish headgear of our painters his throne was a common indian kursi or raised cot about five feet long with back and sides supported by a dwarf railing being an invalid he rested his elbow upon a pillow under which appeared the hilt of a cutch sabre ranged in double line perpendicular to the amir stood the court his cousins and nearest relations with right arms bared after fashion of abyssinia  i entered the room with a loud peace be upon ye to which h h replying graciously and extending a hand bony and yellow as a kites claw snapped his thumb and middle finger two chamberlains stepping forward held my forearms and assisted me to bend low over the fingers which however i did not kiss being naturally averse to performing that operation upon any but a womans hand my two servants then took their turn in this case after the back was saluted the palm was presented for a repetition 3 these preliminaries concluded we were led to and seated upon a mat in front of the amir who directed towards us a frowning brow and an inquisitive eye  some inquiries were made about the chiefs health he shook his head captiously and inquired our errand i drew from my pocket my own letter it was carried by a chamberlain with hands veiled in his tobe to the amir who after a brief glance laid it upon the couch and demanded further explanation i then represented in arabic that we had come from aden bearing the compliments of our daulah or governor and that we had entered harar to see the light of h hs countenance this information concluded with a little speech describing the changes of political agents in arabia and alluding to the friendship formerly existing between the english and the deceased chief abubakr  the amir smiled graciously  this smile i must own dear l was a relief we had been prepared for the worst and the aspect of affairs in the palace was by no means reassuring  whispering to his treasurer a little ugly man with a badly shaven head coarse features pug nose angry eyes and stubby beard the amir made a sign for us to retire the baise main was repeated and we backed out of the audienceshed in high favour according to grandiloquent bruce the court of london and that of abyssinia are in their principles one the loiterers in the harar palace yard who had before regarded us with cut throat looks now smiled as though they loved us marshalled by the guard we issued from the precincts and after walking a hundred yards entered the amirs second palace which we were told to consider our home there we found the bedouins who scarcely believing that we had escaped alive grinned in the joy of their hearts and we were at once provided from the chiefs kitchen with a dish of shabta holcus cakes soaked in sour milk and thickly powdered with red pepper the salt of this inland region  when we had eaten the treasurer reappeared bearing the amirs command that we should call upon his wazir the gerad mohammed resuming our peregrinations we entered an abode distinguished by its external streak of chunam and in a small room on the ground floor cleanly whitewashed and adorned like an old english kitchen with varnished wooden porringers of various sizes we found a venerable old man whose benevolent countenance belied the reports current about him in somaliland 4 half rising although his wrinkled brow showed suffering he seated me by his side upon the carpeted masonrybench where lay the implements of his craft reeds inkstands and whitewashed boards for paper politely welcomed me and gravely stroking his cottoncoloured beard desired my object in good arabic  i replied almost in the words used to the amir adding however some details how in the old day one madar farih had been charged by the late sultan abubakr with a present to the governor of aden and that it was the wish of our people to reestablish friendly relations and commercial intercourse with harar  khayr inshallahit is well if allah please ejaculated the gerad i then bent over his hand and took leave  returning we inquired anxiously of the treasurer about my servants arms which had not been returned and were assured that they had been placed in the safest of storehouses the palace i then sent a common sixbarrelled revolver as a present to the amir explaining its use to the bearer and we prepared to make ourselves as comfortable as possible the interior of our new house was a clean room with plain walls and a floor of tamped earth opposite the entrance were two broad steps of masonry raised about two feet and a yard above the ground and covered with hard matting i contrived to make upon the higher ledge a bed with the cushions which my companions used as shabracques and after seeing the mules fed and tethered lay down to rest worn out by fatigue and profoundly impressed with the poesie of our position i was under the roof of a bigoted prince whose least word was death amongst a people who detest foreigners the only european that had ever passed over their inhospitable threshold and the fated instrument of their future downfall                                       i now proceed to a description of unknown harar  the ancient capital of hadiyah called by the citizens harar gay 5 by the somal adari by the gallas adaray and by the arabs and ourselves harar 6 lies according to my dead reckoning 220° sw of and 175 statute miles from zayla257° w of and 219 miles distant from berberah this would place it in 9° 20 n lat and 42° 17 e long the thermometer showed an altitude of about 5500 feet above the level of the sea 7 its site is the slope of an hill which falls gently from west to east on the eastern side are cultivated fields westwards a terraced ridge is laid out in orchards northwards is a detached eminence covered with tombs and to the south the city declines into a low valley bisected by a mountain burn this irregular position is well sheltered from high winds especially on the northern side by the range of which kondura is the lofty apex hence as the persian poet sings of a heavenfavoured city    its heat is not hot nor its cold cold  during my short residence the air reminded me of tuscany on the afternoon of the 11th january there was thunder accompanied by rain frequent showers fell on the 12th and the morning of the 13th was clear but as we crossed the mountains black clouds obscured the heavens the monsoon is heavy during one summer month before it begins the crops are planted and they are reaped in december and january at other seasons the air is dry mild and equable  the province of hadiyah is mentioned by makrizi as one of the seven members of the zayla empire 8 founded by arab invaders who in the 7th century of our area conquered and colonised the low tract between the red sea and the highlands moslem harar exercised a pernicious influence upon the fortunes of christian abyssinia 9  the allegiance claimed by the aethiopian emperors from the adelthe dankali and ancient somalwas evaded at a remote period and the intractable moslems were propitiated with rich presents when they thought proper to visit the christian court the abyssinians supplied the adel with slaves the latter returned the value in rocksalt commercial intercourse united their interests and from war resulted injury to both people nevertheless the fanatic lowlanders propense to pillage and proselytizing burned the christian churches massacred the infidels and tortured the priests until they provoked a blood feud of uncommon asperity  in the 14th century ad 13121342 amda sion emperor of aethiopia taunted by amano king of hadiyah as a monarch fit only to take care of women overran and plundered the lowlands from tegulet to the red sea the amharas were commanded to spare nothing that drew the breath of life to fulfil a prophecy which foretold the fall of el islam they perpetrated every kind of enormity  peace followed the death of amda sion in the reign of zara yakub 10 ad 14341468 the flame of war was again fanned in hadiyah by a zayla princess who was slighted by the aethiopian monarch on account of the length of her foreteeth the hostilities which ensued were not however of an important nature boeda mariana the next occupant of the throne passed his life in a constant struggle for supremacy over the adel on his deathbed he caused himself to be so placed that his face looked towards those lowlands upon whose subjugation the energies of ten years had been vainly expended  at the close of the 15th century mahfuz a bigoted moslem inflicted a deadly blow upon abyssinia vowing that he would annually spend the forty days of lent amongst his infidel neighbours when weakened by rigorous fasts they were less capable of bearing arms for thirty successive years he burned churches and monasteries slew without mercy every male that fell in his way and driving off the women and children he sold some to strange slavers and presented others to the sherifs of mecca he bought over za salasah commander in chief of the emperors body guard and caused the assassination of alexander ad 14781495 at the ancient capital tegulet naud the successor obtained some transient advantages over the moslems during the earlier reign of the next emperor david iii son of naud 11 who being but eleven years old when called to the throne was placed under the guardianship of his mother the iteghe helena new combatants and new instruments of warfare appeared on both sides in the field  after the conquest of egypt and arabia by selim i a d 1516 12 the caravans of abyssinian pilgrims travelling to jerusalem were attacked the old were butchered and the young were swept into slavery many arabian merchants fled from turkish violence and injustice to the opposite coast of africa whereupon the ottomans took possession from aden of zayla and not only laid the indian trade under heavy contributions by means of their wargalleys but threatened the total destruction of abyssinia they aided and encouraged mahfuz to continue his depredations whilst the sherif of meccah gave him command of zayla the key of the upper country and presented him with the green banner of a crusader  on the other hand the great albuquerque at the same time ad 15081515 was viceroy of india and to him the iteghe helena applied for aid her ambassador arrived at goa bearing a fragment of wood belonging to the true cross on which christ died which relic had been sent as a token of friendship to her brother emanuel by the empress of aethiopia the overture was followed by the arrival at masawwah of an embassy from the king of portugal too proud however to await foreign aid david at the age of sixteen took the field in person against the moslems  during the battle that ensued mahfuz the goliath of the unbelievers was slain in single combat by gabriel andreas a soldier of tried valour who had assumed the monastic life in consequence of having lost the tip of his tongue for treasonable freedom of speech the green standard was captured and 12000 moslems fell david followed up his success by invading the lowlands and in defiance struck his spear through the door of the king of adel  harar was a mere mass of bedouin villages during the reign of mohammed gragne the lefthanded attila of adel 13 supplied with arab mercenaries from mocha and by the turks of yemen with a body of janissaries and a train of artillery he burst into efat and fatigar in ad 1528 he took possession of shoa overran amhara burned the churches and carried away an immense booty the next campaign enabled him to winter at begmeder in the following year he hunted the emperor david through tigre to the borders of senaar gave battle to the christians on the banks of the nile and with his own hand killed the monk gabriel then an old man reinforced by gideon and judith king and queen of the samen jews and aided by a violent famine which prostrated what had escaped the spear he perpetrated every manner of atrocity captured and burned axum destroyed the princes of the royal blood on the mountain of amba geshe 14 and slew in ad 1540 david third of his name and last emperor of aethiopia who displayed the magnificence of king of kings  claudius the successor to the tottering throne sent as his ambassador to europe one john bermudez a portuguese who had been detained in abyssinia and promised it is said submission to the pontiff of rome and the cession of the third of his dominions in return for reinforcements by order of john iii don stephen and don christopher sons of don vasco de gama cruised up the red sea with a powerful flotilla and the younger brother landing at masawwah with 400 musqueteers slew nur the governor and sent his head to gondar where the iteghe sabel wenghel received it as an omen of good fortune thence the portuguese general imprudently marched in the monsoon season and was soon confronted upon the plain of ballut by mohammed gragne at the head of 10000 spearmen and a host of cavalry on the other side stood a rabble rout of abyssinians and a little band of 350 portuguese heroes headed by the most chivalrous soldier of a chivalrous age  according to father jerome lobo 15 who heard the events from an eye witness a conference took place between the two captains mohammed encamped in a commanding position sent a message to don christopher informing him that the treacherous abyssinians had imposed upon the king of portugal and that in compassion of his opponents youth he would give him and his men free passage and supplies to their own country the christian presented the moslem ambassador with a rich robe and returned this gallant answer that he and his fellowsoldiers were come with an intention to drive mohammed out of these countries which he had wrongfully usurped that his present design was instead of returning back the way he came as mohammed advised to open himself a passage through the country of his enemies that mohammed should rather think of determining whether he would fight or yield up his illgotten territories than of prescribing measures to him that he put his whole confidence in the omnipotence of god and the justice of his cause and that to show how full a sense he had of mohammeds kindness he took the liberty of presenting him with a lookingglass and a pair of pincers  the answer and the present so provoked the adel monarch that he arose from table to attack the little troop of portuguese posted upon the declivity of a hill near a wood above them stood the abyssinians who resolved to remain quiet spectators of the battle and to declare themselves on the side favoured by victory  mohammed began the assault with only ten horsemen against whom an equal number of portuguese were detached these fired with so much exactness that nine of the moors fell and the king was wounded in the leg by peter de sa in the melee which ensued the moslems dismayed by their first failure were soon broken by the portuguese muskets and artillery mohammed preserved his life with difficulty he however rallied his men and entrenched himself at a strong place called membret mamrat intending to winter there and await succour  the portuguese more desirous of glory than wealth pursued their enemies hoping to cut them entirely off finding however the camp impregnable they entrenched themselves on a hill over against it their little host diminished day by day their friends at masawwah could not reinforce them they knew not how to procure provisions and could not depend upon their abyssinian allies yet memorious of their countrymens great deeds and depending upon divine protection they made no doubt of surmounting all difficulties  mohammed on his part was not idle he solicited the assistance of the moslem princes and by inflaming their religious zeal obtained a reinforcement of 2000 musqueteers from the arabs and a train of artillery from the turks of yemen animated by these succours he marched out of his trenches to enter those of the portuguese who received him with the utmost bravery destroyed many of his men and made frequent sallies not however without sustaining considerable losses  don christopher had already one arm broken and a knee shattered by a musket shot valour was at length oppressed by superiority of numbers the enemy entered the camp and put the christians to the spear the portuguese general escaped the slaughter with ten men and retreated to a wood where they were discovered by a detachment of the enemy 16 mohammed overjoyed to see his most formidable enemy in his power ordered don christopher to take care of a wounded uncle and nephew telling him that he should answer for their lives and upon their death taxed him with having hastened it the portuguese roundly replied that he was come to destroy moslems not to save them enraged at this language mohammed placed a stone upon his captives head and exposed him to the insults of the soldiery who inflicted upon him various tortures which he bore with the resolution of a martyr at length when offered a return to india as the price of apostacy the heros spirit took fire he answered with the highest indignation that nothing could make him forsake his heavenly master to follow an imposter and continued in the severest terms to vilify the false prophet till mahommed struck off his head 17 the body was divided into quarters and sent to different places 18 but the catholics gathered their martyrs remains and interred them every moor who passed by threw a stone upon the grave and raised in time such a heap that father lobo found difficulty in removing it to exhume the relics he concludes with a pardonable superstition there is a tradition in the country that in the place where don christophers head fell a fountain sprang up of wonderful virtue which cured many diseases otherwise past remedy  mohammed gragne improved his victory by chasing the young claudius over abyssinia where nothing opposed the progress of his arms at last the few portuguese survivors repaired to the christian emperor who was persuaded to march an army against the king of adel resolved to revenge their general the musqueteers demanded the post opposite mohammed and directed all their efforts against the part where the moslem attila stood his fellow religionists still relate that when gragne fell in action his wife talwambara 19 the heroic daughter of mahfuz to prevent the destruction and dispersion of the host of islam buried the corpse privately and caused a slave to personate the prince until a retreat to safe lands enabled her to discover the stratagem to the nobles 20  father lobo tells a different tale according to him peter leon a marksman of low stature but passing valiant who had been servant to don christopher singled the adel king out of the crowd and shot him in the head as he was encouraging his men mohammed was followed by his enemy till he fell down dead the portuguese then alighting from his horse cut off one of his ears and rejoined his fellowcountrymen the moslems were defeated with great slaughter and an abyssinian chief finding gragnes corpse upon the ground presented the head to the negush or emperor claiming the honor of having slain his countrys deadliest foe having witnessed in silence this impudence peter asked whether the king had but one ear and produced the other from his pocket to the confusion of the abyssinian  thus perished after fourteen years uninterrupted fighting the african hero who dashed to pieces the structure of 2500 years like the kardillan of the holy land mohammed gragne is still the subject of many a wild and grisly legend and to the present day the people of shoa retain an inherited dread of the lowland moslems  mohammed was succeeded on the throne of adel by the amir nur son of majid and according to some brother to the lefthanded he proposed marriage to talwambara who accepted him on condition that he should lay the head of the emperor claudius at her feet in ad 1559 he sent a message of defiance to the negush who having saved abyssinia almost by a miracle was rebuilding on debra work the golden mount a celebrated shrine which had been burned by the moslems claudius despising the eclipses evil prophecies and portents which accompanied his enemys progress accepted the challenge on the 22nd march 1559 the armies were upon the point of engaging when the high priest of debra libanos hastening into the presence of the negush declared that in a vision gabriel had ordered him to dissuade the emperor of aethiopia from needlessly risking life the superstitious abyssinians fled leaving claudius supported by a handful of portuguese who were soon slain around him and he fell covered with wounds the amir nur cut off his head and laid it at the feet of talwambara who in observance of her pledge became his wife this amazon suspended the trophy by its hair to the branch of a tree opposite her abode that her eyes might be gladdened by the sight after hanging two years it was purchased by an armenian merchant who interred it in the sepulchre of st claudius at antioch the name of the christian hero who won every action save that in which he perished has been enrolled in the voluminous catalogue of abyssinian saints where it occupies a conspicuous place as the destroyer of mohammed the lefthanded  the amir nur has also been canonized by his countrymen who have buried their favourite wali under a little dome near the jami mosque at harar shortly after his decisive victory over the christians he surrounded the city with its present walla circumstance now invested with the garb of moslem fable the warrior used to hold frequent conversations with el khizr on one occasion when sitting upon a rock still called gay humburtiharars navelhe begged that some sherif might be brought from meccah to aid him in building a permanent city by the use of the great name the vagrant prophet instantly summoned from arabia the sherif yunis his son fakr el din and a descendant from the ansar or auxiliaries of the prophet they settled at harar which throve by the blessing of their presence from this tradition we may gather that the city was restored as it was first founded and colonized by hungry arabs  the sherifs continued to rule with some interruptions until but a few generations ago when the present family rose to power according to bruce they are jabartis who having intermarried with sayyid women claim a noble origin they derive themselves from the caliph abubakr or from akil son of abu talib and brother of ali the ulema although lacking boldness to make the assertion evidently believe them to be of galla or pagan extraction  the present city of harar is about one mile long by half that breadth an irregular wall lately repaired 21 but ignorant of cannon is pierced with five large gates 22 and supported by oval towers of artless construction the material of the houses and defences are rough stones the granites and sandstones of the hills cemented like the ancient galla cities with clay the only large building is the jami or cathedral a long barn of povertystricken appearance with brokendown gates and two whitewashed minarets of truncated conoid shape they were built by turkish architects from mocha and hodaydah one of them lately fell and has been replaced by an inferior effort of harari art there are a few trees in the city but it contains none of those gardens which give to eastern settlements that pleasant view of town and country combined the streets are narrow lanes up hill and down dale strewed with gigantic rubbishheaps upon which repose packs of mangy or oneeyed dogs and even the best are encumbered with rocks and stones the habitations are mostly long flatroofed sheds double storied with doors composed of a single plank and holes for windows pierced high above the ground and decorated with miserable woodwork the principal houses have separate apartments for the women and stand at the bottom of large courtyards closed by gates of holcus stalks the poorest classes inhabit gambisa the thatched cottages of the hillcultivators the city abounds in mosques plain buildings without minarets and in graveyards stuffed with tombs oblong troughs formed by long slabs planted edgeways in the ground i need scarcely say that harar is proud of her learning sanctity and holy dead the principal saint buried in the city is shaykh umar abadir el bakri originally from jeddah and now the patron of harar he lies under a little dome in the southern quarter of the city near the bisidimo gate  the ancient capital of hadiyah shares with zebid in yemen the reputation of being an alma mater and inundates the surrounding districts with poor scholars and crazy widads where knowledge leads to nothing says philosophic volney nothing is done to acquire it and the mind remains in a state of barbarism there are no establishments for learning no endowments as generally in the east and apparently no encouragement to students books also are rare and costly none but the religious sciences are cultivated the chief ulema are the kabir 23 khalil the kabir yunis and the shaykh jami the two former scarcely ever quit their houses devoting all their time to study and tuition the latter is a somali who takes an active part in politics  these professors teach moslem literature through the medium of harari a peculiar dialect confined within the walls like the somali and other tongues in this part of eastern africa it appears to be partly arabic in etymology and grammar the semitic scion being grafted upon an indigenous root the frequent recurrence of the guttural kh renders it harsh and unpleasant and it contains no literature except songs and tales which are written in the modern naskhi character i would willingly have studied it deeply but circumstances preventedthe explorer too frequently must rest satisfied with descrying from his pisgah the promised land of knowledge which another more fortunate is destined to conquer at zayla the hajj sent to me an abyssinian slave who was cunning in languages but he to use the popular phrase showed his right ear with his left hand inside harar we were so closely watched that it was found impossible to put pen to paper escaped however to wilensi i hastily collected the grammatical forms and a vocabulary which will correct the popular assertion that the language is arabic it has an affinity with the amharic 24  harar has not only its own tongue unintelligible to any save the citizens even its little population of about 8000 souls is a distinct race the somal say of the city that it is a paradise inhabited by asses certainly the exterior of the people is highly unprepossessing amongst the men i did not see a handsome face their features are coarse and debauched many of them squint others have lost an eye by smallpox and they are disfigured by scrofula and other diseases the bad expression of their countenances justifies the proverb hard as the heart of harar generally the complexion is a yellowish brown the beard short stubby and untractable as the hair and the hands and wrists feet and ankles are large and illmade the stature is moderatesized some of the elders show the pudding sides and the pulpy stomachs of banyans whilst others are lank and bony as arabs or jews their voices are loud and rude they dress is a mixture of arab and abyssinian they shave the head and clip the mustachios and imperial close like the shafei of yemen many are bareheaded some wear a cap generally the embroidered indian work or the common cotton takiyah of egypt a few affect white turbans of the fine harar work loosely twisted over the ears the bodygarment is the tobe worn flowing as in the somali country or girt with the daggerstrap round the waist the richer classes bind under it a futah or loincloth and the dignitaries have wide arab drawers of white calico coarse leathern sandals a rosary and a toothstick rendered perpetually necessary by the habit of chewing tobacco complete the costume and arms being forbidden in the streets the citizens carry wands five or six feet long  the women who owing probably to the number of female slaves are much the more numerous appear beautiful by contrast with their lords they have small heads regular profiles straight noses large eyes mouths approaching the caucasian type and light yellow complexions dress however here is a disguise to charms a long wide cotton shirt with short arms as in the arabs aba indigodyed or chocolatecoloured and ornamented with a triangle of scarlet before and behindthe base on the shoulder and the apex at the waistis girt round the middle with a sash of white cotton crimsonedged women of the upper class when leaving the house throw a blue sheet over the head which however is rarely veiled the front and back hair parted in the centre is gathered into two large bunches below the ears and covered with dark blue muslin or network whose ends meet under the chin this coiffure is bound round the head at the junction of scalp and skin by a black satin ribbon which varies in breadth according to the wearers means some adorn the gear with large gilt pins others twine in it a taj or thin wreath of sweetsmelling creeper the virgins collect their locks which are generally wavy not wiry and grow long as well as thick into a knot tied a la diane behind the head a curtain of short close plaits escaping from the bunch falls upon the shoulders not ungracefully silver ornaments are worn only by persons of rank the ear is decorated with somali rings or red coral beads the neck with necklaces of the same material and the forearms with six or seven of the broad circles of buffalo and other dark horns prepared in western india finally stars are tattooed upon the bosom the eyebrows are lengthened with dyes the eyes fringed with kohl and the hands and feet stained with henna  the female voice is harsh and screaming especially when heard after the delicate organs of the somal the fair sex is occupied at home spinning cotton thread for weaving tobes sashes and turbans carrying their progeny perched upon their backs they bring water from the wells in large gourds borne on the head work in the gardens andthe men considering like the abyssinians such work a disgracesit and sell in the long street which here represents the eastern bazar chewing tobacco enables them to pass much of their time and the rich diligently anoint themselves with ghee whilst the poorer classes use remnants of fat from the lamps their freedom of manners renders a public flogging occasionally indispensable before the operation begins a few gourds full of cold water are poured over their heads and shoulders after which a single thonged whip is applied with vigour 25  both sexes are celebrated for laxity of morals high and low indulge freely in intoxicating drinks beer and mead the amir has established strict patrols who unmercifully bastinado those caught in the streets after a certain hour they are extremely bigoted especially against christians the effect of their abyssinian wars and are fond of jihading with the gallas over whom they boast many a victory i have seen a letter addressed by the late amir to the hajj sharmarkay in which he boasts of having slain a thousand infidels and by way of bathos begs for a few pounds of english gunpowder the harari hold foreigners in especial hate and contempt and divide them into two orders arabs and somal 26 the latter though nearly one third of the population or 2500 souls are to use their own phrase cheap as dust their natural timidity is increased by the show of pomp and power whilst the word prison gives them the horrors  the other inhabitants are about 3000 bedouins who come and go up to the city gates the country is peopled by the gallas this unruly race requires to be propitiated by presents of cloth as many as 600 tobes are annually distributed amongst them by the amir lately when the smallpox spreading from the city destroyed many of their number the relations of the deceased demanded and received bloodmoney they might easily capture the place but they preserve it for their own convenience these gallas are tolerably brave avoid matchlock balls by throwing themselves upon the ground when they see the flash ride well use the spear skilfully and although of a proverbially bad breed are favourably spoken of by the citizens the somal find no difficulty in travelling amongst them i repeatedly heard at zayla and at harar that traders had visited the far west traversing for seven months a country of pagans wearing golden bracelets 27 till they reached the salt sea upon which franks sail in ships 28 at wilensi one mohammed a shaykhash gave me his itinerary of fifteen stages to the sources of the abbay or blue nile he confirmed the vulgar somali report that the hawash and the webbe shebayli both take rise in the same range of well wooded mountains which gives birth to the river of egypt  the government of harar is the amir these petty princes have a habit of killing and imprisoning all those who are suspected of aspiring to the throne 29 ahmeds greatgrandfather died in jail and his father narrowly escaped the same fate when the present amir ascended the throne he was ordered it is said by the makad or chief of the nole gallas to release his prisoners or to mount his horse and leave the city three of his cousins however were when i visited harar in confinement one of them since that time died and has been buried in his fetters the somal declare that the statedungeon of harar is beneath the palace and that he who once enters it lives with unkempt beard and untrimmed nails until the day when death sets him free  the amir ahmeds health is infirm some attribute his weakness to a fall from a horse others declare him to have been poisoned by one of his wives 30 i judged him consumptive shortly after my departure he was upon the point of death and he afterwards sent for a physician to aden he has four wives no 1 is the daughter of the gerad hirsi no 2 a sayyid woman of harar no 3 an emancipated slave girl and no 4 a daughter of gerad abd el majid one of his nobles he has two sons who will probably never ascend the throne one is an infant the other is a boy now about five years old  illustration  the amir ahmed succeeded his father about three years ago his rule is severe if not just and it has all the prestige of secresy as the amharas say the belly of the master is not known even the gerad mohammed though summoned to council at all times in sickness as in health dares not offer uncalledfor advice and the queen dowager the gisti fatimah was threatened with fetters if she persisted in interference ahmeds principal occupations are spying his many stalwart cousins indulging in vain fears of the english the turks and the hajj sharmarkay and amassing treasure by commerce and escheats he judges civil and religious causes in person but he allows them with little interference to be settled by the kazi abd el rahman bin umar el harari the latter though a highly respectable person is seldom troubled rapid decision being the general predilection the punishments when money forms no part of them are mostly according to koranic code the murderer is placed in the market street blindfolded and bound hand and foot the nearest of kin to the deceased then strikes his neck with a sharp and heavy butchers knife and the corpse is given over to the relations for moslem burial if the blow prove ineffectual a pardon is generally granted when a citizen draws dagger upon another or commits any petty offence he is bastinadoed in a peculiar manner two men ply their horsewhips upon his back and breast and the prince in whose presence the punishment is carried out gives the order to stop theft is visited with amputation of the hand the prison is the award of state offenders it is terrible because the captive is heavily ironed lies in a filthy dungeon and receives no food but what he can obtain from his own familyseldom liberal under such circumstancesbuy or beg from his guards fines and confiscations as usual in the east are favourite punishments with the ruler i met at wilensi an old harari whose gardens and property had all been escheated because his son fled from justice after slaying a man the amir is said to have large hoards of silver coffee and ivory my attendant the hammal was once admitted into the inner palace where he saw huge boxes of ancient fashion supposed to contain dollars the only specie current in harar is a diminutive brass piece called mahallak 31hand worked and almost as artless a medium as a modern italian coin it bears on one side the words    arabic   zaribat el harar the coinage of harar  on the reverse is the date ah 1248 the amir pitilessly punishes all those who pass in the city any other coin  the amir ahmed is alive to the fact that some state should hedge in a prince neither weapons nor rosaries are allowed in his presence a chamberlains robe acts as spittoon whenever anything is given to or taken from him his hand must be kissed even on horseback two attendants fan him with the hems of their garments except when engaged on the haronic visits which he like his father 32 pays to the streets and byways at night he is always surrounded by a strong body guard he rides to mosque escorted by a dozen horsemen and a score of footmen with guns and whips precede him by his side walks an officer shading him with a huge and heavily fringed red satin umbrellafrom india to abyssinia the sign of princely dignity even at his prayers two or three chosen matchlockmen stand over him with lighted fusees when he rides forth in public he is escorted by a party of fifty men the running footmen crack their whips and shout let let go go and the citizens avoid stripes by retreating into the nearest house or running into another street  the army of harar is not imposing there are between forty and fifty matchlockmen of arab origin long settled in the place and commanded by a veteran maghrebi they receive for pay one dollars worth of holcus per annum a quantity sufficient to afford five or six loaves a day the luxuries of life must be provided by the exercise of some peaceful craft including slaves the total of armed men may be two hundred of these one carries a somali or galla spear another a dagger and a third a sword which is generally the old german cavalry blade cannon of small calibre is supposed to be concealed in the palace but none probably knows their use the city may contain thirty horses of which a dozen are royal property they are miserable ponies but well trained to the rocks and hills the galla bedouins would oppose an invader with a strong force of spearmen the approaches to the city are difficult and dangerous but it is commanded from the north and west and the walls would crumble at the touch of a sixpounder three hundred arabs and two gallopper guns would take harar in an hour  harar is essentially a commercial town its citizens live like those of zayla by systematically defrauding the galla bedouins and the amir has made it a penal offence to buy by weight and scale he receives as octroi from eight to fifteen cubits of cutch canvass for every donkey load passing the gates consequently the beast is so burdened that it must be supported by the drivers cultivators are taxed ten per cent the general and easy rate of this part of africa but they pay in kind which considerably increases the government share the greatest merchant may bring to harar 50l worth of goods and he who has 20l of capital is considered a wealthy man the citizens seem to have a more than asiatic apathy even in pursuit of gain when we entered a caravan was to set out for zayla on the morrow after ten days hardly one half of its number had mustered the four marches from the city eastward are rarely made under a fortnight and the average rate of their kafilahs is not so high even as that of the somal  the principal exports from harar are slaves ivory coffee tobacco wars safflower or bastard saffron tobes and woven cottons mules holcus wheat karanji a kind of bread used by travellers ghee honey gums principally mastic and myrrh and finally sheeps fat and tallows of all sorts the imports are american sheeting and other cottons white and dyed muslins red shawls silks brass sheet copper cutlery generally the cheap german birmingham trinkets beads and coral dates rice and loaf sugar gunpowder paper and the various other wants of a city in the wild  harar is still as of old 33 the great half way house for slaves from zangaro gurague and the galla tribes alo and others 34 abyssinians and amharas the most valued 35 have become rare since the king of shoa prohibited the exportation women vary in value from 100 to 400 ashrafis boys from 9 to 150 the worst are kept for domestic purposes the best are driven and exported by the western arabs 36 or by the subjects of h h the imam of muscat in exchange for rice and dates i need scarcely say that commerce would thrive on the decline of slavery whilst the felateas or manrazzias are allowed to continue it is vain to expect industry in the land  ivory at harar amongst the kafirs is a royal monopoly and the amir carries on the onesided system of trade common to african monarchs elephants abound in jarjar the erar forest and in the harirah and other valleys where they resort during the hot season in cold descending to the lower regions the gallas hunt the animals and receive for the spoil a little cloth the amir sends his ivory to berberah and sells it by means of a wakil or agent the smallest kind is called ruba ajquarter ivory the better description nuss ajhalf ivory whilst aj the best kind fetches from thirtytwo to forty dollars per farasilah of 27 arab pounds 36  the coffee of harar is too well known in the markets of europe to require description it grows in the gardens about the town in greater quantities amongst the western gallas and in perfection at jarjar a district of about seven days journey from harar on the efat road it is said that the amir withholds this valuable article fearing to glut the berberah market he has also forbidden the harash or coffee cultivators to travel lest the art of tending the tree be lost when i visited harar the price per parcel of twentyseven pounds was a quarter of a dollar and the hire of a camel carrying twelve parcels to berberah was five dollars the profit did not repay labour and risk  the tobacco of harar is of a light yellow color with good flavour and might be advantageously mixed with syrian and other growths the alo or western gallas the principal cultivators plant it with the holcus and reap it about five months afterwards it is cocked for a fortnight the woody part is removed and the leaf is packed in sacks for transportation to berberah at harar men prefer it for chewing as well as smoking women generally use surat tobacco it is bought like all similar articles by the eye and about seventy pounds are to be had for a dollar  the wars or safflower is cultivated in considerable quantities around the city an abundance is grown in the lands of the gallas it is sown when the heavy rains have ceased and is gathered about two months afterwards this article together with slaves forms the staple commerce between berberah and muscat in arabia men dye with it their cotton shirts women and children use it to stain the skin a bright yellow besides the purpose of a cosmetic it also serves as a preservative against cold when wars is cheap at harar a pound may be bought for a quarter of a dollar  the tobes and sashes of harar are considered equal to the celebrated cloths of shoa handwoven they as far surpass in beauty and durability the vapid produce of european manufactories as the perfect hand of man excels the finest machinery on the windward coast one of these garments is considered a handsome present for a chief the harari tobe consists of a double length of eleven cubits by two in breadth with a border of bright scarlet and the average value of a good article even in the city is eight dollars they are made of the fine longstapled cotton which grows plentifully upon these hills and are soft as silk whilst their warmth admirably adapts them for winter wear the thread is spun by women with two wooden pins the loom is worked by both sexes  three caravans leave harar every year for the berberah market the first starts early in january laden with coffee tobes wars ghee gums and other articles to be bartered for cottons silks shawls and surat tobacco the second sets out in february the principal caravan conveying slaves mules and other valuable articles enters berberah a few days before the close of the season it numbers about 3000 souls and is commanded by one of the amirs principal officers who enjoys the title of ebi or leader any or all of these kafilahs might be stopped by spending four or five hundred dollars amongst the jibril abokr tribe or even by a sloop of war at the emporium he who commands at berberah holds the beard of harar in his hand is a saying which i heard even within the city walls  the furniture of a house at harar is simplea few skins and in rare cases a persian rug stools coarse mats and somali pillows wooden spoons and porringers shaped with a hatchet finished with a knife stained red and brightly polished the gourd is a conspicuous article smoked inside and fitted with a cover of the same material it serves as cup bottle pipe and waterskin a coarse and heavy kind of pottery of black or brown clay is used by some of the citizens  the inhabitants of harar live well the best meat as in abyssinia is beef it rather resembled however in the dry season when i ate it the lean and stringy sirloins of old england in hogarths days a hundred and twenty chickens or sixtysix fullgrown fowls may be purchased for a dollar and the citizens do not like the somal consider them carrion goats flesh is good and the blackfaced berberah sheep after the rains is here as elsewhere delicious the staff of life is holcus fruit grows almost wild but it is not prized as an article of food the plantains are coarse and bad grapes seldom come to maturity although the brab flourishes in every ravine and the palm becomes a lofty tree it has not been taught to fructify and the citizens do not know how to dress preserve or pickle their limes and citrons no vegetables but gourds are known from the cane which thrives upon these hills a little sugar is made the honey of which as the abyssinians say the land stinks is the general sweetener the condiment of east africa is red pepper                                       to resume dear l the thread of our adventures at harar  immediately after arrival we were called upon by the arabs a strange mixture one the haji mukhtar was a maghrebi from fez an expatriation of forty years had changed his hissing arabic as little as his rocky face this worthy had a coffeegarden assigned to him as commander of the amirs bodyguard he introduced himself to us however as a merchant which led us to look upon him as a spy another haji hasan was a thoroughbred persian he seemed to know everybody and was on terms of bosom friendship with half the world from cairo to calcutta moslem christian and pagan amongst the rest was a boy from meccah a muscat man a native of suez and a citizen of damascus the others were arabs from yemen all were most civil to us at first but afterwards when our interviews with the amir ceased they took alarm and prudently cut us  the arabs were succeeded by the somal amongst whom the hammal and long guled found relatives friends and acquaintances who readily recognised them as government servants at aden these visitors at first came in fear and trembling with visions of the harar jail they desired my men to return the visit by night and made frequent excuses for apparent want of hospitality their apprehensions however soon vanished presently they began to prepare entertainments and as we were without money they willingly supplied us with certain comforts of life our three habr awal enemies seeing the tide of fortune settling in our favour changed their tactics they threw the past upon their two harari companions and proposed themselves as abbans on our return to berberah this offer was politely staved off in the first place we were already provided with protectors and secondly these men belonged to the ayyal shirdon a clan most hostile to the habr gerhajis they did not fail to do us all the harm in their power but again my good star triumphed  after a days repose we were summoned by the treasurer early in the forenoon to wait upon the gerad mohammed sword in hand and followed by the hammal and long guled i walked to the palace and entering a little groundfloorroom on the right of and close to the audiencehall found the minister sitting upon a large dais covered with persian carpets he was surrounded by six of his brother gerads or councillors two of them in turbans the rest with bare and shaven heads their tobes as is customary on such occasions of ceremony were allowed to fall beneath the waist the lower part of the hovel was covered with dependents amongst whom my somal took their seats it seemed to be customs time for names were being registered and money changed hands the grandees were eating kat or as it is here called jat 37 one of the party prepared for the prime minister the tenderest twigs of the tree plucking off the points of even the softest leaves another pounded the plant with a little water in a wooden mortar of this paste called el madkuk a bit was handed to each person who rolling it into a ball dropped it into his mouth all at times as is the custom drank cold water from a smoked gourd and seemed to dwell upon the sweet and pleasant draught i could not but remark the fine flavour of the plant after the coarser quality grown in yemen europeans perceive but little effect from itfriend s and i once tried in vain a strong infusionthe arabs however unaccustomed to stimulants and narcotics declare that like opium eaters they cannot live without the excitement it seems to produce in them a manner of dreamy enjoyment which exaggerated by time and distance may have given rise to that splendid myth the lotos and the lotophagi it is held by the ulema here as in arabia akl el salikin or the food of the pious and literati remark that it has the singular properties of enlivening the imagination clearing the ideas cheering the heart diminishing sleep and taking the place of food the people of harar eat it every day from 9 am till near noon when they dine and afterwards indulge in something stronger milletbeer and mead  the gerad after polite inquiries seated me by his right hand upon the dais where i ate kat and fingered my rosary whilst he transacted the business of the day then one of the elders took from a little recess in the wall a large book and uncovering it began to recite a long dua or blessing upon the prophet at the end of each period all present intoned the response allah bless our lord mohammed with his progeny and his companions one and all this exercise lasting half an hour afforded me the opportunitymuch desiredof making an impression the reader misled by a marginal reference happened to say angels men and genii the gerad took the book and found written men angels and genii opinions were divided as to the order of beings when i explained that human nature which amongst moslems is not a little lower than the angelic ranked highest because of it were created prophets apostles and saints whereas the other is but a wasitah or connection between the creator and his creatures my theology won general approbation and a few kinder glances from the elders  prayer concluded a chamberlain whispered the gerad who arose deposited his black coral rosary took up an inkstand donned a white badan or sleeveless arab cloak over his cotton shirt shuffled off the dais into his slippers and disappeared presently we were summoned to an interview with the amir this time i was allowed to approach the outer door with covered feet entering ceremoniously as before i was motioned by the prince to sit near the gerad who occupied a persian rug on the ground to the right of the throne my two attendants squatted upon the humbler mats in front and at a greater distance after sundry inquiries about the changes that had taken place at aden the letter was suddenly produced by the amir who looked upon it suspiciously and bade me explain its contents i was then asked by the gerad whether it was my intention to buy and sell at harar the reply was we are no buyers nor sellers 38 we have become your guests to pay our respects to the amirwhom may allah preserveand that the friendship between the two powers may endure this appearing satisfactory i added in lively remembrance of the proverbial delays of africa where two or three months may elapse before a letter is answered or a verbal message delivered that perhaps the prince would be pleased to dismiss us soon as the air of harar was too dry for me and my attendants were in danger of the smallpox then raging in the town the amir who was chary of words bent towards the gerad who briefly ejaculated the reply will be vouchsafed with this unsatisfactory answer the interview ended  shortly after arrival i sent my salam to one of the ulema shaykh jami of the berteri somal he accepted the excuse of ill health and at once came to see me this personage appeared in the form of a little black man aged about forty deeply pitted by smallpox with a protruding brow a tufty beard and rather delicate features his hands and feet were remarkably small married to a descendant of the sherif yunis he had acquired great reputation as an alim or savan a peacepolicyman and an ardent moslem though an imperfect arabic scholar he proved remarkably well read in the religious sciences and even the meccans had it was said paid him the respect of kissing his hand during his pilgrimage in his second character his success was not remarkable the principal results being a spearthrust in the head and being generally told to read his books and leave men alone yet he is always doing good lillah that is to say gratis and for allahs sake his pugnacity and bluntnessthe prerogatives of the peacefulgave him some authority over the amir and he has often been employed on political missions amongst the different chiefs nor has his ardour for propagandism been thoroughly gratified he commenced his travels with an intention of winning the crown of glory without delay by murdering the british resident at aden 39 struck however with the order and justice of our rule he changed his intentions and offered el islam to the officer who received it so urbanely that the simple eastern repenting having intended to cut the kafirs throat began to pray fervently for his conversion since that time he has made it a point of duty to attempt every infidel i never heard however that he succeeded with a soul  the shaykhs first visit did not end well he informed me that the old usmanlis conquered stamboul in the days of umar i imprudently objected to the date and he revenged himself for the injury done to his fame by the favourite ecclesiastical process of privily damning me for a heretic and a worse than heathen moreover he had sent me a kind of ritual which i had perused in an hour and returned to him this prepossessed the shaykh strongly against me lightly skimming books being a form of idleness as yet unknown to the ponderous east our days at harar were monotonous enough in the morning we looked to the mules drove out the catsas great a nuisance here as at adenand ate for breakfast lumps of boiled beef with peppered holcusscones we were kindly looked upon by one sultan a sick and decrepid eunuch who having served five amirs was allowed to remain in the palace to appearance he was mad he wore upon his poll a motley scratch wig half white and half black like day and night in masquerades but his conduct was sane at dawn he sent us bad plantains wheaten crusts and cups of unpalatable coffeetea 40 and assisted by a crone more decrepid than himself prepared for me his water pipe a gourd fitted with two reeds and a tile of baked clay by way of bowl now he knagged at the slave girls who were slow to work then burst into a fury because some visitor ate kat without offering it to him or crossed the royal threshold in sandal or slipper the other inmates of the house were galla slavegirls a great nuisance especially one berille an unlovely maid whose shrill voice and shameless manners were a sad scandal to pilgrims and pious moslems  about 8 am the somal sent us gifts of citrons plantains sugarcane limes wheaten bread and stewed fowls at the same time the house became full of visitors harari and others most of them pretexting inquiries after old sultans health noon was generally followed by a little solitude the people retiring to dinner and siesta we were then again provided with bread and beef from the amirs kitchen in the afternoon the house again filled and the visitors dispersed only for supper before sunset we were careful to visit the mules tethered in the courtyard being half starved they often attempted to desert 41  it was harvest home at harar a circumstance which worked us much annoy in the mornings the amir attended by forty or fifty guards rode to a hill north of the city where he inspected his galla reapers and threshers and these men were feasted every evening at our quarters with flesh beer and mead 42 the strong drinks caused many a wordy war and we made a point of exhorting the pagans with poor success i own to purer lives  we spent our soiree alternately bepreaching the gallas chaffing mad said who despite his seventy years was a hale old bedouin with a salt and sullen repartee and quarrelling with the slavegirls berille the loudlunged or aminah the pert would insist upon extinguishing the fat fed lamp long ere bedtime or would enter the room singing laughing dancing and clapping a measure with their palms when stoutly aided by old sultan who shrieked like a hyaena on these occasions we ejected her in extreme indignation all then was silence without not soalas within mad said snored fearfully and abtidon chatted half the night with some bedouin friend who had dropped in to supper on our hard couches we did not enjoy either the noctes or the coenoe deorum  the even tenor of such days was varied by a perpetual reference to the rosary consulting soothsayers and listening to reports and rumours brought to us by the somal in such profusion that we all sighed for a discontinuance the gerad mohammed excited by the habr awal was curious in his inquiries concerning me the astute senior had heard of our leaving the end of time with the gerad adan and his mind fell into the fancy that we were transacting some business for the hajj sharmarkay the popular bugbear of harar our fate was probably decided by the arrival of a youth of the ayyal gedid clan who reported that three brothers had landed in the somali country that two of them were anxiously awaiting at berberah the return of the third from harar and that though dressed like moslems they were really englishmen in government employ visions of cutting off caravans began to assume a hard and palpable form the habr awal ceased intriguing and the gerad mohammed resolved to adopt the suaviter in modo whilst dealing with his dangerous guest  some days after his first visit the shaykh jami sending for the hammal informed him of an intended trip from harar my follower suggested that we might well escort him the good shaykh at once offered to apply for leave from the gerad mohammed not however finding the minister at home he asked us to meet him at the palace on the morrow about the time of kat eating  we had so often been disappointed in our hopes of a final laypublic that on this occasion much was not expected however about 6 am we were all summoned and entering the gerads leveeroom were as usual courteously received i had distinguished his complaintchronic bronchitisand resolving to make a final impression related to him all its symptoms and promised on reaching aden to send the different remedies employed by ourselves he clung to the hope of escaping his sufferings whilst the attendant courtiers looked on approvingly and begged me to lose no time presently the gerad was sent for by the amir and after a few minutes i followed him on this occasion alone ensued a long conversation about the state of aden of zayla of berberah and of stamboul the chief put a variety of questions about arabia and every object there the answer was that the necessity of commerce confined us to the gloomy rock he used some obliging expressions about desiring our friendship and having considerable respect for a people who built he understood large ships i took the opportunity of praising harar in cautious phrase and especially of regretting that its coffee was not better known amongst the franks the small wizenfaced man smiled as moslems say the smile of umar 43 seeing his brow relax for the first time i told him that being now restored to health we requested his commands for aden he signified consent with a nod and the gerad with many compliments gave me a letter addressed to the political resident and requested me to take charge of a mule as a present i then arose recited a short prayer the gist of which was that the amirs days and reign might be long in the land and that the faces of his foes might be blackened here and hereafter bent over his hand and retired returning to the gerads leveehut i saw by the countenances of my two attendants that they were not a little anxious about the interview and comforted them with the whispered word achhaall right  presently appeared the gerad accompanied by two men who brought my servants arms and the revolver which i had sent to the prince this was a contretemps it was clearly impossible to take back the present besides which i suspected some finesse to discover my feelings towards him the other course would ensure delay i told the gerad that the weapon was intended especially to preserve the amirs life and for further effect snapped caps in rapid succession to the infinite terror of the august company the minister returned to his master and soon brought back the information that after a day or two another mule should be given to me with suitable acknowledgments we arose blessed the gerad bade adieu to the assembly and departed joyful the hammal in his glee speaking broken english even in the amirs courtyard  returning home we found the good shaykh jami to whom we communicated the news with many thanks for his friendly aid i did my best to smooth his temper about turkish history and succeeded becoming communicative he informed me that the original object of his visit was the offer of good offices he having been informed that in the town was a man who brought down the birds from heaven and the citizens having been thrown into great excitement by the probable intentions of such a personage whilst he sat with us kabir khalil one of the principal ulema and one haji abdullah a shaykh of distinguished fame who had been dreaming dreams in our favour sent their salams this is one of the many occasions in which during a long residence in the east i have had reason to be grateful to the learned whose influence over the people when unbiassed by bigotry is decidedly for good that evening there was great joy amongst the somal who had been alarmed for the safety of my companions they brought them presents of harari tobes and a feast of fowls limes and wheaten bread for the stranger  on the 11th of january i was sent for by the gerad and received the second mule at noon we were visited by the shaykh jami who after a long discourse upon the subject of sufiism 44 invited me to inspect his books when midday prayer was concluded we walked to his house which occupies the very centre of the city in its courtyard is gay humburti the historic rock upon which saint nur held converse with the prophet khizr the shaykh after seating us in a room about ten feet square and lined with scholars and dusty tomes began reading out a treatise upon the genealogies of the grand masters and showed me in half a dozen tracts the tenets of the different schools the only valuable ms in the place was a fine old copy of the koran the kamus and the sihah were there 45 but by no means remarkable for beauty or correctness books at harar are mostly antiques copyists being exceedingly rare and the square massive character is more like cufic with diacritical points than the graceful modern naskhi i could not however but admire the bindings no eastern country save persia surpasses them in strength and appearance after some desultory conversation the shaykh ushered us into an inner room or rather a dark closet partitioned off from the study and ranged us around the usual dish of boiled beef holcus bread and red pepper after returning to the study we sat for a few minuteseasterns rarely remain long after dinnerand took leave saying that we must call upon the gerad mohammed  nothing worthy of mention occurred during our final visit to the minister he begged me not to forget his remedies when we reached aden i told him that without further loss of time we would start on the morrow friday after prayers and he simply ejaculated it is well if allah please scarcely had we returned home when the clouds which had been gathering since noon began to discharge heavy showers and a few loud thunderclaps to reverberate amongst the hills we passed that evening surrounded by the somal who charged us with letters and many messages to berberah our intention was to mount early on friday morning when we awoke however a mule had strayed and was not brought back for some hours before noon shaykh jami called upon us informed us that he would travel on the most auspicious daymondayand exhorted us to patience deprecating departure upon friday the sabbath then he arose to take leave blessed us at some length prayed that we might be borne upon the wings of safety again advised monday and promised at all events to meet us at wilensi  i fear that the shaykhs counsel was on this occasion likely to be disregarded we had been absent from our goods and chattels a whole fortnight the people of harar are famously fickle we knew not what the morrow might bring forth from the amirs mindin fact all these african cities are prisons on a large scale into which you enter by your own will and as the significant proverb says you leave by anothers however when the mosque prayers ended a heavy shower and the stormy aspect of the sky preached patience more effectually than did the divine we carefully tethered our mules and unwillingly deferred our departure till next morning   footnotes  1 the ashantees at customs time run across the royal threshold to escape being seized and sacrificed possibly the trace of the pagan rite is still preserved by moslem harar where it is now held a mark of respect and always exacted from the citizens  2 i afterwards learned that when a man neglects a summons his door is removed to the royal courtyard on the first day on the second it is confiscated the door is a valuable and venerable article in this part of africa according to bruce ptolemy euergetes engraved it upon the axum obelisk for the benefit of his newly conquered aethiopian subjects to whom it had been unknown  3 in abyssinia according to the lord of geesh this is a mark of royal familiarity and confidence  4 about seven years ago the hajj sharmarkay of zayla chose as his agent at harar one of the amirs officers a certain hajj jamitay when this man died sharmarkay demanded an account from his sons at berberah they promised to give it but returning to harar they were persuaded it is believed by the gerad mohammed to forget their word upon this sharmarkays friends and relations incited by one husayn a somali who had lived many years at harar in the amirs favour wrote an insulting letter to the gerad beginning with no peace be upon thee and no blessings of allah thou butcher son of a butcher c c and concluding with a threat to pinion him in the marketplace as a warning to men husayn carried the letter which at first excited general terror when however the attack did not take place the amir abubakr imprisoned the imprudent somali till he died sharmarkay by way of reprisals persuaded alu son of sahlah salaseh king of shoa to seize about three hundred harari citizens living in his dominions and to keep them two years in durance  the amir abubakr is said on his deathbed to have warned his son against the gerad when ahmad reported his fathers decease to zayla the hajj sharmarkay ordered a grand maulid or mass in honour of the departed since that time however there has been little intercourse and no cordiality between them  5 thus m isenberg preface to ambaric grammar p iv calls the city harrar or ararge  6 harar is not an uncommon name in this part of eastern africa according to some the city is so called from a kind of tree according to others from the valley below it  7 i say about we were compelled to boil our thermometers at wilensi not venturing upon such operation within the city  8 the other six were efat arabini duaro sharka bali and darah  9 a circumstantial account of the jihad or moslem crusades is i am told given in the fath el habashah unfortunately a rare work the amir of harar had but one volume and the other is to be found at mocha or hudaydah  10 this prince built debra berhan the hill of glory a church dedicated to the virgin mary at gondar  11 a prince of many titles he is generally called wanag suggad feared amongst the lions because he spent the latter years of his life in the wild  12 yemen submitted to sulayman pasha in ad 1538  13 gragne or in the somali dialect guray means a lefthanded man father lobo errs in translating it the lame  14 this exploit has been erroneously attributed to nur the successor of mohammed  15 this reverend jesuit was commissioned in ad 1622 by the count de vidigueira viceroy of the indies to discover where his relative don christopher was buried and to procure some of the relics assisted by the son in law of the abyssinian emperor lobo marched with an army through the gallas found the martyrs teeth and lower jaw his arms and a picture of the holy virgin which he always carried about him the precious remains were forwarded to goa  i love the style of this old father so unjustly depreciated by our writers and called ignorant peasant and liar by bruce because he claimed for his fellow countrymen the honor of having discovered the coy fountains the nemesis who never sleeps punished bruce by the justest of retributions his pompous and inflated style his uncommon arrogance and overweening vanity his affectation of pedantry his many errors and misrepresentations aroused against him a spirit which embittered the last years of his life it is now the fashion to laud bruce and to pity his misfortunes i cannot but think that he deserved them  16 bruce followed by most of our modern authors relates a circumstantial and romantic story of the betrayal of don christopher by his mistress a turkish lady of uncommon beauty who had been made prisoner  the more truthlike pages of father lobo record no such silly scandal against the memory of the brave and holy portuguese those who are well read in the works of the earlier eastern travellers will remember their horror of handling heathens after that fashion and amongst those who fought for the faith an affaire de coeur with a pretty pagan was held to be a sin as deadly as heresy or magic  17 romantic writers relate that mohammed decapitated the christian with his left hand  18 others assert in direct contradiction to father lobo that the body was sent to different parts of arabia and the head to constantinople  19 bruce followed by later authorities writes this name del wumbarea  20 talwambara according to the christians after her husbands death and her armys defeat threw herself into the wilds of atbara and recovered her son ali gerad by releasing prince menas the brother of the abyssinian emperor who in davids reign had been carried prisoner to adel  the historian will admire these two widely different accounts of the left handed heros death upon the whole he will prefer the moslems tradition from the air of truth pervading it and the various improbabilities which appear in the more detailed story of the christians  21 formerly the waraba creeping through the holes in the wall rendered the streets dangerous at night they are now destroyed by opening the gates in the evening enticing in the animals by slaughtering cattle and closing the doors upon them when they are safely speared  22 the following are the names of the gates in harari and somali  eastward argob bari bar in amharic is a gate eg ankobar the gate of anko a galla queen and argob is the name of a galla clan living in this quarter by the somal called erar  north asum bari the gate of axum in somali faldano or the zayla entrance  west asmadim bari or hamaraisa  south badro bari or bab bida  south east sukutal bari or bisidimo  at all times these gates are carefully guarded in the evening the keys are taken to the amir after which no one can leave the city till dawn  23 kabir in arabic means great and is usually applied to the almighty here it is a title given to the principal professors of religious science  24 this is equivalent to saying that the language of the basque provinces is french with an affinity to english  25 when ladies are bastinadoed in more modest persia their hands are passed through a hole in a tent wall and fastened for the infliction to a falakah or pole outside  26 the hate dates from old times abd el karim uncle to the late amir abubakr sent for sixty or seventy arab mercenaries under haydar assal the auliki to save him against the gallas the matchlockmen failing in ammunition lost twenty of their number in battle and retired to the town where the gallas after capturing abd el karim and his brother abd el rahman seized the throne and aided by the citizens attempted to massacre the strangers these however defended themselves gallantly and would have crowned the son of abd el rahman had he not in fear declined the dignity they then drew their pay and marched with all the honors of war to zayla  shortly before our arrival the dozen of petty arab pedlars at harar treacherous intriguers like all their dangerous race had been plotting against the amir one morning when they least expected it their chief was thrown into a prison which proved his grave and the rest were informed that any stranger found in the city should lose his head after wandering some months among the neighbouring villages they were allowed to return and live under surveillance no one at harar dared to speak of this event and we were cautioned not to indulge our curiosity  27 this agrees with the hon r curzons belief in central african diggings the traveller once saw an individual descending the nile with a store of nuggets bracelets and gold rings similar to those used as money by the ancient egyptians  28 m krapf relates a tale current in abyssinia namely that there is a remnant of the slave trade between guineh the guinea coast and shoa connexion between the east and west formerly existed in the time of john the second the portuguese on the river zaire in congo learned the existence of the abyssinian church travellers in western africa assert that fakihs or priests when performing the pilgrimage pass from the fellatah country through abyssinia to the coast of the red sea and it has lately been proved that a caravan line is open from the zanzibar coast to benguela  29 all male collaterals of the royal family however are not imprisoned by law as was formerly the case at shoa  30 this is a mere superstition none but the most credulous can believe that a man ever lives after an eastern dose  31 the name and coin are abyssinian according to bruce    20 mahallaks are worth              1 grush   12 grush                          1 miskal    4 miskal

cruttenden remarks the ashrafi stamped at the harar mint is a coin peculiar to the place it is of silver and the twentysecond part of a dollar the only specimen i have been able to procure bore the date of 910 of the hagira with the name of the amir on one side and on its reverse la ilaha ill allah this traveller adds in a note the value of the ashrafi changes with each successive ruler in the reign of emir abd el shukoor some 200 years ago it was of gold at present the ashrafi as i have said above is a fictitious medium used in accounts  32 an old story is told of the amir abubakr that during one of his nocturnal excursions he heard three of his subjects talking treason and coveting his food his wife and his throne he sent for them next morning filled the first with good things and bastinadoed him for not eating more flogged the second severely for being unable to describe the difference between his own wife and the princess and put the third to death  33 el makrizi informs us that in his day hadiyah supplied the east with black eunuchs although the infamous trade was expressly forbidden by the emperor of abyssinia  33 the arusi gallas are generally driven direct from ugadayn to berberah  34 if you want a brother in arms says the eastern proverb buy a nubian if you would be rich an abyssinian and if you require an ass a sawahili negro formerly a small load of salt bought a boy in southern abyssinia many of them however died on their way to the coast  35 the firman lately issued by the sultan and forwarded to the pasha of jeddah for the kaimakan and the kazi of mecca has lately caused a kind of revolution in western arabia the ulema and the inhabitants denounced the rescript as opposed to the koran and forced the magistrate to take sanctuary the kaimakan came to his assistance with turkish troops the latter however were soon pressed back into their fort at this time the sherif abd el muttalib arrived at meccah from taif and almost simultaneously reshid pasha came from constantinople with orders to seize him send him to the capital and appoint the sherif nazir to act until the nomination of a successor the state prisoner mohammed bin aun  the tumult redoubled the people attributing the rescript to the english and french consuls of jeddah insisted upon pulling down their flags the pasha took them under his protection and on the 14th january 1856 the queen steamer was despatched from bombay with orders to assist the government and to suppress the contest  36 this weight as usual in the east varies at every port at aden the farasilah is 27 lbs at zayla 20 lbs and at berberah 35 lbs  37 see chap iii el makrizi describing the kingdom of zayla uses the harari not the arabic term he remarks that it is unknown to egypt and syria and compares its leaf to that of the orange  38 in conversational arabic we is used without affectation for i  39 the shaykh himself gave me this information as a rule it is most imprudent for europeans holding high official positions in these barbarous regions to live as they do unarmed and unattended the appearance of utter security may impose where strong motives for assassination are wanting at the same time the practice has occasioned many losses which singly to use an indian statesmans phrase would have dimmed a victory  40 in the best coffee countries harar and yemen the berry is reserved for exportation the southern arabs use for economy and healththe bean being considered heatingthe kishr or follicle this in harar is a womans drink the men considering the berry too dry and heating for their arid atmosphere toast the leaf on a girdle pound it and prepare an infusion which they declare to be most wholesome but which certainly suggests weak senna the boiled coffeeleaf has been tried and approved of in england we omit however to toast it  41 in harar a horse or a mule is never lost whereas an ass straying from home is rarely seen again  42 this is the abyssinian tej a word so strange to european organs that some authors write it zatsh at harar it is made of honey dissolved in about fifteen parts of hot water strained and fermented for seven days with the bark of a tree called kudidah when the operation is to be hurried the vessel is placed near the fire ignorant africa can ferment not distil yet it must be owned she is skilful in her rude art every traveller has praised the honeywine of the highlands and some have not scrupled to prefer it to champagne it exhilarates excites and acts as an aphrodisiac the consequence is that at harar all men pagans and sages priests and rulers drink it  43 the caliph umar is said to have smiled once and wept once the smile was caused by the recollection of his having eaten his pastegods in the days of ignorance the tear was shed in remembrance of having buried alive as was customary amongst the pagan arabs his infant daughter who whilst he placed her in the grave with her little hands beat the dust off his beard and garment  44 the eastern parent of freemasonry  45 two celebrated arabic dictionaries     chap ix  a ride to berberah   long before dawn on saturday the 13th january the mules were saddled bridled and charged with our scanty luggage after a hasty breakfast we shook hands with old sultan the eunuch mounted and pricked through the desert streets suddenly my weakness and sickness left meso potent a drug is joyand as we passed the gates loudly salaming to the warders who were crouching over the fire inside a weight of care and anxiety fell from me like a cloak of lead  yet dear l i had time on the top of my mule for musing upon how melancholy a thing is success whilst failure inspirits a man attainment reads the sad prosy lesson that all our glories    are shadows not substantial things  truly said the sayer disappointment is the salt of lifea salutary bitter which strengthens the mind for fresh exertion and gives a double value to the prize  this shade of melancholy soon passed away the morning was beautiful a cloudless sky then untarnished by sun tinged with reflected blue the mistcrowns of the distant peaks and the smoke wreaths hanging round the sleeping villages and the air was a cordial after the rank atmosphere of the town the dew hung in large diamonds from the coffee trees the spur fowl crew blithely in the bushes by the waysidebriefly never did the face of nature appear to me so truly lovely  we hurried forwards unwilling to lose time and fearing the sun of the erar valley with arms cocked a precaution against the possibility of galla spears in ambuscade we crossed the river entered the yawning chasm and ascended the steep path my companions were in the highest spirits nothing interfered with the general joy but the villain abtidon who loudly boasted in a road crowded with market people that the mule which he was riding had been given to us by the amir as a jizyah or tribute the hammal direfully wrath threatened to shoot him upon the spot and it was not without difficulty that i calmed the storm  passing gafra we ascertained from the midgans that the gerad adan had sent for my books and stored them in his own cottage we made in a direct line for kondura at one pm we safely threaded the gallas pass and about an hour afterwards we exclaimed alhamdulillah at the sight of sagharrah and the distant marar prairie entering the village we discharged our fire arms the women received us with the masharrad or joycry and as i passed the enclosure the geradah khayrah performed the fola by throwing over me some handfuls of toasted grain 1 the men gave cordial poignees de mains some danced with joy to see us return alive they had heard of our being imprisoned bastinadoed slaughtered they swore that the gerad was raising an army to rescue or revenge usin fact had we been their kinsmen more excitement could not have been displayed lastly in true humility crept forward the end of time who as he kissed my hand was upon the point of tears he had been halfstarved despite his dignity as sharmarkays mercury and had spent his weary nights and days reciting the chapter ys and fumbling the rosary for omens the gerad he declared would have given him a sheep and one of his daughters to wife temporarily but sherwa had interfered he had hindered the course of his sires generosity cursed be he exclaimed the end of time who with dirty feet defiles the pure water of the stream  we entered the smoky cottage the gerad and his sons were at wilensi settling the weighty matter of a caravan which had been plundered by the usbayhan tribein their absence the good khayrah and her daughters did the duties of hospitality by cooking rice and a couple of fowls a pleasant evening was spent in recounting our perils as travellers will do and complimenting one another upon the power of our star  at eight the next morning we rode to wilensi as we approached it all the wayfarers and villagers inquired hibernically if we were the party that had been put to death by the amir of harar loud congratulations and shouts of joy awaited our arrival the kalendar was in a paroxysm of delight both shehrazade and deenarzade were affected with giggling and what might be blushing we reviewed our property and found that the one eyed had been a faithful steward so faithful indeed that he had well nigh starved the two women presently appeared the gerad and his sons bringing with them my books the former was at once invested with a gaudy abyssinian tobe of many colours in which he sallied forth from the cottage the admired of all admirers the pretty wife sudiyah and the good khayrah were made happy by sundry gifts of huge birmingham earrings brooches and bracelets scissors needles and thread the evening as usual ended in a feast  we halted a week at wilensi to feedin truth my companions had been faring lentenly at hararand to lay in stock and strength for the long desert march before us a somali was despatched to the city under orders to load an ass with onions tobacco spices wooden platters and karanji 2 which our penniless condition had prevented our purchasing i spent the time collecting a vocabulary of the harari tongue under the auspices of mad said and all the poet a somali educated at the alma mater he was a small black man longheaded and longbacked with remarkably prominent eyes a bulging brow nose pertly turned up and lean jaws almost unconscious of beard he knew the arabic somali galla and harari languages and his acuteness was such that i found no difficulty in what usually proves the hardest taskextracting the grammatical forms a poet the son of a poet to use his own phrase he evinced a horatian respect for the beverage which bards love and his discourse whenever it strayed from the line of grammar savoured of over reverence for the goddess whom pagans associated with bacchus and ceres he was also a patriot and a tyrtaeus no clan ever attacked his girhis without smarting under terrible sarcasms and his sneers at the young warriors for want of ardour in resisting gudabirsi encroachments were quoted as models of the withering stimulated by the present of a tobe he composed a song in honor of the pilgrim i will offer a literal translation of the exordium though sentient of the fact that modesty shrinks from such quotations    formerly my sire and self held ourselves songsters   only to day however i really begin to sing   at the order of abdullah allah sent my tongue is loosed   the son of the kuraysh by a thousand generations   he hath visited audal and sahil and adari 3   a hundred of his ships float on the sea   his intellect c c c  when not engaged with ali the poet i amused myself by consoling mad said who was deeply afflicted his son having received an ugly stab in the shoulder thinking perhaps that the senior anticipated some evil results from the wound i attempted to remove the impression alas 0 hajj groaned the old man it is not thathow can the boy be my boy i who have ever given instead of receiving stabs nor would he be comforted on account of the youths progeniture at other times we summoned the heads of the clans and proceeded to write down their genealogies this always led to a scene beginning with piano but rapidly rising to the strepitoso each tribe and clan wished to rank first none would be even secondwhat was to be done when excitement was at its height the paper and pencil were torn out of my hand stubby beards were pitilessly pulled and daggers half started from their sheaths these quarrels were however easily composed and always passed off in storms of abuse laughter and derision  with the end of the weeks repose came shaykh jami the berteri equipped as a traveller with sword prayingskin and waterbottle this bustling little divine whose hobby it was to make every mans business his own was accompanied by his brother in nowise so prayerful a person and by four burly blacklooking widads of whose birth learning piety and virtues he spoke in terms eloquent i gave them a supper of rice ghee and dates in my hut and with much difficulty excused myself on plea of ill health from a samrah or nights entertainmentthe chaunting some serious book from evening even to the small hours the shaykh informed me that his peaceful errand on that occasion was to determine a claim of bloodmoney amongst the neighbouring bedouins the case was rich in somali manners one man gave medicine to another who happened to die about a month afterwards the father of the deceased at once charged the mediciner with poisoning and demanded the customary fine mad said grumbled certain disrespectful expressions about the propriety of divines confining themselves to prayers and the koran whilst the gerad adan after listening to the shaykhs violent denunciation of the somali doctrine fire but not shame 4 conducted his headscratcher and with sly sarcasm declared that he had been islamized afresh that day  on sunday the 21st of january our messenger returned from harar bringing with him supplies for the road my vocabulary was finished and as nothing delayed us at wilensi i determined to set out the next day when the rumour went abroad every inhabitant of the village flocked to our hut with the view of seeing what he could beg or borrow we were soon obliged to close it with peremptory orders that none be admitted but the shaykh jami the divine appeared in the afternoon accompanied by all the incurables of the country side after hearing the tale of the bloodmoney i determined that talismans were the best and safest of medicines in those mountains the shaykh at first doubted their efficacy but when my diploma as a master sufi was exhibited a new light broke upon him and his attendant widads verily he hath declared himself this day whispered each to his neighbour still sorely mystified shaykh jami carefully inspected the document raised it reverently to his forehead and muttered some prayers he then in humble phrase begged a copy and required from me ijazah or permission to act as master the former request was granted without hesitation about the latter i preferred to temporize he then owned himself my pupil and received as a wellmerited acknowledgment of his services a pencil and a silk turban  the morning fixed for our departure came no one however seemed ready to move the hammal who but the night before had been full of ardour and activity now hung back we had no coffee no waterbags and deenarzade had gone to buy gourds in some distant village this was truly african twentysix days had not sufficed to do the work of a single watch no servants had been procured for us by the gerad although he had promised a hundred whenever required long guled had imprudently lent his dagger to the smoothtongued yusuf dera who hearing of the departure naturally absconded and at the last moment one abdy aman who had engaged himself at harar as guide to berberah for the sum of ten dollars asked a score  a display of energy was clearly necessary i sent the gerad with directions to bring the camels at once and ordered the hammal to pull down the huts abdy aman was told to go to hararor the other placelong guled was promised another dagger at berberah a message was left directing deenarzade to follow and the word was given to load  by dint of shouting and rough language the caravan was ready at 9 am the gerad adan and his ragged tail leading we skirted the eastern side of wilensi and our heavily laden camels descended with pain the rough and stony slope of the wide kloof dividing it from the marar prairie at 1 pm the chief summoned us to halt we pushed on however without regarding him presently long guled and the end of time were missing contrary to express orders they had returned to seek the dagger to ensure discipline on this occasion i must have blown out the long youths brains which were he declared addled by the loss of his weapon the remedy appeared worse than the disease  attended only by the hammal i entered with pleasure the marar prairie in vain the gerad entreated us not to venture upon a place swarming with lions vainly he promised to kill sheep and oxen for a feastwe took abrupt leave of him and drove away the camels  journeying slowly over the skirt of the plain when rejoined by the truants we met a party of travellers who as usual stopped to inquire the news their chief mounted upon an old mule proved to be madar farih a somali well known at aden he consented to accompany us as far as the halting place expressed astonishment at our escaping harar and gave us intelligence which my companions judged grave the gerad hirsi of the berteri amongst whom madar had been living was incensed with us for leaving the direct road report informed him moreover that we had given 600 dollars and various valuables to the gerad adanwhy then had he been neglected madar sensibly advised us to push forward that night and to ware the bush whence midgans might use their poisoned arrows  we alighted at the village formerly beneath gurays now shifted to a short distance from those hills presently appeared deenarzade hung round with gourds and swelling with hurt feelings she was accompanied by dahabo sister of the valiant beuh who having for ever parted from her graceless husband the gerad was returning under our escort to the gurgi of her family then came yusuf dera with a smiling countenance and smooth manners bringing the stolen dagger and many excuses for the mistake he was accompanied by a knot of kinsmen deputed by the gerad as usual for no good purpose that worthy had been informed that his berteri rival offered a hundred cows for our persons dead or alive he pathetically asked my attendants do you love your pilgrim and suggested that if they did so they might as well send him a little more cloth upon the receipt of which he would escort us with fifty horsemen  my somal lent a willing ear to a speech which smelt of falsehood a mile off they sat down to debate the subject was important and for three mortal hours did that palaver endure i proposed proceeding at once they declared that the camels could not walk and that the cold of the prairie was death to man pointing to a caravan of graincarriers that awaited our escort i then spoke of starting next morning still they hesitated at length darkness came on and knowing it to be a mere waste of time to debate over night about dangers to be faced next day i ate my dates and drank my milk and lay down to enjoy tranquil sleep in the deep silence of the desert  the morning of the 23rd of january found my companions as usual in a state of faintheartedness the hammal was deputed to obtain permission for fetching the gerad and all the gerads men this was positively refused i could not however object to sending sundry tobes to the cunning idiot in order to back up a verbal request for the escort thereupon yusuf dera madar farih and the other worthies took leave promising to despatch the troop before noon i saw them depart with pleasure feeling that we had bade adieu to the girhis the greatest danger we had run was from the gerad adan a fact of which i was not aware till some time after my return to berberah he had always been plotting an avanie which if attempted would have cost him dear but at the same time would certainly have proved fatal to us  noon arrived but no cavalry my companions had promised that if disappointed they would start before nightfall and march till morning but when the camels were sent for one as usual if delay was judged advisable had strayed they went in search of him so as to give time for preparation to the caravan i then had a sharp explanation with my men and told them in conclusion that it was my determination to cross the prairie alone if necessary on the morrow  that night heavy clouds rolled down from the gurays hills and veiled the sky with a deeper gloom presently came a thin streak of blue lightning and a roar of thunder which dispersed like flies the mob of gazers from around my gurgi then rain streamed through our hut as though we had been dwelling under a system of cullenders deenarzade declared herself too ill to move shehrazade swore that she would not work briefly that night was by no means pleasantly spent  at dawn on the 24th we started across the marar prairie with a caravan of about twenty men and thirty women driving camels carrying grain asses and a few sheep the long straggling line gave a wide berth to the doughty hirsi and his berteris whose campfires were clearly visible in the morning grey the air was raw piles of purple cloud settled upon the hills whence cold and damp gusts swept the plain sometimes we had a shower at others a scotch mist which did not fail to penetrate our thin raiment my people trembled and their teeth chattered as though they were walking upon ice in our slow course we passed herds of quagga and gazelles but the animals were wild and both men and mules were unequal to the task of stalking them about midday we closed up for our path wound through the valley wooded with acaciafittest place for an ambuscade of archers we dined in the saddle on huge lumps of sundried beef and bits of gum gathered from the trees  having at length crossed the prairie without accident the caravan people shook our hands congratulated one another and declared that they owed their lives to us about an hour after sunset we arrived at abtidons home a large kraal at the foot of the konti cone fear of lions drove my people into the enclosure where we passed a night of scratching i was now haunted by the dread of a certain complaint for which sulphur is said to be a specific this is the pest of the inner parts of somaliland the people declare it to arise from flies and fleas the european would derive it from the deficiency or rather the impossibility of ablutions  allah help the goer but the return is rolling this adage was ever upon the end of times tongue yet my fate was apparently an exception to the general rule on the 25th january we were delayed by the weakness of the camels which had been half starved in the girhi mountains and as we were about to enter the lands of the habr awal 5 then at blood feud with my men all habr gerhajis probably a week would elapse before we could provide ourselves with a fit and proper protector already i had been delayed ten days after the appointed time my comrades at berberah would be apprehensive of accidents and although starting from wilensi we had resolved to reach the coast within the fortnight a months march was in clear prospect  whilst thus chewing the cud of bitter thought where thought was of scant avail suddenly appeared the valiant beuh sent to visit us by dahabo his gay sister he informed us that a guide was in the neighbourhood and the news gave me an idea i proposed that he should escort the women camels and baggage under command of the kalendar to zayla whilst we mounting our mules and carrying only our arms and provisions for four days might push through the lands of the habr awal after some demur all consented  it was not without apprehension that i pocketed all my remaining provisions five biscuits a few limes and sundry lumps of sugar any delay or accident to our mules would starve us in the first place we were about to traverse a desert and secondly where habr awal were they would not sell meat or milk to habr gerhajis my attendants provided themselves with a small provision of sundried beef grain and sweetmeats only one waterbottle however was found amongst the whole party we arose at dawn after a wet night on the 26th january but we did not start till 7 am the reason being that all the party the kalendar shehrazade and deenarzade claimed and would have his and her several and distinct palaver  having taken leave of our friends and property 6 we spurred our mules and guided by beuh rode through cloud and mist towards koralay the saddleback hill after an hours trot over rugged ground falling into the harawwah valley we came to a gudabirsi village where my companions halted to inquire the news also to distend their stomachs with milk thence we advanced slowly as the broken path required through thickets of wild henna to the kraal occupied by beuhs family at a distance we were descried by an old acquaintance fahi who straightways began to dance like a little polyphemus his shockwig waving in the air plentiful potations of milk again delayed my companions who were now laying in a four days stock  remounting we resumed our journey over a mass of rock and thicket watered our mules at holes in a fiumara and made our way to a village belonging to the ugaz or chief of the gudabirsi tribe he was a middle aged man of ordinary presence and he did not neglect to hold out his hand for a gift which we could not but refuse halting for about an hour we persuaded a guide by the offer of five dollars and a pair of cloths to accompany us dubayrthe donkeywho belonged to the bahgobo clan of the habr awal was a long lankin unable like all these bedouins to endure fatigue he could not ride the saddle cut him and he found his mule restive lately married he was incapacitated for walking and he suffered sadly from thirst the donkey little knew when he promised to show berberah on the third day what he had bound himself to perform after the second march he was induced only by the promise of a large present and one continual talk of food to proceed and often he threw his lengthy form upon the ground groaning that his supreme hour was at hand in the land which we were to traverse every mans spear would be against us by way of precaution we ordered our protector to choose desert roads and carefully to avoid all kraals at first not understanding our reasons and ever hankering after milk he could not pass a thorn fence without eyeing it wistfully on the next day however he became more tractable and before reaching berberah he showed himself in consequence of some old blood feud more anxious even than ourselves to avoid villages  remounting under the guidance of the donkey we resumed our eastward course he was communicative even for a somali and began by pointing out on the right of the road the ruins of a stonebuilding called as customary in these countries a fort beyond it we came to a kraal whence all the inhabitants issued with shouts and cries for tobacco three oclock pm brought us to a broad fiumara choked with the thickest and most tangled vegetation we were shown some curious old galla wells deep holes about twenty feet in diameter excavated in the rock some were dry others overgrown with huge creepers and one only supplied us with tolerable water the gudabirsi tribe received them from the girhi in lieu of bloodmoney beyond this watercourse the ground belongs to the rer yunis jibril a powerful clan of the habr awal and the hills are thickly studded with thornfence and kraal  without returning the salutations of the bedouins who loudly summoned us to stop and give them the news we trotted forwards in search of a deserted sheepfold at sunset we passed upon an eminence on our left the ruins of an ancient settlement called after its patron saint ao barhe and both sides of the mountain road were flanked by tracts of prairieland beautifully purpling in the evening air after a ride of thirtyfive miles we arrived at a large fold where by removing the inner thornfences we found fresh grass for our starving beasts the night was raw and windy and thick mists deepened into a drizzle which did not quench our thirst but easily drenched the saddle cloths our only bedding in one sense however the foul weather was propitious to us our track might easily have been followed by some enterprising son of yunis jibril these tracts of thorny bush are favourite places for cattle lifting moreover the fire was kept blazing all night yet our mules were not stolen  we shook off our slumbers before dawn on the 27th i remarked near our restingplace one of those detached heaps of rock common enough in the somali country at one extremity a huge block projects upwards and suggests the idea of a gigantic canine tooth the donkey declared that the summit still bears traces of building and related the legend connected with moga medir 7 there in times of old dwelt a galla maiden whose eye could distinguish a plundering party at the distance of five days march the enemies of her tribe after sustaining heavy losses hit upon the expedient of an attack not en chemise but with their heads muffled in bundles of hay when moga the maiden informed her sire and clan that a prairie was on its way towards the hill they deemed her mad the manoeuvre succeeded and the unhappy seer lost her life the legend interested me by its wide diffusion the history of zarka the blueeyed witch of the jadis tribe who seized yemamah by her gramarye and our scotch tale of birnam woods march are asiatic and european facsimiles of african mogas tooth  at 7 am we started through the mist and trotted eastwards in search of a well the guide had deceived us the day before he had promised water at every half mile he afterwards owned with groans that we should not drink before nightfall these people seem to lie involuntarily the habit of untruth with them becomes a second nature they deceive without object for deceit and the only way of obtaining from them correct information is to inquire receive the answer and determine it to be diametrically opposed to fact  i will not trouble you dear l with descriptions of the uniform and uninteresting scenery through which we rodehorrid hills upon which withered aloes brandished their spears plains apparently rained upon by a shower of stones and rolling ground abounding only with thorns like the waitabits of kafir land created to tear mans skin or clothes our toil was rendered doubly toilsome by the eastern travellers dreadthe demon of thirst rode like care behind us for twentyfour hours we did not taste water the sun parched our brains the mirage mocked us at every turn and the effect was a species of monomania as i jogged along with eyes closed against the fiery air no image unconnected with the want suggested itself water ever lay before mewater lying deep in the shady wellwater in streams bubbling icy from the rockwater in pellucid lakes inviting me to plunge and revel in their treasures now an indian cloud was showering upon me fluid more precious than molten pearl then an invisible hand offered a bowl for which the mortal part would gladly have bartered years of life thendrear contrasti opened my eyes to a heat reeking plain and a sky of that eternal metallic blue so lovely to painter and poet so blank and deathlike to us whose greek kalon was tempest rainstorm and the huge purple nimbus i tried to talkit was in vain to sing in vain vainly to think every idea was bound up in one subject water 8  as the sun sank into the east we descended the wide gogaysa valley with unspeakable delight we saw in the distance a patch of lively green our animals scented the blessing from afar they raised their drooping ears and started with us at a canter till turning a corner we suddenly sighted sundry little wells to spring from the saddle to race with our mules who now feared not the crumbling sides of the pits to throw ourselves into the muddy pools to drink a long slow draught and to dash the water over our burning faces took less time to do than to recount a calmer inspection showed a necessity for cautionthe surface was alive with tadpoles and insects prudence however had little power at that time we drank and drank and then drank again as our mules had fallen with avidity upon the grass i proposed to pass a few hours near the well my companions however pleading the old fear of lions led the way to a deserted kraal upon a neighbouring hill we had marched about thirty miles eastward and had entered a safe country belonging to the bahgoba our guides clan  at sunrise on the 28th of january the donkey whose limbs refused to work was lifted into the saddle declaring that the white man must have been sent from heaven as a special curse upon the children of ishak we started after filling the waterbottle down the gogaysa valley our mules were becoming footsore and the saddles had already galled their backs we were therefore compelled to the additional mortification of travelling at snails pace over the dreary hills and through the uninteresting bush  about noon we entered wady danan or the sour a deep chasm in the rocks the centre is a winding sandy watercourse here and there grassy with tall rushes and affording at every half mile a plentiful supply of sweet water the walls of the ravine are steep and rugged and the thorny jungle clustering at the sides gives a wild appearance to the scene traces of animals quagga and gazelle every where abounded not being however in dianic humour and unwilling to apprise bedouins of our vicinity i did not fire a shot as we advanced large trees freshly barked and more tender plants torn up by the roots showed the late passage of a herd of elephants my mule though the bravest of our beasts was in a state of terror all the way the little grey honeybird 9 tempted us to wander with all his art now he sat upon the nearest tree chirping his invitation to a feast then he preceded us with short jerking flights to point out the path my people however despite the fondness for honey inherent in the somali palate 10 would not follow him deciding that on this occasion his motives for inviting us were not of the purest  emerging from the valley we urged on our animals over comparatively level ground in the fallacious hope of seeing the sea that night the trees became rarer as we advanced and the surface metallic in spots the path led over ironstone that resembled slag in other places the soil was ochrecoloured 11 the cattle lick it probably on account of the aluminous matter with which it is mixed everywhere the surface was burnt up by the sun and withered from want of rain towards evening we entered a broad slope called by the somal dihh murodi or murodilay the elephants valley crossing its breadth from west to east we traversed two fiumaras the nearer hamar the further las dorhhay or the tamarisk waterholes they were similar in appearance the usual wady about 100 yards wide pearly sand lined with borders of leek green pitted with dry wells around which lay heaps of withered thorns and a herd of gazelles tripping gracefully over the quartz carpet  after spanning the valley we began to ascend the lower slopes of a high range whose folds formed like a curtain the bold background of the view this is the landward face of the ghauts over which we were to pass before sighting the sea masses of cold grey cloud rolled from the tableformed summit we were presently shrouded in mist and as we advanced rain began to fall the light of day vanishing we again descended into a fiumara with a tortuous and rocky bed the main drain of the landward mountain side my companions now halfstarvedthey had lived through three days on a handful of dates and sweetmeatsdevoured with avidity the wild jujube berries that strewed the stones the guide had preceded us when we came up with him he was found seated upon a grassy bank on the edge of the rugged torrent bed we sprang in pleased astonishment from the saddle dire had been the anticipations that our mulesone of them already required driving with the spearwould after another night of starvation leave us to carry their loads upon our own hacks the cause of the phenomenon soon revealed itself in the rock was a hole about two feet wide whence a crystal sheet welled over the fiumara bank forming a paradise for frog and tadpole this gaangal is considered by the somal a fairies well all however that the donkey could inform me was that when the nomads settle in the valley the water sinks deep below the eartha knot which methinks might be unravelled without the interposition of a god the same authority declared it to be the work of the old ancient arabs  the mules fell hungrily upon the succulent grass and we with the most frugal of suppers prepared to pass the rainy night presently however the doves and katas 12 the only birds here requiring water approached in flights and fearing to drink fluttered around us with shrill cries they suggested to my companions the possibility of being visited in sleep by more formidable beasts and even man after a short halt an advance was proposed and this was an offer which on principle i never refused we remounted our mules now refreshed and in good spirits and began to ascend the stony face of the eastern hill through a thick mist deepening the darkness as we reached the bleak summit a heavy shower gave my companions a pretext to stop they readily found a deserted thorn fence in which we passed a wet night that day we had travelled at least thirty five miles without seeing the face of man the country was parched to a cinder for want of water and all the nomads had migrated to the plains  the morning of the 29th january was unusually fine the last nights rain hung in masses of mist about the hillsides and the rapid evaporation clothed the clear background with deep blue we began the day by ascending a steep goattrack it led to a sandy fiumara overgrown with jujubes and other thorns abounding in water and showing in the rocky sides caverns fit for a race of troglodytes pursuing the path over a stony valley lying between parallel ranges of hill we halted at about 10 am in a large patch of grassland the produce of the rain which for some days past had been fertilising the hilltops whilst our beasts grazed greedily we sat under a bush and saw far beneath us the low country which separates the ghauts from the sea through an avenue in the rolling nimbus we could trace the long courses of fiumaras and below where mist did not obstruct the sight the tawny plains cut with watercourses glistening white shone in their eternal summer  shortly after 10 am we resumed our march and began the descent of the ghauts by a ravine to which the guide gave the name of kadar no sandy watercourse the pass of this barbarous land here facilitates the travellers advance the rapid slope of the hill presents a succession of blocks and boulders piled one upon the other in rugged steps apparently impossible to a laden camel this ravine the splugen of somaliland led us after an hours ride to the wady duntu a gigantic mountaincleft formed by the violent action of torrents the chasm winds abruptly between lofty walls of syenite and pink granite glittering with flaky mica and streaked with dykes and veins of snowy quartz the strata of the sandstones that here and there projected into the bed were wonderfully twisted around a central nucleus as green boughs might be bent about a tree above the hilltops towered in the air here denuded of vegetable soil by the heavy monsoon there clothed from base to brow with gum trees whose verdure was delicious to behold the channel was now sandy then flagged with limestone in slippery sheets or horrid with rough boulders at times the path was clear and easy at others a precipice of twenty or thirty feet which must be a little cataract after rain forced us to fight our way through the obstinate thorns that defended some spur of ragged hill as the noontide heat concentrated in this funnel began to affect man and beast we found a granite block under whose shady brow clear water oozing from the sand formed a natural bath and sat there for a while to enjoy the spectacle and the atmosphere perfumed as in part of persia and northern arabia by the aromatic shrubs of the desert  after a short halfhour we remounted and pursued our way down the duntu chasm as we advanced the hills shrank in size the bed became more level and the walls of rock gradually widening out sank into the plain brisk and elastic above the air here soft damp and tepid and the sun burning with a more malignant heat convinced us that we stood once more below the ghauts for two hours we urged our mules in a southeast direction down the broad and winding fiumara taking care to inspect every well but finding them all full of dry sand then turning eastwards we crossed a plain called by the donkey battaladayti taranaythe flats of taranayan exact representation of the maritime regions about zayla herds of camels and flocks of milky sheep browsing amongst thorny acacia and the tufted kulan suggested pleasing visions to starving travellers and for the first time after three days of hard riding we saw the face of man the shepherds mikahil of the habr awal tribe all fled as we approached at last one was bold enough to stand and deliver the news my companions were refreshed by good reports there had been few murders and the seaboard was tolerably clear of our doughty enemies the ayyal ahmed we pricked over the undulating growth of parched grass shaping our course for jebel almis to sailors the chief landmark of this coast and for a certain thin blue stripe on the far horizon upon which we gazed with gladdened eyes  our road lay between low brown hills of lime and sandstone the subghauts forming a scattered line between the maritime mountains and the sea presently the path was choked by dense scrub of the arman acacia its yellow blossoms scented the air but hardly made amends for the injuries of a thorn nearly two inches long and tipped with a wooden point sharp as a needle emerging towards evening from this bush we saw large herds of camels and called their guardians to come and meet us for all reply they ran like ostriches to the nearest rocks tittering the cry of alarm and when we drew near each man implored us to harry his neighbours cattle throughout our wanderings in somaliland this had never occurred it impressed me strongly with the disturbed state of the regions inhabited by the habr awal after some time we persuaded a bedouin who with frantic gestures was screaming and flogging his camels to listen reassured by our oaths he declared himself to be a bahgoba and promised to show us a village of the ayyal gedid the hammal who had married a daughter of this clan and had constituted his fatherinlaw my protector at berberah made sure of a hospitable reception tonight we shall sleep under cover and drink milk quoth one hungry man to another who straightways rejoined and we shall eat mutton  after dark we arrived at a kraal we unsaddled our mules and sat down near it indulging in epicurean anticipations opposite us by the door of a hut was a group of men who observed our arrival but did not advance or salute us impatient i fired a pistol when a gruff voice asked why we disturbed the camels that were being milked we have fallen upon the ayyal shirdonour bitterest enemieswhispered the end of time the same voice then demanded in angrier accents of what tribe be ye we boldly answered of the habr gerhajis thereupon ensued a war of words the ayyal shirdon inquired what we wanted where we had been and how we dared seeing that peace had not been concluded between the tribes to enter their lands we replied civilly as our disappointment would permit but apparently gained little by soft words the inhospitable bedouins declared our arrival to be in the seventeenth house of geomancyan advent probable as the greek kalendsand rudely insisted upon knowing what had taken us to harar at last a warrior armed with two spears came to meet us and bending down recognized the end of time after a few short sentences he turned on his heel and retired i then directed long guled to approach the group and say that a traveller was at their doors ready and willing to give tobacco in exchange for a draught of milk they refused pointblank and spoke of fighting we at once made ready with our weapons and showing the plain bade them come on and receive a belly full during the lull which followed this obliging proposal we saddled our mules and rode off in the grimmest of humours loudly cursing the craven churls who knew not the value of a guest  we visited successively three villages of the ayyal gedid the hammal failed to obtain even a drop of water from his connexions and was taunted accordingly he explained their inhospitality by the fact that all the warriors being at berberah the villages contained nothing but women children servants and flocks the donkey when strictly questioned declared that no well nearer than bulhar was to be found as men and mules were faint with thirst i determined to push forward to water that night many times the animals were stopped a mute hint that they could go no further i spurred onwards and the rest as on such occasions they had now learned to do followed without a word our path lay across a plain called banka hadla intersected in many places by deep watercourses and thinly strewed with kulan clumps the moon arose but cast a cloudveiled and uncertain light our path moreover was not clear as the guide worn out by fatigue tottered on far in the rear  about midnight we hearddelightful soundthe murmur of the distant sea revived by the music we pushed on more cheerily at last the donkey preceded us and about 3 am we found in a fiumara some holes which supplied us with bitter water truly delicious after fifteen hours of thirst repeated draughts of the element which the late rains had rendered potable relieved our pain and hard by we found a place where coarse stubbly grass saved our mules from starvation then rain coming on we coiled ourselves under the saddle cloths and reckless alike of ayyal ahmed and ayyal shirdon slept like the dead  at dawn on the 30th january i arose and inspected the site of bulhar it was then deserted a huge heap of bleached bones being the only object suggestive of a settlement this at different times has been a thriving place owing to its roadstead and the feuds of berberah it was generally a village of gurgis with some stonehouses built by arabs the coast however is open and havenless and the shimal wind feared even at the great port here rages with resistless violence yet the place revives when plundering parties render the plain unsafe the timid merchants here embark their goods and persons whilst their camels are marched round the bay  mounting at 6 am we started slowly along the sea coast and frequently halted on the bushy fiumaracut plain about noon we bathed in the sea and sat on the sands for a while my people praying for permission to pass the kraals of their enemies the ayyal ahmed by night this their last request was graciously granted to say sooth rapid travelling was now impossible the spear failed to urge on one mule and the hammal was obliged to flog before him another wretched animal we then traversed an alluvial plain lately flooded where slippery mud doubled the fatigue of our cattle and at 3 pm again halted on a patch of grass below the rocky spur of dabasenis a hill half way between bulhar and berberah on the summit i was shown an object that makes travellers shudder a thorn tree under which the habr gerhajis 13 and their friends of the eesa musa sit vulturelike on the lookout for plunder and murder advancing another mile we came to some wells where we were obliged to rest our animals having there finished our last mouthful of food we remounted and following the plain eastward prepared for a long nightmarch  as the light of day waned we passed on the right hand a tableformed hill apparently a detached fragment of the subghauts or coast range this spot is celebrated in local legends as auliya kumbo the mount of saints where the fortyfour arab santons sat in solemn conclave before dispersing over the somali country to preach el islam it lies about six hours of hard walking from berberah  at midnight we skirted bulho faranji the franks wateringplace 14 a strip of ground thickly covered with trees abounding in grass and water it has been the site of a village when we passed it however all was desert by the moons light we descried as we silently skirted the sea the kraals and folds of our foe the ayyal ahmed and at times we could distinguish the lowing of their cattle my companions chuckled hugely at the success of their manoeuvre and perhaps not without reason at berberah we were afterwards informed that a shepherd in the bush had witnessed and reported our having passed when the ayyal ahmed cursed the star that had enabled us to slip unhurt through their hands  our mules could scarcely walk after every bowshot they rolled upon the ground and were raised only by the whip a last halt was called when arrived within four miles of berberah the end of time and long guled completely worn out fell fast asleep upon the stones of all the party the hammal alone retained strength and spirits the sturdy fellow talked sang and shouted and whilst the others could scarcely sit their mules he danced his wardance and brandished his spear i was delighted with his pluck  now a long dark line appears upon the sandy horizonit grows more distinct in the shades of nightthe silhouettes of shipping appear against sea and sky a cry of joy bursts from every mouth cheer boys cheer our toils here touch their end  the end of time first listened to the small still voice of caution he whispered anxiously to make no noise lest enemies might arise that my other attendants had protectors at berberah but that he the hated and feared as the locum tenens of sharmarkaythe great bete noire depended wholly upon my defence the donkey led us slowly and cautiously round the southern quarter of the sleeping town through bone heaps and jackals tearing their unsavoury prey at last he marched straight into the quarter appropriated to the ayyal gedid our protectors anxiously i inquired if my comrades had left berberah and heard with delight that they awaited me there it was then 2 am and we had marched at least forty miles the somal when in fear of forays drive laden camels over this distance in about ten hours  i dismounted at the huts where my comrades were living a glad welcome a dish of rice and a glass of strong waterspardon dear l these details made amends for past privations and fatigue the servants and the wretched mules were duly provided for and i fell asleep conscious of having performed a feat which like a certain ride to york will live in local annals for many and many a year   footnotes  1 it is an arab as well as a somali ceremony to throw a little kaliyah or salul toasted grain over the honored traveller when he enters hut or tent  2 bread made of holcus grain dried and broken into bits it is thrown into broth or hot water and thus readily supplies the traveller with a wholesome panade  3 the somal invariably call berberah the sahil meaning in arabic the seashore as zayla with them is audal and harar adari  4 al nar wa la al ar an arabic maxim somewhat more forcible than our death rather than dishonor  5 this is the second great division of the somal people the father of the tribe being awal the cadet of ishak el hazrami  the habr awal occupy the coast from zayla and siyaro to the lands bordering upon the berteri tribe they own the rule of a gerad who exercises merely a nominal authority the late chiefs name was bon he died about four years ago but his children have not yet received the turban the royal race is the ayyal abdillah a powerful clan extending from the dabasanis hills to near jigjiga skirting the marar prairie  the habr awal are divided into a multitude of clans of these i shall specify only the principal the subject of the maritime somal being already familiar to our countrymen the esa musa inhabit part of the mountains south of berberah the mikahil tenant the lowlands on the coast from berberah to siyaro two large clans the ayyal yunis and the ayyal ahmed have established themselves in berberah and at bulhar besides these are the ayyal abdillah saad the ayyal geraato who live amongst the ayyal yunisthe bahgobo and the ayyal hamed  6 my property arrived safe at aden after about two months the mule left under the kalendars charge never appeared and the camels are i believe still grazing among the eesa the fair shehrazade having amassed a little fortune lost no time in changing her condition an example followed in due time by deenarzade and the kalendar after a visit to aden returned to electrify his zayla friends with long and terrible tales of travel  7 mogas eyetooth  8 as a rule twelve hours without water in the desert during hot weather kill a man i never suffered severely from thirst but on this occasion probably it was in consequence of being at the time but in weak health  9 i have never shot this feathered friend of man although frequent opportunities presented themselves he appears to be the cuculus indicator le coucou indicateur and the omshlanvo of the kafirs the somal call him maris described by father lobo and bruce he is treated as a myth by le vaillant m wiedman makes him cry shirt shirt shirt dr sparrman tcherr tcherr mr delegorgue chir chir chir his note suggested to me the shrill chirrup of a sparrow and his appearance that of a greenfinch  buffon has repeated what a traveller had related namely that the honey bird is a little traitor who conducts men into ambuscades prepared by wild beasts the lionslayer in s africa asserts it to be the belief of hottentots and the interior tribes that the bird often lures the unwary pursuer to danger sometimes guiding him to the midday retreat of a grizzly lion or bringing him suddenly upon the den of the crouching panther m delegorgue observes that the feeble bird probably seeks aid in removing carrion for the purpose of picking up flies and worms he acquits him of malice prepense believing that where the prey is there carnivorous beasts may be met  the somal however carry their superstition still farther the honeybird is never trusted by them he leads they say either to the lions den or the snakes hidingplace and often guides his victim into the jaws of the kaum or plundering party  10 the somal have several kinds of honey the donyale or wasphoney is scanty and bad it is found in trees and obtained by smoking and cutting the branch the malab shinni or beehoney is either white red or brown the first is considered the most delicate in flavour  11 the somal call it arrah as  12 the sandgrouse of egypt and arabia the rockpigeon of sindh and the surrounding countries  13 the habr gerhajis or eldest branch of the sons of ishak generally including the children of arab inhabit the ghauts behind berberah whence they extend for several days march towards ogadayn the southern region this tribe is divided into a multitude of clans the ismail arrah supply the sultan a nominal chief like the eesa ugaz they extend from makhar to the south of gulays number about 15000 shields and are subdivided into three septs the musa arrah hold the land between gulays and the seats of the mijjarthayn and warsangeli tribes on the windward coast the ishak arrah count 5000 or 6000 shields and inhabit the gulays range the other sons of arrah the fourth in descent from ishak namely mikahil gambah daudan and others also became founders of small clans the ayyal daud facetiously called idagallah or earthburrowers and sprung from the second son of gerhajis claim the country south of the habr awal reckon about 4000 shields and are divided into 11 or 12 septs  as has been noticed the habr gerhajis have a perpetual blood feud with the habr awal and even at aden they have fought out their quarrels with clubs and stones yet as cousins they willingly unite against a common enemy the eesa for instance and become the best of friends  14 so called from the mary anne brig here plundered in 1825     chap x  berberah and its environs   it is interesting to compare the earliest with the latest account of the great emporium of eastern africa  bartema writing in the sixteenth century of barbara and the island of ethiope offers the following brief descriptionafter that the tempests were appeased we gave wind to our sails and in short time arrived at an island named barbara the prince whereof is a mahometan 1 the island is not great but fruitful and well peopled it hath abundance of flesh the inhabitants are of colour inclining to black all their riches is in herds of cattle  lieut cruttenden of the i n writing in 1848 thus describes the placethe annual fair is one of the most interesting sights on the coast if only from the fact of many different and distant tribes being drawn together for a short time to be again scattered in all directions before the towers of berbera were built 2 the place from april to the early part of october was utterly deserted not even a fisherman being found there but no sooner did the season change than the inland tribes commenced moving down towards the coast and preparing their huts for their expected visitors small craft from the ports of yemen anxious to have an opportunity of purchasing before vessels from the gulf could arrive hastened across followed about a fortnight to three weeks later by their larger brethren from muscat soor and ras el khyma and the valuably freighted bagalas 3 from bahrein bussorah and graen lastly the fat and wealthy banian traders from porebunder mandavie and bombay rolled across in their clumsy kotias 3 and with a formidable row of empty ghee jars slung over the quarters of their vessels elbowed themselves into a permanent position in the front tier of craft in the harbour and by their superior capital cunning and influence soon distanced all competitors  during the height of the fair berbera is a perfect babel in confusion as in languages no chief is acknowledged and the customs of bygone days are the laws of the place disputes between the inland tribes daily arise and are settled by the spear and dagger the combatants retiring to the beach at a short distance from the town in order that they may not disturb the trade long strings of camels are arriving and departing day and night escorted generally by women alone until at a distance from the town and an occasional group of dusky and travelworn children marks the arrival of the slave cafila from hurrur and efat  at berbera the gurague and hurrur slave merchant meets his correspondent from bussorah bagdad or bunder abbas and the savage gidrbeersi gudabirsi with his head tastefully ornamented with a scarlet sheepskin in lieu of a wig is seen peacefully bartering his ostrich feathers and gums with the smoothspoken banian from porebunder who prudently living on board his ark and locking up his puggree 4 which would infallibly be knocked off the instant he was seen wearing it exhibits but a small portion of his wares at a time under a miserable mat spread on the beach  by the end of march the fair is nearly at a close and craft of all kinds deeply laden and sailing generally in parties of three and four commence their homeward journey the soori boats are generally the last to leave and by the first week in april berbera is again deserted nothing being left to mark the site of a town lately containing 20000 inhabitants beyond bones of slaughtered camels and sheep and the framework of a few huts which is carefully piled on the beach in readiness for the ensuing year beasts of prey now take the opportunity to approach the sea lions are commonly seen at the town well during the hot weather and in april last year but a week after the fair had ended i observed three ostriches quietly walking on the beach 5  of the origin of berberah little is known el firuzabadi derives it with great probability from two himyar chiefs of southern arabia 6 about ad 522 the troops of anushirwan expelled the abyssinians from yemen and reestablished there a himyari prince under vassalage of the persian monarch tradition asserts the port to have been occupied in turns by the furs 7 the arabs the turks the gallas and the somal and its future fortunes are likely to be as varied as the past  the present decadence of berberah is caused by petty internal feuds gerhajis the eldest son of ishak el hazrami seized the mountain ranges of gulays and wagar lying about forty miles behind the coast whilst awal the cadet established himself and his descendants upon the lowlands from berberah to zayla both these powerful tribes assert a claim to the customs and profits of the port on the grounds that they jointly conquered it from the gallas 8 the habr awal however being in possession would monopolize the right a blood feud rages and the commerce of the place suffers from the dissensions of the owners  moreover the habr awal tribe is not without internal feuds two kindred septs the ayyal yunis nuh and the ayyal ahmed nuh 9 established themselves originally at berberah the former though the more numerous admitted the latter for some years to a participation of profits but when aden occupied by the british rendered the trade valuable they drove out the weaker sept and declared themselves sole abbans to strangers during the fair a war ensued the sons of yunis obtained aid of the mijjarthayn tribe the sons of ahmed called in the habr gerhajis especially the musa arrah clan to which the hajj sharmarkay belongs and with his assistance defeated and drove out the ayyal yunis these flying from berberah settled at the haven of bulhar and by their old connection with the indian and other foreign traders succeeded in drawing off a considerable amount of traffic but the roadstead was insecure many vessels were lost and in 1847 the eesa somal slaughtered the women and children of the newcomers compelling them to sue the ayyal ahmed for peace though the feud thus ended the fact of its having had existence ensures bad blood amongst these savages treaties are of no avail and the slightest provocation on either side becomes a signal for renewed hostilities                                       after this dry disquisition we will return dear l to my doings at berberah  great fatigue is seldom followed by long sleep soon after sunrise i awoke hearing loud voices proceeding from a mass of black face and tawny wig that blocked up the doorway pressing forward to see their new stranger the berberah people had been informed by the donkey of our having ridden from the girhi hills in five days they swore that not only the thing was impossible but moreover that we had never sighted harar having undergone the usual catechising with credit i left the thatched hat in which my comrades were living and proceeded to inspect my attendants and cattle the former smiled blandly they had acquitted themselves of their trust they had outwitted the ayyal ahmed who would be furious thereat they had filled themselves with dates rice and sugared teaanother potent element of moral satisfactionand they trusted that a few days would show them their wives and families the end of times brow however betrayed an arriere pensee once more his cowardice crept forth and he anxiously whispered that his existence depended upon my protection the poor mules were by no means so easily restored their backs cut to the bone by the saddles stood up like those of angry cats their heads drooped sadly and their hams showed red marks of the spearpoint directing them to be washed in the sea dressed with coldwater bandages and copiously fed i proceeded to inspect the berberah plain  the mother of the poor as the arabs call the place in position resembles zayla the townif such name can be given to what is now a wretched clump of dirty mathutsis situated on the northern edge of alluvial ground sloping almost imperceptibly from the base of the southern hills the rapacity of these shortsighted savages has contracted its dimensions to about one sixth of its former extent for nearly a mile around the now desert land is strewed with bits of glass and broken pottery their ignorance has chosen the worst position mos majorum is the somali code where father built there son builds and there shall grandson build to the s and e lies a saline sandflat partially overflowed by high tides here are the wells of bitter water and the filth and garbage make the spot truly offensive northwards the seastrand has become a huge cemetery crowded with graves whose dimensions explain the somali legend that once there were giants in the land tradition assigns to it the name of bunder abbas westward close up to the town runs the creek which forms the wealth of berberah a long strip of sand and limestonethe general formation of the coastdefends its length from the northern gales the breadth is about three quarters of a mile and the depth varies from six to fifteen fathoms near the ras or spit at which ships anchor before putting out to sea  behind the town and distant about seven miles lie the subghauts a bold background of lime and sandstone through a broad gap called duss malablay 10 appear in fine weather the granite walls of wagar and gulays whose altitude by aneroid was found to be 5700 feet above the level of the sea 11 on the eastward the berberah plain is bounded by the hills of siyaro and westwards the heights of dabasenis limit the prospect 12  it was with astonishment that i reflected upon the impolicy of having preferred aden to this place  the emporium of eastern africa has a salubrious climate 13 abundance of sweet watera luxury to be fully appreciated only after a residence at aden 14a mild monsoon a fine open country an excellent harbour and a soil highly productive it is the meetingplace of commerce has few rivals and with half the sums lavished in arabia upon engineer follies of stone and lime the environs might at this time have been covered with houses gardens and trees  the eye of yemen to quote carlyle is a mountain of misery towering sheer up like a bleak pisgah with outlooks only into desolation sand salt water and despair the camp is in a devils punchbowl stiflingly hot during nine months of the year and subject to alternations of sandstorm and simum without either seed water or trees as ibn batutah described it 500 years ago unproductive for want of rainnot a sparrow can exist there nor will a crow thrive 15and essentially unhealthy 16 our loss in operatives is only equalled by our waste of rupees and the general wish of western india is that the extinct sea of fire would vesuviuslike once more convert this dismal cape into a living crater  after a days restphysical not spiritual for the somal were as usual disputing violently about the abbanship 17i went with my comrades to visit an interesting ruin near the town on the way we were shown pits of coarse sulphur and alum mixed with sand in the low lands senna and colocynth were growing wild after walking a mile southsoutheast from present berberah to a rise in the plain we found the remains of a small building about eight yards square divided into two compartments it is apparently a mosque one portion the sole of which is raised shows traces of the prayer niche the other might have contained the tomb of some saint now obsolete or might have been a fort to protect a neighbouring tank the walls are of rubble masonry and mud revetted with a coating of cement hard as stone and mixed with small round pebbles 18 near it is a shallow reservoir of stone and lime about five yards by ten proved by the aqueduct part of which still remains to be a tank of supply removing the upper slabs we found the interior lined with a deposit of sulphate of lime and choked with fine drift sand the breadth is about fifteen inches and the depth nine after following it fifty yards toward the hills we lost the trace the loose stones had probably been removed for graves and the soil may have buried the firmer portion  mounting our mules we then rode in a southsoutheast direction towards the dubar hills the surface of the ground apparently level rises about 100 feet per mile in most parts a soft sand overlying hard loam like work en pise limestone and coralline it shows evidences of inundation waterworn stones of a lime almost as compact as marble pieces of quartz selenite basalt granite and syenite in nodules are everywhere sprinkled over the surface 19 here and there torrents from the hills had cut channels five or six feet below the level and a thicker vegetation denoted the lines of bed the growth of wild plants scanty near the coast became more luxuriant as we approached the hills the arman acacia flourished the kulan tree grew in clumps and the tamarisk formed here and there a dense thicket except a few shy antelope 20 we saw no game  a ride of seven or eight miles led us to the dry bed of a watercourse overgrown with bright green rushes and known to the people as dubar wena or great dubar this strip of ground about half a mile long collects the drainage of the hills above it numerous las or pits in the centre of the bed four or five feet deep abundantly supply the flocks and herds although the surface of the ground where dry was white with impure nitre the water tasted tolerably sweet advancing half a mile over the southern shoulder of a coarse and shelly mass of limestone we found the other rushy swamp called dubar yirr or little dubar a spring of warm and bitter water flowed from the hill over the surface to a distance of 400 or 500 yards where it was absorbed by the soil the temperature of the sources immediately under the hill was 106° fahr the thermometer standing at 80° in the air and the aneroid gave an altitude of 728 feet above the sea  the rocks behind these springs were covered with ruins of mosques and houses we visited a little tower commanding the source it was built in steps the hill being cut away to form the two lower rooms and the second story showed three compartments the material was rubble and the form resembled galla buildings we found however fine mortar mixed with coarse gravel bits of glass bottles and blue glazed pottery articles now unknown to this part of africa on the summit of the highest peak our guides pointed out remains of another fort similar to the old turkish watchtowers at aden  about three quarters of a mile from the little dubar we found the head of the berberah aqueduct thrown across a watercourse apparently of low level it is here more substantially built than near the beach and probably served as a force pipe until the water found a fall we traced the line to a distance of ten yards where it disappeared beneath the soil and saw nothing resembling a supplytank except an irregularly shaped natural pool 21  a few days afterwards accompanied by lieut herne i rode out to inspect the biyu gora or nightrunning water after advancing about ten miles in a southeast direction from berberah we entered rough and broken ground and suddenly came upon a fiumara about 250 yards broad the banks were fringed with brab and tamarisk the daum palm and green rushes a clear sparkling and shallow stream bisected the sandy bed and smaller branches wandered over the surface this river the main drain of the ghauts and subghauts derives its name from the increased volume of the waters during night evaporation by day causes the absorption of about a hundred yards we found its temperature 73° fahr in the air 78° and our people dug holes in the sand instead of drinking from the stream a proof that they feared leeches 22 the taste of the water was bitter and nauseous 23  following the course of the biyu gora through two low parallel ranges of conglomerate we entered a narrow gorge in which lime and sandstone abound the dip of the strata is about 45° west the strike north and south water springs from under every stone drops copiously from the shelves of rock oozes out of the sand and bubbles up from the mould the temperature is exceedingly variable in some places the water is icy cold in others the thermometer shows 68° fahr in others 101°the maximum when we visited it being 126° the colours are equally diverse here the polished surface of the sandstone is covered with a hoar of salt and nitre 24 there where the stream does not flow are pools dyed greenishblack or rustred by iron sediment the gorges sides are a vivid red a peculiar creeper hangs from the rocks and water trickles down its metallic leaves the upper cliffs are crowned with tufts of the dragonsblood tree  leaving our mules with an attendant we began to climb the rough and rocky gorge which as the breadth diminishes becomes exceedingly picturesque in one part the side of a limestone hill hundreds of feet in height has slipped into the chasm half filling it with gigantic boulders through these the noisy stream whirls now falling in small cascades then gliding over slabs of sheet rock here it cuts grooved channels and deep basins clean and sharp as artificial baths in the sandstone there it flows quietly down a bed of pure sparkling sand the high hills above are of a tawny yellow the huge boulders grisly white bear upon their summits the drift wood of the last years inundation during the monsoon when a furious torrent sweeps down from the wagar hills this chasm must afford a curiously wild spectacle  returning from a toilsome climb we found some of the ayyal ahmed building near the spot where biyu gora is absorbed the usual small stone tower the fact had excited attention at berberah the erection was intended to store grain but the suspicious savages the eesa musa and mikahil who hold the land saw in it an attempt to threaten their liberties on our way home we passed through some extensive cemeteries the tombs were in good preservation there was nothing peculiar in their construction yet the somal were positive that they belonged to a race preceding their own near them were some ruins of kilnscomparatively modern for bits of charcoal were mixed with broken pieces of potteryand the oblong tracery of a dwellinghouse divided into several compartments its material was the sundried brick of central asia here a rarity  after visiting these ruins there was little to detain me at berberah the town had become intolerable the heat under a mat hut was extreme the wind and dust were almost as bad as aden and the dirt perhaps even worse as usual we had not a moments privacy arabs as well as the somal assuming the right of walking in sitting down looking hard chatting with one another and departing before the voyage however i was called upon to compose a difficulty upon the subject of abbanship the hammal had naturally constituted his fatherinlaw one burhale nuh of the ayyal gedid protector to lieut herne and myself burhale had proved himself a rascal he had been insolent as well as dishonest and had thrown frequent obstacles in his employers way yet custom does not permit the abban to be put away like a wife and the hammals services entitled him to the fullest consideration on the other hand jami hasan a chief and a doughty man of the ayyal ahmed had met me at aden early in 1854 and had received from me a ring in token of abbanship during my absence at harar he had taken charge of lieut stroyan on the very morning of my arrival he came to the hut sat down spear in hand produced the ring and claimed my promise in vain i objected that the token had been given when a previous trip was intended and that the hammal must not be disappointed jami replied that once an abban always an abban that he hated the hammal and all his tribe and that he would enter into no partnership with burhale nuhto complicate matters lieut stroyan spoke highly of his courage and conduct presently he insisted rudely upon removing his protege to another part of the town this passed the limits of our patience and decided the case against him  for some days discord raged between the rivals at last it was settled that i should choose my own abban in presence of a general council of the elders the chiefs took their places upon the shore each with his followers forming a distinct semicircle and all squatting with shield and spear planted upright in the ground when sent for i entered the circle sword in hand and sat down awaiting their pleasure after much murmuring had subsided jami asked in a loud voice who is thy protector the reply was burhale nuh knowing however how little laconism is prized by an eastafrican audience i did not fail to follow up this answer with an arabic speech of the dimensions of an average sermon and then shouldering my blade left the circle abruptly the effect was success our wild friends sat from afternoon till sunset as we finished supper one of them came in with the glad tidings of a peace conference jami had asked burhale to swear that he intended no personal offence in taking away a protege pledged to himself burhale had sworn and once more the olive waved over the braves of berberah  on the 5th february 1855 taking leave of my comrades i went on board el kasab or the reedsuch was the illomened name of our cranky craftto the undisguised satisfaction of the hammal long guled and the end of time who could scarcely believe in their departure from berberah with sound skins 25 coasting with a light breeze early after noon on the next day we arrived at siyaro a noted wateringplace for shipping about nineteen miles east of the emporium the roadstead is open to the north but a bluff buttress of limestone rock defends it from the northeast gales upon a barren strip of sand lies the material of the town two houses of stone and mud one yet unfinished the other completed about thirty years ago by farih binni a mikahil chief  some dozen bedouin spearmen mikahil of a neighbouring kraal squatted like a line of crows upon the shore to receive us as we waded from the vessel they demanded money in too authoritative a tone before allowing us to visit the wells which form their principal wealth resolved not to risk a quarrel so near berberah i was returning to moralise upon the fate of burckhardtafter a successful pilgrimage refused admittance to aarons tomb at sinaiwhen a bedouin ran to tell us that we might wander where we pleased he excused himself and his companions by pleading necessity and his leanness lent conviction to the plea  the larger well lies close to the eastern wall of the dwellinghouse it is about eighteen feet deep one third sunk through ground the other two thirds through limestone and at the bottom is a small supply of sweet clear water near it i observed some ruined tanks built with fine mortar like that of the berberah ruins the other well lies about half a mile to the westward of the former it is also dug in the limestone rock a few yards to the northeast of the building is the furzeh or customhouse whose pristine simplicity tempts me to describe ita square of ground surrounded by a dwarf rubble enclosure and provided with a proportional mosque a tabular block of coralline niched in the direction of meccah on a little eminence of rock to the westward rise ruined walls said by my companions to have been built by a frank who bought land from the mikahil and settled on this dismal strand  taking leave of the bedouins whose hearts were gladdened by a few small presents we resumed our voyage eastwards along the coast next morning we passed two broken pyramids of dark rock called dubada gumbar maduthe two black hills after a tedious days sail twenty miles in twentyfour hours the captain of el kasab landed us in a creek west of aynterad a few sheepboats lay at anchor in this backbay as usual when the sea is heavy at the roadstead and the crews informed us that a body of bedouins was marching to attack the village abdy mohammed diban proprietor of the aynterad fort having constituted me his protector and remained at berberah i armed my men and ordering the captain of the reed to bring his vessel round at early dawn walked hurriedly over the three miles that separated us from the place arrived at the fort we found that abdys slaves knew nothing of the reported attack they received me however hospitably and brought a supper of their only provision vile dates and dried meat unwilling to diminish the scanty store the hammal and i but dipped our hands in the dish long guled and the end of time however soon cleared the platters while abusing roundly the unpalatable food after supper a dispute arose between the hammal and one of the habr tul jailah the tribe to whom the land belongs the bedouin not liking my looks proposed to put his spear into me the hammal objected that if the measure were carried out he would return the compliment in kind ensued a long dispute and the listeners laughed heartily at the utter indifference with which i gave ear when it concluded amicably as may be expected the slaves spread a carpet upon a coarse berberah couch and having again vented their hilarity in a roar of laughter left me to sleep  we had eaten at least one sheep per diem and mutton baked in the ships oven is delicious to the somali mouth remained on board another dinner a circumstance which possibly influenced the weak mind of the captain of the reed awaking at dawn i went out expecting to find the vessel within stones throw it was nowhere visible about 8 am it appeared in sight a mere speck upon the seahorizon and whilst it approached i inspected the settlement  aynterad an inconsiderable place lying eastnortheast of and about forty miles from berberah is a favourite roadstead principally on account of its water which rivals that of siyaro the anchorage is bad the shimal or north wind sweeps long lines of heavy wave into the open bay and the bottom is a mass of rock and sandreef the fifty sunburnt and windsoiled huts which compose the settlement are built upon a bank of sand overlying the normal limestone at the time when i visited it the male population had emigrated en masse to berberah it is principally supported by the slave trade the arabs preferring to ship their purchases at some distance from the chief emporium 26 lieut herne when he visited it found a considerable amount of black bullion in the market  the fort of aynterad erected thirty years ago by mohammed diban is a stone and mud house square and flatroofed with high windows an attempt at crenelles and for some reason intelligible only to its own vitruvius but a single bastion at the northern angle there is no well and the mass of huts cluster close to the walls the five guns here deposited by sharmarkay when expelled from berberah stand on the ground outside the fort which is scarcely calculated to bear heavy carronades they are unprovided with balls but that is a trifle where pebbles abound moreover abdys slaves are well armed with matchlock and pistol and the bedouin tul jailah 27 find the spear ineffectual against stone walls the garrison has frequently been blockaded by its troublesome neighbours whose prowess however never extended beyond preliminaries  to allay my impatience that morning i was invited into several huts for the purpose of drinking sour milk a malicious joy filled my soul as about noon the machiavellian captain of the reed managed to cast anchor after driving his crazy craft through a sea which the violent shimal was flinging in hollow curves foamfringed upon the strand i stood on the shore making signs for a canoe my desires were disregarded as long as decency admitted at last about 1 pm i found myself upon the quarterdeck  dawwir el farmanshift the yardi shouted with a voice of thunder  the answer was a general hubbub he surely will not sail in a sea like this asked the trembling captain of my companions  he will sententiously quoth the hammal with a burleigh nod  it blows wind remonstrated the rais  and if it blew fire asked the hammal with the air goguenard meaning that from the calamity of frankish obstinacy there was no refuge  a kind of deathwail arose during which to hide untimely laughter i retreated to a large drawer in the stern of the vessel called a cabin there my ears could distinguish the loud entreaties of the crew vainly urging my attendants to propose a days delay then one of the garrison accompanied by the captain who shook as with fever resolved to act forlorn hope and bring a feu denfer of phrases to bear upon the franks hard brain scarcely however had the head of the sentence been delivered before he was playfully upraised by his bushy hair and a handle somewhat more substantial carried out of the cabin and thrown like a bag of biscuit on the deck  the case was hopeless all strangers plunged into the seathe popular way of landing in east africathe anchor was weighed the ton of sail shaken out and the reed began to dip and rise in the yeasty sea laboriously as an alderman dancing a polka  for the first time in my life i had the satisfaction of seeing the somal unable to eatunable to eat mutton in seasickness and needless terror the captain crew and passengers abandoned to us all the baked sheep which we three not being believers in the evil eye ate from head to trotters with especial pleasure that night the waves broke over us the end of time occupied himself in roaring certain orisons which are reputed to calm stormy seas he desisted only when long guled pointed out that a wilder gust seemed to follow as in derision each more emphatic period the captain a noted reprobate renowned on shore for his knowledge of erotic verse and admiration of the fair sex prayed with fervour he was joined by several of the crew who apparently found the charm of novelty in the edifying exercise about midnight a sultan el bahr or seakinga species of whaleappeared close to our counter and as these animals are infamous for upsetting vessels in waggishness the sight elicited a yell of terror and a chorus of religious exclamations  on the morning of friday the 9th february 1855 we hove in sight of jebel shamsan the loftiest peak of the aden crater and ere evening fell i had the pleasure of seeing the faces of friends and comrades once more   footnotes  1 i cannot guess why bartema decided barbara to be an island except that he used insula in the sense of peninsula the town is at very high tides flooded round but the old traveller manifestly speaks of the country  2 these are the four martello towers erected upon the spot where the town of huts generally stands by the hajj sharmarkay who garrisoned them with thirty arab and negro matchlockmen they are now in ruins having been dismantled by orders from aden  3 the former is an arab craft the latter belongs to the northern coasts of western india  4 a turban  5 the wild animals have now almost entirely disappeared as will afterwards be shown the fair since 1848 has diminished to one third its former dimensions  6 this subject has been fully discussed in chap iv  7 the old persians  8 especially the seaboard habr gerbajis clansthe musa arrah the ali said and the saad yunisare interested in asserting their claims  9 yunis and ahmed were brothers children of nuh the ninth in descent from ishak el hazrami the former had four sons hosh yunis gedid yunis mahmud yunis and shirdon yunis their descendants are all known as the ayyal or progeny of yunis the ayyal ahmed nuh hold the land immediately behind the town and towards the ghauts blend with the eesa musa the mikahil claim the eastern country from siyaro to illanti a wooded valley affording good water and bad anchorage to windbound vessels  10 in the centre of the gap is a detached rock called daga malablay  11 it was measured by lt herne who remarks of this range that cold in winter as the presence of the pinetree proves and cooled in summer by the monsoon abounding in game from a spur fowl to an elephant this hill would make an admirable sanitarium unfortunately gulays is tenanted by the habr gerhajis and wagar by the eesa musa treacherous races  12 this part of somali land is a sandy plain thinly covered with thorns and bounded by two ranges the ghauts and subghauts the latter or maritime mountains begin at tajurrah and extend to karam long 46° e where they break into detached groups the distance from the coast varies from 6 to 15 miles the height from 2000 to 3000 feet and the surface is barren the rock being denuded of soil by rain the ghauts lie from 8 to 40 miles from the sea they average from 4000 to 6000 feet are thickly covered with gumarabic and frankincense trees the wild fig and the somali pine and form the seaward wall of the great tableland of the interior the northern or maritime face is precipitous the summit is tabular and slopes gently southwards the general direction is e by n and w by s there are however some spurs at the three hills termed ourat which project towards the north each portion of the plain between these ranges has some local name such as the shimberali valley extending westwards from the detached hill dimoli to gauli dinanjir and gularkar intersected with fiumaras which roll torrents during the monsoon they are covered with a scrub of thorns wild fig aloe and different kinds of cactus  13 the climate of berberah is cool during the winter and though the sun is at all times burning the atmosphere as in somali land generally is healthy in the dry season the plain is subject to great heats but lying open to the north the seabreeze is strong and regular in the monsoon the air is cloudy light showers frequently fall and occasionally heavy storms come up from the southern hills  14 i quote lieut cruttenden the berberah water has acquired a bad name because the people confine themselves to digging holes three or four feet deep in the sand about halfamile from highwater mark they are reconciled to it by its beneficial effects especially after and before a journey good water however can be procured in any of the fiumaras intersecting the plain when the hajj sharmarkays towers commanded the town wells the people sank pits in low ground a few hundred yards distant and procured a purer beverage the banyans who are particular about their potations drink the sweet produce of siyaro a roadstead about nineteen miles eastward of berberah  15 the experiment was tried by an officer who brought from bombay a batch of sparrows and crows the former died scorbutic i presume the latter lingered through an unhappy life and to judge from the absence of young refused to entail their miseries upon posterity  16 the climate of aden it may be observed has a reputation for salubrity which it does not deserve the returns of deaths prove it to be healthy for the european soldier as london and there are many who have built their belief upon the sandy soil of statistics but it is the practice of every sensible medical man to hurry his patients out of aden they die elsewheresome i believe recoverand thus the deaths caused by the crater are attributed statistically to bombay or the red sea  aden is for asiatics a hotbed of scurry and ulcer of the former disease my own corps i am informed had in hospital at one time 200 cases above the usual amount of sickness this arises from the brackish water the want of vegetables and lastly the cachexy induced by an utter absence of change diversion and excitement the ulcer is a disease endemic in southern arabia it is frequently fatal especially to the poorer classes of operatives when worn out by privation hardship and fatigue  17 the abban is now the pest of berberah before vessels have cast anchor or indeed have rounded the spit a crowd of somal eager as hotel touters may be seen running along the strand they swim off and the first who arrives on board inquires the name of the abban if there be none he touches the captain or one of the crew and constitutes himself protector for merchandise sent forward the man who conveys it becomes answerable  the system of dues has become complicated formerly the standard of value at berberah was two cubits of the blue cottonstuff called sauda this is now converted into four pice of specie dollars form the principal currency rupees are taken at a discount traders pay according to degree the lowest being one per cent taken from muscat and suri merchants the shopkeeper provides food for his abban and presents him at the close of the season with a tobe a pair of sandals and halfadozen dollars wealthy banyans and mehmans give food and raiment and before departure from 50 to 200 dollars this class however derives large profits they will lend a few dollars to the bedouin at the end of the fair on condition of receiving cent per cent at the opening of the next season travellers not transacting business must feed the protector but cannot properly be forced to pay him of course the somal take every advantage of europeans mr angelo a merchant from zanzibar resided two months at bulhar his broker of the ayyal gedid tribe and an arab who accompanied him extracted it is said 3000 dollars as a rule the abban claims one per cent on sales and purchases and two dollars per head of slaves for each bale of cloth halfadollar in coin is taken on gums and coffee the duty is one pound in twentyseven cowhides pay halfadollar each sheep and goats skins four pice and ghee about one per cent  lieut herne calculates that the total money dues during the fairseason amount to 2000 dollars and that in the present reduced state of berberah not more than 10000l worth of merchandize is sold this estimate the natives of the place declare to be considerably under the mark  18 the similarity between the persian gach and this cement which is found in many ruins about berberah has been remarked by other travellers  19 the following note by dr carter of bombay will be interesting to indian geologists  of the collection of geological specimens and fossils from berberah above mentioned lieut burton states that the latter are found on the plain of berberah and the former in the following order between the sea and the summits of mountains 600 feet high above itthat is the ridge immediate behind berberah  1 country along the coast consists of a coralline limestone tertiary formation with drifts of sand c 2 subghauts and lower ranges say 2000 feet high of sandstone capped with limestone the former preponderating 3 above the ghauts a plateau of primitive rocks mixed with sandstone granite syenite mica schiste quartz rock micaceous grit c  the fawncoloured fossils from his coralline limestone are evidently the same as those of the tertiary formation along the southeast coast of arabia and therefore the same as those of cutch and it is exceedingly interesting to find that among the bluecoloured fossils which are accompanied by specimens of the blue shale composing the beds from which they have been weathered out are species of terebratula belemnites identical with those figured in grants geology of cutch thus enabling us to extend those beds of the jurassic formation which exist in cutch and along the southeastern coast of arabia across to africa  20 these animals are tolerably tame in the morning as day advances their apprehension of man increases  21 lieut cruttenden in considering what nation could have constructed and at what period the commerce of berberah warranted so costly an undertaking is disposed to attribute it to the persian conquerors of aden in the days of anushirwan he remarks that the trade carried on in the red sea was then great the ancient emporia of hisn ghorab and aden prosperous and wealthy and berberah doubtless exported as it does now ivory gums and ostrich feathers but though all the maritime somali country abounds in traditions of the furs or ancient persians none of the buildings near berberah justify our assigning to them in a country of monsoon rain and high winds an antiquity of 1300 years  the somal assert that ten generations ago their ancestors drove out the gallas from berberah and attribute these works to the ancient pagans that nation of savages however was never capable of constructing a scientific aqueduct i therefore prefer attributing these remains at berberah to the ottomans who after the conquest of aden by sulayman pacha in ad 1538 held yemen for about 100 years and as auxiliaries of the king of adel penetrated as far as abyssinia traces of their architecture are found at zayla and harar and according to tradition they possessed at berberah a settlement called after its founder bunder abbas  22 here as elsewhere in somali land the leech is of the horsevariety it might be worth while to attempt breeding a more useful species after the manner recommended by capt r johnston the subassistant commissary general in sindh 10th april 1845 in these streams leeches must always be suspected inadvertently swallowed they fix upon the inner coat of the stomach and in northern africa have caused it is said some deaths among the french soldiers  23 yet we observed frogs and a small species of fish  24 either this or the sulphate of magnesia formed by the decomposition of limestone may account for the bitterness of the water  25 they had been in some danger a treacherous murder perpetrated a few days before our arrival had caused all the habr gerbajis to fly from the town and assemble 5000 men at bulhar for battle and murder this proceeding irritated the habr awal and certainly but for our presence the strangers would have been scurvily treated by their cousins  26 of all the slavedealers on this coast the arabs are the most unscrupulous in 1855 one mohammed of muscat a shipowner who moreover constantly visits aden bought within sight of our flag a freeborn arab girl of the yafai tribe from the akarib of bir hamid and sold her at berberah to a compatriot such a crime merits severe punishment even the abyssinians visit with hanging the christian convicted of selling a fellow religionist the arab slaver generally marries his properly as a ruse and arrived at muscat or bushire divorces and sells them free somali women have not unfrequently met with this fate  27 the habr tul jailah mother of the tribe of jailah descendants of ishak el hazrami by a slave girl inhabit the land eastward of berberah their principal settlements after aynterad are the three small ports of karam unkor and hays the former according to lieut cruttenden is the most important from its possessing a tolerable harbour and from its being the nearest point from aden the course to which place is n n w consequently the wind is fair and the boats laden with sheep for the aden market pass but one night at sea whilst those from berberah are generally three what greatly enhances the value of kurrum karam however is its proximity to the country of the dulbahanteh who approach within four days of kurrum and who therefore naturally have their chief trade through that port the ahl tusuf a branch of the habertel jahleh at present hold possession of kurrum and between them and the tribes to windward there exists a most bitter and irreconcileable feud the consequence of sundry murders perpetrated about five years since at kurrum and which hitherto have not been avenged the small ports of enterad unkor heis and rukudah are not worthy of mention with the exception of the firstnamed place which has a trade with aden in sheep     postscript   on saturday the 7th april 1855 the h e i companys schooner mahi lieut king i n commanding entered the harbour of berberah where her guns roared forth a parting salute to the somali expedition  the emporium of east africa was at the time of my landing in a state of confusion but a day before the great harar caravan numbering 3000 souls and as many cattle had entered for the purpose of laying in the usual eight months supplies and purchase barter and exchange were transacted in most hurried and unbusinesslike manner all day and during the greater part of night the town rang with the voices of buyer and seller to specify no other articles of traffic 500 slaves of both sexes were in the market 1 long lines of laden and unladen camels were to be seen pacing the glaring yellow shore rumours of plundering parties at times brought swarms of spearmen bounding and yelling like wild beasts from the town already small parties of travellers had broken ground for their return journey and the foul heap of mat hovels to which this celebrated mart had been reduced was steadily shrinking in dimensions  our little party consisted of fortytwo souls at aden i had applied officially for some welltrained somali policemen but as an increase of that establishment had been urged upon the home authorities my request was refused we were fain to content ourselves with a dozen recruits of various races egyptian nubian arab and negro whom we armed with sabres and flint muskets the other members of the expedition were our private servants and about a score of somal under our rival protectors jami hasan and burhale nuh the ras or captain of the kafilah was one mahmud of the mijjarthayn better known at aden as el balyuz or the envoy he had the reputation of being a shrewd manager thoroughly acquainted with the habits and customs as well as the geography of somaliland  our camp was pitched near the site of the proposed agency upon a rocky ridge within musketshot of the southern extremity of the creek and about three quarters of a mile distant from the town this position had been selected for the benefit of the mahis guns political exigencies required the mahi to relieve the elphinstone then blockading the seaboard of our old arab foe the fazli chief she was unable to remain upon the coast and superintend our departure a measure which i had strongly urged our tents were pitched in one line lieut stroyans was on the extreme right about a dozen paces distant was the rowtie 2 occupied by lieut herne and myself and at a similar distance on the left of the camp was that in which lieut speke slept the baggage was placed between the two latter the camels were tethered in front upon a sandy bed beneath the ridge our campingground and in rear stood the horses and mules during daytime all were on the alert at night two sentries were posted regularly relieved and visited at times by the ras and ourselves  i had little reason to complain of my reception at berberah the chiefs appeared dissatisfied with the confinement of one mohammed sammattar the abban who accompanied lieut speke to the eastern country they listened however with respectful attention to a letter in which the political resident at aden enjoined them to treat us with consideration and hospitality  there had been petty disputes with burhale nuh and the elders of the eesa musa tribe touching the hire of horsekeepers and cameldrivers such events however are not worthy to excite attention in africa my friend at harar the shaykh jami had repeatedly called upon us ate bread and salt recommended us to his fellow countrymen and used my intervention in persuading avaricious shipowners to transport gratis pauper pilgrims to arabia the people after seeing the deaths of a few elephants gradually lowered their loud boasts and brawling claims they assisted us in digging a well offered their services as guides and cameldrivers and in some cases insisted upon encamping near us for protection briefly we saw no grounds of apprehension during thirty years not an englishman of the many that had visited it had been molested at berberah and apparently there was as little to fear in it as within the fortifications of aden 3  under these favourable circumstances we might have set out at once towards the interior our camels fiftysix in number had been purchased 4 and the ogadayn caravan was desirous of our escort but we wished to witness the close of the berberah fair and we expected instruments and other necessaries by the midapril mail from europe 5  about 8 pm on the 9th april a shower accompanied by thunder and lightning came up from the southern hills where rain had been falling for some days and gave notice that the gugi or somali monsoon had begun this was the signal for the bedouins to migrate to the plateau above the hills 6 throughout the town the mats were stripped from their frameworks of stick and pole 7 the camels were laden and thousands of travellers lined the roads the next day berberah was almost deserted except by the pilgrims who intended to take ship and by merchants who fearful of plundering parties awaited the first favourable hour for setting sail our protectors jami and burhale receiving permission to accompany their families and flocks left us in charge of their sons and relations on the 15th april the last vessel sailed out of the creek and our little party remained in undisputed possession of the place  three days afterwards about noon an aynterad craft en route from aden entered the solitary harbour freighted with about a dozen somal desirous of accompanying us towards ogadayn the southern region she would have sailed that evening fortunately however i had ordered our people to feast her commander and crew with rice and the irresistible dates  at sunset on the same day we were startled by a discharge of musketry behind the tents the cause proved to be three horsemen over whose heads our guard had fired in case they might be a foraging party i reprimanded our people sharply for this act of folly ordering them in future to reserve their fire and when necessary to shoot into not above a crowd after this we proceeded to catechise the strangers suspecting them to be scouts the usual forerunners of a somali raid the reply was so plausible that even the balyuz with all his acuteness was deceived the bedouins had forged a report that their ancient enemy the hajj sharmarkay was awaiting with four ships at the neighbouring port siyaro the opportunity of seizing berberah whilst deserted and of reerecting his forts there for the third time our visitors swore by the divorceoaththe most solemn which the religious knowthat a vessel entering the creek at such unusual season they had been sent to ascertain whether it had been freighted with materials for building and concluded by laughingly asking if we feared danger from the tribe of our own protectors believing them we posted as usual two sentries for the night and retired to rest in our wonted security  between 2 and 3 am of the 19th april i was suddenly aroused by the balyuz who cried aloud that the enemy was upon us 8 hearing a rush of men like a stormy wind i sprang up called for my sabre and sent lieut herne to ascertain the force of the foray armed with a colt he went to the rear and left of the camp the direction of danger collected some of the guardothers having already disappearedand fired two shots into the assailants then finding himself alone he turned hastily towards the tent in so doing he was tripped up by the ropes and as he arose a somali appeared in the act of striking at him with a club lieut herne fired floored the man and rejoining me declared that the enemy was in great force and the guard nowhere meanwhile i had aroused lieuts stroyan and speke who were sleeping in the extreme right and left tents the former it is presumed arose to defend himself but as the sequel shows we never saw him alive 9 lieut speke awakened by the report of firearms but supposing it the normal false alarma warning to plunderershe remained where he was presently hearing clubs rattling upon his tent and feet shuffling around he ran to my rowtie which we prepared to defend as long as possible  the enemy swarmed like hornets with shouts and screams intending to terrify and proving that overwhelming odds were against us it was by no means easy to avoid in the shades of night the jobbing of javelins and the long heavy daggers thrown at our legs from under and through the opening of the tent we three remained together lieut herne knelt by my right on my left was lieut speke guarding the entrance i stood in the centre having nothing but a sabre the revolvers were used by my companions with deadly effect unfortunately there was but one pair when the fire was exhausted lieut herne went to search for his powderhorn and that failing to find some spears usually tied to the tentpole whilst thus engaged he saw a man breaking into the rear of our rowtie and came back to inform me of the circumstance  at this time about five minutes after the beginning of the affray the tent had been almost beaten down an arab custom with which we were all familiar and had we been entangled in its folds we should have been speared with unpleasant facility i gave the word for escape and sallied out closely followed by lieut herne with lieut speke in the rear the prospect was not agreeable about twenty men were kneeling and crouching at the tent entrance whilst many dusk figures stood further off or ran about shouting the warcry or with shouts and blows drove away our camels among the enemy were many of our friends and attendants the coast being open to them they naturally ran away firing a few useless shots and receiving a modicum of flesh wounds  after breaking through the mob at the tent entrance imagining that i saw the form of lieut stroyan lying upon the sand i cut my way towards it amongst a dozen somal whose warclubs worked without mercy whilst the balyuz who was violently pushing me out of the fray rendered the strokes of my sabre uncertain this individual was cool and collected though incapacitated by a sore rightthumb from using the spear he did not shun danger and passed unhurt through the midst of the enemy his efforts however only illustrated the venerable adage defend me from my friends i turned to cut him down he cried out in alarm the wellknown voice caused an instants hesitation at that moment a spearman stepped forward left his javelin in my mouth and retired before he could be punished escaping as by a miracle i sought some support many of our somal and servants lurking in the darkness offered to advance but tailed off to a man as we approached the foe presently the balyuz reappeared and led me towards the place where he believed my three comrades had taken refuge i followed him sending the only man that showed presence of mind one golab of the yusuf tribe to bring back the aynterad craft from the spit into the centre of the harbour 10 again losing the balyuz in the darkness i spent the interval before dawn wandering in search of my comrades and lying down when overpowered with faintness and pain as the day broke with my remaining strength i reached the head of the creek was carried into the vessel and persuaded the crew to arm themselves and visit the scene of our disasters  meanwhile lieut herne who had closely followed me fell back using the buttend of his discharged sixshooter upon the hard heads around him in so doing he came upon a dozen men who though they loudly vociferated kill the franks who are killing the somal allowed him to pass uninjured  he then sought his comrades in the empty huts of the town and at early dawn was joined by the balyuz who was similarly employed when day broke he sent a negro to stop the native craft which was apparently sailing out of the harbour and in due time came on board with the exception of sundry stiff blows with the warclub lieut herne had the fortune to escape unhurt  on the other hand lieut spekes escape was in every way wonderful sallying from the tent he levelled his dean and adams close to an assailants breast the pistol refused to revolve a sharp blow of a war club upon the chest felled our comrade who was in the rear and unseen when he fell two or three men sprang upon him pinioned his hands behind felt him for concealed weaponsan operation to which he submitted in some alarmand led him towards the rear as he supposed to be slaughtered there lieut speke who could scarcely breathe from the pain of the blow asked a captor to tie his hands before instead of behind and begged a drop of water to relieve his excruciating thirst the savage defended him against a number of the somal who came up threatening and brandishing their spears he brought a cloth for the wounded man to lie upon and lost no time in procuring a draught of water  lieut speke remained upon the ground till dawn during the interval he witnessed the wardance of the savagesa scene striking in the extreme the tallest and largest warriors marched in a ring round the tents and booty singing with the deepest and most solemn tones the song of thanksgiving at a little distance the grey uncertain light disclosed four or five men lying desperately hurt whilst their kinsmen kneaded their limbs poured water upon their wounds and placed lumps of dates in their stiffening hands 11 as day broke the division of plunder caused angry passions to rise the dead and dying were abandoned one party made a rush upon the cattle and with shouts and yells drove them off towards the wild some loaded themselves with goods others fought over pieces of cloth which they tore with hand and dagger whilst the disappointed vociferating with rage struck at one another and brandished their spears more than once during these scenes a panic seized them they moved off in a body to some distance and there is little doubt that had our guard struck one blow we might still have won the day  lieut spekes captor went to seek his own portion of the spoil when a somal came up and asked in hindostani what business the frank had in their country and added that he would kill him if a christian but spare the life of a brother moslem the wounded man replied that he was going to zanzibar that he was still a nazarene and therefore that the work had better be done at oncethe savage laughed and passed on he was succeeded by a second who equally compassionate whirled a sword round his head twice pretended to strike but returned to the plunder without doing damage presently came another manner of assailant lieut speke who had extricated his hands caught the spear levelled at his breast but received at the same moment a blow from a club which paralyzing his arm caused him to lose his hold in defending his heart from a succession of thrusts he received severe wounds on the back of his hand his right shoulder and his left thigh pausing a little the wretch crossed to the other side and suddenly passed his spear clean through the right leg of the wounded man the latter smelling death then leapt up and taking advantage of his assailants terror rushed headlong towards the sea looking behind he avoided the javelin hurled at his back and had the good fortune to run without further accident the gauntlet of a score of missiles when pursuit was discontinued he sat down faint from loss of blood upon a sandhill recovering strength by a few minutes rest he staggered on to the town where some old women directed him to us then pursuing his way he fell in with the party sent to seek him and by their aid reached the craft having walked and run at least three miles after receiving eleven wounds two of which had pierced his thighs a touching lesson how difficult it is to kill a man in sound health 12  when the three survivors had reached the craft yusuf the captain armed his men with muskets and spears landed them near the camp and ascertained that the enemy expecting a fresh attack had fled carrying away our cloth tobacco swords and other weapons 13 the corpse of lieut stroyan was then brought on board our lamented comrade was already stark and cold a spear had traversed his heart another had pierced his abdomen and a frightful gash apparently of a sword had opened the upper part of his forehead the body had been bruised with warclubs and the thighs showed marks of violence after death this was the severest affliction that befell us we had lived together like brothers lieut stroyan was a universal favourite and his sterling qualities of manly courage physical endurance and steady perseverance had augured for him a bright career thus prematurely cut off truly melancholy to us was the contrast between the evening when he sat with us full of life and spirits and the morning when we saw amongst us a livid corpse  we had hoped to preserve the remains of our friend for interment at aden but so rapid were the effects of exposure that we were compelled most reluctantly on the morning of the 20th april to commit them to the deep lieut herne reading the funeral service  then with heavy hearts we set sail for the near arabian shore and after a tedious two days carried to our friends the news of unexpected disaster   footnotes  1 the fairseason of 186456 began on the 16th november and may be said to have broken up on the 15th april  the principal caravans which visit berberah are from harar the western and ogadayn the southern region they collect the produce of the numerous intermediate tribes of the somal the former has been described in the preceding pages the following remarks upon the subject of the ogadayn caravan are the result of lieuts stroyan and hernes observations at berberah  large caravans from ogadayn descend to the coast at the beginning and the end of the fairseason they bring slaves from the arusa country cattle in great quantities gums of sorts clarified butter ivory ostrich feathers and rhinoceros horns to be made into handles for weapons these are bartered for coarse cotton cloth of three kinds for english and american sheeting in pieces of seventyfive sixtysix sixtytwo and fortyeight yards black and indigodyed calicos in lengths of sixteen yards nets or fillets worn by the married women iron and steel in small bars lead and zinc beads of various kinds especially white porcelain and speckled glass dates and rice  the ayyal ahmed and ayyal yunis classes of the habr awal somal have constituted themselves abbans or brokers to the ogadayn caravans and the rapacity of the patron has produced a due development of roguery in the client the principal trader of this coast is the banyan from aden find cutch facetiously termed by the somal their milchcows the african cheats by mismeasuring the bad cotton cloth and the indian by falsely weighing the coffee ivory ostrich feathers and other valuable articles which he receives in return dollars and even rupees are now preferred to the double breadth of eight cubits which constitutes the well known tobe  2 a sepoys tent penthouse shaped supported by a single transverse and two upright poles and open at one of the long ends  3 since returning i have been informed however by the celebrated abyssinian traveller m antoine dabbadie that in no part of the wild countries which he visited was his life so much perilled as at berberah  4 lieut speke had landed at karam harbour on the 24th of march in company with the ras in order to purchase camels for the ayyun or best description he paid seven dollars and a half the gel ad white camels cost on an average four in five days he had collected twentysix the number required and he then marched overland from karam to berberah  i had taken the precaution of detaching lieut speke to karam in lively remembrance of my detention for want of carriage at zayla and in consequence of a report raised by the somal of aden that a sufficient number of camels was not procurable at berberah this proved false lieuts stroyan and herne found no difficulty whatever in purchasing animals at the moderate price of five dollars and three quarters a head for the same sum they could have bought any reasonable number future travellers however would do well not to rely solely upon berberah for a supply of this necessary especially at seasons when the place is not crowded with caravans  5 the elders of the habr awal i have since been informed falsely asserted that they repeatedly urged us with warnings of danger to leave berberah at the end of the fair but that we positively refused compliance for other reasons the facts of the case are those stated in the text  6 they prefer travelling during the monsoon on account of the abundance of water  7 the framework is allowed to remain for use next fairseason  8 the attacking party it appears was 350 strong 12 of the mikahil 15 of the habr gerhajis and the rest eesa musa one ao ali wore it is said the ostrich feather for the murder of lieut stroyan  9 mohammed his indian servant stated that rising at my summons he had rushed to his tent armed himself with a revolver and fired six times upon his assassins unhappily however mohammed did not see his master fall and as he was foremost amongst the fugitives scant importance attaches to his evidence  10 at this season native craft quitting berberah make for the spit late in the evening cast anchor there and set sail with the land breeze before dawn our lives hung upon a thread had the vessel departed as she intended the night before the attack nothing could have saved us from destruction  11 the somal place dates in the hands of the fallen to ascertain the extent of injury he who cannot eat that delicacy is justly decided to be in articulo  12 in less than a month after receiving such injuries lieut speke was on his way to england he has never felt the least inconvenience from the wounds which closed up like cuts in indianrubber  13 they had despised the heavy sacks of grain the books broken boxes injured instruments and a variety of articles which they did not understand we spent that day at berberah bringing off our property and firing guns to recall six servants who were missing they did not appear having lost no time in starting for karam and aynterad whence they made their way in safety to aden on the evening of the 19th of april unable to remove the heavier effects and anxious to return with the least possible delay i ordered them to be set on fire     appendix i   diary and observations made by lieutenant speke when attempting to reach the wady nogal   diary   on the 28th october 1854 lieutenant speke arrived at kurayat a small village near las kuray goree bunder in the country called by the somal makhar or the eastern maritime region during the period of three months and a half he was enabled to make a short excursion above the coastmountains visiting the warsingali the dulbahanta and the habr gerhajis tribes and penetrating into a region unknown to europeans the bad conduct of his abban and the warlike state of the country prevented his reaching the wady nogal which under more favourable circumstances and with more ample leisure than our plans allowed him he conceives to be a work of little difficulty and no danger he has brought back with him ample notices of the region visited and has been enabled to make a valuable collection of the fauna which have been forwarded to the curator of the royal as societys museum calcutta on the 15th february 1855 lieutenant speke revisited kurayat and there embarked for aden  before proceeding to lieutenant spekes journal it may be useful to give a brief and general account of the region explored  the portion of the somali country visited by lieutenant speke may be divided into a maritime plain a range of mountains and an elevated plateau  the maritime plain at the points visited by lieutenant speke is a sandy tract overlying limestone level to the foot of the hills and varying from half a mile to two miles in breadth water is not everywhere procurable at the village of las kuray there is an old and well built well about twelve feet deep producing an abundant and excellent supply it appears that the people have no implements and are too barbarous to be capable of so simple an engineering operation as digging the vegetation presents the usual appearance of salsolaceous plants thinly scattered over the surface with here and there a stunted growth of arman or acacia the watershed is of course from south to north and the rain from the hills is carried off by a number of fiumaras or freshets with broad shallow beds denoting that much of the monsoon rain falling in the mountains is there absorbed and that little finds its way to the sea at this season the dry weather the plain is thinly inhabited there are no villages except on the seashore and even these were found by the traveller almost entirely deserted mostly women occupying the houses whilst the men were absent trading and tending cattle in the hills the harbours are generally speaking open and shallow roadsteads where ships find no protection there is however one place las galwayta where it is said deep water extends to the shore  meteorological observations show a moderate temperature clear air and a regular northeasterly wind it is probable that unlike the berberah plain the monsoon rain here falls in considerable quantities this land belongs in part to the warsingali westwards of las galwayta which is the frontier the habr gerhajis lay claim to the coast the two tribes as usual in that unhappy land are on terms of dam or bloodfeud yet they intermarry  the animals observed were the waraba a darkcoloured cynhyena with a tail partly white a grey jackal and three different kinds of antelopes besides gulls butcher birds and a description of sparrow no birds were found on the maritime plain  the range of mountains is that long line which fringes the somali coast from tajurrah to ras jerd hafun cape guardafui in the portion visited by lieutenant speke it is composed principally of limestones some white others brownish and full of fossil shells the seaward face is a gradual slope yet as usual more abrupt than the landward side especially in the upper regions steep irregular ravines divide the several masses of hill the range was thinly covered with acacia scrub in the lower folds the upper portion was thickly clad with acacia and other thorns and upon the summit the somali pine tree observed by me near harar and by lieutenant herne at gulays first appeared rain had freshly fallen  the animal creation was represented by the leopard hyena rhinoceros waraba four kinds of antelopes hares and rats tailless and longtailed it is poor in sea birds specimens of those collected have been forwarded to the as societys museum and but one description of snake was observed these hills belong partly to the warsingali and partly to the habr gerhajis the frontier is in some places denoted by piles of rough stones as usual violations of territorial right form the rule not the exception and trespass is sure to be followed by a war the meteorology of these hills is peculiar the temperature appears to be but little lower than the plain the wind was northeasterly and both monsoons bring heavy rains  at yafir on the summit of the hill lieutenant spekes thermometer showed an altitude of about 7500 feet the people of the country do not know what ice means water is very scarce in these hills except during the monsoon it is found in springs which are far apart and in the lower slopes collected rain water is the sole resource this scarcity renders the habits of the people peculiarly filthy  after descending about 2000 feet from the crest of the mountains to the southern fall lieutenant speke entered upon the platform which forms the country of the eastern somal he is persuaded that the watershed of this extensive tract is from nw to se contrary to the opinion of lieutenant cruttenden who from information derived from the somal determined the slope to be due south nogal appears according to lieutenant speke to be the name of a tract of land occupied by the warsingali the mijjarthayn and the northern clan of the dulbahantas as bohodlay in haud is inhabited by the southern nogal is a sterile table land here and there thinly grown with thorns perfectly useless for agriculture and unless it possess some mineral wealth valueless the soil is white and stony whereas haud or ogadayn is a deep red and is described as having some extensive jungles between the two lies a large watercourse called tuk der or the long river it is dry during the cold season but during the rains forms a flood tending towards the eastern ocean this probably is the line which in our maps is put down as wady nogal a very fertile and beautiful valley  the surface of the plateau is about 4100 feet above the level of the sea it is a space of rolling ground stony and white with broken limestone water is found in pools and in widely scattered springs it is very scarce and in a district near and south of the hills lieutenant speke was stopped by want of this necessary the climate appeared to our traveller delightful in some places the glass fell at 6 am to 25° yet at noon on the same day the mercury rose to 76° the wind was always n e sometimes gentle and occasionally blowing strongly but without dust the rainy monsoon must break here with violence and the heat be fearful in the hot season the principal vegetation of this plateau was acacia scarce and stunted in some places under the hills and in the watercourses these trees are numerous and well grown on the other hand extensive tracts towards the south are almost barren the natives speak of malmal myrrh and the luban incense trees the wild animals are principally antelopes there are also ostriches onagers waraba lions reported to exist jackals and vermin the bustard and florikan appear here the nomads possess large flocks of sheep the camels cows and goats being chiefly found at this season on the seaward side of the hills where forage is procurable the horses were stunted tattoos tolerably wellbred but soft for want of proper food it is said that the country abounds in horses but lieutenant speke doubts the fact the eastern portion of the plateau visited by our traveller belongs to the warsingali the western to the dulbahantas the former tribe extends to the s e whilst the latter possess the lands lying about the tuk der the nogal and haud these two tribes are at present on bad terms owing to a murder which led to a battle the quarrel has been allowed to rest till lately when it was revived at a fitting opportunity but there is no hostility between the southern dulbahantas and the warsingali on the old principle that an enemys enemy is a friend  on the 21st october 1854 lieutenant speke from the effects of a stiff easterly wind and a heavy sea made by mistake the harbour of rakudah this place has been occupied by the rer dud descendants of sambur son of ishak it is said to consist of an small fort and two or three huts of matting lately reerected about two years ago the settlement was laid waste by the rightful owners of the soil the musa abokr a subfamily of the habr tal jailah  22nd octoberwithout landing lieutenant speke coasted along to bunder hais where he went on shore hais is a harbour belonging to the musa abokr it contains a fort a singlestoried flatroofed stone and mud house about 20 feet square one of those artless constructions to which only somal could attach importance there are neither muskets nor cannon among the braves of hais the town consists of half a dozen mud huts mostly skeletons the anchoring ground is shallow but partly protected by a spur of hill and the sea abounds in fish four buggaloes native craft were anchored here waiting for a cargo of dumbah sheep and clarified butter the staple produce of the place hais exports to aden mocha and other parts of arabia it also manufactures mats with the leaves of the daum palm and other trees lieutenant speke was well received by one ali the agil or petty chief of the place he presented two sheep to the traveller on the way from bunder jedid to las kuray lieutenant speke remarks that las galwayta would be a favourable site for a somali settlement the water is deep even close to the shore and there is an easy ascent from it to the summit of the mountains the consequence is that it is coveted by the warsingali who are opposed by the present proprietors the habr gerhajis the sultan of the former family resists any settlement for fear of dividing and weakening their force it is too far from their pastures and they have not men enough for both purposes  28th octoberlieutenant speke landed at kurayat near las kuray and sent a messenger to summon the chief mohammed ali gerad or prince of the warsingali tribe  during a halt of twentyone days the traveller had an opportunity of being initiated into the mysteries of somali medicine and money hiding the people have but two cures for disease one the actual cautery the other a purgative by means of melted sheepstail followed by such a draught of camels milk that the stomach having escaped the danger of bursting is suddenly and completely relieved it is here the custom of the wealthy to bury their hoards and to reveal the secret only when at the point of death lieutenant speke went to a place where it is said a rich man had deposited a considerable sum and described his cache as being on a path in a direct line between two trees as far as the arms can reach with a stick the hoarder died between forty and fifty years ago and his children have been prevented by the rocky nature of the ground and their forgetting to ask which was the right side of the tree from succeeding in anything beyond turning up the stones  las kuray is an open roadstead for native craft the town is considered one of the principal strongholds of the coast there are three large and six small forts similar in construction to those of hais all are occupied by merchants and are said to belong to the sultan the mass of huts may be between twenty and thirty in number they are matted buildings long and flatroofed half a dozen families inhabit the same house which is portioned off for such accommodation public buildings there are none and no wall protects the place it is in the territory of the warsingali and owns the rule of the gerad or prince who sometimes lives here and at other times inhabits the jungle las kuray exports gums dumbah sheep and guano the latter considered valuable and sent to makalla in arabia to manure the date plantations  four miles westward of las kuray is kurayat also called little kuray it resembles the other settlement and is not worth description lieutenant speke here occupied a fort or stone house belong to his abban finding the people very suspicious he did not enter las kuray for prudential motives there the sultan has no habitation when he visited the place he lodged in the house of a nacoda or shipcaptain  lieutenant speke was delayed at kurayat by the pretext of want of cattle in reality to be plundered the sultan who inhabits the jungle did not make his appearance till repeatedly summoned about the tenth day the old man arrived on foot attended by a dozen followers he was carefully placed in the centre of a double line bristling with spears and marched past to his own fort lieutenant speke posted his servants with orders to fire a salute of small firearms the consequence was that the evening was spent in prayers  during lieutenant spekes first visit to the sultan who received him squatting on the ground outside the house in which he lodged with his guards about him the dignitary showed great trepidation but returned salams with politeness  he is described as a finelooking man between fortyeight and fifty years of age he was dressed in an old and dirty tobe had no turban and appeared unarmed he had consulted the claims of dignity by keeping the traveller waiting ten days whilst he journeyed twenty miles before showing himself he had privily held a durbar at las kuray it was attended by the agils of the tribe by mohammed samattar lieutenant spekes abban and the people generally here the question was debated whether the traveller was to be permitted to see the country the voice of the multitude was as usual contra fearing to admit a wolf into the fold it was silenced however by the sultan who thought fit to favour the english and by the abban who settled the question saying that he as the sultans subject was answerable for all that might happen and that the chief might believe him or nothow could such junglefolk know anything  on the morning of the 8th november the sultan returned lieutenant spekes visit the traveller took the occasion of opening his desire to visit the warsingali country and the lands on the road to berberah keeping inland about 200 miles more or less according to circumstances and passing through the dulbahantas to this the sultan replied that as far as his dominions extended the traveller was perfectly at liberty to go where he liked but as for visiting the dulbahantas he could not hear of or countenance it mahmud ali gerad or prince of the southern dulbahantas was too far away for communication and mohammed ali gerad the nearest chief had only ruled seven or eight years his power therefore was not great moreover these two were at war the former having captured it is said 2000 horses 400 camels and a great number of goats and sheep besides wounding a man during the visit which lasted from 8 am to 2 pm the sultan refused nothing but permission to cross the frontier fearing he said lest an accident should embroil him with our government lieutenant speke gave them to understand that he visited their country not as a servant of the company but merely as a traveller wishing to see sport this of course raised a laugh it was completely beyond their comprehension they assured him however that he had nothing to apprehend in the warsingali country where the sultans order was like that of the english the abban then dismissed the sultan to las kuray fearing the appetites of his followers and the guard on departure demanded a cloth each by way of honorarium this was duly refused and they departed in discontent the people frequently alluded to two grand grievances in the first place they complained of an interference on the part of our government in consequence of a quarrel which took place seven years ago at aden between them and the habr tal jailah tribe of karam the political resident it is said seized three vessels belonging to the warsingali who had captured one of the ships belonging to their enemies the former had command of the sea but since that event they have been reduced to a secondary rank this grievance appears to be based on solid grounds secondly they complained of the corruption of their brethren by intercourse with a civilised people especially by visiting aden the remedy for this evil lies in their own hands but desire of gain would doubtless defeat any moral sanitary measure which their elders could devise they instanced the state of depravity into which the somal about berberah had fallen and prided themselves highly upon their respect for the rights of meum and tuum so completely disregarded by the western states but this virtue may arise from the severity of their chastisements mutilation of the hand being the usual award to theft moreover lieutenant spekes journal does not impress the reader highly with their honesty and lastly i have found the habr awal at berberah on the whole a more respectable race than the warsingali  lieutenant spekes delay at kurayat was caused by want of carriage he justly remarks that every one in this country appeals to precedent the traveller therefore should carefully ascertain the price of everything and adhere to it as those who follow him twenty years afterwards will be charged the same one of the principal obstacles to lieutenant spekes progress was the large sum given to the natives by an officer who visited this coast some years ago future travellers should send before them a trusty warsingali to the sultan with a letter specifying the necessary arrangements a measure which would save trouble and annoyance to both parties  on the 10th of november the sultan came early to lieutenant spekes house he received a present of cloth worth about forty rupees after comparing his forearm with every other mans and ascertaining the mean he measured and remeasured each piece an operation which lasted several hours a flint gun was presented to him evidently the first he had ever handled he could scarcely bring it up to his shoulder and persisted in shutting the wrong eye then he began as usual to beg for more cloth powder and lead by his assistance lieutenant speke bought eight camels inferior animals at rather a high price from 10 to 1612 cloths equivalent to dollars per head it is the custom for the sultan or in his absence for an agil to receive a tithe of the price and it is his part to see that the traveller is not overcharged he appears to have discharged his duty very inefficiently a dollar a day being charged for the hire of a single donkey lieutenant speke regrets that he did not bring dollars or rupees cloth on the coast being now at a discount  after the usual troubles and vexations of a first move in africa on the 16th of november 1854 lieutenant speke marched about three miles along the coast and pitched at a well close to las kuray he was obliged to leave about a quarter of his baggage behind finding it impossible with his means to hire donkeys the best conveyance across the mountains where camels must be very lightly laden the sultan could not change he said the route settled by a former sahib he appears though famed for honesty and justice to have taken a partial view of lieutenant spekes property when the traveller complained of his abban the reply was this is the custom of the country i can see no fault all you bring is the abbans and he can do what he likes with it  the next day was passed unpleasantly enough in the open air to force a march and the sultan and his party stuck to the datebag demanding to be fed as servants till rations were served out to them  18th novemberabout 2 am the camels eleven in number were lightly loaded portions of the luggage being sent back to kurayat till more carriage could be procured the caravan crossed the plain southwards and after about two miles march entered a deep stony watercourse winding through the barren hills after five miles progress over rough ground lieutenant speke unloaded under a tree early in the afternoon near some pools of sweet rain water collected in natural basins of limestone dotting the watercourse the place is called iskodubuk the name of the watercourse is duktura the sultan and the abban were both left behind to escort the baggage from las kuray to kurayat they promised to rejoin lieutenant speke before nightfall the former appeared after five the latter after ten days the sultan sent his son abdallah a youth of about fifteen years old who proved so troublesome that lieutenant speke was forced repeatedly to dismiss him still the lad would not leave the caravan till it reached the dulbahanta frontier and the abban delayed a negro servant lieutenant spekes gunbearer trying by many offers and promises to seduce him from service  19th novemberat dawn the camels were brought in they had been feeding at large all night which proves the safety of the country after three hours work at loading the caravan started up the watercourse the road was rugged at times the watercourse was blocked up with boulders which compelled the travellers temporarily to leave it with a little cutting away of projecting rocks which are of soft stone the road might be made tolerably easy scattered and stunted acacias fringed with fresh green foliage relieved the eye all else was barren rock after marching about two miles the traveller was obliged to halt by the sultan a messenger arrived with the order the haltingplace is called damalay it is in the bed of the watercourse stagnating rain foullooking but sweet lying close by as in all other parts of this fiumara the bed was dotted with a bright green tree sometimes four feet high resembling a willow lieutenant speke spread his mat in the shade and spent the rest of the day at his diary and in conversation with the natives  the next day was also spent at damalay the interpreter mohammed ahmed a somali of the warsingali tribe and all the people refused positively to advance lieutenant speke started on foot to las kuray in search of the abban he was followed at some distance by the somal and the whole party returned on hearing a report that the chief and the abban were on the way the traveller seems on this occasion to have formed a very low estimate of the people he stopped their food until they promised to start the next day  21st novemberthe caravan marched at gunfire and after a mile left the watercourse and ascended by a rough camelpath a buttress of hill leading to the ridge of the mountains the ascent was not steep but the camels were so bad that they could scarcely be induced to advance the country was of a more pleasant aspect a shower of rain having lately fallen at this height the trees grow thicker and finer the stones are hidden by grass and heather and the air becomes somewhat cooler after a six miles march lieutenant speke encamped at a place called adhai sweet water was found within a miles walkthe first spring from which our traveller drank here he pitched a tent  at adhai lieutenant speke was detained nine days by the nonappearance of his protector and the refusal of his followers to march without him the camels were sent back with the greatest difficulty to fetch the portion of the baggage left behind on the 24th lieutenant speke sent his hindostani servant to las kuray with orders to bring up the baggage imam started alone and on foot not being permitted to ride a pony hired by the traveller he reported that there is a much better road for laden camels from the coast to the crest of the hills though unprotected he met with no difficulty and returned two days afterwards having seen the baggage en route during lieutenant spekes detention the somal battened on his provisions seeing that his two servants were absent and that no one guarded the bags half the rice had been changed at las kuray for an inferior description the camel drivers refused their rations because all their friends thirty in number were not fed the sultans son taught them to win the day by emptying and hiding the waterskins by threatening to kill the servants if they fetched water and by refusing to do work during the discussion which appears to have been lively the eldest of the sultans four sons mohammed aul appeared from las kuray he seems to have taken a friendly part stopped the discussion and sent away the young prince as a nuisance unfortunately however the latter reappeared immediately that the date bags were opened and mohammed aul stayed only two days in lieutenant spekes neighbourhood on the 28th november the abban appeared the sultan then forced upon lieutenant speke his brother hasan as a second abban although this proceeding is contrary to the custom of the country the new burden however after vain attempts at extortion soon disappeared carrying away with him a gun  for tanning waterskins the somal here always use when they can procure it a rugged bark with a smooth epidermis of a reddish tinge a pleasant aromatic odour and a strong astringent flavour they call it mohur powdered and sprinkled dry on a wound it acts as a styptic here was observed an aloeformed plant with a strong and woody thorn on the top it is called haskul or hig the fibres are beaten out with sticks or stones rotted in water and then made into cord in other parts the young bark of the acacia is used it is first charred on one side then reduced to fibre by mastication and lastly twisted into the semblance of a rope  from a little manuscript belonging to the abban lieutenant speke learned that about 440 years ago ad 1413 one darud bin ismail unable to live with his elder brother at mecca fled with a few followers to these shores in those days the land was ruled they say by a christian chief called kin whose wazir wharrah was the terror of all men darud collected around him probably by proselytising a strong party he gradually increased his power and ended by expelling the owners of the country who fled to the nw as far as abyssinia darud by an asyri damsel had a son called kabl ullah whose son harti had as progeny warsingali dulbahanta and mijjarthayn these three divided the country into as many portions which though great territorial changes have taken place to this day bear their respective owners names  of this i have to observe that universal tradition represents the somal to be a people of halfcaste origin african and arabian moreover that they expelled the gallas from the coast until the latter took refuge in the hills of harar the gallas are a people partly moslem partly christian and partly pagan this may account for the tradition above recorded most somal however declare darud to be a man of ignoble origin and do not derive him from the holy city some declare he was driven from arabia for theft of course each tribe exaggerates its own nobility with as reckless a defiance of truth as their neighbours depreciate it but i have made a rule always to doubt what semibarbarians write writing is the great source of historical confusion because falsehoods accumulate in books persons are confounded and fictions assume as in the mythologic genealogies of india persia greece and rome a regular and systematic form on the other hand oral tradition is more trustworthy witness the annals and genealogies preserved in verse by the bhats of cutch the arab nassab and the bards of belochistan  30th novemberthe sultan took leave of lieutenant speke and the latter prepared to march in company with the abban the interpreter the sultans two sons and a large party by throwing the tent down and sitting in the sun he managed to effect a move in the evening the camels started from adhai up a gradual ascent along a strong path the way was covered with bush jungle and trees the frankincense it is said abounded gum trees of various kinds were found and the traveller remarked a single stunted sycamore growing out of a rock i found the tree in all the upper regions of the somali country and abundant in the harar hills after two miles march the caravan halted at habal ishawalay on the northern side of the mountains within three miles of the crest the haltingground was tolerably level and not distant from the waters of adhai the only spring in the vicinity the travellers slept in a deserted kraal surrounded by a stout fence of acacia thorns heaped up to keep out the leopards and hyenas during the heat lieutenant speke sat under a tree here he remained three days the first in order to bring up part of his baggage which had been left behind the second to send on a portion to the next haltingplace and the third in consequence of the abbans resolution to procure ghee or clarified butter the sultan could not resist the opportunity of extorting something by a final visitfor a goat killed and eaten by the cameldrivers contrary to lieutenant spekes orders a dollar was demanded  4th december 1854about dawn the caravan was loaded and then proceeded along a tolerably level pathway through a thick growth of thorn trees towards a bluff hill the steep was reached about 9 am and the camels toiled up the ascent by a stony way dropping their loads for want of ropes and stumbling on their road the summit about 500 yards distant was reached in an hour at yafir on the crest of the mountains the caravan halted two hours for refreshment lieutenant speke describes the spot in the enthusiastic language of all travellers who have visited the seaward range of the somali hills it appears however that it is destitute of water about noon the camels were again loaded and the caravan proceeded across the mountains by a winding road over level ground for four miles this point commanded an extensive view of the southern plateau in that direction the mountains drop in steps or terraces and are almost bare as in other parts rough and flat topped piles of stones reminding the traveller of the tartar cairns were observed i remarked the same in the northern somali country and in both places the people gave a similar account of them namely that they are the work of an earlier race probably the gallas some of them are certainly tombs for human bones are turned up in others empty chambers are discovered and in a few are found earthern and large copper pots lieutenant speke on one occasion saw an excavated mound propped up inside by pieces of timber and apparently built without inlet it was opened about six years ago by a warsingali in order to bury his wife when a bar of metal afterwards proved by an arab to be gold and a gold ring similar to what is worn by women in the nose were discovered in other places the natives find it is said womens bracelets beads and similar articles still used by the gallas  after nightfall the caravan arrived at mukur a haltingplace in the southern declivity of the hills here lieutenant speke remarked that the large watercourse in which he halted becomes a torrent during the rains carrying off the drainage towards the eastern coast he had marched that day seventeen miles when the party made a kraal with a few bushes water was found within a mile in a rocky basin it was fetid and full of animalculae here appeared an old woman driving sheep and goats into las kuray a circumstance which shows that the country is by no means dangerous  after one days halt at mukur to refresh the camels on the 6th december lieutenant speke started at about 10 am across the last spur of the hills and presently entered a depression dividing the hills from the plateau here the country was stony and whitecoloured with watercourses full of rounded stones the jujube and acacias were here observed to be on a large scale especially in the lowest ground after five miles the traveller halted at a shallow watercourse and at about half a mile distant found sweet but dirty water in a deep hole in the rock the name of this station was karrah  8th decemberearly in the morning the caravan moved on to rhat a distance of eight miles it arrived at about noon the road lay through the depression at the foot of the hills in the patches of heather florikan was found the jujubetree was very large in the rains this country is a grassy belt running from west to east along a deep and narrow watercourse called rhat tug or the fiumara of rhat which flows eastward towards the ocean at this season having been eaten up the land was almost entirely deserted the kraals lay desolate the herdsmen had driven off their cows to the hills and the horses had been sent towards the mijjarthayn country a few camels and donkeys were seen considering that their breeding is left to chance the blood is not contemptible the sheep and goats are small and their coats as usual in these hot countries remain short lieutenant speke was informed that owing to want of rain and it being the breeding season the inland and nomad warsingali live entirely on flesh one meal serving for three days this was a sad change of affairs from what took place six weeks before the travellers arrival when there had been a fall of rain and the people spent their time revelling on milk and sleeping all day under the shade of the treesthe somali idea of perfect happiness  on the 9th december lieutenant speke halting at rhat visited one of kins cities now ruined by time and changed by the somal having converted it into a cemetery the remains were of stone and mud as usual in this part of the world the houses are built in an economical manner one straight wall nearly 30 feet long runs down the centre and is supported by a number of lateral chambers facing opposite ways e g  2 illustrations  this appears to compose the village and suggests a convent or a monastery to the west and about fifty yards distant are ruins of stone and good white mortar probably procured by burning the limestone rock the annexed ground plan will give an idea of these interesting remains which are said to be those of a christian house of worship in some parts the walls are still 10 feet high and they show an extent of civilisation now completely beyond the warsingali it may be remarked of them that the direction of the niche as well as the disposition of the building would denote a moslem mosque at the same time it must be remembered that the churches of the eastern christians are almost always made to front jerusalem and the gallas being a moslem and christian race the sects would borrow their architecture from each other the people assert these ruins to be those of nazarenes yet in the jid ali valley of the dulbahantas lieutenant speke found similar remains which the natives declared to be one of their forefathers mosques the plan and the direction were the same as those now described nothing however is easier than to convert st sophia into the aya sufiyyah mosque moreover at jid ali the traveller found it still the custom of the people to erect a mala or cross of stone or wood covered with plaster at the head and foot of every tomb  illustration  the dulbahantas when asked about these crosses said it was their custom derived from sire and grandsire this again would argue that a christian people once inhabited these now benighted lands  north of the building now described is a cemetery in which the somal still bury their dead here lieutenant speke also observed crosses but he was prevented by the superstition of the people from examining them  on an eminence sw of and about seventy yards from the main building are the isolated remains of another erection said by the people to be a fort the foundation is level with the ground and shows two compartments opening into each other  illustration  rhat was the most southerly point reached by lieutenant speke he places it about thirty miles distant from the coast and at the entrance of the great plateau here he was obliged to turn westward because at that season of the year the country to the southward is desolate for want of raina warning to future visitors during the monsoon this part of the land is preferred by the people grass grows and there would be no obstacle to travellers  before quitting rhat the abban and the interpreter went to the length of ordering lieutenant speke not to fire a gun this detained him a whole day  11th decemberearly in the morning lieutenant speke started in a westerly direction still within sight of the mountains where not obstructed by the inequalities of the ground the line taken was over an elevated flat in places covered with the roots of parched up grass here it was barren and there appeared a few acacias the view to the south was shortened by rolling ground hollow basins sometimes fifteen miles broad succeed each other each sends forth from its centre a watercourse to drain off the water eastward the face of the country however is very irregular and consequently description is imperfect this day ostriches and antelopes were observed in considerable numbers after marching ten miles the caravan halted at barham where they found a spring of clear and brackish water from the limestone rock and flowing about 600 yards down a deep rocky channel in parts lined with fine acacias a kraal was found here and the traveller passed a comfortable night  12th decemberabout 9 am the caravan started and threaded a valley which if blessed with a fair supply of water would be very fertile whilst everything else is burned up by the sun on the high ground a nutritious weed called buskallay fattens the sheep and goats wherever therefore a spring is found men flock to the place and fence themselves in a kraal about halfway the travellers reached darud bin ismails tomb a parallelogram of loose stones about one foot high of a battered and ignoble appearance at one extremity stood a large sloping stone with a little mortar still clinging to it no outer fence surrounded the tomb which might easily be passed by unnoticed no honors were paid to the memory of the first founder of the tribe and the somal did not even recite a fatihah over his dust after marching about twelve miles the caravan encamped at labbahdilay in the bed of a little watercourse which runs into the yubbay tug here they found a small pool of bad rain water they made a rude fence to keep out the wild beasts and in it passed the night  13th decemberthe somal showed superior activity in marching three successive days the reason appears to be that the abban was progressing towards his home at sunrise the camels were loaded and at 8 am the caravan started up a valley along the left bank of a watercourse called the yubbay tug this was out of the line but the depth of the perpendicular sides prevented any attempt at crossing it the people of the country have made a peculiar use of this feature of ground during the last war ten or eleven years ago between the warsingali and the dulbahantas the latter sent a large foraging party over the frontier the warsingali stationed a strong force at the head of the watercourse to prevent its being turned and exposed their flocks and herds on the eastern bank to tantalise the hungry enemy the dulbahantas unable to cross the chasm and unwilling like all somali heroes even in their wrath to come to blows with the foe retired in huge disgust after marching five miles the caravan halted the abban declaring that he and the sultans younger son must go forward to feel the way in other words to visit his home his pretext was a good one in countries where postal arrangements do not exist intelligence flies quicker than on the wings of paper many evil rumours had preceded lieutenant speke and the inland tribe professed it was reported to despise a people who can only threaten the coast the dulbahantas had been quarrelling amongst themselves for the last thirteen years and were now determined to settle the dispute by a battle formerly they were all under one head but one ali harram an akil or minor chief determined to make his son mohammed ali gerad or prince of the clans inhabiting the northern provinces after five years intrigue the son was proclaimed and carried on the wars caused by his father declaring an intention to fight to the last he has however been successfully opposed by mahmud ali the rightful chief of the dulbahanta family the southern clans of haud and beyond the nogal being more numerous and more powerful than the northern divisions no merchant arab or other thinks of penetrating into this country principally on account of the expense lieutenant speke is of opinion that his cloth and rice would easily have stopped the war for a time the dulbahantas threatened and blustered but allowed themselves easily to be pacified  it is illustrative of the customs of this people that when the dulbahantas had their hands engaged and left their rear unprotected under the impression that no enemies were behind the warsingali instantly remembered that one of their number had been murdered by the other race many years ago the bloodmoney had been paid and peace had been concluded but the opportunity was too tempting to be resisted  the yubbay tug watercourse begins abruptly being as broad and deep at the head as it is in the trunk when lieutenant speke visited it it was dry there was but a thin growth of trees in it showing that water does not long remain there immediately north of it lies a woody belt running up to the foot of the mountains and there bifurcating along the base southwards the yubbay is said to extend to a considerable distance but somali ideas of distance are peculiar and absorption is a powerful agent in these latitudes  till the 21st december lieutenant speke was delayed at the yubbay tug his ropes had been stolen by discharged camelmen and he was unable to replace them  on the 15th december one of the midgan or serviles was tried for stealing venison from one of his fellows the sultan before his departure had commissioned three of lieutenant spekes attendants to act as judges in case of such emergency on this occasion the interpreter was on the woolsack and he sensibly fined the criminal two sheep to be eaten on the road from inquiries i have no doubt that these midgan are actually reduced by famine at times to live on a food which human nature abhors in the northern part of the somali country i never heard of cannibalism although the servile tribes will eat birds and other articles of food disdained by somal of gentle blood lieutenant speke complains of the scarcity and the quality of the water which resembles the mixture commonly known as black draught yet it appears not to injure health and the only disease found endemic is an ophthalmia said to return periodically every three years the animals have learned to use sparingly what elsewhere is a daily necessary camels are watered twice a month sheep thrice and horses every two or three days no wild beasts or birds except the rock pigeon and duck ever drink except when rain falls  the pickaxe and spade belonging to the traveller were greatly desired in one place water was found but more generally the people preferred digging for honey in the rocks of the inhabitants we find it recorded that like all nomads they are idle to the last degree contenting themselves with tanned skins for dress and miserable huts for lodging changing ground for the flocks and herds is a work of little trouble one camel and a donkey carry all the goods and chattels including water wife and baby milk in all stages but never polluted by fire wild honey and flesh are their only diet some old men have never tasted grain armed with spear and shield they are in perpetual dread of an attack it is not strange that under such circumstances the population should be thin and scattered they talk of thousands going to war but the wary traveller suspects gross exaggeration they preserve the abominable galla practice of murdering pregnant women in hopes of mutilating a male foetus  on the 20th december lieutenant speke was informed by the sultans son that the dulbahantas would not permit him to enter their country as a favour however they would allow him to pass towards the home of the abban who having married a dulbahanta girl was naturalised amongst them  21st decemberearly in the morning lieutenant speke accompanied by the interpreter the sultans son one servant and two or three men to lead a pair of camels started eastward the rest of the animals nine in number were left behind in charge of imam a hindostani boy and six or seven men under him the reason for this step was that husayn haji an agil of the dulbahantas and a connection of the abban demanded as sole condition for permitting lieutenant speke to visit jid ali that the traveller should give up all his property before leaving the valley he observed a hillock glistening white it appears from its salt bitter taste to have been some kind of nitrate efflorescing from the ground the caravan marched about a mile across the deep valley of yubbay tug and ascended its right side by a beaten track they then emerged from a thin jungle in the lower grounds to the stony hills which compose the country here the line pursued was apparently parallel to the mountains bordering upon the sea between the two ridges was a depression in which lay a small watercourse the road ran along bleak undulating ground with belts of acacia in the hollows here and there appeared a sycamore tree on the road two springs were observed both of bitter water one deep below the surface the other close to the ground patches of green grass grew around them having entered the dulbahanta frontier the caravan unloaded in the evening after a march of thirteen miles at a depression called ali no water was found there  22nd decemberearly in the morning the traveller started westward from ali wishing that night to make jid ali about eighteen miles distant after marching thirteen miles over the same monotonous country as before lieutenant speke was stopped by husayn haji the agil who declared that guled ali another agil was opposed to his progress after a long conversation lieutenant speke reasoned him into compliance but that night they were obliged to halt at birhamir within five miles of jid ali the traveller was offered as many horses as he wanted and a free passage to berberah if he would take part in the battle preparing between the two rival clans of dulbahantas he refused on plea of having other engagements but whenever the question of penetrating the country was started there came the same dry answer no beggar had even attempted to visit themwhat then did the englishman want the abbans mother came out from her hut which was by the wayside and with many terrors endeavoured to stop the traveller  23rd decembernext morning the abban appeared and by his sorrowful surprise at seeing lieutenant speke across the frontier showed that he only had made the difficulty the caravan started early and travelling five miles over stony ground reached the jid ali valley this is a long belt of fertile soil running perpendicular to the seaward range it begins opposite bunder jedid at a gap in the mountains through which the sea is they say visible in breadth at the part first visited by lieutenant speke it is about two miles it runs southward and during rain probably extends to about twenty miles inland near the head of the valley is a spring of bitter water absorbed by the soil after a quarter of a miles course in the monsoon however a considerable torrent must flow down this depression ducks and snipe are found here the valley shows even at this season extensive patches of grass large acacia trees bushes and many different kinds of thorns it is the most wooded lowland seen by lieutenant speke already the nomads are here changing their habits two small enclosures have been cultivated by an old dulbahanta who had studied agriculture during a pilgrimage to meccah the jowari grows luxuriantly with stalks 8 and 9 feet high and this first effort had well rewarded the enterpriser lieutenant speke lent the slave farhan to show the art of digging for this he received the present of a goat i may here remark that everywhere in the somali country the people are prepared to cultivate grain and only want some one to take the initiative as yet they have nothing but their hands to dig with a few scattered huts were observed near jid ali the grass not being yet sufficiently abundant to support collected herds  lieutenant speke was delayed nineteen days at jid ali by various pretexts the roads were reported closed the cloth and provisions were exhausted five horses must be bought from the abban for thirty dollars a head they were worth one fourth that sum as presents the first european that visited the western country had stopped rain for six months and the somal feared for the next monsoon all the people would flock in demanding at least what the warsingali had received otherwise they threatened the travellers life on the 26th of december lieutenant speke moved three miles up the valley to some distance from water the crowd being troublesome and preventing his servants eating on the 31st of december all the baggage was brought up from near abi one of the camels being upon the point of death was killed and devoured it was impossible to keep the abban from his home which was distant about four miles numerous messages were sent in vain but lieutenant speke drew him from his hut by sitting in dhurna or dunning him into compliance at last arose a violent altercation all the warsingali and dulbahanta servants were taken away water was stopped the cattle were cast loose and the traveller was told to arm and defend himself and his two menthey would all be slain that night and the abban would abandon them to the consequences of their obstinacy they were not killed however and about an hour afterwards the somal reappeared declaring that they had no intention of deserting  11th january 1855about 10 am the caravan started without the abban across the head of the jid ali valley the land was flat abounding in acacia and showing signs of sun parched grass cropped close by the cattle after a five miles march the travellers came to a place called biyu hablay they unloaded under a tree and made a kraal water was distant around were some courses ending abruptly in the soft absorbing ground here the traveller was met by two dulbahantas who demanded his right to enter their lands and insinuated that a force was gathering to oppose him they went away however after a short time threatening with smiles to come again lieutenant speke was also informed that the southern dulbahanta tribes had been defeated with loss by the northern clans and that his journey would be interrupted by them here the traveller remarked how willing are the somal to study as usual in this country any man who reads the koran and can write out a verset upon a board is an object of envy the people are fanatic they rebuked the interpreter for not praying regularly for eating from a christians cooking pot and for cutting deers throats low down to serve as specimens they also did not approve of the travellers throwing date stones into the fire as usual they are fearful boasters their ancestors turned christians out of the country they despise guns they consider the frank formidable only behind walls they are ready to fight it out in the plain and they would gallop around cannon so that not a shot would tell vain words to conceal the hearts of hares lieutenant speke justly remarks that on account of the rough way in which they are brought up the somal would become excellent policemen they should however be separated from their own people and doubtless the second generation might be trained into courage  at biyu hablay lieutenant speke finding time as well as means deficient dropped all idea of marching to berberah he wished to attempt a north western route to hais but the rer hamaturwa a clan of the habr gerhajis who occupy the mountain positively refused passage permission was accorded by that clan to march due north upon bunder jedid where however the traveller feared that no vessel might be found as a last resource he determined to turn to the northeast and by a new road through the habr gerhajis to make las kuray  18th januarythe abban again returned from his home and accompanied lieutenant speke on his first march to the northeast early in the morning the caravan started over the ground before described on this occasion however it traversed the belt of jungle at the foot of the mountains after a march of six miles they halted at mirhiddo under a tree on elevated ground in a mere desert no water being nearer than the spring of jid ali the abban took the opportunity of lieutenant speke going out specimenhunting to return home contrary to orders and he did not reappear till the traveller walked back and induced him to march here a second camel being in articulo was cut up and greedily devoured  21st januarythe abban appeared in the morning and the caravan started about noon over the stony ground at the foot of the hills after a miles march the protector again disappeared in open defiance of orders that days work was about ten miles the caravan halted late at night in the bed of a watercourse called hanfallal lieutenant speke visited the spring which is of extraordinary sweetness for the warsingali country it flows from a cleft in the rock broad enough to admit a mans body and about 60 feet deep  23rd januarylieutenant speke was about to set out under the guidance of awado the abbans mother when her graceless son reappeared at noon the caravan travelled along a rough road over the lower spurs of the mountains they went five miles and it was evening when they unloaded in a watercourse a little distance up the hills at a place called dallmalay the bed was about 150 yards broad full of jungle and showed signs of a strong deep stream during the monsoon the travellers made up a kraal but found no water there  24th januaryearly in the morning the caravan started and ascended by a path over the hills the way was bare of verdure but easy here a camel unable to walk though unloaded was left behind one of lieutenant spekes discharged camelmen a warsingali being refused passage by the habr gerhajis on account of some previous quarrel found a stray camel and carried it off to his home amongst the dulbahantas he afterwards appeared at las kuray having taken the road by which the travellers entered the country having marched eleven miles the caravan arrived in the evening at gobamiray a flat on the crest of the mountains here again thick jungle appeared and the traveller stood over more on the seaward side water was distant  on arriving the camels were seized by the urus sugay a clan of the habr gerhajis the poor wretches pretended to show fight and asked if they were considered a nation of women that their country was to be entered without permission next morning they volunteered to act as escort  25th januaryloading was forbidden by the valiant sons of habr gerhajis but as they were few in number and the warsingali clan was near it went on without interruption this day like the latter was cloudy heavy showers fell for some hours and the grass was springing up rain had lasted for some time and had not improved the road this fall is called by the people dairti it is confined to the hills whereas the gugi or monsoon is general over the plateau  about noon the caravan marched late because the abbans two horses had strayed these animals belonged to a relation of the protector who called them his own and wished as a civility to sell the garrons at the highest possible price to his client the caravan marched down a tortuous and difficult road descending about four miles it unloaded as evening drew near and the travellers found at gambagahh a good dormitory a cave which kept out the rain water was standing close by in a pool the whole way was a thick jungle of bush and thorn  26th januarythe somal insisted upon halting to eat and the caravan did not start before noon the road was tolerable and the descent oblique the jungle was thick and the clouds thicker rain fell heavily as usual in the afternoon five cloths were given to the habr gerhajis as a bribe for passage after a march of six miles the caravan halted at a place called minan here they again found a cave which protected them from the rain water was abundant in the hollows of the rock  27th januaryearly in the morning the caravan set out and descended the hill obliquely by a tolerable road they passed a number of thorn trees bearing a gum called falafala or luban meyti a kind of frankincense it is thrown upon the fire and the women are in the habit of standing over it after travelling six miles the travellers unloaded at hundurgal on the bank of a watercourse leading to las galwayta some pools of rainwater were observed in the rocky hollows of the bed  28th januaryat about 9 am the caravan crossed one of the lower ridges of the mountains by a tolerable road lieutenant speke had preceded his camels and was sitting down to rest when he was startled by hearing the rapid discharge of a revolver his valiant abban either in real or in pretended terror of the habr gerhajis had fired the pistol as a warning it had the effect of collecting a number of bedouins to stare at the travellers and cogitate on what they could obtain they offered however no opposition  at midday the caravan reached a broad and deep fiumara which contained a spring of good sweet water flowing towards the sea here they halted for refreshment again advancing they traversed another ridge and after a march of twelve miles arrived in the evening at another little watercourse on the maritime plain that day was clear and warm the rain being confined to the upper ranges the name of the haltingplace was farjeh  29th januarythe caravan marched over the plain into kurayat or little las kuray where lieutenant speke after a detention of upwards of a fortnight took boat and after five days sail arrived at aden where i was expecting him he was charged forty dollarsfive times the proper sumfor a place in a loaded buggalow from aden to bombay thirtyfive dollars is the hire of the whole cabin this was the last act of the abban who is now by the just orders of the acting political resident aden expiating his divers offences in the station jail   conclusion  lieutenant speke has passed through three large tribes the warsingali the dulbahanta and the habr gerhajis  the warsingali have a sultan or chief whose orders are obeyed after a fashion by all the clans save one the bihidur he cannot demand the attendance of a subject even to protect the country and has no power to raise recruits consequently increase of territory is never contemplated in this part of the somali country in case of murder theft or dispute between different tribes the aggrieved consult the sultan who assembling the elders deputes them to feel the inclinations of the public the people prefer revenging themselves by violence as every man thereby hopes to gain something the war ends when the enemy has more spears than cattle leftmost frequently however by mutual consent when both are tired of riding the country expeditions seldom meet one another this retiring as that advances and he is deemed a brave who can lift a few head of cattle and return home in safety the commissariat department is rudely organised at the trystingplace generally some water the people assemble on a day fixed by the sultan and slaughter sheep each person provides himself by hanging some dried meat upon his pony it is said that on many occasions men have passed upwards of a week with no other sustenance than water this extensive branch of the somal is divided into eighteen principal clans viz  1 rer gerad the royal family 2 rer fatih 3 rer abdullah 4 rer bihidur 5 bohogay salabay 6 adan yakub 7 gerad umar 8 gerad yusuf 9 gerad liban 10 nuh umar 11 adan said 12 rer haji 13 dubbays 14 warlabah 15 bayabarhay 16 rer yasif 17 hindudub 18 rer garwayna  the northern dulbahantas are suffering greatly from intestine war they are even less tractable than the warsingali their sultan is a ruler only in name no one respects his person or consults him in matters of importance their gerad was in the vicinity of the traveller but evasive answers were returned probably in consequence of the abbans machinations to every inquiry the elders and men of substance settle local matters and all have a voice in everything that concerns the general weal such for instance as the transit of a traveller lieutenant speke saw two tribes the mahmud gerad and rer ali nalay the latter is subdivided into six septs  the habr gerhajis here scattered and cut up have little power their royal family resides near berberah but no one as yet wears the turban and even when investiture takes place a rulers authority will not extend to makhar three clans of this tribe inhabit this part of the somali country viz bah gummaron rer hamturwa and urus sugay  i venture to submit a few remarks upon the subject of the preceding diary  it is evident from the perusal of these pages that though the traveller suffered from the system of blackmail to which the inhospitable somal of makhar subject all strangers though he was delayed persecuted by his protector and threatened with war danger and destruction his life was never in real peril some allowance must also be made for the people of the country lieutenant speke was of course recognised as a servant of government and savages cannot believe that a man wastes his rice and cloth to collect dead beasts and to ascertain the direction of streams he was known to be a christian he is ignorant of the moslem faith and most fatal to his enterprise he was limited in time not knowing either the arabic or the somali tongue he was forced to communicate with the people through the medium of his dishonest interpreter and abban  i have permitted myself to comment upon the system of interference pursued by the former authorities of aden towards the inhabitants of the somali coast a partial intermeddling with the quarrels of these people is unwise we have the whole line completely in our power an armed cruiser by a complete blockade would compel the inhabitants to comply with any requisitions but either our intervention should be completeeither we should constitute ourselves sole judges of all disputes or we should sedulously turn a deaf ear to their complaints the former i not only understand to be deprecated by our rulers but i also hold it to be imprudent nothing is more dangerous than to influence in any way the savage balance of power between these tribes by throwing our weight on one side we may do them incalculable mischief the somal like the arab bedouins live in a highly artificial though an apparently artless state of political relations and the imperfect attempt of strangers to interfere would be turned to the worst account by the designing adventurer and the turbulent spirit who expects to rise by means of anarchy and confusion hitherto our partial intervention between the habr awal of berberah and the habr gerhajis of zayla has been fraught with evils to them and consequently to us  but it is a rapidly prevailing custom for merchants and travellers to engage an abban or protector not on the african coast as was formerly case but at aden it is clearly advantageous to encourage this practice since it gives us a right in case of fraud or violence to punish the abban as he deserves  lastly we cannot expect great things without some establishment at berberah were a british agent settled there he could easily select the most influential and respectable men to be provided with a certificate entitling them to the honor and emolument of protecting strangers nothing would tend more surely than this measure to open up the new country to commerce and civilisation and it must not be inferred from a perusal of the foregoing pages that the land is valueless lieutenant speke saw but a small portion of it and that too during the dead season its exports speak for themselves guano valuable gums hides peltries mats clarified butter honey and dumbah sheep from the ruins and the traditions of the country it is clear that a more civilised race once held these now savage shores and the disposition of the people does not discourage the hope entertained by every englishmanthat of raising his fellow man in the scale of civilisation  camp aden march 1855

of the indian navy one of the travellers who accompanied sir william cornwallis then captain harris on his mission to the court of shoa his services being required by the bombay government he was directed by captain harris on october 14th 1841 to repair to the coast via harar by a road hitherto untrodden by europeans these pages will reward perusal as a narrative of adventure especially as they admirably show what obstacles the suspicious characters and the vain terrors of the bedouins have thrown in the way of energy and enterprise   aden february 28 1842  shortly after i had closed my last communication to captain harris of the bombay engineers on special duty at the court of shoa 14 jan 1842 a report arrived at allio amba that demetrius an albanian who had been for ten years resident in the kingdom of shoa and who had left it for tajoorah accompanied by johannes another albanian by three arabs formerly servants of the embassy and by several slaves had been murdered by the bedoos bedouins near murroo this caused a panic among my servants i allayed it with difficulty but my interpreter declared his final intention of deserting me as the hurruri caravan had threatened to kill him if he persisted in accompanying me before proceeding farther it may be as well to mention that i had with me four servants one a mere lad six mules and nine asses to carry my luggage and provisions  i had now made every arrangement having as the wallasena mahomed abugas suggested purchased a fine horse and a tobe for my protector and guide datah mahomed of the clan seedy habroo a subtribe of the debeneh it was too late to recede accordingly at an early hour on saturday the 15th january 1842 i commenced packing and about 8 am took my departure from the village of allio amba i had spent there a weary three months and left it with that mixture of pleasure and regret felt only by those who traverse unknown and inhospitable regions i had made many friends who accompanied me for some distance on the road and took leave of me with a deep feeling which assured me of their sympathy many endeavoured to dissuade me from the journey but my lot was cast  about five miles from allio i met the nephew of the wallasena who accompanied me to farri furnished me with a house there and ordered my mules and asses to be taken care of shortly after my arrival the guide an old man made his appearance and seemed much pleased by my punctuality  at noon on sunday the 16th the wallasena arrived and sent over his compliments with a present of five loaves of bread i called upon him in the evening and reminded him of the letter he had promised me he ordered it to be prepared taking for copy the letter which the king sahala salassah of shoa had given to me  my guide having again promised to forward me in safety the wallasena presented him with a spear a shield and a tobe together with the horse and the cloth which i had purchased for him about noon on monday the 17th we quitted farri with a slavecaravan bound for tajoorah i was acquainted with many of these people the wallasena also recommended me strongly to the care of mahomed ibn buraitoo and dorranu ibn kamil we proceeded to datharal the wallasena and his nephew having escorted me as far as denehmelli where they took leave i found the caffilah to consist of fifteen tajoorians and about fifty camels laden with provisions for the road fifty male and about twenty female slaves mostly children from eight to ten years of age my guide had with him five camels laden with grain two men and two women  the ras el caffilah chief of the caravan was one ibrahim ibn boorantoo who it appears had been chief of the embassy caravan although essakh ishak gave out that he was it is certain that this man always gave orders for pitching the camp and for loading but we being unaware of the fact that he was ras el caffilah he had not received presents on the arrival of the embassy at shoa whilst unloading the camels the following conversation took place ya kabtan 0 captain said he addressing me with a sneer where are you going todo you think the bedoos will let you pass through their country we shall see now i will tell youyou feringis have treated me very illyou loaded essakh and others with presents but never gave me anything i have as it were a knife in my stomach which is continually cutting methis knife you have placed there but inshallah it is now my turn i will be equal with youyou think of going to hurrurwe shall see i replied you know me not it is true i was ignorant that you were ras el caffilah on our way to shoa you say you have a knife cutting your insidei can remove that knife those who treat me well now that i am returning to my country shall be rewarded for the lord be praised there i have the means of repaying my friends but in shoa i am a beggar those that treat me ill shall also receive their reward  my mules being frightened at the sight of the camels were exceedingly restive one of them strayed and was brought back by deeni ibn hamed a young man who was indebted to me for some medicines and a trifling present which he had received from the embassy ibrahim the ras el caffilah seeing him lead it back called out so you also have become servant to the kafir infidel at the same time datah mahomed the guide addressed to me some remark which he asked ibrahim to explain the latter replied in a sarcastic manner in arabic a language with which i am unacquainted 1 this determined hostility on the part of the ras el caffilah was particularly distressing to me as i feared he would do me much mischief i therefore determined to gain him over to my interests and accordingly taking deeni on one side i promised him a handsome present if he would take an opportunity of explaining to ibrahim that he should be well rewarded if he behaved properly and at the same time that if he acted badly that a line or two sent to aden would do him harm i also begged him to act as my interpreter as long as we were together and he cheerfully agreed to do so  we were on the point of resuming our journey on tuesday the 18th when it was found that the mule of the el caffilah had strayed after his conduct on the preceding evening he was ashamed to come to me but he deputed one of the caravan people to request the loan of one of my mules to go in quest of his i gave him one readily we were detained that day as the missing animal was not brought back till late notwithstanding my civility i observed him in close conversation with datah mahomed about the rich presents which the feringis had given to essakh and others and i frequently observed him pointing to my luggage in an expressive manner towards evening the guide came to me and said my son i am an old man my teeth are bad i cannot eat this parched graini see you eat bread now we are friends you must give me some of it i replied that several times after preparing for the journey i had been disappointed and at last started on a short noticethat i was but scantily supplied with provisions and had a long journey before me notwithstanding which i was perfectly willing that he should share with me what i had as long as it lasted and that as he was a great chief i expected that he would furnish me with a fresh supply on arriving at his country he then said it is well but why did you not buy me a mule instead of a horse my reply was that i had supposed that the latter would be more acceptable to him i divided the night into three watches my servants kept the first and middle and i myself the morning  we quitted dattenab the frontier station at about 7 oclock am on wednesday the 19th the country at this season presented a more lively appearance than when we travelled over it before grass being abundant on the trees by the roadside was much gum acacia which the caffilah people collected as they passed i was pleased to remark that ibrahim was the only person illdisposed towards me the rest of the travellers were civil and respectful at noon we halted under some trees by the wayside presently we were accosted by six bedoos of the woemah tribe who were travelling from keelulho to shoa they informed us that demetrius had been plundered and stripped by the takyle tribe that one arab and three male slaves had been slain and that another arab had fled on horseback to the etoh ittu gallas whence nothing more had been heard of him the rest of the party were living under the protection of shaykh omar buttoo of the takyle the bedoos added that plunderers were lying in wait on the banks of the river howash for the white people that were about to leave shoa the ras el caffilah communicated to me this intelligence and concluded by saying now if you wish to return i will take you back but if you say forward let us proceed i answered let us proceed i must own that the intelligence pleased me not two of my servants were for returning but they were persuaded to go on to the next station where we would be guided by circumstances about 2 oclock pm we again proceeded after a long cullam or talk which ended in datah mahomed sending for assistance to a neighbouring tribe during a conversation with the ras el caffilah i found out that the bedoos were lying in wait not for the white people but for our caravan it came out that these bedouins had had the worst of a quarrel with the last caffilah from tajoorah they then threatened to attack it in force on its return the ras el caffilah was assured that as long as we journeyed together i should consider his enemies my enemies and that being well supplied with firearms i would assist him on all occasions this offer pleased him and we became more friendly we passed several deserted villages of the bedoos who had retired for want of water towards the wadys and about 7 oclock pm halted at the lake leadoo  on the morning of thursday the 20th datah mahomed came to me and delivered himself though deeni as follows my son our father the wallasena entrusted you to my care we feasted together in gouchooyou are to me as the son of my house yesterday i heard that the bedoos were waiting to kill but fear not for i have sent to the seedy habroo for some soldiers who will be here soon now these soldiers are sent for on your account they will want much cloth but you are a sensible person and will of course pay them well they will accompany us beyond the howash i replied it is true the wallasena entrusted me to your care he also told me that you were a great chief and could forward me on my journey i therefore did not prepare a large supply of clotha long journey is before mewhat can be spared shall be freely given but you must tell the soldiers that i have but little you are now my father  scarcely had i ceased when the soldiers fine stoutlooking savages armed with spear shield and crease mustering about twentyfive made their appearance it was then 10 am the word was given to load the camels and we soon moved forward i found my worthy protector exceedingly goodnatured and civil dragging on my asses and leading my mules near the howash we passed several villages in which i could not but remark the great proportion of children at about 3 pm we forded the river which was waistdeep and on the banks of which were at least 3000 head of horned cattle seeing no signs of the expected enemy we journeyed on till 5 pm when we halted at the southeastern extremity of the howash plain about one mile to the eastward of a small pool of water  at daylight on friday the 21st it was discovered that datah mahomeds horse had disappeared this was entirely his fault my servants had brought it back when it strayed during the night but he said let it feed it will not run away when i condoled with him on the loss of so noble an animal he replied i know very well who has taken it one of my cousins asked me for it yesterday and because i refused to give it he has stolen it never mind inshallah i will steal some of his camels after a cullam about what was to be given to our worthy protectors it was settled that i should contribute three cloths and the caffilah ten receiving these they departed much satisfied having filled our water skins we resumed our march a little before noon several herds of antelope and wild asses appeared on the way at 7 pm we halted near hano prevented from lighting a fire for fear of the galla i was obliged to content myself with some parched grain of which i had prepared a large supply  at sunrise on the 22nd we resumed our journey the weather becoming warm and the grass scanty at noon we halted near shaykh othman i was glad to find that deeni had succeeded in converting the ras el caffilah from an avowed enemy to a staunch friend at least outwardly so he has now become as civil and obliging as he was before the contrary there being no water at this station i desired my servant adam not to make any bread contenting myself with the same fare as that of the preceding evening this displeasing datah mahomed some misunderstanding arose which from their ignorance of each others language might but for the interference of the ras el caffilah and deeni have led to serious results an explanation ensued which ended in datah mahomed seizing me by the beard hugging and embracing me in a manner truly unpleasant i then desired adam to make him some bread and coffee and harmony was once more restored this little disturbance convinced me that if once left among these savages without any interpreter that i should be placed in a very dangerous situation the ras el caffilah also told me that unless he saw that the road was clear for me to hurrur and that there was no danger to be apprehended that he could not think of leaving me but should take me with him to tajoorah he continued you know not the emir of hurrur when he hears of your approach he will cause you to be waylaid by the galla why not come with me to tajoorah if you fear being in want of provisions we have plenty and you shall share all we have i was much surprised at this change of conduct on the part of the ras el caffilah and by way of encouraging him to continue friendly spared not to flatter him saying it was true i did not know him before but now i saw he was a man of excellent disposition at three pm we again moved forward grass became more abundant in some places it was luxuriant and yet green we halted at eight pm the night was cold with a heavy dew and there being no fuel i again contented myself with parched grain  at daylight on the 23rd we resumed our march datah mahomed asked for two mules that he and his friend might ride forward to prepare for my reception at his village i lent him the animals but after a few minutes he returned to say that i had given him the two worst and he would not go till i dismounted and gave him the mule which i was riding about noon we arrived at the lake toor erain murroo where the bedouins were in great numbers watering their flocks and herds at least 3000 head of horned cattle and sheep innumerable datah mahomed on my arrival invited me to be seated under the shade of a spreading tree and having introduced me to his people as his guest and the friend of the wallasena immediately ordered some milk which was brought in a huge bowl fresh and warm from the cow my servants were similarly provided during the night adam shot a fox which greatly astonished the bedouins and gave them even more dread of our firearms hearing that demetrius and his party who had been plundered of everything were living at a village not far distant i offered to pay the ras el caffilah any expense he might be put to if he would permit them to accompany our caravan to tajoorah he said that he had no objection to their joining the caffilah but that he had been informed their wish was to return to shoa i had a long conversation with the ras who begged of me not to go to hurrur for he said it is well known that the hurruri caravan remained behind solely on your account you will therefore enter the town should you by good fortune arrive there at all under unfavourable circumstances i am sure that the emir 2 who may receive you kindly will eventually do you much mischief besides which these bedouins will plunder you of all your property the other people of the caravan who are all my friends also spoke in the same strain this being noted as a bad halting place all kept watch with us during the night  the mules and camels having had their morning feed we set out at about 10 am on monday the 24th for the village of datah mahomed he having invited the caffilahs people and ourselves to partake of his hospitality and be present at his marriage festivities the place is situated about half a mile to the e n e of the lake it consists of about sixty huts surrounded by a thorn fence with separate enclosures for the cattle the huts are formed of curved sticks with their ends fastened in the ground covered with mats in shape approaching to oval about five feet high fifteen feet long and eight broad arrived at the village we found the elders seated under the shade of a venerable acacia feasting six bullocks were immediately slaughtered for the caffilah and ourselves at sunset a camel was brought out in front of the building and killedthe bedoos are extremely fond of this meat in the evening i had a long conversation with datah mahomed who said my son you have as yet given me nothing the wallasena gave me everything my horse has been stoleni want a mule and much cloth deeni replied for me that the mules were presents from the king sahala salassah to the governor of aden this the old man would not believe i told him that i had given him the horse and tobe but he exclaimed no no my son the wallasena is our father he told me that he had given them to me and also that you would give me great things when you arrived at my village my son the wallasena would not lie datah was then called away  early on the morning of tuesday the 25th datah mahomed invited me and the elders of the caffilah to his hut where he supplied us liberally with milk clarified butter was then handed round and the tajoorians anointed their bodies after we had left his hut he came to me and in presence of the ras el caffilah and deeni said you see i have treated you with great honour you must give me a mule and plenty of cloth as all my people want cloth you have given me nothing as yet seeing that i became rather angry and declared solemnly that i had given him the horse and tobe he smiled and said i know that but i want a mule my horse has been stoleni replied that i would see about it he then asked for all my blue cloth and my arab camblee blanket my portmanteau being rather the worse for wearits upper leather was tornhe thrust in his fingers and said with a most avaricious grin what have you here i immediately arose and exclaimed you are not my father the wallasena told me you would treat me kindly this is not doing so he begged pardon and said do not be frightened my son i will take nothing from you but what you give me freely you think i am a bad man people have been telling you ill things about me i am now an old man and have given up such childs work as plundering people it became however necessary to inquire of datah mahomed what were his intentions with regard to myself i found that i had been deceived at shoa there it was asserted that he lived at errur and was brother to bedar one of the most powerful chiefs of the adel instead of which it proved that he was not so highly connected and that he visited errur only occasionally datah told me that his marriage feast would last seven days after which he would forward me to doomi where we should find bedar who would send me either to tajoorah or to hurrur as he saw fit  i now perceived that all hope of reaching hurrur was at an end vexed and disappointed at having suffered so much in vain i was obliged to resign the idea of going there for the following reasons the mission treasury was at so low an ebb that i had left shoa with only three german crowns and the prospect of meeting on the road mahomed ali in charge of the second division of the embassy and the presents who could have supplied me with money the constant demands of datah mahomed for tobacco for cloth in fact for everything he saw would become ten times more annoying were i left with him without an interpreter the tajoorians also one all begged me not to remain saying think not of your property but only of your and your servants lives come with us to tajoorah we will travel quick and you shall share our provisions at last i consented to this new arrangement and datah mahomed made no objection this individual however did not leave me till he had extorted from me my best mule all my tobes eight in number and three others which i borrowed from the caravan people he departed about midnight saying that he would take away his mule in the morning  at 4 am on the 26th i was disturbed by datah mahomed who took away his mule and then asked for more cloth which was resolutely refused he then begged for my camblee which as it was my only covering i would not part with and checked him by desiring him to strip me if he wished it he then left me and returned in about an hour with a particular friend who had come a long way expressly to see me i acknowledged the honour and deeply regretted that i had only words to pay for it he himself having received my last tobe however i continued seeing the old mans brow darken i will endeavour to borrow one from the caffilah people deeni brought me one which was rejected as inferior i then said you see my dressthat cloth is better than what i wearbut here take my turban this had the desired effect the cloth was accepted at length datah mahomed delivered me over to the charge of the ras el caffilah in a very impressive manner and gave me his blessing we resumed our journey at 2 pm when i joined heartily with the caravan people in their praise be to god we are at length clear of the bedoos about 8 pm we halted at metta  at halfpast 4 am on the 27th we started all the people of the caffilah were warm in their congratulations that i had given up the hurrur route at 9 am we halted at codaitoo the country bears marks of having been thickly inhabited during the rains but at present owing to the want of water not an individual was to be met with at murroo we filled our waterskins there being no water between that place and doomi distant two days journey as the ras el caffilah had heard that the bedoos were as numerous as the hairs of his head at doomi and keelulhoo he determined to avoid both and proceed direct to warrahambili where water was plentiful and bedoos were few owing to the scarcity of grass this he said was partly on my account and partly on his own as he would be much troubled by the bedouins of doomi many of them being his kinsmen we continued our march from 3 pm till 9 pm when we halted at boonderrah  at 4 pm on january 28th we moved forward through the waddy boonderrah which was dry at that season grass however was still abundant from 11 am till 4 pm we halted at geera dohiba then again advancing we traversed by a very rough road a deep ravine called the place of lions the slaves are now beginning to be much knocked up many of them during the last march were obliged to be put upon camels i forgot to mention that one died the day we left murroo at 10 pm we halted at hagaioo geera dohiba this was formerly the dwellingplace of hagaioo chief of the woemah dankali but the eesa somali having made a successful attack upon him and swept off all his cattle he deserted it during the night the barking of dogs betrayed the vicinity of a bedoo encampment and caused us to keep a good lookout water being too scarce to make bread i contented myself with coffee and parched grain  at daylight on the 29th we resumed our journey and passed by an encampment of the eesa about noon we reached warrahambili thus far we have done well but the slaves are now so exhausted that a halt of two days will be necessary to recruit their strength in this wady we found an abundance of slightly brackish water and a hot spring  sunday 30th januarya caffilah travelling from tajoorah to shoa passed by the people kindly offered to take my letters mahomed ibn boraitoo one of the principal people in the caffilah presented me with a fine sheep and a quantity of milk which i was glad to accept there had been a longstanding quarrel between him and our ras el caffilah when the latter heard that i accepted the present he became very angry and said to my servant adam very well your master chooses to take things from other people why did he not ask me if he wanted sheep we shall see adam interrupted him by saying be not angry my master did not ask for the sheep it was brought to him as a present it has been slaughtered and i was just looking for you to distribute it among the people of the caffilah this appeased him and adam added if my master hears your words he will be angry for he wishes to be friends with all people i mention the above merely to show how very little excites these savages to anger the man who gave me the sheep hearing that i wished to go to tajoorah offered to take me there in four days i told him i would first consult the ras el caffilah who declared it would not be safe for me to proceed from this alone but that from dakwaylaka three marches in advance he himself would accompany me in the ras then presented me with a sheep  we resumed our journey at 1 pm january 31st passed several parties of eesa and at 8 pm halted at burroo ruddah  on february 1st we marched from 4 am to 11 am when we halted in the wady fiahloo dry at this season grass was abundant at 3 pm we resumed our journey crossing the plain of amahdoo some men were observed to the southward marching towards the caffilah the alarm and the order to close up were instantly given our men threw aside their upper garments and prepared for action being fully persuaded that it was a party of eesa coming to attack them however on nearer approach we observed several camels with them two men were sent on to inquire who they were they proved to be a party of somalis going to ousak for grain at 8 pm we halted on the plain of dakwaylaka  at daylight on february the 2nd the ras el caffilah deeni and mahomed accompanied me in advance of the caravan to water our mules at dakwaylaka arriving there about 11 am we found the bedoos watering their cattle mahomed unbridled his animal which rushed towards the trough from which the cattle were drinking the fair maid who was at the well baling out the water into the trough immediately set up the shrill cry of alarm and we were compelled to move about a mile up the wady when we came to a pool of water black as ink thirsty as i was i could not touch the stuff the caffilah arrived about halfpast 1 pm by which time the cattle of the bedoos had all been driven off to grass so that the well was at our service we encamped close to it ibrahim recommended that adam burroo of the assoubal tribe a young bedoo and a relation of his should accompany our party i promised him ten dollars at tajoorah 3 at 3 pm having completed my arrangements and leaving one servant behind to bring up the luggage i quitted the caffilah amidst the universal blessings of the people i was accompanied by ibrahim the ras el caffilah deeni ibn hamid my interpreter three of my servants and the young bedoo all mounted on mules one baggage mule fastened behind one of my servants animals carried a little flour parched grain and coffee coffeepot fryingpan and one suit of clothes for each advancing at a rapid pace about 5 pm we came up with a party consisting of eesa with their camels one of them instantly collected the camels whilst the others hurried towards us in a suspicious way the bedoo hastened to meet them and we were permitted owing i was told to my firearms the appearance of which pleased them not to proceed quietly at 7 pm having arrived at a place where grass was abundant we turned off the road and halted  at 130 am on thursday 3rd february as the moon rose we saddled our mules and pushed forward at a rapid pace at 4 am we halted and had a cup of coffee each when we again mounted as the day broke we came upon an encampment of the debeneh who hearing the clatter of our mules hoofs set up the cry of alarm the bedoo pacified them they had supposed us to be a party of eesa we continued our journey and about 10 am we halted for breakfast which consisted of coffee and parched grain at noon we again moved forward and at 3 pm having arrived at a pool of water called murhabr in the wady dalabayah we halted for about an hour to make some bread we then continued through the wady passed several bedoo encampments till a little after dark when we descended into the plain of gurgudeli here observing several fires the bedoo crawled along to reconnoitre and returned to say they were debeneh we gave them a wide berth and about 830 pm halted we were cautioned not to make a fire but i had a great desire for a cup of coffee after the fatigue of this long march accordingly we made a small fire concealing it with shields  at 3 am on friday the 4th february we resumed our journey after about an hour and a half arriving at a good grazing ground we halted to feed the mules and then watered them at alooli at 1 pm i found the sun so oppressive that i was obliged to halt for two hours we had struck off to the right of the route pursued by the embassy and crossed not the salt lake but the hills to the southward the wind blowing very strong considerably retarded our progress so that we did not arrive at dahfurri our haltingplace till sunset dahfurri is situated about four miles to the southward of mhow the encampment of the embassy near the lake and about 300 yards to the eastward of the road here we found a large basin of excellent water which the tajoorians informed me was a mere mass of mud when we passed by to shoa but that the late rains had cleared away all the impurities after sunset a gale of wind blew  at 1 am on the 5th february the wind having decreased we started passing through the pass of the rer essa the barking of dogs caused us some little uneasiness as it betrayed the vicinity of the bedoo whether friend or foe we knew not ibrahim requested us to keep close order and to be silent as day broke we descended into the plain of warrah lissun where we halted and ate the last of the grain after half an hours halt we continued our journey ibrahim soon declared his inability to keep up with us so he recommended me to the care of the bedoo and deeni saying he would follow slowly we arrived at sagulloo about 11 am and ibrahim about two hours afterwards at 3 pm we resumed our march and a little before sunset arrived at ambaboo  the elders had a conference which lasted about a quarter of an hour when they came forward and welcomed me directing men to look after my mules i was led to a house which had been cleaned for my reception ibrahim then brought water and a bag of dates and shortly afterwards some rice and milk many villagers called to pay their respects and remained but a short time as i wanted repose they would scarcely believe that i had travelled in eighteen days from shoa including four days halt  early on the morning of the 6th february i set out for tajoorah where i was received with every demonstration of welcome by both rich and poor the sultan gave me his house and after i had drunk a cup of coffee with him considerately ordered away all the people who had flocked to see me as he remarked i must be tired after so rapid a journey  it may not be amiss to mention here that the british character stands very high at tajoorah the people assured me that since the british had taken aden they had enjoyed peace and security and that from being beggars they had become princes as a proof of their sincerity they said with pride look at our village you saw it a year and a half ago you know what it was then behold what is now i confessed that it had been much improved  from tajoorah the traveller after awarding his attendants took boat for zayla where he was hospitably received by the hajj sharmarkays agent suffering severely from fever on monday the 14th february he put to sea again and visited berberah where he lived in sharmarkays house and finally he arrived at aden on friday the 25th february 1842 he concludes the narrative of his adventure as follows  it is due to myself that i should offer some explanation for the rough manner in which this report is drawn up on leaving shoa the caffilah people marked with a jealous eye that i seemed to number the slaves and camels and deeni reported to me that they had observed my making entries in my notebook whenever the bedoos on the road caught sight of a piece of paper they were loud in their demands for it 4 our marches were so rapid that i was scarcely allowed time sufficient to prepare for the fatigues of the ensuing day and experience had taught me the necessity of keeping a vigilant watch 5 aware that government must be anxious for information from the mission i performed the journey in a shorter space of time than any messenger however highly paid has yet done it and for several days lived on coffee and parched grain moreover on arrival at aden i was so weak from severe illness that i could write but at short intervals  it will not i trust be considered that the alteration in my route was caused by trivial circumstances it would have been absurd to have remained with the bedoos without an interpreter there would have been daily disputes and misunderstandings and i had already sufficient insight into the character of datah mahomed to perceive that his avarice was insatiable supposing i had passed through his hands there was the chief of bedar who besides expecting much more than i had given to datah mahomed would it is almost certain eventually have forwarded me to tajoorah finally if i can believe the innumerable reports of the people both at tajoorah and zalaya neither i myself nor my servants would ever have passed through the kingdom of hurrur the jealousy of the prince against foreigners is so great that although he would not injure them within the limits of his own dominions he would cause them to waylaid and murdered on the road   footnotes  1 thus in the original it may be a mistake for captain barker is i am informed a proficient in conversational arabic  2 this chief was the emir abubakr father of ahmed the latter was ruling when i entered harar in 1855  3 as the youth gave perfect satisfaction he received besides the ten dollars a tobe and a european saddle to which he had taken a great fancy  4 in these wild countries every bit of paper written over is considered to be a talisman or charm  5 a sergeant a corporal and a portuguese cook belonging to captain harriss mission were treacherously slain near tajoorah at night the murderers were hamid saborayto and mohammed saborayto two dankalis of the ad all clan in 1842 they seem to have tried a ruse de guerre upon m rochet and received from him only too mild a chastisement the ruffians still
