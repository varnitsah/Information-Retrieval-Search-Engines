67715459	blue lights by rm ballantyne    chapter one  hot work in the soudan  the false step  there is a dividing ridge in the great northern wilderness of america whereon lies a lakelet of not more than twenty yards in diameter  it is of crystal clearness and profound depth and on the still evenings of the indian summer its surface forms a perfect mirror which might serve as a toiletglass for a redskin princess  we have stood by the side of that lakelet and failed to note the slightest symptom of motion in it yet somewhere in its centre there was going on a constant and mysterious division of watery particles and those of them which glided imperceptibly to the right flowed southward to the atlantic while those that trembled to the left found a restingplace by the frozen shores of hudsons bay  as it is with the flow and final exit of those waters so is it sometimes if not always with the spirit and destiny of man  miles milton our hero at the age of nineteen stood at the dividing ridge of his life  if the oscillating spirit trembling between right and wrong had decided to lean to the right what might have been his fate no one can tell  he paused on the balance a short time then he leaned over to the left and what his fate was it is the purpose of this volume to disclose  at the outset we may remark that it was not unmixed good  neither was it unmitigated evil  miles had a strong body a strong will and a somewhat passionate temper a compound which is closely allied to dynamite  his father unfortunately was composed of much the same materials  the consequences were sometimes explosive  it might have profited the son much had he studied the scripture lesson children obey your parents in the lord  not less might it have benefited the father to have pondered the words fathers provoke not your children to wrath  young milton had set his heart on going into the army  old milton had resolved to thwart the desire of his son  the mother milton a meek and loving soul experienced some hard times between the two  both loved her intensely and each loved himself not better perhaps but too much  it is a sad task to have to recount the disputes between a father and a son  we shrink from it and turn away  suffice it to say that one day miles and his father had a vesuvian meeting on the subject of the army the son became petulant and unreasonable the father fierce and tyrannical  the end was that they parted in anger  go sir cried the father sternly when you are in a better frame of mind you may return  yes father i will go cried the son starting up and i will never return  poor youth  he was both right and wrong in this prophetic speech  he did return home but he did not return to his father  with fevered pulse and throbbing heart he rushed into a plantation that lay at the back of his fathers house  he had no definite intention save to relieve his feelings by violent action  running at full speed he came suddenly to a disused quarry that was full of water  it had long been a familiar haunt as a bathingpool  many a time in years past had he leaped off its precipitous margin into the deep water and wantoned there in all the abandonment of exuberant youth  the leap was about thirty feet the depth of water probably greater  constant practice had rendered miles so expert at diving and swimming that he had come to feel as much at home in the water as a newzealander  casting off his garments he took the accustomed plunge by way of cooling his heart and brain  he came up from the depths refreshed but not restored to equanimity  while dressing the sense of injustice returned as strongly as before and with it the hot indignation so that on afterwards reaching the highway he paused only for a few moments  this was the critical point  slowly but decidedly he leaned to the left  he turned his back on his fathers house and caused the stones to spurt from under his heels as he walked rapidly away  if miles milton had thought of his mother at that time he might have escaped many a day of bitter repentance for she was as gentle as her husband was harsh but the angry youth either forgot her at the moment or more probably thrust the thought of her away  poor mother if she had only known what a conflict between good and evil was going on in the breast of her boy how she would have agonised in prayer for him  but she did not know  there was however one who did know who loved him better even than his mother and who watched and guarded him throughout all his chequered career  it is not improbable that in spite of his resolves miles would have relented before night and returned home had not a very singular incident intervened and closed the door behind him  that day a notorious swindler had been tracked by a redhaired detective to the manufacturing city to which miles first directed his steps  the bills describing the swindler set forth that he was quite young tall handsome broadshouldered with black curling hair and a budding moustache that he was dressed in grey tweeds and had a prepossessing manner  now this chanced to be in some respects an exact description of miles milton  the budding moustache to be sure was barely discernible still it was sufficiently so for a detective to found on  his dress too was brown tweed not grey but of course dresses can be changed and as to his manner there could not be two opinions about that  now it chanced to be past one oclock when miles entered the town and felt himself impelled by familiar sensations to pause in front of an eatinghouse  it was a poor eatinghouse in a low district but miles was not particular still further it was a temperance coffeehouse but miles cared nothing for strong drink  strong health and spirits had served his purpose admirably up to that date  inside the eatinghouse there sat several men of the artisan class and a few of the nondescript variety  among the latter was the redhaired detective  he was engaged with a solid beefsteak  oho escaped softly from his lips when his sharp eyes caught sight of our hero  so softly did he utter the exclamation that it might have been a mere remark of appreciation addressed to the steak from which he did not again raise his eyes for a considerable time  the place was very full of peopleso full that there seemed scarcely room for another guest but by some almost imperceptible motion the redhaired man made a little space close to himself  the man next to him with a hooknose widened the space by similar action and miles perceiving that there was room sat down  bread and cheese he said to the waiter  bread an cheese sir  yessir  miles was soon actively engaged in mechanically feeding while his mind was busy as to future plans  presently he became aware that the men on either side of him were scanning his features and person with peculiar attention  coldish weather remarked the redhaired man looking at him in a friendly way  it is replied miles civilly enough  rather cold for bathin aint it sir continued the detective carelessly picking his teeth with a quill  how did you know that ive been bathing demanded miles in surprise  i didnt know it  how did you guess it then  vell it aint difficult to guess that a young feller as bin avin a swim wen you see the air of is ead hall vet an is pocketankercher lookin as if it ad done dooty for a towel not to mention is veskit avin bin putt on in a urry so as the buttons aint got into the right oles you see  miles laughed and resumed his bread and cheese  you are observant i perceive he said  not wery partiklarly so returned redhair but i do obsarve that your boots tell of country roads  was it a long way hout of town as you was bathin this forenoon now  there was a free and easy familiarity about the mans tone which miles resented but not wishing to run the risk of a disagreement in such company he answered quietlyyes a considerable distance it was in an old quarry where i often bathe close to my fathers house  ha jest so about alfway to the willage of ramplin were you slep last night if report speaks true an were you left the grey tweeds unless praps you sunk em in the old quarry  why what on earth do you mean asked miles with a look of such genuine surprise that redhair was puzzled and the man with the hooked nose who had been listening attentively looked slightly confused  read that sir said the detective extracting a newspaper cutting from his pocket and laying it on the table before miles  while he read the two men watched him with interest so did some of those who sat near for they began to perceive that something was in the wind  the telltale blood sprang to the youths brow as he read and perceived the meaning of the mans remarks  at this redhair and hooknose nodded to each other significantly  you dont mean to say exclaimed miles in a tone of grand indignation which confirmed the men in their suspicion that you think this description applies to me  i wouldnt insinivate too much sir though i have got my suspicions said redhair blandly but of course thats easy settled for if your fathers ouse is anywere hereabouts your father wont object to identify his son  ridiculous exclaimed miles rising angrily at this interruption to his plans  the two men rose promptly at the same moment  of course my father will prove that you have made a mistake but  he hesitated in some confusion for the idea of reappearing before his father so soon and in such company after so stoutly asserting that he would never more return was humiliating  the detective observed the hesitation and became jocose  if youd rather not trouble your parent said redhair youve got no call to do it  the station aint far off and the sooner we get there the better for all parties  a slight clink of metal at this point made miles aware of the fact that hooknose was drawing a pair of handcuffs from one of his pockets  the full significance of his position suddenly burst upon him  the thought of being led home a prisoner or conveyed to the policestation handcuffed maddened him and the idea of being thus unjustly checked at the very outset of his independent career made him furious  for a few moments he stood so perfectly still and quiet that the detectives were thrown slightly off their guard  then there was an explosion of some sort within the breast of miles milton  it expended itself in a sudden impulse which sent redhead flat on the table among the crockery and drove hooknose into the fireplace among the fireirons  a fat little man chanced to be standing in the doorway  the same impulse modified shot that little man into the street like a cork out of a bottle and next moment miles was flying along the pavement at racing speed horrified at what he had done but utterly reckless as to what might follow  hearing the shouts of pursuers behind him and being incommoded by passersby in the crowded thoroughfare miles turned sharply into a bystreet and would have easily made his escapebeing uncommonly swift of foothad he not been observed by an active little man of supple frame and presumptuous tendencies  unlike the mass of mankind around himwho stared and wonderedthe active little man took in the situation at a glance joined in the pursuit kept well up thus forming a sort of connectinglink between the fugitive and pursuers and even took upon himself to shout stop thief as he ran  miles endeavoured to throw him off by putting on as schoolboys have it a spurt  but the active little man also spurted and did not fall far behind  then miles tried a second double and got into a narrow street which a single glance showed him was a blind alley  disappointment and anger hereupon took possession of him and he turned at bay with the tigerlike resolve to run amuck  fortunately for himself he observed a pot of whitewash standing near a halfwhitened wall with a dirty canvas frock and a soiled billycock lying beside it  the owner of the property had left it inopportunely for quick as thought miles wriggled into the frock flung on the billycock seized the pot and walked in a leisurely way to the head of the alley  he reached it just as the active little man turned into it at the rate of ten miles an hour  a yell of stop thief issued from the mans presumptuous lips at the moment  his injunction was obeyed to the letter for the wouldbe thief of an honest mans character on insufficient evidence was stopped by miless bulky person so violently that the whitewash was scattered all about and part of it went into the active mans eyes  to squash the large brush into the little mans face and thus effectually complete what his own recklessness had begun was the work of an instant  as he did it miles assumed the role of the injured party suiting his language to his condition  what dee mean by that you houtrageous willain he cried savagely to the great amusement of the bystanders who instantly formed a crowd round them  look wot a mess youve bin an made o my clean frock dont you see  the poor little man could not see  he could only cough and gasp and wipe his face with his coattails  id give you in charge o the pleece i would if it wasnt that youve pretty well punished yourself aready continued miles  take im to a pump some o you cause i aint got time  goodday spiderlegs an dont go for to run into a hartist again with a paintpot in is and  so saying miles pushed through the laughing crowd and sauntered away he turned into the first street he came to and then went forward as fast as was consistent with the idea of an artisan in a hurry  being utterly ignorant of the particular locality into which he had penetratedthough well enough acquainted with the main thoroughfares of the cityhis only care was to put as many intricate streets and lanes as possible between himself and the detectives  this was soon done and thereafter turning into a darkish passage he got rid of the paintpot and borrowed costume  fortunately he had thrust his own soft helmetshaped cap into his breast at the time he put on the billycock and was thus enabled to issue from the dark passage very much like his former self with the exception of a few spots of whitewash which were soon removed  feeling now pretty safe our hero walked a considerable distance through the unknown parts of the city before he ventured to inquire the way to thoroughfares with which he was familiar  once in these he proceeded at a smart pace to one of the railway stations intending to leave town though as yet he had formed no definite plan of action  in truth his mind was much troubled and confused by the action of his conscience for when the thought of leaving home and entering the army as a private soldier against his fathers wishes crossed his mind conscience faithfully shook his head and when softer feelings prevailed and the question arose irresistibly shall i return home the same faithful friend whispered yes  in a state of indecision miles found himself borne along by a human stream to the bookingoffice  immediately in front of him were two soldiersone a sergeant and the other a private of the line  both were tall handsome men straight as arrows and with that air of selfsufficient power which is as far removed from arrogance as it is from cowardice and is by no means an uncommon feature in men of the british army  miles felt a strong unaccountable attraction towards the young private he had not yet heard his voice nor encountered his eye indeed being behind him he had only seen his sideface and as the expression on it was that of stern gravity the attractive power could not have lain in that  it might have lain in the youthful look of the lad for albeit a goodly man in person he was almost a boy in countenance being apparently not yet twenty years of age  miles was at last roused to the necessity for prompt and decisive action by the voice of the sergeant saying in tones of authority  portsmouththirdtwosingle  thats the way to go it lobster remarked a shabby man next in the line behind miles  the grave sergeant paid no more regard to this remark than if it had been the squeak of a mouse  now then sir your carridge stops the way  eave aead  shall i elp you said the shabby man  thus admonished miles scarce knowing what he said repeated the sergeants words  portsmouththirdtwosingle  vy you aint agoin to pay for me are you exclaimed the shabby man in smiling surprise  oh beg pardon  i mean one said miles to the clerk quickly  the clerk retracted the second ticket with stolid indifference and miles hastening to the platform sat down on a seat deeply and uncomfortably impressed with the fact that he possessed little or no money  this unsatisfactory state of things had suddenly burst upon him while in the act of paying for his ticket  he now made a careful examination of his purse and found its contents to be exactly seven shillings and sixpence besides a few coppers in his trouserspocket  again indecision assailed him  should he return  it was not too late yes said conscience with emphasis  no said shame  false pride echoed the word and selfwill reechoed it  still our hero hesitated and there is no saying what the upshot might have been if the bell had not rung at the moment and now then take your seats put an end to the controversy  another minute and miles milton was seated opposite the two soldiers rushing towards our great southern seaport at the rate of forty miles an hour    chapter two  shows some of the consequences of the false step and introduces the reader to peculiar company  our hero soon discovered that the sergeant was an old campaigner having been out in egypt at the beginning of the war and fought at the famous battle of telelkebir  in his grave and undemonstrative way and quiet voice this man related some of his experiences so as not only to gain the attention of his companion in arms but to fascinate all who chanced to be within earshot of himnot the least interested among whom of course was our friend miles  as the sergeant continued to expatiate on those incidents of the war which had come under his own observation three points impressed themselves on our hero first that the sergeant was evidently a man of serious if not religious spirit second that while he gave all due credit to his comrades for their bravery in action he dwelt chiefly on those incidents which brought out the higher qualities of the men such as uncomplaining endurance forbearance etcetera and he never boasted of having given a thorough licking to the egyptians nor spoke disparagingly of the native troops lastly that he seemed to lay himself out with a special view to the unflagging entertainment of his young comrade  the reason for this last purpose he learned during a short halt at one of the stations  seeing the sergeant standing alone there miles after accosting him with the inevitable references to the state of the weather remarked that his comrade seemed to be almost too young for the rough work of soldiering  yes he is young enough but older than he looks answered the sergeant  poor lad  im sorry for him  indeed  he does not seem to me a fit subject for pity  young strong handsome intelligent he seems pretty well furnished to begin the battle of lifeespecially in the army  things are not what they seem returned the soldier regarding his young questioner with something between a compassionate and an amused look  all is not gold that glitters  soldiering is not made up of brass bands swords and red coats  having read a good deal of history i am well aware of that retorted miles who was somewhat offended by the implication contained in the sergeants remarks  well then you see continued the sergeant all the advantages that you have mentioned and which my comrade certainly possesses weigh nothing with him at all just now because this sudden call to the wars separates him from his poor young wife  wife exclaimed miles why he seems to me little more than a boy except in size and perhaps in gravity  he is over twenty and as to gravitywell most young fellows would be grave enough if they had to leave a pretty young wife after six months of wedded life  you see he married without leave and so even if it were a time of peace his wife would not be recognised by the service  in wartime he must of course leave her behind him  it has been a hard job to prevent him from deserting and now its all i can do to divert his attention from his sorrow by stirring him up with tales of the recent wars  at this point the inexorable bell rang doors were banged whistles sounded and the journey was resumed  arrived at portsmouth miles was quickly involved in the bustle of the platform  he had made up his mind to have some private conversation with the sergeant as to the possibility of entering her majestys service as a private soldier and was on the point of accompanying his military travelling companions into the comparative quiet of the street when a porter touched his cap  any luggage sir  luggageanono luggage  it was the first moment since leaving home that the thought of luggage had entered into his brain  that thought naturally aroused other thoughts such as lodgings food friends funds and the like  on turning to the spot where his military companions had stood he discovered that they were gone  running to the nearest doorway he found it to be the wrong one and before he found the right one and reached the street the two soldiers had vanished from the scene  you seem to be a stranger here sir  can i direct you said an insinuating voice at his elbow  the speaker was an elderly man of shabbygenteel appearance and polite address  miles did not quite like the look of him  in the circumstances however and with a strangely desolate feeling of loneliness creeping over him he did not see his way to reject a civil offer  thank you  i am indeed a stranger and happen to have neither friend nor acquaintance in the town so if you can put me in the way of finding a respectable lodgingaa cheap one you will greatly oblige me  with pleasure said the man if you will accompany  stay dont trouble yourself to show me the way interrupted miles just name a house and the street that will  no trouble at all sir said the man  i happen to be going in the direction of the docks and know of excellent as well as cheap lodgings there  making no further objection miles followed his new friend into the street  for some time the crowd being considerable and noisy they walked in silence  at the time we write of portsmouth was ringing with martial music and preparations for war  at all times the redcoats and the bluejackets are prominent in the streets of that seaport for almost the whole of our army passes through it at one period or another either in going to or returning from foreign parts  but at this time there was the additional bustle resulting from the egyptian war  exceptional activity prevailed in its yards and hurry in its streets  recruits recently enlisted flocked into it from all quarters while on its jetties were frequently landed the sad fruits of war in the form of wounded men  have you ever been in portsmouth before asked the shabbygenteel man on reaching a part of the town which was more open and less crowded  never  i had no idea it was so large and bustling said miles  the crowding and bustling is largely increased just now of course in consequence of the war in egypt returned the man  troops are constantly embarking and others returning  it is a noble service  men start in thousands from this port young hearty healthy and full of spirit they returnthose of them who return at allsickly brokendown and with no spirit at all except what they soon get poured into them by the publicans  yes commend me to the service of my queen and country  there was a sneering tone in the mans voice which fired his companions easily roused indignation  mind what you say about our queen while in my company said miles sternly stopping short and looking the man full in the face  i am a loyal subject and will listen to nothing said in disparagement of the queen or of her majestys forces  bless you sir said the man quickly im a loyal subject myself and wouldnt for the world say a word against her majesty  no more would i disparage her troops but after all the army aint perfect you know even you must admit that sir  with all its noble qualities theres room for improvement  there was such an air of sincerityor at least of assumed humilityin the mans tone and manner that miles felt it unjustifiable to retain his indignation  at the same time he could not all at once repress it and was hesitating whether to fling off from the man or to forgive him when the sound of many voices and of feet tramping in regular time struck his ear and diverted his attention  next moment the head of a regiment accompanied by a crowd of juvenile admirers swept round the corner of the street  at the same instant a forest of bayonets gleamed upon the youths vision and a brass band burst with crashing grandeur upon his ear sending a quiver of enthusiasm into the deepest recesses of his soul and stirring the very marrow in his bones  miles stood entranced until the regiment had passed and the martial strains were softened by distance then he looked up and perceived that his shabby companion was regarding him with a peculiar smile  i think youve a notion of being a soldier he said with a smile  where is that regiment going asked miles instead of answering the question  to barracks at present to egypt in a few days  therell be more followin it before long  it was a distracting as well as an exciting walk that miles had through the town for at every turn he passed couples or groups of soldiers or sailors or marines and innumerable questions sprang into and jostled each other in his mind while at the same moment his thoughts and feelings were busy with his present circumstances and future prospects the distraction was increased by the remarks and comments of his guide and he would fain have got rid of him but goodfeeling as well as commonsense forbade his casting him off without sufficient reason  presently he stopped without very well knowing why in front of a large imposing edifice  looking up he observed the words soldiers institute in large letters on the front of it  what sort of an institute is that he asked  oh its a miserable affair where soldiers are taken in cheap as they say an done for returned the shabby man hurriedly as if the subject were distasteful to him  come along with me and ill show you places where soldiersay and civilians toocan enjoy themselves like gentlemen an get value for their money  as he spoke two finelooking men issued from a small street close to them and crossed the roadone a soldier of the line the other a marine  here it is jack exclaimed the soldier to his friend miss sarah robinsons institoot that youve heard so much about  come an ill show you where you can write your letter in peace  thus much was overheard by miles as they turned into a sidestreet and entered what was obviously one of the poorer districts of the town  evidently that soldiers opinion does not agree with yours remarked miles as they walked along  mores the pity returned the shabby man whose name he had informed his companion was sloper  now we are getting among places you see where theres a good deal of drinking going on  i scarcely require to be told that returned miles curtly for he was beginning to feel his original dislike to mister sloper intensified  it did not indeed require any better instructor than eyes and ears to inform our hero that the grogshops around him were full and that a large proportion of the shouting and swearing revellers inside were soldiers and seamen  by this time it was growing dark and most of the ginpalaces were beginning to send forth that glare of intense and warm light with which they so knowingly attract the human moths that constitute their prey  here we are said sloper stopping in front of a publichouse in a narrow street  this is one o the respectable lodgins  most o the others are disreputable  its not much of a neighbourhood i admit  it certainly is not very attractive said miles hesitating  you said you wanted a cheap one returned sloper and you cant expect to have it cheap and fashionable you know  youve no occasion to be afraid  come in  the arguments of mr sloper might have failed to move miles but the idea of his being afraid to go anywhere was too much for him  go in then he said firmly and followed  the room into which he was ushered was a moderately large publichouse with a bar and a number of tables round the room at which many men and a few women were seated some gambling others singing or disputing and all drinking and smoking  it is only right to say that miles was shocked  hitherto he had lived a quiet and comparatively innocent country life  he knew of such places chiefly from books or hearsay or had gathered merely the superficial knowledge that comes through the opening of a swingdoor  for the first time in his life he stood inside a low drinkingshop breathing its polluted atmosphere and listening to its foul language  his first impulse was to retreat but false shame the knowledge that he had no friend in portsmouth or place to go to that the state of his purse forbade his indulging in more suitable accommodation and a certain pride of character which made him always determine to carry out what he had resolved to doall these considerations and facts combined to prevent his acting on the better impulse  he doggedly followed his guide to a small round table and sat down  prudence however began to operate within him  he felt that he had done wrong but it was too late now he thought to retrace his steps he would however be on his guard would not encourage the slightest familiarity on the part of any one and would keep his eyes open  for a youth who had seen nothing of the world this was a highly commendable resolve  whatll you drink asked mr sloper  miles was on the point of saying coffee but reflecting that the beverage might not be readily obtainable in such a place he substituted beer  instead of calling the waiter mr sloper went himself to the bar to fetch the liquor  while he was thus engaged miles glanced round the room and was particularly struck with the appearance of a large finelooking sailor who sat at the small table next to him with hands thrust deep into his trouserspockets his chin resting on his broad chest and a solemn owlish stare in his semidrunken yet manly countenance  he sat alone and was obviously in a very sulky frame of minda condition which he occasionally indicated through a growl of dissatisfaction  as miles sat wondering what could have upset the temper of a tar whose visage was marked by the unmistakable lines and dimples of goodhumour he overheard part of the conversation that passed between the barman and mr sloper  what have they got hold o rattling bill asked the former as he drew the beer  ay worse luck returned sloper  i saw the sergeant as i came along lead him over to miss robinsons trapconfound her  dont you go fur to say anything agin miss robinson old man suddenly growled the big sailor in a voice so deep and strong that it silenced for a moment the rest of the company  leastways you may if you like but if you do ill knock in your daylights an polish up your figurhead so as your own mother would mistake you fur a battered saucepan  the seaman did not move from his semirecumbent position as he uttered this alarming threat but he accompanied it with a portentous frown and an owlish wink of both eyes  what have you joined the blue lights asked sloper with a smile referring to the name by which the religious and temperance men of the army were known  no i hant  better for me praps if i had  here waiter fetch me another ginanwarer  an more o the gin than the warer mind heave ahead or ill sink you  having been supplied with a fresh dose of gin and water the seaman appeared to go to sleep and miles for want of anything better to do accepted slopers invitation to play a game of dominoes  are the beds here pretty good he asked as they were about to begin  yes firstratefor the money answered sloper  thats a lie growled the big sailor  theyre bad at any price stuffed wi cocoanuts and marlinespikes  mr sloper received this observation with the smiling urbanity of a man who eschews war at all costs  you dont drink he said after a time referring to miless pot of beer which he had not yet touched  miles made no reply but by way of answer took up the pot and put it to his lips  he had not drunk much of it when the big seaman rose hurriedly and staggered between the two tables  in doing so he accidentally knocked the pot out of the youths hand and sent the contents into mr slopers face and down into his bosom to the immense amusement of the company  that man of peace accepted the baptism meekly but miles sprang up in sudden anger  the seaman turned to him however with a benignantly apologetic smile  hallo messmate  i ax your parding  they dont leave room even for a scarecrow to go about in this here cabin  ill stand you another glass give us your flipper  there was no resisting this it was said so heartily  miles grasped the huge hand that was extended and shook it warmly  all right he said laughing  i dont mind the beer and theres plenty more where that came from but i fear you have done some damage to my fr  your friend  out with it sir  never be ashamed to acknowledge your friends exclaimed the shabby man as he wiped his face  hold on a bit he added rising ill have to change my shirt  wont keep you waitin long  another pot o beer for this ere genlemn said the sailor to the barman as sloper left the room  paying for the drink he returned and put the pot on the table  then turning to miles he said in a low voice and with an intelligent look  come outside for a bit messmate  i wants to speak to ee  miles rose and followed the man in much surprise  youll excuse me sir he said when a few yards away from the door but i see that youre green an dont know what a rascally place youve got into  ive been fleeced there myself and yet im fool enough to go back  most o the parties thereexcept the sailors an sodgersare thieves an blackguards  theyve drugged your beer i know thats why i capsized it for you and the

molloy at your service an that name dont require no handleeither mister or esquireto prop it up  the way in which the sailor squared his broad shoulders when he said this rendered it necessary to prop himself up  seeing which miles afforded the needful aid by taking his arm in a friendly way  but come let us go back he said  i must pay for my beer you know  your beer is paid for young man said molloy stopping and refusing to move  i paid for it so youve ony got to settle with me besides if you go back youre done for  and youve no call to go back to say farewell to your dear friend sloper

demanded the sailor sternly  no fault to find at all replied miles suffering himself to be hurried away by his new friend but wherever i have gone since arriving in portsmouth her name has cropped up  in portsmouth echoed the sailor  let me tell you young man that wherever you go all over the world if theres a british soldier there miss sarah robinsons name will be sure to crop up  why dont you know that shes the soldiers friend  im afraid i must confess to ignorance on the pointyet stay now you couple her name with the soldiers friend i have got a faint remembrance of having heard it before  have i not heard of a miss weston too in connection with a work of some sort among sailors  ay no doubt ye have  she has a grand institoot in portsmuth too but she goes in for sailors onlyall over the kingdomwereas miss robinson goes in for soldiers an sailors both though mainly for the soldiers  she set agoin the sailors welcome before miss weston began in portsmuth an so she keeps it up but there aint no opposition or rivalry  their aims is pretty much alike an so they keep stroke together wi the oars  but ill tell you more about that when you get inside  here we are  theres the dockgates you see and thats queen street an the welcomes close at hand  its a teetotal house you know  all miss robinsons institoots is that  indeed  how comes it then that a manexcuse methree sheets in the wind can gain admittance  oh as to that any sailor or soldier may get admittance even if hes as drunk as a fiddler if he ony behaves hisself  but they wont supply drink on the premises or allow it to be brought incept inside o you of coorse  cause why you cant help thatleastwise not without the help of a stomachpump  plenty o men who aint abstainers go to sleep every night at the welcome cause they find the beds and other things so comfortable  in fact some hard topers have been indooced to take the pledge in consekince o what theyve heard an seen in this welcome though they came at first only for the readinroom an beds  here let me look at you under this here lamp  yes  youll do  youre something like a seadog already  you wont object to change hats wi me  why asked miles somewhat amused  never you mind that mate  you just putt yourself under my orders if youd sail comfortably before the wind  ill arrange matters an you can square up in the morning  as miles saw no particular reason for objecting to this fancy of his eccentric friend he exchanged his soft cap for the sailors straw hat and they entered the welcome together    chapter three  the sailors welcomemiles has a night of it and enlistshis friend armstrong has an agreeable surprise at the soldiers institute  it was not long before our hero discovered the reason of jack molloys solicitude about his appearance  it was that he miles should pass for a sailor and thus be in a position to claim the hospitality of the sailors welcometo the inner life of which civilians were not admitted though they were privileged with the public in general to the use of the outer refreshmentroom  come here jack molloy he said leading his friend aside when he made this discovery  you pride yourself on being a trueblue british tar dont you  i does said jack with a profound solemnity of decision that comported well with his character and condition  and you would scorn to serve under the french flag or the turkish flag or the black flag or any flag but the union jack wouldnt you  right you are mate thems my sentiments to a tee  well then you cant expect me to sail under false colours any more than yourself continued miles  i scorn to sail into this port under your straw hat so ill strike these colours bid you goodbye and make sail for another port where a civilian will be welcome  molloy frowned at the floor for some moments in stern perplexity  youve took the wind out o my sails entirely you have he replied at last an youre right young man but im troubled about you  if you dont run into this here port youll have to beat about in the offing all night or cast anchor in the streets for i dont know of another lodgin in portsmuth were you could hang out except them disrepitible grogshops  in coorse theres the big hotels but i heerd you say to sloper that you was bound to do things cheap bein hard up  never mind my friend said miles quickly  i will manage somehow so goodnight and many thanks to you for the interest you have taken in  avast mate theres no call to go into action in sitch a hurry  this here sailors welcome opens the doors of its bar an refreshmentroom an spreads its purvisions before all an sundry as can afford to pay its moderate demands  its ony the aftercabin youre not free to  so youll have a bit supper wi me before you set sail on your night cruise  being by that time rather hungry as well as fatigued miles agreed to remain for supper  while they were engaged with it he was greatly impressed with the number of sailors and marines who passed into the readingroom beyond the bar or who sat down at the numerous tables around to have a hearty supper which they washed down with tea and coffee instead of beer or ginapparently with tremendous appetite and much satisfaction  look ye here said jack molloy rising when their feed was about concluded ive no doubt they wont object to your taking a squint at the readinroom though they wont let you use it  following his companion miles passed by a glass double door into an enormous welllighted warm room seventy feet long and of proportionate width and height in which a goodly number of men of the sea were busy as beessome of them reading books or turning over illustrated papers and magazines others smoking their pipes and enjoying themselves in rockingchairs in front of the glowing fire chatting laughing and yarning as freeandeasily as if in their native focsls while a few were examining the pictures on the walls or the large models of ships which stood at one side of the room  at the upper end a fullsized billiardtable afforded amusement to several players and profound interest to a number of spectators who passed their comments on the play with that offhand freedom which seems to be a product of fresh gales and saltwater  a door standing partly open at the upper end of this apartment revealed a large hall from which issued faintly the sound of soft music  aint it snug and theres no gamblin agoin on there remarked molloy as they returned to their table thats not allowednor drinkin nor cardplayin but thats all they putt a stop to  shes a wise woman is miss robinson  she dont hamper us wi no rules  why bless you jack ashore would never submit to rules  he gits more than enough o them afloat  no its liberty hall here  we may come an go as we like at all hours o the day and night an do exactly as we please so long as we dont smash up the furnitur or feed without payin or make ourselves a gineral noosance  they dont even forbid swearin  they say they leave the matter o lingo to our own good taste and good sense  an dyou know its wonderful what an amount o both weve got wen we aint worried about it  youll scarce hear an oath in this house from mornin to evenin though youll hear a deal o snorin doorin the night  thats how the place takes so well dee see  then the welcome is well patronised i suppose  patronised exclaimed the seaman thats so an no mistake  why matebut whats your name  ive forgot to ax you that all this time  call me miles said our hero with some hesitation  call you miles  aint you miles  well yes i am only theres more of my name than that but thats enough for your purpose i daresay  all right  well miles you was askin how the house is patronised ill tell ee  they make up about two hundred an twenty beds in it altogether an these are chockfull amost every night  one way or another they had fortyfour thousand men more or less as slep under this roof last yearso ive bin told  thats patronisin aint it to say nothin o the fellers as comes forgrub which as youve found is good for the money and the attendants is civil  you see theyre always kind an attentive here cause they professes to think more of our souls than our bodieswhich weve no objection to dee see for the lookin arter our souls includes the lookin arter our bodies  an they dont bother us in no way to attend their biblereadins an sitchlike  there they are in separate rooms if you want em you may go if you dont you can let em alone  no compulsion which comes quite handy to some on us for i dont myself care much about sitchlike things  so longs my bodys all right i leaves my soul to look arter itself  as the seaman said this with a goodnatured smile of indifference there sprang to the mind of his young companion words that had often been impressed on him by his mother what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul but he made no reference to this at the time  howsever continued molloy as they dont worrit us about religion except to give us a good word an a blessin now an again and mayhap a little book to read we all patronises the house an its my opinion if it was twice as big as it is wed fill it chockfull  i would board as well as sleep in it myselffor its full o conveniences sitch as lockers to putt our things in an baths and what not besides all the other things ive mentionedbut the want o drink staggers me  i cant git along without a drop o drink  miles thought that his nautical friend appeared to be unable to get along without a good many drops of drink but he was too polite to say so  man alive continued jack molloy striking his huge fist on his thigh with emphasis its a wonderful place is this welcome  an its a lively place too  why a fellow hanged hisself in one o the bunks overhead not long ago  you dont mean that exclaimed miles rather shocked  in course i does  but they heard im gaspin an cut him down in time to save him  it was drink they say as made him do it and they got him to sign the pledge arterwards  i believe hes kep it too  leastwise i know many a hard drinker as have bin indooced to give it up and stuck to itall through comin here to have a snooze in a comfortable hunk they give the bunks namescubicles they calls em in the lump separately theres the commodore goodenough cot an the little nellie cot an the sunshine cotso called cause it haint got a porthole to let in the daylight at all and the billy rough un  the what  the billy rough unarter the ship o that name you know  oh you mean the bellerophon  well young man an didnt i say the billy rough un  then theres thebut whats your hurry said the seaman as miles rose  its getting late now friend  if im to find another lodging i must be off  doubtless ill find some respectable house to take me in for the night  miles suppressed a yawn as he put on his cap  i dont believe you will returned molloy also rising and giving full vent to a sympathetic and vociferous yawn  howsever wen a young feller insists on havin his way its best to give him plenty of cable and let him swing  hes sure to find out his mistake by experience  but look ye here miles ive took a fancy to you an id be sorry to think you was in difficulties  if he continued thrusting a hand into his breechespocket and bringing up therefrom a mass of mixed gold silver and copperif you dont objec to accep of a loan of  thank youno my friend  it is very kind of you said miles quickly but i have quite enough for present necessities  so goodnight  all right returned the sailor thrusting the money back into his pocket  but if you should ever want a jaw with jack molloy while youre in this here port youve only got to hail him at the sailors welcome an if he should happen to be out they always can tell you where hes cruisin  goodnight an luck go wi ye  another tremendous yawn finished the speech and next moment miles found himself in the street oppressed with a strange and miserable sensation which he had never before experienced  indeed he had to lean against the house for a few minutes after coming out into the fresh air and felt as if the power of connected thought was leaving him  he was aroused from this condition by the flashing of a light in his eyes  opening them wide he beheld a policeman looking at him earnestly  now then young fellow said the guardian of the night dyou think you can take care of yourself  oh yes quite well  its only a giddy feeling that came over me  im all right said miles rousing himself and passing on  he staggered slightly however and a short humph from the policeman showed that he believed the youth to be something more than giddy  ashamed to be even unjustly supposed to be intoxicated miles hurried away wondering very much what could be the matter with him for he had not tasted a drop of strong drink except the halfglass of beer he had swallowed before molloy chanced to knock it out of his hand  suddenly he remembered that the sailor had said the beer was drugged  if he could have asked the barman who had served him that worthy could have told him that this was true that the whole glassful if swallowed would ere long have rendered him insensible and that what he had already taken was enough to do him considerable damage  as he walked onward he became rapidly worse the people and the streets seemed to swim before him an intense desire to sleep overpowered every other feeling and at last turning into a dark entry he lay down and pillowed his head on a doorstep  here he was found by a policeman a stretcher was fetched and he was conveyed to the station as drunk and incapable  when brought before the inspector the following morning shame and reckless despair were the tenants of his breast  those tenants were not expelled but rather confirmed in possession when the inspectorafter numerous questions to which miles returned vague unsatisfactory repliesadopted the role of the faithful friend and gave him a great deal of paternal advice especially with reference to the avoidance of strong drink and bad companions  miles had the wisdom however to conceal his feelings and to take the reproof and advice in good part  afterwards on being set free he met a recruiting sergeant who regarding him as a suitable subject for the service of her majesty immediately laid siege to him  in his then state of mind the siege was an easy one  in short he capitulated at once and entered the queens service under the name of john miles  we need scarcely say that his heart misgave him that his conscience condemned him and that do what he would he could not shut out the fact that his taking so hasty and irrevocable a step was a poor return for all the care and anxiety of his parents in years gone by  but as we have said or hinted miles was one of those youths who when they have once made up their minds to a certain course of action fancy that they are bound to pursue it to the end  hence it was that he gave his name as john miles instead of miles milton so that he might baffle any inquiries as to what had become of him  once enlisted he soon began to realise the fact that he was no longer a free agentat least not in the sense in which he had been so up to that period of his life  constant drill was the order of the day for some weeks for there was a demand for more troops for egypt at the time and regiments were being made up to their full strength as fast as possible  during this period miles saw little of his companions in arms personally save that group of recruits who were being licked into shape along with him  at first he was disappointed with these for most of them were shy unlettered men some raw lads from the country and others men who seemed to have been loafers before joining and were by no means attractive  the drillsergeant however was a good though stern man and soon recognised the differences in character aptitude and willingness among his raw recruits  this man whose name was hardy made a powerful impression on our hero from the first there was something so quiet and even gentle about him in spite of his firm and inflexible demands in regard to the matters of drill and duty  to please this man miles gave himself heart and soul to his work and was soon so efficient as to be allowed to join the regiment  and here he found to his surprise and satisfaction that the sergeant and young soldier with whom he had travelled to portsmouth were members of the company to which he was attached  as we have said miles had taken a great fancy at first sight to the young private whose name was william armstrong  our hero was of an affectionate disposition and would have allowed his warm feelings to expend themselves on a dog rather than have denied them free play  no wonder then that he was attracted by the handsome manly countenance and deferential manner of armstrong who although an uneducated youth and reared in the lower ranks of life was gifted with those qualities of the true gentleman which mere social position can neither bestow nor take away  his intellect also was of that active and vigorous fibre which cannot be entirely repressed by the want of scholastic training  the affection was mutual for the contrasts and similarities of the two men were alike calculated to draw them together  both were tall broad squareshouldered erect and soldierly yet withal modest as well in demeanour as in feeling and so exactly like to each other in size and figure and in the quiet gravity of their expressions that they might well have been taken for twin brothers  when in uniform the two strode along the streets of portsmouth people were apt to turn and look at them and think no doubt that with many such men in the british army it would go hard with the foes of old england  the bond of union was still further strengthened by the fact that while the comparatively learned miles was enthusiastic and communicative the unlettered armstrong was inquisitive and receptive fond of prying into the nature of things and always ready as well as competent to discuss not merely to argue  observe the distinction good reader discussion means the shaking of any subject into its component parts with a desire to understand it  argument has come very much to signify the enravelment of any subject with a view to the confusion and conquest of an opponent  both young men abhorred the latter and liked the former  hence much of their harmony and friendship  will you come with me up town said armstrong to miles one day as he was about to quit the barrackroom  im going to see if theres any news of my emmy  i did not know you expected her said miles  come along im ready  i dont expect her yet returned armstrong as they left the barracks i only look for a letter because it was on wednesday that i wrote telling her of my going to egypt and she can scarce have had time to get ready to come down poor girl  in fact i am going to engage a room for her  by the way i heard this morning that theres to be another draft for egypt so youll have a chance to go  im rejoiced to hear it returned miles for to say the truth i had been growing envious of your good fortune in being ordered on active service  hooroo armstrong where away now cried an unmistakably irish voice as a smart little soldier crossed the street to them and was introduced to miles as corporal flynn belonging to another company in his own regiment  my blissin on ye miles  john is it  yes john replied our hero much amused at the freeandeasy address of the little corporal  well john miles he said i dont know whether yell laugh or cry whin i tell ye that youll likely be warned this evenin for the draft thats goin to aigypt  i certainly wont cry returned miles with a laugh  yet the news brought a sudden feeling into his breast which was strongly allied to the opposite of laughter for the thought of parting from father and mother without bidding them farewell fell upon his spirit with crushing weight but like too many men who know they are about to do wrong miles hardened his heart with the delusive argument that having fairly taken the step it was impossible for him now to retrace it  he knew at least he thoughtthat there was still the possibility of being bought off and that his stern father would only be too glad to help him  he also knew that at least he had time to write and let them know his circumstances so that they might run down to portsmouth and bid him goodbye but he had taken the bit in his teeth and now he resolved to abide the consequences  turning from his companions while they conversed he looked into a shopwindow  your chums in the blues said the lively corporal in a lower voice  young fellows are often in that state after joining aint they returned armstrong  true for yean more shame to them whin they ought to be as proud as paycocks at wearin her gracious majestys uniform  but good luck to ee  i must be off for im bound for aigypt mesilf  i am glad that i shall have the chance of seeing your wife for ive been much interested in her since your friend sergeant gilroy told me about her said miles as they resumed their walk  surely it is hard of them to refuse to let her go with the regiment  well it is hard returned the young soldier but after all i cannot find fault with the powers that be for i married with my eyes open  i knew the rule that those who marry without leave must leave their wives at home for only a certain number of families can go abroad with a regimentand that only in peacetime  it might have been well continued armstrong slowly while a sad expression clouded his face for a few moments if i had waited and many a time has my conscience smitten me for my haste  but what could i do  emmy most unaccountably fell in love wi methank god for i do think that the greatest earthly blessing that can be given to mortal man is the love of a gentle truehearted girl  the wealth of the indies cannot purchase that and nothing else in life can supply the want of it  can you wonder that i grasped the treasure when within my reach  i certainly cannot and as certainly i do not blame you returned the sympathetic miles  of course i fell in love with emmy continued the soldier with a slightly confused look  i could no more help that than i could help growing up  could i  certainly not said miles  well you see continued his friend as the affair was arranged in heaven according to general belief what was i that i should resist you see emmys father whos a welltodo farmer was willing and we never gave a thought to egypt or the war at the time  she will be well looked after while im away and ill send her every penny of my pay that i can spare but  he stopped abruptly and miles respecting his feelings remarked by way of changing the subject that the pay of a private soldier being so small very little could be saved out of that  not much assented his comrade but little as it is we can increase it in various ways  for one thing i have given up smoking  that will save a little though to say truth i have never expended much on baccy  then i have joined miss robinsons temperance band  strange how often that ladys name has been in my ears since i came to portsmouth said miles  not so strange after all returned armstrong when one reflects that she has been the means of almost changing the character of the town within the last few yearsas far at least as concerns the condition of soldiers as well as many of the poorer classes among its inhabitants so sergeant gilroy tells me  as some of the information given by sergeant gilroy to the young soldier may be interesting to many readers we quote a few of his own words  why some years ago he said the soldiers wives mothers and sisters who came down here to see the poor fellows set sail for foreign parts found it almost impossible to obtain lodgings except in drinkinghouses which no respectable woman could enter  some poor women even preferred to spend a winter night under railway arches or some such shelter rather than enter these places  and soldiers out of barracks had nowhere else to go to for amusement while sailors on leave had to spend their nights in them or walk the streets  now all that is changed  the soldiers institute supplies 140 beds and furnishes board and lodging to our sisters and wives at the lowest possible rates besides receptionrooms where we can meet our friends a splendid readingroom where we find newspapers and magazines and can write our letters if we like in peace and quiet a bar where tea and coffee bread and butter buns etcetera can be had at all reasonable hours for a mere trifle a coffee and smoking room opening out of which are two billiardrooms and beyond these a garden where we can get on the flat roof of a house and watch the arrival and departure of shipping  there is a small charge to billiardplayers which pays all expenses of the tables so that not a penny of the institute funds is spent on the games  of course no gambling is allowed in any of miss robinsons institutes  then there are bibleclass rooms and womens workrooms and a lending library and bathrooms and a great hall big enough to hold a thousand people where there are held temperance meetings lectures with dissolving views entertainments and teafights and sunday services  no wonder that with such an agency at work for the glory of god and the good of men portsmouth is almost a new place indeed although miss robinson met with powerful opposition at first from the powers that be her institute is now heartily recognised and encouraged in every way at the horse guards  indeed it has recently been visited by the prince of wales and the duke of cambridge and highly approved of by these and other grandees  while the two soldiers were chatting about the past and present of the institute they arrived at its door  here we are  come into the receptionroom miles while i make inquiry about my letters  they entered the house as he spoke  the receptionroom is on the right of the passage  armstrong opened the door and looked in but instead of advancing he stood transfixed gazing before him openmouthed as though he had seen a spectre for there in front of the fire sat a beautiful refinedlooking girl with golden hair and blue eyes gazing pensively at the flickering flames  miles was not kept long in suspense as to who she was  emmy  oh willie  these were exclamations which would have revealed all in a moment even though emmy had not sprung up and rushed into willies open arms  how she ever emerged from the embrace of those arms with unbroken bones is a mystery which cannot be solved but she did emerge in safety and with some confusion on observing that miles had witnessed the incident with admiring gaze  never mind him emmy said the young soldier laughing hes a good friend a comrade  shake hands with him  the action and the ease of manner with which emmy obeyed proved that grace and small hands are not altogether dependent on rank or station  excuse me said miles after a few words of salutation ill go and have a look at the library  so saying he quitted the room leaving the young couple alone for there chanced to be no other visitors to the receptionroom at the time  in the lobby he found several soldiers and a couple of sailors enjoying coffee at the bar and was about to join them when a man came forward whose dress was that of a civilian though his bearing proclaimed him a soldier  hallo brown exclaimed one of the soldiers dye know that a troopship has just come in  know it of course i do you may trust the people of this house to be first in hearing such news  mr tufnell told me of it  im just going down to the jetty to boil the kettle for them  as he spoke two ladies of the institute descended the broad staircase each with a basket on her arm  they entered into conversation for a few minutes with the soldiers at the bar and it was abundantly evident to miles from the kindly tone of the former and the respectful air of the latter that they were familiar acquaintances and on the best of terms  are you all ready brown asked one of the ladies of the soldierlike civilian whom we have already mentioned  all ready miss a man has already gone to order the bread and butter and light the fire  i hear the vessel is crowded so we may expect a full house tonight  miles pricked up his ears on hearing this and when brown went out leaving the two ladies to finish their conversation with the soldiers he followed him  pardon me he said on overtaking the man  did i understand correctly that a troopship has just arrived  right said brown  i am just going down to the embarkation jetty to get coffee ready for the men  you seem to have joined but a short time apparently for though i am familiar with your uniform i have not seen yourself before  true it is not long since i joined and this is my first visit to the institute  i hope it wont be the last friend returned brown heartily  every soldier is welcome there and for the matter of that so is every sailor and marine  i have heard as much  may i accompany you to this jetty to see the troops arrive and this coffee business that you speak of  you may and welcome said brown leading his companion through the town in the direction of the docks and chatting as they walked along about the army and navy about his own experiences in the former and about the condition of soldiers at the present time as contrasted with that of the days gone by    chapter four  the embarkation jettyand nipped in the bud  bronzed faces under white helmets crowded the ports and bulwarks of the great white leviathan of the deepthe troopship orontesas she steamed slowly and cautiously up to the embarkation jetty in portsmouth harbour  on the jetty itself a few anxious wives mothers and sisters stood eagerly scanning the sea of faces in the almost hopeless endeavour to distinguish those for which they sought  yet ever and anon an exclamation on the jetty and an answering wave of an arm on the troopship told that some at least of the anxious ones had been successful in the search  dont they look weatherbeaten remarked miles to his companion  sure its more like sundried they are answered a voice at his side brown had gone to the shed to prepare his coffee and bread against the landing of the troops and a stout irishwoman had taken his place close to her stood the two ladies from the institute with baskets on their arms  you are right returned miles with a smile they look like men who have seen service  is your husband among them  faix id be sorprised if he was returned the woman for i left him in owld ireland in the only landed property he iver held in this worldsix futt by two an five deep  hes been in possession six years now an it wouldnt be aisy to drive him out o that anyhow no its my son terence ive come to look afther  och there he is look look thats him close by the funnel  dont ye see im  blissins on his goodlookin face  hooroo  terenceterence flynn dont ye recognise yer owld mother  sure an he does though we havent met for tin year  my hasnt he got the hair on his lips tooan his cheeks are like shoeleathermy darlint  as the enthusiastic mother spoke in the tones of a public orator there was a general laugh among those who were nearest to her but she was forgotten immediately for all were too deeply intent on their own interests to pay much regard to each other just then  the great vessel was slow in getting alongside and making fast to the jettyslow at least in the estimation of the impatientfor although she might leap and career grandly in wanton playfulness while on her native billows in port a careless touch from her ponderous sides would have crushed part of the jetty into fragments  miles therefore had ample time to look about him at the various groups around  one young woman specially attracted his attention for she stood apart from every one and seemed scarcely able to stand because of weakness she was young and goodlooking  her face which was deadly pale contrasted strongly with her glossy ravenblack hair and the character of her dress denoted extreme poverty  the ladies from the institute had also observed this poor girl and one of them going to her side quietly addressed her  miles from the position in which he stood could not avoid overhearing what was said  yes miss i expect my husband said the woman in answer to a question  hes coming home on sickleave  i had a letter from him a good while ago saying he was coming home in the orontes  i hope you will find that the sea air has done him good said the lady in that tone of unobtrusive sympathy which is so powerfully attractiveespecially to those who are in trouble  a sea voyage frequently has a wonderful effect in restoring invalids  what is his name  martinfred martin  hes a corporal now  you have not recognised him yet i suppose  not yet miss answered mrs martin with an anxious look and shivering slightly as she drew a thin worn shawl of many patches closer round her shoulders  but he wouldnt expect me to meet him you see knowing that im so poor and live far from portsmouth  but i was so anxious you see miss that our kind vicar gave me enough money to come down  where did you spend the night asked the lady quickly  the poor woman hesitated and at last said she had spent the night walking about the streets  you see miss she explained apologetically i didnt know a soul in the town and i couldnt abear to go into any o the publichouses besides i had no money for the journey down took nearly all of it  oh i am so sorry that you didnt know of our institute said the lady with much sympathy in voice and look for we provide accommodation for soldiers wives who come like you to meet their husbands returning from abroad and we charge little or even nothing if they are too poor to pay  indeed miss  i wish i had known of it  but in the morning i had the luck to meet a policeman who directed me to a coffeetavern in a place called nobbs laneyoull not know it miss for its in a very poor part o the townwhere i got a breakfast of as much hot peasoup and bread as i could eat for threehapence an had a good rest beside the fire too  they told me it was kept by a miss robinson  god bless her whoever she is for i do believe i should have been dead by now if i hadnt got the rest and the breakfast  the woman shivered again as she spoke and drew the thin shawl still closer for a sharp east wind was blowing over the jetty at the time  come with me you are cold  i know nobbs lane well  we have a shed and fire here on the jetty to shelter people while waiting  there you need not fear to miss your husband for the men wont land for a long time yet  may i follow you madam said miles stepping forward and touching his cap in what he supposed to be the deferential manner of a private soldier  i am interested in your work and would like to see the shed you speak of  the lady looked up quickly at the tall young soldier who thus addressed her  i saw you in the lobby of the institute this morning did i not  you did madam  i was waiting for a friend who is a frequenter of the institute  one of your own people brought me down here to see the arrival of the orontes and the coffeeshed but i have lost him in the crowd and know not where the shed is  here it is returned the lady pointing to an iron structure just behind them  you will find mr brown there busy with the coffee and that small shed beside it is the shelterroom  you are welcome to inspect all our buildings at any time  so saying the lady led mrs martin into the shed last referred to and miles followed her  there was a small stove in the solitary iron room of which the shed consisted which diffused a genial warmth around  several soldiers wives and female relatives were seated beside it engaged in quieting refractory infants or fitting a few woollen garments on children of various ages  these garments had been brought from the institute chiefly for the purpose of supplying the wives and children returning from warmer climes to england and one of them a thick knitted shawl was immediately presented to mrs martin as a gift and placed round her shoulders by the ladys own hands  you are very kind miss she said an unbidden tear rolling down her cheek as she surveyed the garment and folded it over her breast  have you any children asked the lady  none  we had onea dear baby boy answered the young wife sadly born after his father left england  god took him home when he was two years old  his father never saw him but we shall all meet again she added brightly in the better land  ah it makes me glad to hear you say that god took him home  only the spirit of jesus could make you regard heaven as the home where you are all to meet again  now i would advise you to sit here and keep warm till i go and make inquiry about your husband  it is quite possible you know that he may be in the sick bay and they wont let any one on board till the vessel is made fast  you are quite sure i suppose that it was the orontes in which your husband said he was coming  yes quite sure  the lady had asked the question because a vague fear possessed her regarding the cause of the soldiers not having been seen looking eagerly over the side like the other men  hurrying from the shed with her basket on her arm she made for the gangway which had just been placed in position  she was accompanied by her companion also carrying her basket  miles took the liberty of following them closely but not obviously for he formed only one of a stream of men and women who pushed on board the instant that permission was given  while one of the ladies went in search of one of the chief officers the other quietly and unobtrusively advanced among the returning warriors and opening her basket drew therefrom and offered to each soldier an envelope containing one or two booklets and texts and a hearty invitation to make free use of the soldiers institute during their stay in portsmouth  a most bewildering scene was presented on the deck of that great white vessel  there were hundreds of soldiers in her returning home after longer or shorter absences in china india the cape and other faraway parts of the earth  some were stalwart and bronzed by the southern sun others were gaunt weak and cadaverous from the effect of sickness exposure or wounds but all were more or less excited at having once again set eyes on old england and at the near prospect of once more embracing wives mothers and sweethearts and meeting with old friends the continual noise of manly voices hailing exclaiming chaffing or conversing and the general babel of sounds is indescribable  to miles milton who had never before even imagined anything of the sort it seemed more like a vivid dream than a reality  he became so bewildered with trying to attend to everything at once that he lost sight of the shorter of the ladies whom he was following but pushing ahead soon found her again in the midst of a group of old friendsthough still young soldierswho had known the institute before leaving for foreign service and were eagerly inquiring after the health of miss robinson and tufnell the manager and others  during his progress through this bustling scene miles observed that the soldiers invariably received the gifts from the lady with respect and many of them with hearty expressions of thanks while a few stopped her to speak about the contents of the envelopes  so numerous were the men that the work had to be done with businesslike celerity but the visitor was experienced  while wasting no time in useless delay she never hurried her movements or refused to stop and speak or forced her way through the moving throng  almost unobserved save by the men who chanced to be next to her she glided in and out amongst them like a spirit of lightwhich in the highest sense she wasintent on her beneficent mission  her sole aim was to save the men from the tremendous dangers that awaited them on landing in portsmouth and bring them under christian influence  those dangers may be imagined when it is told that soldiers returning from abroad are often in possession of large sums of money and that harpies of all kinds are eagerly waiting to plunder them on their arrival  on one occasion a regiment came home and in a few days squandered three thousand pounds in portsmouth  much more might be said on this point but enough has been indicated to move thoughtful minds and our story waits  suddenly the attention of miles and every one near him was attracted by the loud hibernian yell of a female voice exclaiming  oh terence me darlin son here ye are an is it yersilf lookin purtier a long way than the day ye left me an niver so much as a scratch on yer face for all the wars yeve bin inbad luck to thim  need we say that this was mrs flynn  in her anxiety to meet her son she had run against innumerable men and women who remonstrated with her variously according to temperament without however the slightest effect  her wild career was not checked until she had flung herself into the arms of a tall stalwart trooper with drooping moustache who would have done credit to any nationality under the sun and whose enthusiasm at the happy meeting with his mother was almost as demonstrative as her own but more dignified  others there were however whose case was very different  one who came there to meet the strong healthy man to whom she had said goodbye at the same spot several years before received him back a worn and wasted invalid upright still with the martial air of discipline but feeble and with something like the stamp of death upon his brow  another woman found her son strong indeed and healthy as of yore but with an empty sleeve where his right arm should have beenhis days of warfare over before his earthly sun had reached the zenith  whilst miles was taking note of these things and moralising in spite of his distaste just then to that phase of mental occupation the other lady of the institute appeared and spoke hurriedly to her companion  go she said tell mrs martin that her husband is not on board the orontes  let tufnell if he is at the shed or our missionary take her up to the institute without delay  let them take this note to miss robinson at the same time  the younger lady looked inquiringly at her companion but the latter pushed on hurriedly and was soon lost in the crowd so she went at once on shore to obey her instructions  being thus left to look after himself miles went about gazing at the varied interesting and curious scenes that the vessel presented  no one took any notice of him for he was only one soldier among hundreds and so many people from the shore had been admitted by that time that strange faces attracted no attention  we have referred chiefly to soldiers friends but these after all formed a small minority of the visitors many of whom were tradesmen of the towntailors shoemakers and vendors of fancy articleswho had come down with their wares to tempt the returning voyagers to part with their superfluous cash  even in the midst of all the pushing and confusion one man was seen trying on a pair of boots near to him was a sailor carefully inspecting a tailors book of patterns with a view to shoregoing clothes while another more prompt in action was already being measured for a suit of the same  descending to the tweendecks our hero found that the confusion and noise there were naturally greater the space being more limited and the noise confined  there was the addition of bad air and disagreeable smells here and miles could not help reflecting on the prospect before him of long voyages under cramped circumstances in the midst of similar surroundings  but being young and enthusiastic he whispered to himself that he was not particular and was ready to rough it in his countrys cause  in a remarkably dark region to which he penetrated he found himself in the womens quarters the disagreeables of which were increased by the cries of discontented children and the yells of inconsolable infants some of whom had first seen the light of this world in the sad twilight of tweendecks  shrinking from that locality miles pursued his investigations and gradually became aware that sundry parrots and other pets which the soldiers and sailors had brought home were adding their notes of discord to the chorus of sounds  while he was looking at and attempting to pat a small monkey which received his advances with looks of astonished indignation he became conscious of the fact that a number of eyes were looking down on him through a crevice at the top of a partition close to his side  who are these he asked of a sailor who stood near him  why them are the longterm men  i suppose you mean prisoners  yes thats about it replied the tar  soldiers as has committed murderor suthin o that sortan got twenty year or more for all i knows  the other fellers further on there in chains is shortterm men  bin an done suthin or other not quite so bad i suppose  miles advanced further on and found eight men seated on the deck and leaning against the bulkhead  if his attention had not been drawn to them he might have supposed they were merely resting but a closer glance showed that they were all chained to an iron bar  they did not seem very different from the other men around them save that they were most of them stern and silent  a powerful feeling of compassion rose in our heros breast as he looked at these moral wrecks of humanity for their characters and prospects were ruined though their physique was not much impaired  it seemed to him such an awful homecoming after perhaps long years of absence thus in the midst of all the bustle and joy of meetings and of pleasant anticipations to be waiting there for the arrival of the prisonvan and looking forward to years of imprisonment instead of reunion with friends and kindred  at sight of them a thought sprang irresistibly into our heros mind this is the result of wrongdoing  his conscience was uncomfortably active and faithful that morning somehow it pointed out to him that wrongdoing was a long ladder that the chained criminals before him had reached the foot and that he stood on the topmost rung  that was all the difference between them and himselfa difference of degree not of principle  pushing his way a little closer to these men he found that his was not the only heart that pitied them  his friend the younger lady was there speaking to them  he could not hear what she said for the noise drowned her voice but her earnest eager look and her gesticulations told well enough that she was pointing them to the saviour of sinners with what effect of course he could not tell but it was evident that the prisoners at least gave her their attention  leaving her thus engaged miles continued for a considerable time his progress through the ship  afterwards he observed by a movement among the men that a detachment was about to land  indeed he found that some of the soldiers had already landed and were making their way to the coffeeshed  following these quickly to the same place he found that innumerable cups of hot coffee and solid slices of bread and butter were being served out as fast as they could be filled and cut  a large hole or window opened in the side of the shed the shutter of which was hinged at the bottom and when let down formed a convenient counter  behind this counter stood the two ubiquitous ladies of the institute acting the part of barmaids as if to the manner born and with the same businesslike active yet modest readyforanything air which marked all their proceedings  and truly their post was no sinecure  to supply the demands of hundreds of hungry and thirsty warriors was not childsplay  inside the shed miles found his friend brown busy with a mighty caldron of hot water numerous packets of coffee and immense quantities of sugar and preserved milk  brown was the fountainhead  the ladies were the distributing pipesif we may say so and although the fountain produced can after can of the coveted liquid with amazing rapidity and with a prodigality of material that would have made the hair of a private housewife stand on end it was barely possible to keep pace with the demand  at a large table one of the missionaries of the institute cut up and buttered loaves at a rate which gave the impression that he was a conjurer engaged in a species of sleightofhand  the butter however troubled him for the weather being cold it was hard and would not spread easily  to overcome this he put a pound or so of it on a plate beside the boilerfire to soften  unfortunately he temporarily forgot it and on afterwards going for it found that it had been reduced to a yellow liquid  however hungry soldiers rejoicing in the fact of having at last reached home are not particular  some of them unaccustomed no doubt to be served by ladies asked for their supply deferentially accepted it politely and drank it with additional appreciation  we want more brown said one of the ladies glancing back over her shoulder as she poured out the last drop from her large jug and more buns and bread please  here you are miss cried brown who was warm by that time in spite of the weather as he bore his brimming and steaming pitcher to the windowor hole in the walland replenished the jugs  the buns are all done an the bread wont hold out long but ive sent for more it wont be long  i see we shall need several more brews he added as he turned again towards the inexhaustible boiler  shall i assist you said miles stepping into the shed and seizing a loaf and a knife  thank you  go ahead said brown  put another lump of butter near the fire said the missionary to our hero not too close  i melted the last lump altogether  a cup o coffee for my terence an wan for mesilf my dear exclaimed a loud voice outside  there was no mistaking the speaker  some of the men who crowded round the counter laughed others partially choked when the strapping terence said in a hoarse whisper whist mother be civil dont ye see that its ladies no less is sarvin of us  please maam can i ave some coffee asked a modest soldiers wife who looked pale and weary after the long voyage with three children to look after  a cup was promptly supplied and three of the newlyarrived buns stopped the mouths of her clamorous offspring  can ye give me a cup o tea demanded another soldiers wife who was neither so polite nor so young as the previous applicant  it is probable that the ladies did not observe the nature of her demand else they would doubtless have explained that they had no tea but a cup of coffee was silently handed to her  ah this is real hometea this is she said smacking her lips after the first sip  a mighty difference tween this an what weve bin used to in the ship  yes indeed assented her companion  whether it was tea she had been accustomed to drink on board the troopship we cannot tell but probably she was correct as to the mighty difference  it may be that the beverages supplied in foreign lands had somewhat damaged the power of discrimination as to matters of taste in these soldiers wives  at all events an incident which occurred about the same time justifies this belief  mr miles said the missionary pausing a moment to wipe his brow in the midst of his labours will you fetch the butter now  miles turned to obey with alacritywith too much alacrity indeed for in his haste he knocked the plate over and sent the lump of butter into the last prepared brew of coffee  hallo  i say exclaimed brown in consternation  more coffee brown demanded the ladies simultaneously at that inauspicious moment  yes miss iim comingdirectly cried brown  do be quick please  whats to be done said brown making futile endeavours to fish out the slippery mass with the stirringstick  shove it down and stir it well about suggested miles  whether conscience was inoperative at that moment we know not but brown acted on the suggestion and briskly amalgamated the butter with the coffee while the crowd at the porthole politely but continuously demanded more  dont be in a urry tom cried a corporal removing his pith helmet in order to run his fingers through his hair its a eavenly state o things now to what it was a few years ago wen we an our poor wives ad to sit ere for hours in the heat or cold wet or dry without shelter or a morsel to eat or a drop to drink till we got away up town to the grogshops  well this is civilisation at last remarked a handsome and hearty young fellow who had apparently been ignorant of the treat in store for him and who sauntered up to the shed just as the butterbrew was beginning to be served out  why i declare its chocolate exclaimed one of the women who had been already served with a cup and had resolved to go in as she said for another pennyworth  so it is  my aint it nice said her companion smacking her lips  whether the soldiers fell into the same mistake or were too polite to take notice of it we cannot tell for they drank it without comment and with evident satisfaction like men of simple tastes and uncritical minds  we turn now to a very different scene  in one of the private sittingrooms of the institute sat poor young mrs martin the very embodiment of blank despair  the terrible truth that her husband had died and been buried at sea had been gently and tenderly broken to her by miss robinson  at first the poor girl could notwould notbelieve it  then as the truth gradually forced itself into her brain she subsided into a tearless expressionless state of quiescence that seemed to indicate a mind unhinged  in this state she remained for some time apparently unconscious of the kind words of christian love that were addressed to her  at last she seemed to rouse herself and gazed wildly round the room  let me go she said  i will find him somewhere  dont hinder me please  but you cannot go anywhere till you have had food and rest dear child said her sympathetic comforter laying her hand gently on the girls arm  come with me  she sought to lead her away but the girl shook her off  no she exclaimed starting up hastily so that the mass of her dark hair fell loose upon her shoulders contrasting forcibly with the dead whiteness of her face and lips  no  i cannot go with you  fred will be getting impatient  dyou think ill ever believe it  dead and buried in the sea  never  even while she spoke the gasp in her voice and the pressure of both hands on her poor heart told very plainly that the young widow did indeed believe it  oh may god himself comfort you dear child said the lady taking her softly by the hand  comecome with me  mrs martin no longer refused  her spirit which had flashed up for a moment seemed to collapse and without another word of remonstrance she meekly suffered herself to be guided to a private room where she was put to bed  she never rose from that bed  friendless and without means she would probably have perished in the streets or in one of the dens of portsmouth had she not been led to this refuge  as it was they nursed her there and did all that human skill and christian love could devise but her heart was broken  towards the end she told them in a faint voice that her fred had been stationed at alexandria and that while there he had been led to put his trust in the saviour  she knew nothing of the details  all these and much more she had expected to hear from his own lips  but he will tell me all about it soon thank god were the last words she uttered as she turned her eyes gratefully on the loving strangers who had found and cared for her in the dark day of her calamity    chapter five  difficulties met and overcome  miles and his friend brown after their work at the jetty had chanced to return to the institute at the moment referred to in the last chapter when the poor young widow having become resigned had been led through the passage to her bedroom  our hero happened to catch sight of her face and it made a very powerful impression on himan impression which was greatly deepened afterwards on hearing of her death  in the receptionroom he found armstrong still in earnest conversation with his wife  hallo armstrong still here  have you been sitting there since i left you he asked with a smile and look of surprise  oh no answered his friend not all the time  we have been out walking about town and we have had dinner herean excellent feed let me tell you and cheap too  but where did you run off to  sit down and ill tell you said miles  thereupon he related all about his days experiences  when he had finished armstrong told him that his own prospect of testing the merits of a troopship were pretty fair as he was ordered for inspection on the following day  so you see continued the young soldier if you are acceptedas you are sure to beyou and i will go out together in the same vessel  im glad to hear that anyhow returned miles  and i am very glad too said little emily with a beaming smile for willie has told me about you mr miles and how you first met and took a fancy to each other and it will be so nice to think that theres somebody to care about my willie when he is far away from me  the little woman blushed and halflaughed and nearly cried as she said this for she felt that it was rather a bold thing to say to a stranger and yet she had such a strong desire to mitigate her husbands desolation when absent from her that she forcibly overcame her modesty and i want you to do me a favour mr miles she added  ill do it with pleasure returned our gallant hero  i want you to call him willie said the little woman blushing and looking down  certainly i willif your husband permits me  you see she continued i want him to keep familiar with the name ive been used to call himfor comrades will call him armstrong i suppose and  oh  emmy interrupted the soldier reproachfully do you think i require to be kept in remembrance of that name  wont your voice repeating it haunt me day and night till the happy day when i meet you again on the portsmouth jetty or mayhap in this very room  miles thought when he heard this speech of the hopedfor meeting between poor mrs martin and her fred and a feeling of profound sadness crept over him as he reflected how many chances there were against their ever again meeting in this world  naturally these thoughts turned his mind to his own case  his sinful haste in quitting home and the agony of his mother on finding that he was really gone were more than ever impressed on him but again the fatal idea that what was done could not be undone coupled with pride and false shame kept him firm to his purpose  that evening in barracks miles was told by his company sergeant to hold himself in readiness to appear before the doctor next morning for inspection as to his physical fitness for active service in egypt  our hero was by this time beginning to find out that the life of a private soldier into which he had rushed was a very different thing indeed from that of an officerto which he had aspired  here again pride came to his aidin a certain sensefor if it could not reconcile him to his position it at all events closed his mouth and made him resolve to bear the consequences of his act like a man  in the morning he had to turn out before daylight and with a small band of men similarly situated to muster in the drillshed a little after eight  thence they marched to the doctors quarters  it was an anxious ordeal for all of them for like most young soldiers they were enthusiastically anxious to go on active service and there was of course some uncertainty as to their passing the examination  the first man called came out of the inspection room with a beaming countenance saying that he was all right which raised the hopes and spirits of the rest but the second appeared after inspection with a woebegone countenance which required no interpretation  no reason was given for his rejection he was simply told that it would be better for him not to go  miles was the third called  as he presented himself the doctor yawned vociferously as if he felt that the hour for such work was unreasonably early  then he looked at his subject with the critical air of a farmer inspecting a prize ox  how old are you he asked  nineteen sir  are you married  miles smiled  did you hear me asked the doctor sharply  you dont need to smile many a boy as longlegged and as young as you is fool enough to marry are you married  miles flushed looked suddenly stern squared his shoulders drew himself up with an air that implied you wont catch me tripping again and said firmly yet quite respectfully  no sir  the doctor here took another good look at his subject with a meaning twinkle in his eye as if he felt that he had touched a tender point then he felt his victims pulse sounded his chest and ordered him to strip  being apparently satisfied with the result of his examination he asked him if he felt all right  reflecting that his mother had often told him he was made up of body soul and spirit and that in regard to the latter two he was rather hazy miles felt strongly inclined for a moment to say certainly not but thinking better of it he answered yes sir with decision  have you anything to complain of asked the doctor  the mind of our hero was what we may style rapidly reflective  in regard to the decrees of fate things in general and his fathers conduct in particular he had a decided wish to complain but again he laid restraint on himself and said no sir  and do you wish to go to egypt  yes sir was answered with prompt decision  then you may go said the doctor turning away with an air of a man who dismisses a subject from his mind  when all the men had thus passed the medical examination those of them who were accepted mustered their bags and kits before captain lacey commander of the company to which they were attached and those who wanted anything were allowed to draw it from the stores  captain lacey was a fine specimen of a british soldiergrave but kind in expression and in heart tall handsome powerful about thirty years of age with that urbanity of manner which wins affection at first sight and that cool quiet decision of character which inspires unlimited confidence  as the troopship which was to convey them to egypt was to start sooner than had been intended there was little time for thought during the few hours in england that remained to the regiment  the men had to draw their pith helmets and fit the ornaments thereon then go the quartermasters stores to be fitted with white clothing after which they had to parade before the colonel fully arrayed in the martial habiliments which were needful in tropical climes  besides these matters there were friends to be seen in some cases relatives to be parted from and letters innumerable to be written  miles milton was among those who on the last day in portsmouth attempted to write home he had been taken by sergeant gilroy the previous night to one of the institute entertainments in the great hall  the sergeant had tried to induce him to go to the bibleclass with him but miles was in no mood for that at the time and he was greatly relieved to find that neither the sergeant nor any of the people of the institute annoyed him by thrusting religious matters on his attention  food lodging games library baths bibleclasses prayermeetings entertainments were all there to be used or let alone as he chose perfect freedom of action being one of the methods by which it was sought to render the place attractive to the soldiers  but although miles at once refused to go to the class he had no objection to go to the entertainment  it was a curious mixture of song recitation addresses and readings in which many noble sentiments were uttered and not a few humorous anecdotes and incidents related  it was presided over by tufnell the manager a soldierlylooking man who had himself originally been in the army and who had for many years been miss robinsons righthand man there could not have been fewer than a thousand people in the hall a large proportion of whom were redcoats and bluejackets the rest being civilians and the way in which these applauded the sentiments laughed at the humour and rejoiced in the music showed that the provision for their amusement was thoroughly appreciated  whether it was the feeling of goodfellowship and sympathy that pervaded the meeting or some word that was dropped at a venture and found root in his heart miles could not tell but certain it is that at that entertainment he formed the resolution to write home before leaving not that he had yet repented of the step he had taken but he was sorry for the manner in which he had done so and for allowing so much time to elapse that now the opportunity of seeing his parents before starting was lost  as it was impossible for him to write his letter in the noise of the barrackroom he went off next day to the readingroom of the institute and there with no other sounds to disturb him than the deep breathing of some studious redcoats and the chirping pen of a comrade engaged like himself he began to write  but his thoughts somehow would not work  his pen would not write  he even fancied that it had a sort of objection to spell  so it had when not properly guided by his hesitating hand  the first part went swimmingly enough    dearest mother   im so sorry  but here he stopped for the memory of his fathers severity rearoused his indignation and he felt some doubt as to whether he really was sorry  then under the impulse of this doubt he wrote a long letter in imagination in which he defended his conduct pretty warmly on the ground that he had been driven to it  driven to what asked something within him  to the course which i have taken and am now defending replied somethingelse within him hotly  then the course was a wrong one else you wouldnt have to defend it rejoined the first something  wellyesnno it wasnt returned the second something doggedly  before this internal dispute could be carried further miles was aroused by a sudden burst of noisy voices as if a lunatic asylum had been let loose into the hall below  rising quickly he hurried down with his studious comrades to see what it could be all about  its only another troopship come in and theyve all come up here without giving us warning to get ready said tufnell as he bustled about endeavouring to introduce order into what appeared to miles to be the reproduction of babel minus the bricks  the fact was that a troopship having arrived rather suddenly a sergeant had driven up in hot haste from the docks to make arrangements for the reception of the soldiers wives and children  look sharp he cried on entering the hall abruptly sixteen families are on their way to you  all right we can take em in was the prompt reply and orders were given to set the foodproducing machinery of the establishment instantly in motion  but almost before the preparation had fairly begun the advanceguard of the army largely composed of infantry burst upon them like a thunderclap and continued to pour in like a torrent  there were men shouting women chattering tired children whining and excited children laughing babies yelling or crowing miscellaneously parrots screaming people running up and down stairs in search of dormitories plates and cups clattering at the bar as the overwhelmed barmaids did their best to appease the impatient and supply the hungry while the rumbling of controlwagons bringing up the baggage formed a sort of bass accompaniment to the concert  you see it varies with us a good deal remarked brown to miles during a lucid interval sometimes we are almost empty a few hours later we are overflowing  it comes hard on the housekeeper of course but we lay our account wi that and do you know it is wonderful what can be done in trying circumstances when we lay our account wi them yes miss its all ready shouted the speaker in reply to a soft female voice that came down the wide staircase as it were over the heads of the turbulent crowd  in a moment he disappeared and tufnell stood as if by magic in his place  yes said the manager taking up his discourse where the other had left off and in a few minutes youll see that most of these wives and children of the soldiers will be distributed through the house in their bedrooms when our ladies will set to work to make acquaintance with them and then well open our stores of warm clothing of which the poor things coming as they do from warm climates are often nearly or quite destitute  but where do you get these supplies from asked miles  from kindhearted christians throughout the country who send us gifts of old and new garments boots and shoes shawls and socks etcetera which we have always in readiness to meet sudden demands and i may add that the demands are pretty constant  brown told you just now that we have varied experience  i remember once we got a message from the assistant quartermastergenerals office to ask how many women and children we could accommodate as a shipful was expected  we replied that we could take 140 and set to work with preparations  after all only one woman came  today we expected nobody andyou see what we have got  the genial countenance of the manager beamed with satisfaction  it was evident that what he had got did not at all discompose him as he hurried away to look after his flock while the originatorthe heart and soul of all thisalthough confined to her room at that time with spine complaint and unable to take part in the active work as she had been wont to do in years gone by heard in her chamber the softened sound of the human storm and was able to thank god that her soldiers institute was fulfilling its destiny  hallo  miles exclaimed armstrong over the heads of the crowd ive been looking for you everywhere  dyou know we run a chance of being late  come along quick  our hero who in his interest in the scene had forgotten the flight of time hurried out after his comrade as the band struck up home sweet home and returned to barracks utterly oblivious of the fact that he had left the unfinished letter to his mother on the table in the readingroom    chapter six  the unfinished lettertoo late  next morning young miltonor as he was called by his comrades john milesrose with the depressing thought that it was to be his last day in england  as he was dressing it flashed across him that he had left his unfinished letter on the readingroom table and concluding that it would be swept away in the rush of people thereat all events that not having been folded or addressed it could not be postedhis depression was deepened  the first thing that roused him to a better frame of mind was the smell of tea  most people are more or less familiar with teapots with the few teaspoonfuls of the precious leaf which thrifty housekeepers put into these pots and the fragrant liquid that results  but who among civilians save the informed can imagine a barrackroom teapot  open your ears o ye thrifty ones while we state a few facts and there will be no need to tell you to open your eyes  into the teapot which supplied miles with his morning cup there was put for one making eight pounds of teanot ounces observe but poundstwentynine pounds of sugar and six gallonsan absolute cowfulof milk  the pot itself consisted of eight enormous coppers which were filled with boiling water to the brim  yes sir remarked the military cook who concocted the beverage to a speechless visitor one day it is a pretty extensive brew but then you see we have a large family  a considerable portion of this large family was soon actively engaged in preparation for immediate embarkation for egypt  then the general made the men a farewell speech  it was a peculiar speechnot altogether suited to cheer timid hearts had any such been there but admirably adapted to british soldiers  men said he i am very glad to see you parade looking so well and clean and comfortable and ready for active service  you will be dirty enough sometimes where you are going for the country is hot and unhealthy and not over clean  you will have hardships hard times and plenty of hard work as well as hard beds now and then and very likely the most of you will never come back again but you would be unworthy of the name of british soldiers if you allowed such thoughts to trouble your minds  i sincerely express the hope however that you will all come home again safe and sound  i have not the slightest doubt that every man of you will do his duty in the field faithfully and well but im not so sure of your wisdom in camp and barracks so i will give you a word of advice  there is far more danger in getting drunk in hot countries than in england  let me advise you then not to get drunk and i would warn you particularly against the vile stuff they will offer for sale in egypt  it is rank poison  if you had stomachs lined with brass you might perhaps stand itnot otherwise  then i would warn you against the sun  in egypt the sun is sometimes like a fiery furnace never expose yourself when you can avoid doing so and above all never go outside your tents without your helmets on  if you do youll repent it and repentance will probably come too late  i wish you all a prosperous voyage and may god keep you all  delivered in a sharp stern unsentimental tone this brief speech had probably a much more powerful effect on the men than a more elaborate exhortation would have had  the impression was deepened by the remarks of an old officer who made a very brief soldierly speech after the general winding up with the information that he had himself been in egypt and assuring them that if they did not take care of themselves there was little chance of a man of them returning alive  may you have a pleasant passage out he said in conclusion and in the name of the portsmouth division i wish you victory in all your battles and a hearty goodbye  the men who were not going away were then called on to give their departing friends three cheers which they did with right goodwill captain lacey who was in charge of the detachment stepped to the front drew his sword gave the order to shoulder arms form fours right turn quick march and away they went with the united bands of two regiments playing the girl i left behind me  the girls they were about to leave behind them were awaiting them at the barrackgates with a considerable sprinkling of somewhat older girls to keep them company  many of the poor creatures were in tears for the men whom they might never see again and lumps in several manly throats rather interfered with the parting cheer delivered by the detachment at the gate  most of them accompanied the soldiers as far as the dockyard gates  emily armstrong was not among them  she had parted the previous night from her husband at his earnest request and returned by rail to her fathers house there to await as patiently as she might the return of her willie  noble defenders of our country observed an enthusiastic citizen as they passed through the gates  food for powder remarked a sarcastic publican as he turned away to resume his special work of robbing powder of its food and his country of its defenders  proceeding to the embarkation jetty the detachment was marched on board the troopship where the men were at once told off to their respective messes and proceeded without delay to make themselves at home by taking possession of their allotted portion of the huge whitepainted fabric that was to bear them over the waves to distant lands  taking off their belts and stowing them overhead they got hold of their bags exchanged their smart uniforms for old suits of clothes and otherwise prepared themselves for the endurance of life on board a transport  to his great satisfaction miles found that several of the comrades for whom he had by that time acquired a special liking were appointed to the same mess with himself  among these were his friend willie armstrong sergeants gilroy and hardy corporal flynn a private named gaspard redgrave who was a capital musician and had a magnificent tenor voice robert macleod a bigboned scotsman and moses pyne a longlegged cadaverous nondescript who was generally credited with being halfmad though with a good deal of method in his madness and who was possessed of gentleness of spirit and a cheerful readiness to oblige which seemed a flat contradiction of his personal appearance and rendered him a general favourite  while these were busy arranging their quarters a soldier passed with several books in his hand which he had just received from one of the ladies from the institute  hallo jack cried moses pyne have the ladies been aboard  of course they have  theyve been all over the ship already distributin books an goodbyes  if you want to see em youll have to look sharp moses for theyre just goin on shore  see em echoed moses of course i wants to see em  but for them id be  the rest of the sentence was lost in the clatter of moses feet as he stumbled up the ladderway  remembering his letter at that moment miles followed him and reached the gangway just as the visitors were leaving  excuse me he said to one of them stopping her  oh  im so glad to have found you she said  i have been looking for you everywhere  miss robinson sent you this little parcel of books with her best wishes and hopes that you will read them  thanks very much  i will with pleasure  and will you do me a favour  i left a letter on the readingroom table  a sudden and peremptory order of some sort caused a rush which separated miles from the visitor and cut short the sentence and the necessity for the immediate departure of all visitors rendered its being finished impossible  but miss robinsons representative did not require to be told that a forgotten letter could only want posting  on returning therefore to the institute she went at once to the readingroom where she found no letter  making inquiry she learned from one of the maids that a sheet of paper had been found with nothing on it but the words dearest mother im so sorry and that the same had been duly conveyed to miss robinsons room  hasting to the apartment of her friend she knocked and was bidden enter  you have got an unfinished letter it seems she began  yes here it is interrupted miss robinson handing the sheet to her assistant  what a pity that it gives no clew to the writerno address  i am pretty sure as to the writer returned the other  it must have been that finelooking young soldier john miles of whom we have seen a little and heard so much from sergeant gilroy  hereupon an account was given of the hurried and interrupted meeting on board the troopship and the two ladies came to the conclusion that as nothing was known about the parents or former residence of john miles no steps of any kind were possible  the letter was therefore carefully put by  that same evening there alighted at the railway station in portsmouth an elderly lady with an expression of great anxiety on her countenance and much perturbation in her manner  any luggage maam asked a sympathetic porterfor railway porters are sometimes more sympathetic than might be expected of men so much accustomed to witness abrupt and tender partings  no no luggage  yesa small valisein the carriage  thats it  fourwheeler maam  eh noyesyes  where to maam asked the sympathetic porter after the lady was seated in the cab  where to echoed mrs milton for it was she in great distress oh wherewhere shall i drive to  really maam i couldnt say answered the porter with a modest look  iveimy son  my dear boy  where shall i go to inquire  oh what shall i do  these would have been perplexing utterances even to an unsympathetic man  turning away from the window and looking up at the driver the porter said solemnly  to the best otel you know of cabby thats not too dear  an if youve bin gifted with compassion cabby dont overcharge your fare  accepting the direction and exercising his discretion as well as his compassion that intelligent cabby drove strange to say straight to an hotel styled the officers house which is an offshoot of miss robinsons institute and stands close beside it  a hofficers lady said the inventive cabby to the boy who opened the door  wants to putt up in this ere ouse  when poor mrs milton had calmed her feelings sufficiently to admit of her talking with some degree of coherence she rang the bell and sent for the landlord  mr tufnell who was landlord of the officers house as well as manager of the institute soon presented himself and to him the poor lady confided her sorrows  you see landlord she said whimpering i dont know a soul in portsmouth andandin fact i dont even know how i came to your hotel for i never heard of it before but i think i must have been sent here for i see from your looks that you will help me  you may depend on my helping you to the best of my power madam  may i ask what you would have me do  with much earnestness and not a few tears poor mrs milton related as much of her sons story as she thought necessary  well you could not have come to a better place said tufnell for miss robinson and all her helpers sympathise deeply with soldiers  if any one can find out about your son they can  how were you led to suspect that he had come to portsmouth  a friend suggested that he might possibly have done so  indeed it seems natural considering my dear boys desire to enter the army and the number of soldiers who are always passing through this town  well i will go at once and make inquiry  the name milton is not familiar to me but so many come and go that we sometimes forget names  when poor mrs milton was afterwards introduced to miss robinson she found her both sympathetic and anxious to do her utmost to gain information about her missing son but the mothers graphic descriptions of him did not avail much  the fact that he was young tall handsome curlyhaired etcetera applied to so many of the defenders of the country as to be scarcely distinctive enough but when she spoke of my dear miles a new light was thrown on the matter  she was told that a young soldier answering to the description of her son had been there recently but that his surnamenot his christian namewas miles would she recognise his handwriting  recognise it exclaimed mrs milton in a blaze of sudden hope  ay that i would didnt i teach him every letter myself  didnt he insist on making his downstrokes crooked and wasnt my heart almost broken over his square os  while the poor mother was speaking the unfinished letter was laid before her and the handwriting at once recognised  thats his  bless him  and hes sorry  didnt i say he would be sorry  didnt i tell his father so  darling miles i  here the poor creature broke down and wept at the thought of her repentant son  it was well perhaps that the blow was thus softened for she almost fell on the floor when her new friend told her in the gentlest possible manner that miles had that very day set sail for egypt  they kept her at the institute that night however and consoled her much as well as aroused her gratitude by telling of the good men who formed part of her sons regiment and of the books and kind words that had been bestowed on him at parting and by making the most they could of the good hope that the fighting in egypt would soon be over and that her son would ere long return to her god willing sound and well    chapter seven  miles begins to discover himselfhas a few rough experiencesand falls into peasoup saltwater and love  while his mother was hunting for him in portsmouth miles milton was cleaving his way through the watery highway of the world at the rate of fifteen knots  he was at the time in that lowest condition of misery mental and physical which is not unfrequently the result of a chopping sea in the channel  it seemed to him just then an unbelievable mystery how he could at any time have experienced pleasure at the contemplation of food  the heaving of the great white ship was nothing to the heaving well it may perhaps be wiser to refrain from particulars but he felt that the beating of the two thousand horsepower enginesmore or less was childsplay to the throbbing of his brain  and this he thought in the bitterness of his soul this is what i have sacrificed home friends position prospects in life for  this issoldiering  the merest shadow of the power to reasonif such a shadow had been leftmight have convinced him that that was not soldiering that as far as it went it was not even sailoring  youre very bad i fear remarked a gentle voice at the side of his hammock  miles looked round  it was goodnatured lanky cadaverous moses pyne  who told you i was bad asked miles savagely putting a wrongbut too trueinterpretation on the word  the colour of your cheeks tells me poor fellow  bah exclaimed miles  he was too sick to say more  he might have said less with advantage  shall i fetch you some soup asked moses in the kindness of his heart  moses you see was one of those lucky individuals who are born with an incapacity to be sick at sea and was utterly ignorant of the cruelty he perpetrated  or some lobscouse he added  go away gasped miles  a basin of  miles exploded literally as well as metaphorically and moses retired  strange thought that healthy soldier as he stalked away on further errands of mercy stooping as he went to avoid beamsstrange that miles is so changeable in character  i had come to think him a steady reliable sort of chap  puzzling over this difficulty he advanced to the side of another hammock from which heavy groans were issuing  are you very bad corporal he asked in his usual tone of sympathy  bad is it said flynn  och its worse nor bad i am  couldnt ye ax the captin to heaveto for a  the suggestive influence of heavingto was too much for flynn  he pulled up dead  after a few moments he groaned  arrah be off moses av ye dont want my fist on yer nose  extraordinary murmured the kindly man as he removed to another hammock the occupant of which was differently constituted  moses he said as the visitant approached  yes gaspard was the eager reply can i do anything for you  yes if youd go on deck refresh yourself with a walk and leave us all alone youll conferon  gaspard ceased to speak he had already spoken too much and moses pyne still wondering quietly took his advice  but if the channel was bad the bay of biscay was according to flynn far badder  before reaching that celebrated bay however most of the men had recovered and with more or less lugubrious aspects and yellowgreen complexions were staggering about attending to their various duties no doubt their movements about the vessel were for some time characterised by that disagreement between action and will which is sometimes observed in feeble chickens during a high wind but on the whole activity and cheerfulness soon began to reanimate the frames and spirits of britains warriors  and now miles milton began to find out as well as to fix in some degree his natural character  up to this period in his life a mild existence in a quiet home under a fairly good though irascible father and a loving christian mother had not afforded him much opportunity of discovering what he was made of  recent events had taught him pretty sharply that there was much room for improvement  he also discovered that he possessed a very determined will in the carrying out of his intentions especially when those intentions were based upon his desires  whether he would be equally resolute in carrying out intentions that did not harmonise with his desires remained to be seen  his mother among her other teachings had often tried to impress on his young mind the difference between obstinacy and firmness  my boy she was wont to say while smoothing his curly head dont mistake obstinacy for firmness  a man who says i will do this or that in spite of all the world against advice and simply because he wants to do it is obstinate  a man who says i will do this or that in spite of all the world against advice against his own desires and simply because it is the right thing to do is firm  remembering this and repenting bitterly his having so cruelly forsaken his mother our hero cast about in his mind how best he could put some of her precepts into practice as being the only consolation that was now possible to him  you see the good seed sown in those early days was beginning to spring up in unlikely circumstances  of course the habit of prayer and reading a few verses from the bible night and morning recurred to him  this had been given up since he left home he now resumed it though for convenience he prayed while stretched in his hammock  but this did not satisfy him  he must needs undertake some disagreeable work and carry it out with that degree of obstinacy which would amount to firmness  after mature consideration he sought and obtained permission to become one of the two cooks to his mess  moses pyne was the other  nothing he felt could be more alien to his nature more disgusting in every way to his feelingsand he was right  his dislike to the duties seemed rather to increase than to diminish day by day  bitterly did he repent of having undertaken the duty and earnestly did he consider whether there might not be some possible and honourable way of drawing back but he discovered none and soon he provedto himself as well as to othersthat he did indeed possess at least in some degree firmness of character  the duties that devolved on him were trying  he had to scrub and keep the mess clean and tidy to draw all the provisions and prepare them for cooking then to take them to the galley and fetch them when cooked that this last was no simple matter such as any shoregoing tailcoated waiter might undertake was brought forcibly out one day during what seamen style dirty weather  it was raining at the time  the sea was grey the sky was greyer and as the steamer itself was whiteygrey it was a grave business altogether  is the soup ready moses asked miles as he ascended towards the deck and met his confrere coming down  i dont know  shall i go an see  no you can go and look after the table  i will fetch the soup  a nasty sea on remarked a voice which sounded familiar in miless ears as he stepped on deck  hallo  jack molloy he exclaimed catching hold of a stanchion to steady himself as a tremendous roll of the vessel caused a sea to flash over the side and send a showerbath in his face  what part of the sky did you drop from  i thought i had left you snug in the sailors welcome  werry likely you did john miles answered the tar balancing himself with perfect ease and caring no more for spray than if he had been a dolphin but im here for all thatone o the crew o this here transport though i means to wolunteer for active sarvice when i gets out  an no wonder we didnt come across each other sooner  in sitch a enormous tubful o lobsters etceterer its a wonder weve met at all an praps youve bin a good deal under hatches since you come aboord  molloy said this with a knowing look and a grin  miles met the remark in a similar spirit  yes jack ive been paying tribute to neptune lately  you looks like it miles judgin by the colour o your jib  where away now  going for our soup  what made you cook o the mess  ay dont you wish you were me  another roll and flash of spray ended the conversation and separated the friends  the peasoup was ready when our hero reached the galley  having filled the messtureen with the appetising mixture he commenced the return journey with great care for he was now dependent entirely on his legs both hands being engaged  miles was handy if we may say so with his legs  once or twice he had to rush and thrust a shoulder against the bulwarks and a dash of spray served for salt to the soup but he was progressing favourably and had traversed full threequarters of the distance to the hatch when a loud hooroo caused him to look round smartly  he had just time to see corporal flynn who had slipped and fallen come rolling towards him like a sack of flour  next moment he was swept off his legs and went into the lee scuppers with his comrade in a bath of peasoup and saltwater  fortunately the obliging wave which came inboard at the same moment mingled with the soup and saved both men from a scalding  such mishaps however were rare and they served rather to enliven the voyage than otherwise  besides the duties already mentioned our hero had to wash up all the dishes and other things at mealhours to polish up the messkettles and tin dishes and generally to put things away in their places and keep things in applepie order  recollecting another of his mothers teachingswhatever is worth doing at all is worth doing wellhe tried his best and was so ably seconded by the amiable moses that the milesmoses mess came to be at last regarded as the bestkept one on board  one morning after clearing up the dishes and putting things in order miles went on deck for a little fresh air  on the way up he met an elderly gentleman whose dress proclaimed him a clergyman  he looked earnestly at our hero and nodding kindly spoke a few words to him in passing  miles had been aware that there was a clergyman on board going out to egypt with his familywhether in connection with the troops or for health he did not know  he was much impressed with the looks and expression of this man  it seemed to him as if there were some sort of attractive power about him which was unaccountably strong and he felt quite interested in the prospect of hearing him preach on the following sunday  while on deck the previous day he had seen the figures of two ladies whom he rightly judged to be the family above referred to but as there was nearly the whole distance of the ships length between them he could not distinguish their faces  on taking his place when sunday came he observed that the family were present seated however in such a position that he could only see their backs  speculating in a listless way as to what sort of faces they had he whiled away the few minutes before the service began  he was recalled from this condition by the tones of the clergymans voice which seemed to have the same effect on him as his look and manner had the day they first met  during the sermon miless attention was riveted insomuch that he almost forgot where he was  the text was a familiar onegod is lovebut the treatment of it seemed entirely new the boundless nature of that love its incomprehensible and almighty force its enduring certainty and its overwhelming immensity embracing as it did the whole universe in christ were themes on which the preacher expatiated in a way that miles had never before dreamed of  all subordinate love said the preacher in concluding has its source in this  no wonder then that it is spoken of in scripture as a love which passeth knowledge  when the men rose to leave it could be easily seen that they were deeply impressed  as they went out slowly miles passed close to the place where the ladies sat  the slighter of the two was talking in a low tone to her companion and the young soldier was struck with the wonderful resemblance in her tone to that of the preacher  he wondered if her face also resembled his in any degree and glanced back but the head was turned away  i like that parson  he has got brains remarked sergeant hardy as he walked along the deck with sergeant gilroy and corporal flynn  sur an i like him too said the corporal for hes got heart  heart and brains returned gilroy a grand combination  what more could we want  dont you think that tongue is also essential asked miles  but for the preachers eloquence his heart and brain would have worked in vain  come now john miles dont you be risin up into poethry  its not yer naturthough ye think it is  besides av a mans heart an brains is all right he can make good use of em widout much tongue  me own notion is that its thim as hasnt got much to spake of aither of heart or brain as is overfond o waggin the tongue  thats so flynn  youre a living example of the truth of your own opinion retorted miles  och is it angered ye are at gittin the worst o the argiment rejoined the corporal  niver mind boy youll do better by and by  as flynn descended the ladder while he spoke the sense of what he said was lost but the truth of his opinion still continued to receive illustration from the rumbling of his voice until it was swallowed up in the depths of the vessel  next day our hero received a shock from which he never finally recovered  be not alarmed reader it was not paralytic in its nature  it happened on this wise  miles had occasion to go to the fore part of the ship on some culinary business without his coat and with his sleeves rolled up above his elbows  arrived there he found that the captain was taking the ladies round the ship to point out some of its interesting details  as miles came up the younger lady turned round so as to present her full face to him  it was then that poor miles received the shock above referred to at that moment a little boy with wings and a bow stepped right in front of the young lady and shot straight at miles milton  the arrow entered his heart and heno he did not fall true men in such circumstances never fall  they stand transfixed sometimes or stupefied  thus stood miles and stared  yes though naturally modest and polite he stood and stared  and small blame to him as flynn might have said for before him stood his ideal of a fairy an angel a sylphor anything beautiful that best suits your fancy reader  sunny hair sunny eyesearnest and inquiring eyessunny smiles and eyebrows to match  yes she had eyebrows distinctly darker than her hair and welldefined over a pair of large brown eyes  poor miles was stricken as we have said butwould you believe it there were men there looking at that girl at that time who to use their own phraseology would not have accepted a dozen of her for the girls they had left behind them  one young fellow in particular murmured to himself as followsyes very well in her way no doubt but she couldnt hold a candle to my emmy  perhaps the most cutting remark of allmade mentally of coursewas that of sergeant grady who for reasons best known to himself had left a wife describable as a stout wellfavoured girl of forty behind him  in twenty years or so he thought she may perhaps be near as goodlookin as my susy but shell never come quite up to hernever  come this way mrs drew said the captain  i will show you the mens quarters  out of the way my man  flushing to the roots of his hair miles stepped hastily aside  as he did so there was heard an awful rend of a sort that tests the temper of women  it was followed by a musical scream  the girls dress had caught on a block tackle  miles leaped forward and unhooked it  he was rewarded with a smiling thank you which was followed by a blush of confusion as miss drews mother exclaimed oh  marionhow could you by way of making things easier for her no doubt  you did that young man about as smart as i could a done it myself growled a voice behind him  the speaker was jack molloy and a general titter followed miles as he hurried away  as we have said the weather became much worse when the troopship drew near to the bay of biscay and it soon became evident that they were not to cross that famous portion of the atlantic without experiencing some of the violent action for which it is famed  but by that time most of the soldiers according to molloy had got their sealegs on and rather enjoyed the tossing than otherwise  i do like this sort o thing said a beardless young fellow as a number of the men sat on campstools or stood on the weatherside of the deck chatting together about past times and future prospects  ha exclaimed a seaman who stood near them coiling up a rope hold on till youve got a taste o the bay  this is a millpond to that and youll have the chance tonight  if you dont im a dutchman  if i do youll have a taste of it too old saltwater for were in the same boat retorted the young redcoat  true but we aint in the same body returned the sailor  i should just like to see your fourfutt legs wobblin about in a norwest gale youd sing another song  come macleod cried moses pyne tip us a gaelic song  hoots man wull ye be wantin to be made seaseekfor thats whatll do it said the big scotsman  na na let gaspard sing us the bay o biscay o  thatll be mair appropriate  there was a general chorus of assent to this and as gaspard redgrave was an obliging man untroubled by false modesty he cleared his throat and began  his voice being a really splendid one attracted all the men who chanced to be within range of it among others miles who was passing at the moment with a bag of biscuits in one hand and a meatcan in the other  he leaned up against one of those funnels which send fresh air down to the stokers of steamships  he had listened only a few moments when marion drew glided amongst the men and seemed to stand as if entranced with delight in front of him steadying herself by a rope for the vessel was pitching a good deal as well as rolling considerably  at the first chorus the crowd burst forth with wild enthusiasm    as we lay on that day   in the bay of biscay o  dwelling with unnecessary length and emphasis on the o  at the close of the second verse the men were preparing to burst forth again when miles observed an approaching billow which caused him to start in alarm  although unused to the aspect of waves he had an instinctive feeling that there was danger approaching  voices of warning were promptly raised from different parts of the vessel but already the loud chorus had begun and drowned every other sound  miles dropped his biscuits and sprang towards marion who with flashing eyes and parted lips was gazing at gaspard  he just reached her when the wave burst over the side and catching most of the men quite unprepared swept them with terrible violence towards the leeside of the deck  marion was standing directly in the line of this human cataract but miles swung her deftly round into the lee of the funnel a handle of which she happily caught and clung to it like a limpet  her preserver was not so fortunate  the edge of the cataract struck him swept him off his legs and hurled him with many comrades against the lee bulwarks where he lay stunned and helpless in the swishing water  of course soldiers and sailors ran from all parts of the vessel to the rescue and soon the injured men were carried below and attended to by the doctors and considering the nature of the accident it was matter for surprise that the result was no worse than some pretty severe contusions and a few broken ribs  when miles recovered consciousness he found himself in his hammock with considerable pain in various parts of his body and the reverend james drew bending over him  youre all right now my fine fellow he said in a low comforting voice  no bones broken so the doctors say  only a little bruised  tell me sir said miles rousing himself isis your daughter safe  yes thanks be to god and to your prompt assistance she is none the worsesave the fright and a wetting  miles sank back on his pillows with a feeling of profound satisfaction  now you must try to sleep if you can said the clergyman it will do you good  but miles did not want anything to do him good  he was quite content to lie still and enjoy the simple fact that he had rescued marion perhaps from deathat all events from serious injury  as for painwhat was that to him was he not a soldierone whose profession requires him to suffer anything cheerfully in the discharge of duty  and was not love the highest duty  on the strength of some such thoughts he forgot his pain and calmly went to sleep    chapter eight  has reference to many things connected with mind matter and affections  the wave which had burst with such disastrous effect on the deck of the troopship was but the herald of one of those short wild storms which occasionally sweep with desolating violence over the atlantic ocean and too frequently strew with wreck the western shores of europe  in the bay of biscay as usual the power of the gale was felt more severely than elsewhere  theres some sort o mystery about the matter said jack molloy to william armstrong as they cowered together under the shelter of the bridge  why the atlantic should tumble into this ere bay with greater wiolence than elsewhere is beyond my comprehension  but any man wi half an eye can see that it do do it  jist look at that  there was something indeed to look at for even while he spoke a mighty wave tumbled on board of the vessel rushed over the fore deck like niagara rapids in miniature and slushed wildly about for a considerable time before it found its way through the scuppers into the grey wilderness of heaving billows from which it sprang  the great ship quivered and seemed for a moment to stagger under the blow while the wind shrieked through the rigging as if laughing at the success of its efforts but the whiteygrey hull rose heavily yet steadily out of the churning foam rode triumphant over the broadbacked billow that had struck her and dived ponderously into the valley of waters beyond  dont you think said the young soldier whose general knowledge was a little more extensive than that of the seaman that the gulf stream may have something to do with it  molloy looked at the deck with philosophically solemn countenance deriving no apparent inspiration from that quarter he gazed on the tumultuous chaos of saltwater with a perplexed expression  finally and gravely he shook his weatherbeaten head  cant see that nohow he said  in course i knows that the gulf stream comes out the gulf o mexico cuts across the atlantic in a noreasterly direction goes slap agin the west of england ireland and scotland and then scurries away up the coast o norwaythough why it should do so is best known to itself praps its arter the fashion of an angry woman accordin to its own sweet will but what has that got for to do wi the bay of biscay o  thats wot i wants to know  more to do with it than you think jack answered the soldier  in the first place youre not quite though partly correct about the gulf stream  well i aint zactly a scienkrific stoodent you know  dont purfess to be  just so jack  neither am i but i have inquired into this matter in a general way an heres my notions about it  draw it fine willum dont be flowery said the sailor renewing his quid  moreover if youll take the advice of an old salt youll keep a tighter grip o that belayinpin youve got hold of unless you wants to be washed overboard  now then fire away  im all attention as the cat said at the mouth o the mousehole  well then began armstrong with the slightly conscious air of superior knowledge the gulf stream does not rise in the gulf of mexico  did i say that it did willum  well you said that it came out of the gulf of mexicoand no doubt so far you are right but what i mean is that it does not originate there  wy dont you say what you mean then willum instead o pitchin into a poor chap as makes no pretence to be a purfessor  heave ahead  well jack continued the soldier with more care as to his statements i believe on the best authority that the gulf stream is only part of a great ocean current which originates at the equator and a small bit of which flows north into the atlantic where it drives into the gulf of mexico  finding no outlet there it rushes violently round the gulf  gits angry no doubt an thats what makes it hot suggested the sailor  perhaps  anyhow it then flows as you say in a noreasterly direction to the coasts of great britain and ireland  but it does more than that  it spreads as it goes and also rushes straight at the coasts of france and spain  here however it meets a strong counter current running south along these same coasts of france an spain  that is difficulty number one  it has to do battle wi that current and you know jack wherever theres a battle theres apt to be convulsions of some sort  well then a norwesterly gale comes on and rolls the whole o the north atlantic ocean against these coasts  so here you have this part of the gulf stream caught in another directionon the port quarter as you sailors might call it  never mind wot us sailors might call it willum  wotever you say on that pint youre sure to be wrong  heave ahead  well then continued armstrong with a laugh thats trouble number two and these troubles youll observe apply to the whole west coast of both countries but in the bay of biscay there is still another difficulty for when these rushing and tormented waters try to escape they are met fair in the face by the whole north coast of spain and thus  i sees it exclaimed molloy with a sudden beam of intelligence youve hit the nail on the head willum  gulf stream flies at france in a hot rage finds a cool current or customer flowin down south that shouts belay there  at it they go tooth an nail when down comes a norwester like a wolf on the fold takes the stream on the port quarter as you say an drives both it an the cool customer into the bay where the north o spain cries avast heavin both o you an drives em back to where the norwesters drivin em on  no wonder theres a mortal hullaballoo in the bay o biscay  why mate where got ye all that larnin  before his friend could reply a terrific plunge of the vessel a vicious shriek of the wind and the entrance of another tremendous sea suggested that the elements were roused to unusual fury at having the secrets of their operations thus ruthlessly revealed and also suggested the propriety of the two friends seeking better shelter down below  while this storm was raging miles lay in his hammock subjected to storms of the bosom with occasional calms between  he was enjoying one of the calms when armstrong passed his hammock and asked how he was getting on  very well willie  soon be all right i think he replied with a contented smile  for at that moment he had been dwelling on the agreeable fact that he had really rescued marion drew from probable death and that her parents gratefully recognised the serviceas he learned from the clergyman himself who expressed his gratitude in the form of frequent visits to and pleasant chats with the invalid  the interest and sympathy which miles had felt on first seeing this man naturally increased and at last he ventured to confide to him the story of his departure from home but said nothing about the changed name  it is needless to relate all that was said on the occasion  one can easily imagine the bearing of a good deal of it  the result on miles was not very obvious at the time but it bore fruit after many days  the calm in our heros breast was not however of long duration  the thought that as a private in a marching regiment he had not the means to maintain marion in the social position to which she had been accustomed was a very bitter thought and ruffled the sea of his feelings with a stiff breeze  this freshened to something like a gale of rebellion when he reflected that his case was all but hopeless for whatever might have been the truth of the statement regarding the french army under napoleon that every soldier carried a marshals baton in his knapsack it did not follow that soldiers in the british army of the present day carried commissions in their knapsacks  indeed he knew it was by no means a common thing for men to rise from the ranks and he was well aware that those who did so were elevated in virtue of qualities which he did not possess  he was in the midst of one of his bosom storms when sergeant hardy came to inquire how he did  somehow the quiet grave manly nature of that sergeant had a powerful effect not only on miles but on every one with whom he came in contact it was not so much his words as his manner that commended him  he was curiously contradictory so to speak in character and appearance  the stern gravity of his countenance suggested a hard nature but lines of goodhumour lurking about the eyes and mouth put to flight the suggestion and acts of womanly tenderness on many occasions turned the scale the other way  a strong tall stiffly upright and slowmoving frame led one to look only for elephantine force but when circumstances required prompt action our sergeant displayed powers of catlike activity which were all the more tremendous that they seemed incongruous and were unexpected  from his lips you looked for a voice of thunderand at drill you were not disappointedbut on ordinary occasions his speech was soft and low bass indeed as to its quality but never harsh or loud  a gale is brewing up from the norwest so jack molloy says remarked hardy as he was about to pass on  why i thought it was blowing a gale now returned miles  at least it seems so if we may judge from the pitching and plunging  ah lad you are judging from the landlubbers viewpoint returned the sergeant  wait a bit and you will understand better what molloy means when he calls this only a capful of wind  miles had not to wait long  the gale when fully brewed up proved to be no mean descendant of the family of storms which have tormented the celebrated bay since the present economy of nature began and many of those who were on board of the troopship at that time had their eyes opened and their minds enlarged as to the nature of a thorough gale when hatches have to be battened down and the deadlights closed when steersmen have to be fastened in their places and the maddened sea seems to roar defiance to the howling blast and all things movable on deck are swept away as if they were straws and many things not meant to be movable are wrenched from their fastenings with a violence that nothing formed by man can resist and timbers creak and groan and loose furniture gyrates about until smashed to pieces and wellguarded glass and crockery leap out of bounds to irrecoverable ruin and even the seamen plunge about and stagger and landsmen hold on to ringbolts and belayingpins or cling to bulkheads for dear life while mighty billows thundering inboard hiss along the decks and everything above below and around seems being swept into eternity by the besom of destruction  but the troopship weathered the storm nobly and the good lord sent fine weather and moderate winds thereafter and ere long the soldiers were enjoying the sunshine the sparkling waters and the sight of the lovely shores of the blue mediterranean  soon after that broken bones began to mend and bruises to disappear and our hero thoroughly recovered from his accident as well as greatly improved in general health returned to his duties  but miles was not a happy man for day by day he felt more and more severely that he had put himself in a false position  besides the everincreasing regret for having hastily forsaken home he had now the bitter reflection that he had voluntarily thrown away the right to address marion drew as an equal  during the whole voyage he had scarcely an opportunity of speaking a word to her  of course the warmhearted girl did not forget the important service that had been rendered to her by the young soldier and she took more than one occasion to visit the fore part of the vessel for the purpose of expressing her gratitude and asking about his health after he was able to come on deck but as her father accompanied her on these occasions the conversation was conducted chiefly between him and the reverend gentleman  still it was some comfort to hear her voice and see her eyes beaming kindly on him  once the youth inadvertently expressed his feelings in his look so that marions eyelids dropped and a blush suffused her face to hide which she instantly became unreasonably interested in the steamwinch beside which they were standing and wanted to understand principles of engineering which had never troubled her before  what is the use of that curious machine she asked turning towards it quickly  wy miss answered jack molloy who chanced to be sitting on a spare yard close at hand working a turks head on a manrope thats the steamwinch that is the thing wot we uses wen we wants to hoist things out o the hold or lower em into it  come marion we must not keep our friend from his duties said mr drew nodding pleasantly to miles as he turned away  the remark was called forth by the fact that miles had been arrested while on his way to the galley with a dish of salt pork and with his shirtsleeves as usual tucked up  only once during the voyage did our hero get the chance of talking with marion alone  the opportunity like most pieces of good fortune came unexpectedly  it was on a magnificent night just after the troopship had left malta  the sea was perfectly calm yet affected by that oily motion which has the effect of breaking a reflected moon into a million fragments  all nature appeared to be hushed and the stars were resplendent  it was enough as jack molloy said to make even a bad man feel good  do ee speak from personal experience jack asked a comrade on that occasion  i might jim if you wasnt here retorted molloy but its not easy to feel bad alongside o you  thats like a doubleedged sword jackcuts two ways  wich way dee mean it  wichever way you please as the man said wen the alligator axed im wether hed prefer to be chawed up or bolted whole  concluding that on the whole the conversation of his friends did not tend to edification miles left them and went to one of the starboard gangways from which he could take a contemplative view of nature in her beautiful robe of night  curiously enough marion chanced to saunter towards the same gangway and unexpectedly found him there  a lovely night mr miles she remarked  miles started and turned with slight confusion in his face which happily the imperfect light concealed  beautiful indeed he exclaimed thinking of the face before himnot of the night  a cool beautiful night like this continued the girlwho was of the romantic age of sixteenwill remain long i should think in your memory and perhaps mitigate in some degree the hardships that are before you on the burning sand of egypt  the memory of this night returned miles with fervour will remain with me for ever  it will not only mitigate what you are pleased to call hardships but will cause me to forget them altogetherforget everything  nay that were impossible rejoined marion with a slight laugh for a true soldier cannot forget duty  true true said miles dubiously at least it ought to be true and i have no doubt is so in many cases but  what more he might have said cannot now be told for they were interrupted at the moment by captain lacey who happening to walk in that direction stopped and directed miss drews attention to a picturesque craft with high lateen sails which had just entered into the silver pathway of the moon on the water  miles felt that it would be inappropriate in him to remain or to join in the conversation  with a heart full of disappointment and indignation he retired and sought refuge in the darkest recesses of the pantry to which he was welcome at all times being a great favourite with the steward  whether it was the smell of the cheese or the ketchup we know not but here better thoughts came over our hero  insignificant causes often produce tremendous effects  the touching of a trigger is but a small matter the effects of such a touch are sometimes deadly as well as touching  possibly the sugar if not the cinnamon may have been an element in his change of mind  at all events it is safe to say that the general smell of groceries was associated with it  under the benign influence of this change he betook himself to the berth of the chief shipscarpenter with whom also he was a favourite finding the berth empty and a light burning in it he sat down to wait for his friend  the place was comparatively quiet and retired bethinking himself of the little packet which he had received at portsmouth and which still lay unopened in the breastpocket of his shelljacket he pulled it out  besides a testament it contained sundry prettily covered booklets written by miss robinson and others to interest the public in our soldiers as well as to amuse the soldiers themselves  in glancing through our soldiers and sailors institute memories our warfare the victory heavens light our guide goodbye and similar works two facts were suddenly impressed upon his mind and strongly illuminatednamely that there is such a thing as living for the good of others and that up to that time he had lived simply and solely for himself  the last sentence that had fallen from the lips of marion that night was also strongly impressed upon hima true soldier cannot forget duty and he resolved that duty should be his lifes watchword thenceforward  such is the influence that a nobleminded woman may unconsciously have over even an unsteady man  soon after this the troopship reached the end of her voyage and cast anchor off the coast of egypt near the farfamed city of alexandria    chapter nine  our hero meets a friend unexpectedly in peculiar circumstances and has a very strange encounter  miles miltons first experience in alexandria was rather curious and like most surprising things quite unlooked for  the troops were not permitted to land immediately on arrival but of course no such prohibition lay on the passengers who went off immediately  in the hurry of doing so the clergyman and his family missed saying goodbye to miles who happened to be on duty in some remote part of the vessel at the time and the shoreboat could not be delayed  this caused mr and mrs drew much regret but we cannot add that it caused the same to miss drew because that young lady possessed considerable command of feature and revealed no feeling at all on the occasion  miles was greatly disappointed when he found that they had gone but consoled himself with the hope that he could make use of his first days leave to find them out in the town and say goodbye  but why encourage hope thought miles to himself with bitterness in his heart im only a private  marion will never condescend to think of me  what have i to offer her except my worthless self  you see miles was beginning to see through himself faintly even if my father were a rich man able to buy me out of the army and leave me a fortune which he is notwhat right have i to expect that a girl like marion would risk her happiness with a fellow who has no profession no means of subsistence and who has left home without money and without leave bah  miles you are about the greatest goose that ever put on a red coat  he was getting on you see  if he had put sinner for goose his shot would have been nearer the mark as it was all things considered it was not a miss  he smarted considerably under the selfcondemnation if a comrade had said as much he would have resented it hotly but a man is wonderfully lenient to himself  under the impulse of these feelings he sought and obtained leave to go into the town  he wished to see how the new soldiers institute being set up there was getting along  he had promised miss robinson to pay it a visit  that was his plea  he did not feel called upon to inform his officer of his intention to visit the drews  that was quite a private matteryet it was the main matter for on landing instead of inquiring for the spot where the new institute was being erected he began a search among the various hotels where english visitors were wont to put up  the search was successful  he found the hotel but the family had gone out he was told and were not expected back till evening  disappointment of course was the result but he would wait  it is amazing what an amount of patience even impatient men will exercise when under the influence of hope  there was plenty of time to run down and see the institute but he might miss his friends if they should chance to come in and go out again during his absence  what should he do  bother the institute he muttered to himself  its only bricks an mortar after all and i dont know a soul there  he was wrong on both of these points as we shall see  whats the use of my going he murmured after a reflective pause  you promised the ladies of the portsmouth institute that youd go to see it and report progress said that extraordinary something inside of him which had a most uncomfortable way of starting up and whispering when least expected to do so  and added something every gentleman should keep his word  true replied miles almost angrily though inaudibly but im not a gentleman im only a private  goose retorted that pertinacious something is not every private a gentleman who acts like one  and is not every gentleman a blackguard who behaves as such  miles was silenced  he gave in and went off at once to visit the institute  as he walked down the long straight street leading to the grand square which had been almost destroyed by the bombardment he passed numerous dirty drinkingshops and wondered that english soldiers would condescend to enter such disgusting places  he was but a young soldier and had yet to learn that to men who have been fairly overcome by the power of the fiend strong drink no place is too disgusting and no action too mean so that it but leads to the gratification of their intolerable craving  it is said that in two streets only there were 500 of these disreputable drinkingshops  all sorts and conditions of men passed him as he went along turks greeks arabs negroes frenchmen italians and englishmen the gay colours of whose picturesque costumes lent additional brilliancy to the sunny scene  the sight of the darkskinned men and veiled women of the arab quarter did more however than anything else to convince our hero that he had at last really reached the eastthe land of the ancient pharaohs the pyramids the arabian nights entertainments and of modern contention  presently he came upon the piece of waste ground which had been chosen as the site of the new institute  it was covered with the ruins shattered cement glass tiles and general wreckageof the buildings that had stood there before the bombardment and on three sides it was surrounded by heaps of stones shattered walls and rubbish some acres in extent  but the place had the great advantage of being close to the old harbour not far from the spot where ancient alexandria stood and was open to the fresh cooling breezes that came in from the sea  arab workmen were busily employed at the time on the foundations of the building under the superintendence of an unmistakable and soldierlylooking englishman whose broad back was presented to miles as he approached  turning suddenly round mr tufnell the manager of the portsmouth institute confronted the visitor with a stern but perspiring visage which instantly became illuminated with a beaming smile  what  tufnell exclaimed our hero in amazement  ay miles as large as life  larger than life if anything said miles grasping the proffered hand and shaking it warmly  why man the air of egypt seems to magnify you  more likely that the heat of egypt is making me grow  what are you rubbing your eyes for  to make sure that they do not deceive answered miles  did i not leave you behind me at portsmouth  so you did friend but the voyage in a troopship is not the fastest method of reaching egypt  as you see ive overshot you in the race  i have come to put up the new building  but come to my palace here and have a talk and a cup of coffee  glad to see that the voyage has agreed with you  they reached the palace to which the manager referred and found it to be a cottage of corrugated iron amidst the rubbish  here said tufnell offering his friend a chair i spend all my time and reign suprememonarch of all i survey  these are my subjects he added pointing to the arab workmen that wilderness of rubbish is my kingdom and yon heap of iron and stone is the material out of which we mean to construct our alexandria institute  to save time the most valuable article in the world if youll believe me miss robinson as perhaps you may have heard bought an old iron edifice in london known as the brompton oratory and sent it out herelike a convictat government expense  you see not only the public but government have now come to recognise the value of her work for soldiers  and your subjects the arabsare they obedient and loyal asked miles  pretty well but they give me some trouble now and then  the other day for instance we had a sad accident which at one time i feared would land us in serious difficulties  it is necessary you must know in laying foundations here to dig through the sand some twelve to fifteen feet till water is reached and then we lay a solid stone foundation about nine feet wide  well while digging this foundation the sand fell in on one of the workmen  i off coat at once and set to work with a shovel shouting to the fellows to help me  instead of helping they rushed at me in a body to prevent my interfering in the matter  then they quarrelled among themselves as to the best way of getting the man out and the result was that the poor fellow was suffocated though he might easily have been rescued by prompt action but that was not the end of it  the relations and friends of the man came down made eastern howling and lamentation over him and laid his corpse at the door of my cottage holding me responsible for his life and demanding compensation  and it was not till i had paid a few francs to every brother and cousin and relative belonging to him that their grief was appeased and the dead body carried away  still the matter did not end here for next day the workmen said the accident was owing to the omission of a sacrifice at the commencement of the work and they must have a lamb to kill on the ground or more lives would certainly be lost  so i bought them a lamb which they duly killed cooked and ate after sprinkling its blood on the four corners of the foundation and on the walls  i had the skin of this lamb dressed and sent home as a curiosity  see note 1  you appear to have pretty rough times of it then on the whole said miles  i never counted on smooth times returned tufnell besides being used to roughing it i am always glad to do so in a good cause  my palace as you see is not a bad one though small  it is pretty hot too as you seem to feel and they tell me there will be some interesting variety in my experiences when the rainy season sets in  i wouldnt mind it so much if i could only be left to sleep in peace at nights  i stay here you see night and day and what wi the arabs prowling around whispering and trying to get in and the wild dogs makin the neighbourhood a place o public meetingbarking howling and quarrelling over their sorrows like human beins they dont give me much rest  i have read of these dogs before said miles  are they really as wild and dangerous as they get credit for  if youd seen the fight i had wi them the other night youd have no doubt on that point  why a gang of em made a regular attack on me and if it hadnt been that i was pretty active with my swordstick theyd have torn me in bits  let me advise you never to go out after nightfall without one  is that one in your hand  no it is merely a cane  well exchange with me  theres no saying when you may want it  tufnell took a light swordstick which lay on the table and handed it to miles who accepted it laughingly and without the slightest belief that he should ever have occasion to use it  in chatting about the plans of the building and the prospects of success our hero became at last so deeply interestedpartly no doubt because of his friends enthusiasmthat he forgot the flight of time and the evening was advancing before he rose to leave  now tufnell he said suddenly i must be off i have another call of importance to make  what wont you stop and have a cup of coffee with me  impossible  my business is urgent  i want to see friends whom i may not have the chance of seeing again  goodnight  goodnight then and have a care of the dogs specially after nightfall  on returning to the hotel shortly after sunset miles came to the conclusion that his love must certainly be true for its course was not running smooth  his friends had not yet returned  mrs drew had indeed come back alone in a cab but she had von headik an vas go to the bed  waiting about in front of the hotel for an hoar or two proved to be too much for our heros nerves he therefore made up his mind to exhaust his nervous system by means of a smart walk  soon he found himself in a lonely place halfway between the grand square and the ramleh gate with a deliciously cool breeze playing on his brow and a full moon sailing overhead  no one was moving about on the road along which he walked  he had it all to himself at first and the evening would have been quiet as well as beautiful but for the yelping dogs which had by that time come out of their daydens to search and fight for food and hold their nightly revels  all round him were the heaps of rubbish caused by bombardment and the ruined houses which war had rendered tenantless though here and there the uprising of new buildings proved that the indomitable energy of man was not to be quelled by war or anything else  a flickering oillamp placed here and there at intervals threw a sickly yellow light into dark recesses which the moonbeams failed to reach  intermingled with these were a few datepalms and bananas  after a time he observed a couple of figures in advance of hima man and womanwalking slowly in the same direction  not wishing to have his thoughts disturbed he pushed on intending to pass the wayfarers  he had got to within a hundred paces of them when he became aware of a violent pattering sound behind him  stopping and looking back he saw a pack of eight or nine of the wild halffamished dogs of the place coming along the road at full gallop  he was quite aware that they were the savage masterless creatures which keep close in hiding during the day and come out at night to search for something to devour but he could not bring himself to believe that any sort of dog was a dangerous animal  he therefore merely looked at them with interest as being natives of the place  they passed without taking notice of himas ugly and wolfish a pack as one could wish to seeled by a big fellow like a ragged disreputable collie  they also passed with apparent indifference the wayfarers in advance who had stopped to look at them  suddenly and without a note of warning the whole pack turned and rushed back yelling fiercely towards the man and woman  the latter clung to the left arm of the former who raised his stick and brought it down with such goodwill on the skull of the foremost dog that it reeled back with an angry howl  it was not cowed however for it came on again but the man instead of striking it thrust the end of his stick down its throat and checked it a second time  still unsubdued the fierce animal flew at him once more and would certainly have overcome him if miles had not run to the rescue at the first sign of attack  coming up quickly he brought his cane down on the dogs head with all his might having quite forgotten the sword in the excitement of the moment  the blow did nothing to the dog but it shattered the cane leaving the sword exposed  this was fortunate  a quick thrust sent the dog flying away with yells of pain and fear followed by all his companions who seemed to take their cue entirely from their leader  turning to congratulate the wayfarers on their escape miles confronted mr drew and his daughter marion  if he had encountered the glare of the great seaserpent he could scarcely have been taken more completely aback  my dear young friend said the clergyman recovering himself and grasping the passive hand of the young soldier with enthusiasm though he could not help smiling at his obvious embarrassment you seem to have been raised up to be our rescuer  i hope i have been raised up for something even more satisfactory than that thought miles but he did not say so  what he did sayin a stammering fashionwas to the effect that he hoped he might be called on totorender many more such trifling servicesnohe did not quite mean that but if they should ever again be in danger he hoped they would call on him totothat is  but i hope sincerely he added changing the subject abruptly that you are not hurt miss drew  oh dear no only a little frightened  but father are you sure that you are not hurt  quite sure only a little sprain i think or twist in my right ankle the attack was so sudden you see that in the hurry to meet it my foot turned over  give me your arm my young friend  there it will be all right in a few minutes  how you tremble marion  your nerves have received a greater shock than you imagine and a lame man is but a poor support  give her your other arm mr miles  you are stout enough to support us both  stout enough to support them both  ay at that moment miles felt stout enough to support the entire world like atlas on his own broad shoulders  with a blush that the moon generously refused to reveal marion laid her hand lightly on the soldiers arm  it was much too light a touch and did not distribute with fairness the weight of his burden for the old gentleman hung heavily on the other arm  mr drew walked very slowly and with evident pain for the twist of the ankle had been much more severe than he at first imagined  you will come in and sup with us said mr drew on at last reaching the hotel door  impossible  i am exceedingly sorry but my time has almost expired indeed i fear it has expired already and duty comes before everything else  your daughter taught me that lesson sir on board ship  oh you hypocrite remarked his familiar and plainspoken internal friend where was this grand sense of duty when you left home in a rage without by your leave to father or mother  miles could make no reply  he had a tendency to silence when this friend spoke and returned to barracks in a pensive mood just in time as armstrong said to save his bacon    note 1  this fleece is now among other curiosities at the portsmouth institute    chapter ten  off to the wars  the troops sent out to egypt at that time were much wanted to reinforce the southern frontier and defend it from the attacks of osman digna who with a large host of the dusky warriors of the soudan was giving the defenders much trouble and keeping them incessantly on the qui vive  miles milton had no time while in alexandria for anything but duty  he saw marion only once again before leaving but did not find an opportunity to converse with her alone  to do him justice he had not the most distant intention of declaring the state of his feelings even if the opportunity had been given  he merely desired to be in her company for a little on any terms whatever  on that occasion however he contrived to scorch his heart with a double dose of jealousy for he found two young men visiting the clergyman each of whom seemed to be a friend of the family  one was a spendthrift named rentwortha young traveller of that loose easygoing type which is occasionally met with in foreign parts squandering the money of a rich father  he was a decidedly handsome young fellow but with the stamp of dissipation already on his countenance  the other was a telegraph engineer with honesty and goodnature in every line of his plain countenance  both of these youths paid marked attention to marionat least miles thought soand he hated them both accordingly all the more that he felt their eyes to be fixed upon him while he was bidding her farewell  he did not say goodbye  that was too commonplacein the circumstances almost childish  there was one gleam of comfort in the fact however that marion echoed the word and that he thoughtindeed he was sureher hand trembled slightly as she returned or rather received his squeeze  miles was very stern of countenance and remarkably upright in figure while these adieux were being saidfor the glare of his rivals he thought was upon him  how the poor fellow got through the preparations and packing and parades that were necessary when the order came abruptly for the regiment to start for suez we cannot tell  he went about everything mechanically or like a man in a dream  and it was not till they had fairly started in the railway train that he became alive to the serious fact that he was actually off to the wars  the accommodation for passengers in that train was not good  distinctly bad indeed would be the proper term to apply to the kind of cattletruck in which miles found himself with a detachment of the gallant 310th infantry and soon the blinding dust of egypt reminded our young soldier that the real battle of life had fairly begun  youll get over it in time my poor fellow said his friend armstrong who sat beside him  you need the same consolation yourself friend willie retorted miles wiping the dust out of the corners of his eyes  i didnt mean that returned his friend  you know what i mean but cheer up absence makes the heart grow fonderat the same time it makes a fellow fit for duty  i have gone through it myself and know all about it  miles flushed and felt inclined at first to resent this allusion to the state of his affections but he was fortunately saved from taking any notice of it by a sudden burst of laughter among the men at a remark from corporal flynn who although this was his first visit to egypt had undertaken to point out to his comrades the various localities which he chose to assume were more or less connected with scripture history  the first part of the journey was not particularly interesting and what with the fine sand and the great heat the men began to experience the discomforts of an eastern climate and to make frequent application to their waterbottles  it would have been well if they had contented themselves with water and with the cold tea which some of them had been provident enough to save up at breakfast but when they reached the first station where there was a five minutes halt some of them managed to smuggle strong drink into the train  one immediate result was that the men became more noisy  come give us a song gaspard cried several voices apparently inspired at the same moment with the same idea and desire  wan wid a rousin chorus boy cried flynn  gaspard complied being ever ready to oblige but whether it was the heat or the dust or the rousin chorus or the drink the song was a partial failure  perhaps it was the excess of tremulo induced by the motion of the train  at all events it fell flat and when finished a hilarious loudvoiced man named simkin or rattling bill struck up rule britannia which more than made amends for the other and was sung with intense vigour till the next station was reached  here more drink was smuggled on board the train and as a natural consequence men became troublesome  a morose man named sutherland who was apt to grow argumentative and quarrelsome in his cups made an assertion in reference to something terrestrial which had no particular interest for any mortal man  simkin contradicted it  sutherland repeated it  simkin knocked sutherlands helmet overboard  sutherland returned the compliment in kind and their comrades had to quell an intestine war while the lost headpieces were left on the arid plain where they were last seen surrounded by wonderstricken and longlegged natives of the flamingo tribe  this loss was a serious one for exposure of the head to the sun in such a climate is exceedingly dangerous and the old hands had great difficulty in impressing the fact on rattling bill and sutherland who with the obstinacy of greenhorns made light of the danger and expressed disbelief in sunstroke  of course considerable interest was manifested when the station of telelkebir was reached  its two mile from this ive bin towld said flynn where the great battle was fowt  how dee know that flynn asked one  how do i know anything im towld but by belaivin it returned the corporal  its my opeenion said the big scotsman macleod that if there had been ony better troops than egeeptians to fecht wi oor men an my lord wolseley wadna hae fund it sic an easy job  but it is said that the egyptians were brave enough and fought and died like men till they were fairly overpowered said moses pyne who being young and ardent besides just felt bound to stand up for dead foes  im no objeckin to their bravery returned the scot  they did the best they could but what was to be expeckit o a wheen men that was dragged to the field against their wull an made to fecht afore they weel kent hoo to use their airms  anyhow they gave us a chance to show what british soldiers can do said rattling bill  an sure theres plenty more where they came from to give us another chance said flynn  thats true boys  three cheers for the heroes of telelkebir dead and livin cried armstrong setting the example  the response was prompt and hearty and for a few moments a forest of white helmets waved in the air  the enthusiasm was not allowed to cool for the next station was kassassin where the life guards and our cavalry made their midnight charges and where there occurred perhaps one of the longest days fighting in the war of 1882  here also they saw the graves of the poor fellows who fell at that time but the sight did not depress the men much  the somewhat lugubrious sutherland alone seemed to take a serious view of such matters  its a vera weel for lichthearted lads like you to laugh an cheer he said but theres naething mair certain than that some o you thats laughin an cheerin yenoo an boastin o lickin the soudan neegers ll fill sandy graves afore lang  you dont know that scotty  praps well all escape and return to old england together said one of his comrades  arrah if i did git into wan o the sandy graves ye spake of remarked flynn i do belaive id rise out of it just for the pleasure o contradictin you sutherland  hm nae doot  contradictiousness whiles maks fowk lively that wad be dull an deed eneuch withoot it  but did onybody iver hear o a regment gaun oot to the wars an comin back jist as it went  thats the question  as hamlets ghost said when he was takin a nightwalk to cool hisself interposed simkin  it wasna his ghost it was his faithers ghost cried sutherland an im no sure that  howld yer tongues both o ye cried flynn sure the loss o yer helmets is beginning to tell on yer heads already  what can the line be i see in the distance over there  i do belaive its another o thim broad rivers that seem to cut up this land all into stripes  why its the canal man cried moses pyne who was more or less enthusiastic about all the sights and scenes they were passing  dont ye see the ships  sure enough youre right moses as ye ginerally are whin youre not wrong  theres some ships comin wan way an some goin the other och but he is a great jainius that frenchman as tied the two says togitherlipslispswhat is it they calls him  ive clane forgot  lesseps said miles as he gazed with unusual interest on this wonderful highway of nations  the troops reached suez after a ten hours journey the distance being about 230 miles  our hero made the acquaintance here of a private of marines named stevenson with whom he afterwards served in the soudan and with whom he became very friendly not only because their spirits were sympathetic but because having been brought up in the same part of england they had similar memories and associations in regard to home  only those who have wandered long and far from their native land can understand the attractive influence that arises between men who meet abroad and find that they can chat about the same places and persons in the old country  it was saturday when the troops arrived at suez and the heavy dew that fell rendered the night bitterly cold and felt to be so all the more because of the intense heat of the day  sunday began with rousing out at six breakfast at seven parade at eight and divine service thereafter  as there was no clergyman at the place at the time the duty was performed by one of the officers  doubtless among the officers there are men who not only can read prayers well but who have the spirit of prayer in them  that such however is not always the case may be gathered from the remark of one of the men upon this occasion  wy you know tom said this rather severe critic to his comrade confidentially theres one advantage in fast readin that it gets the business soon over which is some sort o comfort to fellows that has got to attend whether they like it or not hot or cold fresh or tired unless dooty prevents  but the hofficer that did dooty today seemed to me to ave made a wager to read the prayers against time an that can do no good at all to any one you know  far better in my opinion to ave no service at all  no wonder men wont listen  why its a mockerythats what it is  a walk round suez with armstrong and stevenson till tattoo at 930 finished the day and convinced miles and his friends that the sooner they bade adieu to that place the better for all of them  their wishes were gratified almost sooner than they wished    chapter eleven  new and sad mingled with curious experiences  at suez miles milton first made acquaintance with the shady side of war  before the commanding officer after parade next morning they received marching orders and kitmuster followed  in the afternoon the lochard steamer came in from suakim with sick wounded and invalids and a large party was told off to assist in landing them and their baggage  miles was one of the party  the dock where the vessel lay was three miles off and the greater part of this distance the invalids were brought by train but the latter part of the journey had to be done on foot by those who could walk and on stretchers by those who could not  oh it was pitiful to see those battered sunburnt bloodless young men with deep lines of suffering on their faces aged before their time and the mere wrecks of what they once were  men who had gone to that region strong active ruddy enthusiastic and who after a few months returned thus feeble and shatteredsome irreparably so others with perhaps years of joyless life before them a few with the unmistakable stamp of death already on their brows  there were about forty altogether  some as we have said were carried from the vessel and not one of the forlorn band could get on without the assistance of their fresh comrades from england  one tall deepchested young soldier who must have been a splendid specimen of manhood when he landed in egypt was supported on one side by miles and on the other by stevenson  halt a moment said the invalid in a weak voice and with an apologetic smile  ii cant get along quite as fast as i used to  his trembling legs and bowed back did not require the tongue or the large sunken eyes to confirm that obvious truth  poor fellow said mileswith difficulty owing to the lump in his throatyou ought to have had a stretcher  here sit down a bit on this stone  have you been wounded  ay returned the man with a look of quiet resignation that seemed to have become habitual to him i have been wounded but not by spear or bullet  its the climate that has done for me  i used to think that nothing under the sun could quell me but the lord has seen fit to bring down my pride in that matter  at the same time its only fair to say that he has also raised me up and given me greater blessings than he has taken away  they told me in portsmouth that he would and it has come true  at the institute asked stevenson eagerly  aythe soldiers institute answered the invalid  god bless you returned the marine grasping his hand  it was there i was brought to god myself  cheer up brother  youll soon be in hospital where good food an physic an nursing will bring you round mayhap an make you as shipshape as ever  it may be so if he wills it so returned the trooper softly but i have a little book called our warfare and a letter from the soldiers friend in my pocket which has done me more good than all the hospitals and physic in egypt can do  come let us go on  im better now  rising and putting a long arm round the shoulders of each of his new friends the trooper slowly brought up the rear of the touching procession which had already passed them on its way to suez  in the vessel which had brought those unfortunate men from suakim miles and his comrades soon found themselves advancing down that region of sweltering heat called the red sea  the sight of the disabled men had naturally at first a depressing effect on the men but the influence of robust health youth strong hope and that lighthearted courage which makes the british soldier so formidable to his foes soon restored to most of them their wonted freeandeasy enjoyment of the present and disregard for the future  even the serving out of cholerabelts and pocketfilters failed to allay their exuberant spirits  the lochard although doubtless a good ship for carrying coals was very illsuited to convey troops  but in times of war and in distant lands soldiers lay their account with roughing it  they soon found that a little of the physic which is supposed to be rough on rats would have been of advantage for the very first night many of the men were awakened by those creatures nibbling at their toes everything on board was dirty the tin pannikins were rusty the biscuit was mouldy and full of creatures that the captain called weevils and macleod styled weedeevils  some of the biscuit was so bad that it had to be thrown away and the remainder eaten as moses said with closed eyes  its an ill wind that blaws naebody guid said macleod to moses pyne as he came on deck to enjoy a pipe after their first dinner on board what dee think that queer cratur flynn is doin doon below  nothing very useful i daresay said moses  yere wrang for ance  hes lyin in ambush there makin war on the ratsay an hes killed twa or three aready  you dont say so  ill go and see the fun  so saying moses went below but had just reached the foot of the ladder when a boot caught him violently on the shins  hi hallo ho shouted moses  och git out o the line o fire wid ye  theres another growled flynn as he fired a second boot which whizzed past the intruder and a sharp squeak told that it had not been fired in vain  moses beat a hasty retreat and the irishman continued the fight with that indomitable perseverance for which his countrymen are famous there is no saying how long the action would have lasted but in his energy he knocked away the support of a shelf behind him and a small cask of large nails taking him in rear sent him sprawling on the deck and routed him  this misadventure did not however terminate the war  on the contrary rathunting became a favourite pastime during the voyage down the red sea  our hero of course took his turn at the fighting but we believe that he never received a medal for his share in that war  they spent one sunday on the deep but the only record made of it in the journal of the soldier from which most of our facts are gathered is that they had prayers in racing styleagainst time  as if to cleanse themselves from the impropriety of this act the soldiers had a grand washing of clothes on the following day and the day after that they arrived at suakim  it is what i call a dreary dismallooking town said miles to armstrong as they approached  might be worse replied his friend  ye aye tak a cheery view o things airmstrong  an what for no asked sutherland  you may well ask why not said sergeant hardy  i think it wisest to look always on the bright side of things  whether its dreary or pleasant well have to make the best we can of it boys said stevenson for this is to be our home for some time to come  horrible growled simkin whose spirit was essentially rebellious  ochone sighed flynn who we need scarcely say was essentially jolly  further remark was cut short by the voice of captain lacey ordering the men to fall in as the colonel in command was coming on board to inspect them  the night of the arrival of the 310th was dreadfully hot insomuch that many of the men found it impossible to sleep  but in the silence of that night food for reflection was supplied to the wakeful in the form of sounds that were new to many but soon became familiar to all namely the boom of big guns and the rattle of musketry  osman digna was making one of his customary attacks on the town and the defenders were repelling him  of course the sanguine among the new arrivals were much excited and eager to join in the fray but their services were not required that night  osman and his dusky hordes were being repulsed as usual and the reinforcements were obliged to content themselves with merely listening to the sounds of war    chapter twelve  in action at last  no time was lost in sending the newlyarrived troops to their sphere of duty  there was something appropriate in their landing on that day of gunpowdery memories the 5th of november  it was four oclock when they disembarked  by fourthirty they were drawn up and inspected by the general and immediately thereafter marched off in detachments to their respective stationsto sphinx redoubt fort commodore bulimba and other points of defence  the detachment in which miles milton found himself was led by captain lacey to sphinx redoubt where he was greatly pleased to find that his new friend private stevenson of the marines was also stationed with some of his comrades  there are probably times in the experiences of most of us when we seem to awake out of a long dream and begin to appreciate fully that the circumstances in which we are placed are stern realities after all such a time of awakening came to our hero when he and his comrades each received fifty rounds of ballcartridge and stood ready to repel assault on the defences of suakim  hitherto drill and reviews had seemed to him a good deal like playing at soldiers  even when the distant sound of the big guns and the rattle of small arms touched his ear the slumber of unbelief was only brokennot quite dispelled  but now weighted with the deadly missiles with rifle in hand with ears alert to every sound and eyes open to every object that might present itself on the sandy waste beyond the redoubt and a general feeling of expectancy pervading his thoughts and feelings he became clearly convinced that the recent past was no flight of the imaginationthat he was in very truth a soldier and that his fighting career had in reality begun  now it may not be out of place here to state that our hero was not by nature a combative man  we think it necessary to point this out because the somewhat pugnacious introduction of miles into our story may have misled the reader on this point  his desire for a soldiers life was founded on a notion that it would prove to be a roving jovial hilarious sort of life with plenty of sport and adventure in foreign lands  of course he knew that it implied fighting also and he was quite ready for that when it should be required of him but it did not occur to him to reflect very profoundly that soldiering also meant in some instances exposure to withering heat during the day and stifling heat during the night to thirst that seems unquenchable and fatigue from prolonged duty that seems irreparable to fits of sickness that appear to eliminate from stalwart frames all the strength they had ever possessed and fits of the blues that render the termination of life a subject of rather pleasant contemplation than otherwise  but all these things he found out at suakim  moreover it had not occurred to him to think deeply on the fact that fighting meant rushing at a fellowman whose acquaintance he had not made before against whom he had not the slightest feeling of illwill and skewering him with a bayonet or sending a bullet into him which would terminate his career in midlife and leave a wife and children perhaps a mother alsodisconsolate  but he also found that out at suakim  we repeat that miles had no desire to fight though of course he had no objection  when the officer in command sent him and his comrades to their stationafter the ballcartridge supply just referred toand told them to keep a sharp lookout for osman digna was giving them a great deal of trouble at the time and pointed out where they were to go if attacked and warned them to be ready to turn out on the instant that the bugle should sound the alarm miles was as full of energy and determination to fight and die for his country as the best of his comrades though he did not express so strong a wish for a brush with the enemy as some of them did or sympathise much with corporal flynn when he said  its wishin i am that osman an his dirty naygurs would come down on us this night for were fresh an hearty just off the say burnin for fame an glory ivery mothers son of us an fit to cut the black bastes up into mincemeat  och but its thirsty i am  if ye spoke less an thocht mair ye wadna be sae dry maybe remarked saunders in a cynical tone  hoots man let the cratur alane said macleod as he busied himself polishing up some dim parts of his rifle  its no muckle pleesure were like to hae in this het place  let the puir thing enjoy his boastin while he may  sure an were not widout consolation anyhow retorted the corporal for as long as weve got you mac and your countryman to cheer us wid your wise an lively talk well niver die o the blues  as he spoke a tremendous explosion not far off caused the redoubt to tremble to its foundations  at the same moment the alarm sounded the men sprang up seized their arms and stood ready for an attack but to their surprise no attack was made  surely it must have been one of the mines you were telling me about said miles in a low voice to sergeant gilroy who stood near to him  it was one of them unquestionably for a corporal of the berkshire regiment told me lieutenant young placed the mine there yesterday  while gilroy was speaking lieutenant young himself came along engaged in earnest conversation with captain lacey and stood still close beside miles  what puzzles me is that they have not followed it up with a few volleys according to their usual custom said the former in a low voice  luckily they seldom do any harm for they are uncommonly bad shots but they generally try their best to do us mischief and always make a good deal of noise about it  perhaps suggested captain lacey your mine has done so much execution this time and killed so many men that theyve got a fright and run away  it may be so but i think not  the soudanese are not easily frightened as we have some cause to know  have you many mines about asked the captain  yes we have a good many  and they form a most important part of our defence for we are not very well supplied with men and the egyptian troops are not to be depended on unless backed up by ours  these mines require to be carefully handled however for our shepherds take the cattle out to graze every day so that if i were to fail to disconnect any of them in the mornings we should have some of our cattle blown up and if i failed to connect them again at night the enemy would attack us more vigorously  as it is they are very nervous about the mines they have pluck to face any foe that they can see but the idea of an unseen foe who lurks underground anywhere and may suddenly send them into the sky like rockets daunts them a bit  and little wonder returned the captain  from what you say i judge that you have the management of most of the mines  of all of them answered the lieutenant with a modest look  there was more than modesty in this young officer of engineers there was heroism also  he might have added though he did not that this duty of connecting and disconnecting the mines each night and morning was such a dangerous service that he declined to take men out with him and invariably did the work personally and alone  the mystery of the explosion on the night we write of was explained next morning when a party sallied forth to see what damage had been done they found instead of dismembered men the remnants of a poor little hare which had strayed across the fatal line of danger and been blown to atoms  thus do the lives of the innocent too often fall a sacrifice to the misdeeds of the guilty  next night however the defenders were roused by a real attack  the day had been one of the most trying that the new arrivals had yet experienced  the seasoned men who had been formed by nature apparently of indestructible material said it was awful  the thermometer stood at above 110 degrees in the shade there was not a breath of air moving the men were panting almost choking  even the negroes groaned and drawing brackish water from a well in the fort poured it over their heads and bodiesbut with little benefit for the water itself was between 95 and 100 degrees  itll try some o the newcomers tonight if im not mistaken remarked one of the indestructible men above referred to as he rose from dinner and proceeded to fill his pipe  why dyou think so asked sergeant hardy whose name was appropriate for he continued for a long time to be one of the indestructibles  cause its always like this when were goin to have a horrible night  do the nights vary much asked armstrong who was still busy with his knife and fork  of course they do returned the man  sometimes you have it quite chilly after a hot day  other times you have it suffocatinlike the black hole of calcuttaas itll be tonight  what sort o hole was that asked simkin whose knowledge of history was not extensive  it was a small room or prison into which they stuffed a lot of our men once in india in awful hot weather an kep them there waitin till the great mogul or some chap o that sort should say what was to be done wi them  but his majesty was asleep at the time an it was as much as their lives was worth to waken him  so they had to wait an afore he awakened out o that sleep most o the men was deadsuffocated for want o fresh air  i say mac pass the water said moses pyne  it makes a feller feel quite gaspy to think of  the weatherprophet proved to be right  that night no one could sleep a wink except the big scotsman macleod  to make matters worse the insects of the place were unusually active  one of them especially not much bigger than a pinpoint was irritating out of all proportion to its size and it kept up during the night the warfare which the innumerable flies had waged during the day  its no use trying to sleep willie said miles to armstrong who was next to him as they lay on the flat roof of the redoubt with their rifles resting on the sandbags which formed a slight protection from the enemys fire when one of the frequent attacks was made on the town  so i find returned his friend  i have tried everything  counting up to hundreds of thousands has made me rather more wakeful  i find that thinking of emmy does me most good but even that wont produce sleep  strange remarked miles  i have been trying the same sort of thing without success  and ive had an unusually hard day of it so that i ought to be ready for sleep  you were in luck being on policeduty  hm  i dont think much of my luck  but lets hear what you have been up to all day  well first i began by turning out at 530 am said miles rolling with a sigh on his other side for a uniform crossbelts boots ammunition etcetera dont after all form an easy nightdress after a cup of coffee i fell in with a lot of our fellows and was told off for fatigueduty  worked away till 730  then breakfast  after that i had to clear up the mess then got ready for inspection parade at 930 after which i had to scrub belts and clean up generally  dinner over i was warned to go on nightguard but for some reason which was not stated to me that was changed and im not sorry for it because the heat has taken a good deal out of me and i prefer lying here beside you willie to standing sentry blinking at the desert and fancying every bush and stone to be a dusky skirmisher of osman digna  by the way if that mountain range where the enemy lies is twelve or fourteen miles distant from the town they have a long way to come when they take a fancy to attack uswhich is pretty often too  they say he has got two hundred thousand men with him  dyou think that can be true  a gentle trumpetnote from his friends nose told miles that he had brought about what thoughts of emmy had failed to accomplish  thoughts of marion had very nearly brought himself to a similar condition when a trumpetblast the reverse of gentle roused the whole line of defence and immediately after sharp firing was heard in the direction of the right water fort which was manned by marines with two krupp guns and a gardner  a few rounds from the big guns drove the enemy back in that direction  miles and those around him however had not to turn out  owing to their position on the roof of the sphinx redoubt they had only to roll on their fronts rest their rifles on the sandbags and they were at once ready for action  round the various forts and redoubts deep and broad trenches had been dug and they were rendered otherwise as strong as possible  the right and left water forts formed the first line of defence  the latter fort being manned by egyptian troops was more frequently favoured with the attentions of osman than the others for the marines were splendid men and the native chief was well aware of that  all the places around which offered the slightest shelter to the enemy had been carefully measured as to distance so that the exact range could be fixed at a moments notice  then the warvessels and one of the forts were furnished with electric lights so that by bringing these to bear on the foe as well as the big and little gunsnot to mention mines and riflesthe attacking host had always a warm reception when they paid a visit to the town and never stayed long  the defenders required all these aids however for besides a regiment of egyptian infantry a company of royal engineers and about 500 marines there was only one small battalion of british troops and a regiment of egyptian cavalry  these last were extremely useful  every day they went out scouting and clearing around suakim and had frequent skirmishes with the enemy in all of which they were said to have behaved very well indeed  our party on the redoubt had not lain there long when a sheet of flame seemed to flash out of the darkness in front of them  it was followed by the rattle of small arms  instantly the redoubt replied bullets whizzed overhead and our hero received what has of late been called a baptism of fire  but he was so busy plying his own weapon that he scarcely realised the fact that death was ever and anon within a few inches of him until a bullet ripped the sandbag on which his rifle rested and drove the sand into his face  he became a wiser man from that hour and soon acquired the art of performing his duty with the least possible exposure of his person and that for the briefest possible space of time  like a firstrate detective the electric light sought out and exposed their foes then withering volleys sent them scurrying across the country back to their native hills  sure its wid wan eye open weve got to slape whin the murtherin rascals come down on us like that observed corporal flynn when the firing had slackened to a few dropping shots on both sides  av theyd only stand fornint us in the open its short work wed make o them  theres no more pluck in them than in my smallest finger  it seemed as if righteous retribution were being meted out that night for a spent ball entered the fort at that moment and strange to say hit the extreme tip of the corporals little finger  a howl as much of surprise as pain apprised his comrades of the fact and a hearty laugh followed when the trifling extent of the injury was ascertained  serves you right flynn for boasting said armstrong with a grim smile as he stretched himself out and rested his head on a sandbag moreover you are unjust for these black fellows are as brave a lot o men as british troops have ever had to face  goodnight boys im off to the land of nod    chapter thirteen  tells of some of the trials uncertainties dangers and disasters of war  uncertain moonlight with a multitude of cloudlets drifting slowly across the sky so as to reveal veil partially obscure or sometimes totally blot out the orb of night may be a somewhat romantic but is not a desirable state of things in an enemys country especially when that enemy is prowling among the bushes  but such was the state of things one very sultry night when our hero found himself standing in the open alone and with thoughts of a varied and not wholly agreeable nature for his companions  he was on sentry duty  it was intensely dark when the clouds partially veiled the moon for she was juvenile at the timein her first quarter and when the veil was partially removed the desert for it was little better assumed an indistinct and ghostlygrey appearance  sombre thoughts naturally filled the mind of our young soldier as he stood there alert watchful with weapons ready ears open to the slightest sound and eyes glancing sharply at the perplexing shadows that chased each other over the ground like wanton soudanese at play his faculties were intensely strung at what may well be styled attention and riveted on that desert land to which fateas he called his own conducthad driven him  yet strange to say his mysterious spirit found leisure to fly back to old england and revisit the scenes of childhood  but he had robbed himself of pleasure in that usually pleasant retrospect  he could see only the mild sorrowful slightly reproachful yet always loving face of his mother when in imagination he returned home  it was more than he could bear  he turned to pleasanter memories  he was back again at portsmouth in the readingroom of the soldiers institute with redcoated comrades around him busy with newspaper and illustrated magazine while the sweet sound of familiar music came from the adjoining rooms where a number of blue lights or rather redcoats who were not ashamed to own and serve their maker were engaged with songs of praise  suddenly he was back in egypt with his heart thumping at his ribs  an object seemed to move on the plain in front of him  the ready bayonet was lowered the trigger was touched  only for a moment however  the shadow of a cloud had passed from behind a bushthat was all yet it was strange how very like to a real object it seemed to his highlystrung vision  a bright moonbeam next moment showed him that nothing to cause alarm was visible  mind is not so easily controlled as matter  like a statue he stood there in body but in mind he had again deserted his post  yet not to so great a distance as before  he only went the length of alexandria and thought of marion  the thought produced a glow not of physical heatthat was impossible to one whose temperature had already risen to the utmost attainable heightbut a glow of soul  he became heroic  he remembered marions burning words and resolved that duty should henceforth be his guidingstar  duty  his heart sank as he thought of the word for the something within him became suddenly active and whispered how about your duty to parents  you left them in a rage  you spent some time in portsmouth surrounded by good influences and might have written home but you didnt  you made some feeble attempts indeed but failed  you might have done it several times since you landed in this country but you havent  you know quite well that you have not fully repented even yet  while the whispering was going on the active fancy of the youth saw the lovely face of marion looking at him with mournful interest as it had been the face of an angel and then there came to his memory words which had been spoken to him that very day by his earnest friend stevenson the marine no man can fully do his duty to his fellows until he has begun to do his duty to god  the words had not been used in reference to himself but in connection with a discussion as to the motives generally which influence men  but the words were made use of by the spirit as arrows to pierce the youths heart  guilty he exclaimed aloud and almost involuntary followed god forgive me  again the watchful ear distinguished unwonted sounds and the sharp eyewonderfully sharpened by frequent dangerperceived objects in motion on the plain  this time the objects were real  they approached it was the rounds who visited the sentries six times during each night  in another part of the ground at a considerable distance from the spot where our hero mounted guard stood a youthful soldier also on guard and thinking no doubt of home  he was much too young for service in such a climatealmost a boy  he was a ruddy healthy lad with plenty of courage and high spirit who was willing to encounter anything cheerfully so long as in so doing he could serve his queen and country  but he was careless of his own comfort and safety  several times he had been found fault with for going out in the sun without his white helmet  miles had taken a fancy to the lad and had spoken seriously but very kindly to him that very day about the folly of exposing himself in a way that had already cost so many men their lives  but young lewis laughed goodnaturedly and said that he was too tough to be killed by the sun  the suffocating heat of that night told upon him however severely tough though he was or supposed himself to bewhile he kept his lonely watch on the sandy plain  presently a dark figure was seen approaching  the sentinel at once challenged and brought his rifle to the ready  the man who was a native gave the password all right and made some apparently commonplace remark as he passed which coupled with his easy manner and the correct countersign threw the young soldier off his guard suddenly a long sharp knife gleamed in the faint light and was drawn across the body of lewis before he could raise a hand to defend himself he fell instantly mortally wounded with his entrails cut open  at the same moment the tramp of the rounds was heard and the native glided back into the darkness from which he had so recently emerged  when the soldiers came to the post they found the poor young soldier dying  he was able to tell what had occurred while they were making preparations to carry him away but when they reached the fort they found that his brief career had ended  a damp was cast on the spirits of the men of his company when they learned next day what had occurred for the lad had been a great favourite but soldiers in time of war are too much accustomed to look upon death in every form to be deeply or for long affected by incidents of the kind  only the comrades who had become unusually attached to this poor youth mourned his death as if he had been a brother in the flesh as well as in the ranks  he was a good lad said sergeant gilroy as they kept watch on the roof of the fort that night  since we came here he has never missed writing to his mother a single mail  it is true being an amiable lad and easily led through his affections he had given way to drink to some extent but no later than yesterday i prevailed upon him to join our temperance band  what become a blue light exclaimed sutherland with something of a sneer in his tone  ah comrade and i hope to live to see you join our band also and become one of the bluest lights among us returned the sergeant goodhumouredly  never replied sutherland with emphasis youll never live to see that  perhaps not but if i dont live to see it some one else will rejoined the sergeant laying his hand gently on the mans shoulder  is that you again  its wishin i am that i had you in ould ireland growled corporal flynn referring to osman digna whose men had opened fire on the neighbouring fort and again roused the whole garrison slape is out o the question wi such a muskitos buzzin about  bad luck to ee  what good would it do to send him to ireland asked simkin as he yawned rolled over and like the rest of his comrades loaded his rifle  why man dont ye see av he was in ould ireland he couldnt be disturbin our nights rest here  moreover theyd make a dacent man of im there in no time  its always the way if an english blackguard goes over to ireland hes almost sure to return home more or less of a gintleman  thats why ive always advised you to go over boy  an maybe if osman wint hedhallo  a flash of light and whistling of bullets overhead effectually stopped the irishmans discourse  not that he was at all alarmed by the familiar incident but being a change of subject it became more absorbingly interesting than the conversation besides necessitating some active precautions  the firing seemed to indicate an attack in several places along the line of defence  at one of the posts called the new house the attack was very sharp  the enemy could not have been much if at all over three hundred yards distant in the shelter of three large pits  of course the fire was vigorously returned  a colonel and major were there on the redoubt with powerful fieldglasses and directed the men where to fire until the general himself appeared on the scene and took command  on the left from quarantine island the royal engineers kept up a heavy crossfire and on the right they were helped by a fort which was manned by egyptian troops  from these three points a heavy fire was kept up and continued till six oclock in the morning  by that time the enemy having been finally driven out of the pits a party was sent across to see what execution had been done  it was wonderfully little considering the amount of ammunition and energy expended  in the first pit one man was found dead a bullet had entered his forehead and come out at the back of his head  moving him a little on one side they found another man under him shot in the same way  all round the pit inside were large pools of blood but no bodies for the natives invariably dragged or carried away their dead when that was possible  in the other two pits large pools of blood were also found but no bodies  beyond them however one man was discovered shot through the heart  he had evidently been dragged along the sand but the tremendous fire of the defenders had compelled the enemy to drop him  still further on they found twelve more corpses which had been dragged a short way and then left  close to these they observed that the sand had been disturbed and on turning it up found that a dozen of bodies had been hastily buried there  altogether they calculated that at least fifty of the enemy had been killed on that occasiona calculation which was curiously verified by the friendly tribes asking permission to bury the dead according to the soudanese custom  this was granted of course and thus the exact number killed was ascertained but how many had been wounded no one could tell  fifty desolated homes remarked one of the men when the number of killed was announced at mess that day  he was a cynical sourvisaged man who had just come out of hospital after a pretty severe illness fifty widows mayhap he continued to say nothin o childnthat are just as fond o husbands an fathers as ours are  why jack hall if these are your sentiments you should never have enlisted cried simkin with a laugh  i listed when i was drunk returned hall savagely  och then it sarves ye right said flynn  even a pig would be ashamed to do anythin whin it was in liquor  the corporals remark prevented the conversation taking a lugubrious turn to the satisfaction of a few of the men who could not endure to look at anything from a serious point of view  whats the use one of them asked of pullin a long face over what you cant change  here we are boys to kill or be killed  my creed is take things as they come and be jolly  it wont mend matters to think about wives and childn  wont it cried armstrong looking up with a bright expression from a sheet of paper on which he had just been writing  here am i writin home to my wifein a hurry too for ive only just heard that word has been passed the mail for england goes today  im warned for guard tonight too an if the night takes after the day were in for a chance o suffocation to say nothing o insectsas you all know  now wont it mend matters that ive got a dear girl over the sea to think about and to say god bless her body and soul  no doubt retorted the takethingsastheycomeandbejolly man butbut  but cried hall coming promptly to his rescue have not the soudanese got wives an children as well as us  i daresay they havesome of em  well does the thought of your respective wives an children prevent your shooting or sticking each other when you get the chance  of course it dont returned armstrong with a laugh as he resumed his pencil  what would be the use o comin here if we didnt do that but i havent time to argue with you just now hall  all i know is that its my duty to write to my wife an i wont let the chance slip when ive got it  bah exclaimed the cynic relighting his pipe which in the heat of debate he had allowed to go out  several of the other men having been reminded of the mail by the conversation also betook themselves to pen and pencil though their hands were more familiar with rifle and bayonet  among these was miles milton  mindful of his recent thoughts and reimpressed with the word duty which his friend had just emphasised he sat down and wrote a distinctly selfcondemnatory letter home  there was not a word of excuse explanation or palliation in it from beginning to end  in short it expressed one idea throughout and that wasguilty and of course this was followed by his asking forgiveness  he had forgivenessthough he knew it notlong before he asked it  his brokenhearted father and his everhopeful mother had forgiven him in their hearts long beforeeven before they received that treasured fragment from portsmouth which began and ended with  dearest mother i am sorry  after finishing and despatching the letter miles went out with a feeling of lightness about his heart that he had not felt since that wretched day when he forsook his fathers house  as it was still early in the afternoon he resolved to take a ramble in the town but seeing sergeant gilroy and another man busy with the gardner gun on the roof of the redoubt he turned aside to ask the sergeant to accompany him for gilroy was a very genial christian and miles had lately begun to relish his earnest intelligent talk dashed as it was with many a touch of humour  the gun they were working with at the time had been used the day before in ascertaining the exact range of several objects on the ground in front  ill be happy to go with you miles after ive given this gun a cleanout said gilroy  turn the handle sutherland  ill turn the handle if its a richt said the cautious scot with some hesitation  it is all right returned the sergeant  we ran the feeder out last night you know and i want to have the barrels cleaned  turn away  thus ordered a second time sutherland obeyed and turned the handle the gun went off and its contents passed through the sergeants groin making a hole through which a man could have passed his arm  he dropped at once and while some ran for the doctor and some for water others brought a stretcher to carry the poor fellow to hospital meanwhile miles going down on his knees beside him raised his head and moistened his pale lips with water  he could hardly speak but a smile passed over his face as he said faintly shell get my presents by this mail  write milesbreak it to herwell meet againby the side of jesusgod be praised  he ceased and never spoke again  gilroy was a married man with five children  just before the accident he had written to his wife enclosing gifts for his little ones and telling in a thankful spirit of continued health and safety  before the mailsteamer with his letter on board was out of sight he was dead    chapter fourteen  describes some of osman dignas eccentricities and other matters  one day miles and his friend armstrong went to have a ramble in the town of suakim and were proceeding through the bazaar when they encountered simkin hurrying towards them with a much too serious expression on his face  have you heard the nnews he asked on coming up  no whats up  the old shepshepherds bin killed all the ccattle ccaptured an the egyptian ccavalrys bin sent out after them  nonsense  youre dreaming or youve bin drinking said miles  neither dreamin nor drinkin returned simkin with indignation as he suddenly delivered a blow at our heros face  miles stopped it however gave him a playful punch in the chest and passed on  at first simkin seemed inclined to resent this but while he swayed about in frowning indecision his comrades left him shaking his head therefore with intense gravity he walked away muttering not a bad fellow miles after all if he wwasnt so fond o the bbottle  miles was at the same moment making the same remark to his friend in reference to simkin and with greater truth  but i dont wonder that the men who drink go in for it harder than ever here continued miles  there is such hard work and constant exposure and so little recreation of any sort  yet it is a pity that men should give way to it for too many of our comrades are on the sicklist because of it and some under the sod  it is far more than a pity returned armstrong with unwonted energy drink with its attendant evils is one of the great curses of the army i have been told and i can well believe it that drink causes more loss to an army than war the dangers of foreign service and unhealthy climates all put together  thats a strong statement willie and would need to be founded on good authority  who told you  our new parson told me and he is in my opinion a good authority because he is a christian if ever a man was and he is an elderly man besides being uncommonly clever and well informed  he told us a great many strong facts at the temperance meeting we held last night  i wish you had been there miles  it would have warmed your heart i think  have you joined them willie  yes i have and god helping me i mean to stick by them  i would have gone to the meeting myself said miles thoughtfully if i had been asked  strange returned armstrong that sergeant hardy said to me he thought of asking you to accompany us but had an idea that you wouldnt care to go  now just look at that lot there beside the grogshop door what a commentary on the evils of drink  the lot to which he referred consisted of a group of miserable loungers in filthy garments and fezcaps who in monkeylike excitement or solemn stupidity stood squabbling in front of one of the many greek drinkingshops with which the town was cursed  passing by at the moment with the stately contempt engendered by a splendid physique and a red coat strode a trooperone of the defenders of the town  his gait was steady enough but there was that unmistakable something in the expression of his face which told that he was in the grip of the same fiend that had captured the men round the grogshop door  he was wellknown to both armstrong and miles  hallo  johnson cried the latter  is there any truth in the  he stopped and looked steadily in the troopers eyes without speaking  oh yes i know what you mean said johnson with a reckless air  i know that im drunk  i wouldnt say exactly that of you returned miles but  well well i say it of myself continued the trooper  its no use humbuggin about it  im swimmin wi the current  goin to the dogs like a runaway locomotive  of course i see well enough that men like sergeant hardy an stevenson of the marines who have been temperance men all their lives enjoy good healthwould to god i was like em and i know that drinkers are dyin off like sheep but that makes it all the worse for me for to tell you the honest truth boysan i dont care who knows iti cant leave off drinkin  its killin me by inches  i know likewise that all the old hard drinkers here are soon sent home ruined for lifesuch of em at least as dont leave their miserable bones in the sand and i know that im on the road to destruction but i canti wont give it up  ha  johnson said armstrong these are the very words quoted by the new parson at the temperance meetin last nightan hes a splendid fellow with his tongue  hard drinker says he you are humbuggin yourself  you say you cant give up the drink  the real truth is my man that you wont give it up  if only i could persuade you in gods strength to say i will youd soon come all right  now johnson if youll come with me to the next meetin  what me go to a temperance meetin cried the trooper with something of scorn in his laugh  you might as well ask the devil to go to church  no no armstrong im past prayin forthank you all the same for invitin me  but what was you askin about news bein true what news  why that the old shepherd has been killed and all our cattle are captured and the egyptian cavalry sent after them  you dont say so cried the trooper with the air of a man who suddenly shakes off a heavy burden  if thats so theyll be wantin us also no doubt  without another word he turned and strode away as fast as his long legs could carry him  although there might possibly be a call for infantry to follow miles and his friend did not see that it was needful to make for their fort at more than their ordinary pace  it was a curious and crowded scene they had to traverse  besides the grogshops already mentioned there were numerous coffeehouses where from diminutive cups natives of temperate habits slaked their thirst and discussed the newsof which by the way there was no lack at the time for besides the activity of osman digna and his hordes there were frequent arrivals of mails and sometimes of reinforcements from lower egypt  in the sidestreets were many smithies where lanceheads and knives were being forged by men who had not the most distant belief that such weapons would ever be turned into pruninghooks  there were also workers in leather who sewed up passages of the koran in leathern cases and sold them as amulets to be worn on necks and arms  elsewhere hairdressers were busy greasing and powdering with the dust of redwood the bushy locks of hadendoa dandies  in short all the activities of eastern city life were being carried on as energetically as if the place were in perfect security though the only bulwark that preserved it hour by hour from being swept by the innumerable hordes of soudan savagery consisted of a few hundreds of british and egyptian soldiers  arrived at the sphinx fort the friends found that the news was only too true  the stolen cattle belonged to the people of suakim  every morning at six oclock it was the custom of the shepherds to go out with their herds and flocks to graze there being no forage in or near the town all had to be back by sunset when the gates were locked and no one was allowed out or in till six the next morning  the women who carried all the water used in the waterless town had of course to conform to the same rule  like most men who are constantly exposed to danger the shepherds became careless or foolhardy and wandered rather far with their herds  osman was too astute to neglect his opportunities  on this occasion an old shepherd who was wellknown at sphinx redoubt had strayed too far  the soudanese swept down cut off his retreat killed him and as we have said carried off his cattle  it was to retrieve if possible or avenge this disaster that the egyptian cavalry sallied forth  they were seen galloping after the foe when miles reached the roof of the redoubt where some of his comrades were on duty while captain lacey and several officers were looking on with fieldglasses  they are too late i fear to do much good remarked one of the officers  dont i wish i was goin wid them whispered corporal flynn to a comrade  ye wad be a queer objec on the ootside o a horse remarked macleod cynically  why mac ye wouldnt have me go inside of a horse would ye  it wad be much the same which way ye went returned the scot  ah thin the horse wouldnt think so unless he was a donkey  well done exclaimed captain lacey at that moment as the cavalry cut off and succeeded in recapturing a few of the cattle and gave the enemy several volleys which caused them to beat a hasty retreat  this however turned out to be a ruse on the part of osman who had his men concealed in strong force there  he tried to draw the cavalry away from suakim and was very nearly successful  in the ardour of pursuit the egyptians failed to observe that the soudanese were creeping round their rear to cut off retreat  on discovering their mistake and finding that their small force of two hundred men was being surrounded by thousands of arab warriors it was almost too late  turning at once they galloped back and could be seen through the fieldglasses turning now and then gallantly to engage the pursuing foe  no help could be rendered them at first as they were beyond the range of all the forts nevertheless they got in safely with little injury to man or beast and driving before them the animals that had been recovered  next day the body of the poor old shepherd was brought in and buried without a coffin by his relations  miles being off duty at the time went to see the funeral and found that eastern and western ideas on this point as on many others are wide as the poles asunder  no doubt the grief of the near relations was as real as it was demonstrative but it required more credulity than he possessed to enable him to believe that the howling shouting and singing of many mourners was indicative of genuine feeling  the creation of noise indeed seemed to be their chief method of paying respect to the dead  as deaths in suakim were very numerous at this time owing to much sickness among natives as well as troops the sounds of mourning whether by volley or voice became so frequent that orders were at last given to cease firing over the soldiers graves when they were buried  just ahead of the shepherds body came some poor women who were weeping falling down at intervals and kissing the ground  on reaching the wall round the land side of the town these women stopped formed a circle and kneeled on the sand while the body was passing them then they leaned forward and kissed the ground continuing in that position till all the procession had passed  there the women remained not being allowed to go to the grave and the singing and shouting were continued by boys who kept running round the bier as it was borne along  on reaching the grave the body was put in with the face toward the east and covered up with stones and mortar  then the grave was filled up with sand a brief prayer was offeredthe mourners kneelingafter which the people went home  sad thoughts filled the mind of our young soldier as he returned to the fort but the sadness was soon turned to indignation when he got there  for some time past a soudanese youth of about seventeen or eighteen years of age had been coming about the sphinx redoubt and ingratiating himself with the men who took a great fancy to him because he was amiable in disposition somewhat humorous as well as lively and handsome though black  they used to give him something to eat every time he came and made quite a pet of him  one day while he was out in the open country osmans men captured this youth and took him at once before their leader who probably regarding him as a deserter ordered both his hands to be cut off close to the wrists  the cruel deed was done and the poor lad was sent back to suakim  it was this that roused the wrath of miles as well as that of his comrades  when they saw the raw stumps and the haggard look of the poor fellow who had suffered much from loss of blood they got into a state of mind that would have made them ready to sally forth if so required and assault the entire soudan in arms  och av i only had im here said flynn clenching his teeth and fists at the same time  itsitsits  mincemeat youd make of him said moses  noits cats matethe baste  the others were equally angry though not quite so emphatic but they did not waste their time in useless regrets  they hurried the young soudanese to the doctor who carefully dressed his wounds and every care was thereafter taken of him by the men until completely restored to health  it may interest the reader to know that this poor fellow was afterwards well looked after  some sort of employment in the garrison was obtained for him and he was found to be a useful and willing servant despite the absence of his hands  that night a furious sandstorm burst upon the town accompanied by oppressive heat  it always seems to me said miles to gaspard redgrave who lay next him that mosquitoes and sandflies cats and dogs and in fact the whole brute creation becomes more lively when the weather is unusually hot  just listen to these cats  like a colony of small children being murdered said gaspard  its awfu observed saunders in a kind of solemn astonishment as a frightful caterwaul burst upon their ears  i wadna like to hear teegers in the same state o mind  or elephants murmured moses pyne who was more than half asleep  the cats were indeed a great nuisance for not satisfied with getting on the flat roofs of the houses at nights and keeping up a species of wardance there they invaded the soldiers quarters upsetting things in the darkthus demonstrating the absurdity of the proverb that cats see best in the darkstealing whatever they could lay hold of and inducing halfslumbering men to fling boots and shoes or whatever came most handy at them  rats also were innumerable and to the great surprisenot to say indignationof the men neither dogs nor cats paid the least attention to the rats  after a time the storm both of animate and inanimate nature began to abate and the weary overworked soldiers were dropping off to sleep when a tremendous explosion effectually roused them  there goes another mine cried armstrong starting up  it dont require a prophet to tell us that growled gaspard as he yawned and slowly picked up his rifle  explosions were of quite common occurrence at that time but had to be attended to nevertheless  that osman had taken advantage of the very dark night to make an earlier attack than usual was evident for shots were fired immediately after the explosion occurred as usual  these were replied to but the effect of the explosion it was supposed must have been unusually severe for the enemy withdrew after exchanging only a few shots  this surmise was afterwards proved to be correct  on going to the spot the following morning they found that at least a dozen of their foes must have been blown up for legs and arms and other human remains were picked up in all directions  these the soldiers gathered with the aid of the friendly natives and burned  no attack was made for four days after that but then the untiring enemy became as troublesome as ever  spies afterwards said that when osman heard of this incident and of the number of men killed he said it served them right  they had no business to go touching things that did not belong to them    chapter fifteen  athleticsa new acquaintance turns upan expedition undertaken followed by a race for life  energetic and exhilarating exercise has sometimes the effect of driving away sickness which doctors stuff and treatment fail to cope with successfully  in saying this we intend no slight either to doctors stuff or treatment  after the troops had been some time at suakim the effect of the climate began to tell on them so severely that a very large proportion of europeans were in hospital and many who strove hard to brave it out were scarcely fit for duty  great heat did not however interfere with miles miltons health  he was one of those fortunates who seem to have been made of tougher clay than the average of humanity  but his friend armstrong was laid up for a considerable time  even robert macleod was knocked over for a brief period and the lively corporal flynn succumbed at last  moses pyne however stood the test of hard work and bad climate well and so for a time did sergeant hardy  it was found generally that the abstainers from strong drink suffered less from bad health and unwholesome surroundings than their fellows and as there were a good many in the regiment who were constantly endeavouring to convince their comrades of the advantages of totalabstinence things were not so bad as they might have been  it was about this time that one of the generals who visited suakim instituted athletic games thereby vastly improving the health and spirits of the men  and now miles milton learned for the first time what an immense power there lies in scientific training  one evening when out walking with stevenson he took it into his head to race with him and having been a crack runner at school he beat him easily  why miles said his friend when the short race was over i had no idea you could run so well  if you choose i will put you in training for the coming sports  you must know that i have run and walked and competed in the track many a time at home and have trained and brought out runners who had no notion of what was in them till i proved it to them by training  will you go in for it and promise to do as i bid you  i have no objection replied miles with a light laugh  if he had known what his friend intended to do he might not have agreed so readily for from that hour till the day of the sports stevenson made him go through an amount of runningeven after being made stiff by previous runsthat he would never have agreed to undertake unless forced to do so  we say forced because our hero regarded a promise once given as sacred  his was a curiously compound nature so that while in some points of conduct he was laxas we have seenin others he was very strict  he was peculiarly so in regard to promises  his comrades soon came to know this and ultimately came to consider him a very reliable man  having then promised his friend to keep sternly to his work he did so with the result that his strength increased wonderfully  another result was that he carried off the first prize in all the races  in order to make the most of time and avoid the evils of noonday heat it was arranged that the races etcetera for the egyptian soldiers and natives in government employ should come off in the morning and that the british troops should run in the later and cooler parts of the day with the temperature at 120 degrees in the shade it would have been dangerous for europeans to compete  the sports including our familiar cricket were greatly enjoyed and the result was a decided improvement in the health of the whole force  boatraces were also included in these sports  at the conclusion of one of these miles to his great surprise encountered his old acquaintance of the sailors welcome big jack molloy  why jack exclaimed miles as the hearty tar wrung his hand whod have expected to see you here  ah who indeed an i may say ditto  im very glad to see you molloy for to say truth i thought i had seen the last of you when we parted in the troopship  ive often thought of you since and of our first evening together in thethe what was its name  the sailors welcomeman alive  i wonder youve forgot it blessins on it  i aint likely to forget it  why it was there did i ever tell you the wery night arter i met you that a messmate took me to the big hall back o the readinroom  its no use me tryin fur to tell you all i heard in that there big hall but when i come outblowd if i didnt sign the pledge right away an i aint took a drop o grog since  glad to hear it jack for to say truth i never saw the evil of grog so clearly as i have since coming out here and seeing strong stout men cast down by it in dozensmany of them kindhearted rightthinking men whom i would have thought safe from such a thing  indeed i have more than half a mind to join the good templars myself  young man said molloy sternly if it takes the death of dozens o stout kindhearted men to force you to make up half your mind how many dee want to die before you make up the whole of it  but i said that my mind was more than half made up returned miles with a smile  now lookee here rejoined the sailor earnestly its all wery well for milksops an nincompoops and landlubbers to go in for halfanhalf work like that but youre not the man i takes you for if you aint game for more than that so i ax you to promise me that youll sign the pledge right off as i did first time you gits the chance  but you forget im only a landlubber who according to you is fit for only halfanhalf measures said miles who not being addicted to much wine felt disinclined to bind himself  no matter returned the sailor with deepening earnestness if you go in fur it youll never repent it  take my word for that  now i ax ye to promise  well i do promisethe very first time i get the chance and that will be tomorrow night for our new parson has started temperance meetings and he is a great teetotaller  an you promise to stick to it added molloy  when i give a promise i always stick to it returned miles gravely  right you are lad  give us your flipper  the foregoing conversation took place at the harbour a little apart from the noisy group of soldiers and sailors who were discussing the circumstances of the recent boatrace  immediately after it molloy returned to his ship in the harbour and our hero to his post in the line of defence  one of those who had been conspicuous that day in arranging and starting the races acting as umpire at the cricket and generally putting heart and spirit into everything by his quiet goodnature and selfdenying activity was the young officer of engineers who has been already mentioned as the manager of the mines that were laid around suakim  poor fellow little did he imagine that that was to be his last day on earth  every morning as before mentioned this young officer went out alone to perform the dangerous work of disconnecting the mines so that the inhabitants of the town might go out and in and move about during the daytime in safety  again a little before sunset every evening he went out and reconnected them so that the enemy could not approach the place without the risk of being blown to pieces  at the same time the gates were closed and no one was allowed to leave or enter the town  on this particular evening the lieutenant went out as usual on his dangerous mission just after six oclock  he had not been long gone when a loud explosion was heard and a cloud of smoke was seen where one of the mines had been laid down  a party at once sallied out and found as they had feared that the brave young fellow had perished  he had been literally blown to pieces his head being found in one place while other portions of his body were scattered around  this melancholy incident cast a gloom over the whole place  the remains of the heroic young engineer were buried next day with military honours the garrison was not however left long in peace to think over his sad fate for the very next night a determined attack was made all along the line  the annoying persistency of these attacks seemed to have stirred the indignation of the general in command for he ordered out a small force of cavalry to carry the war into the enemys country  critics say that this act was ill advised and that the cavalry should not have been despatched without the support of infantry  critics are not always or necessarily right  indeed we may venture to say that they are often wrong  we do not pretend to judge but be this as it may the cavalry was ordered to destroy the village of handoub about fifteen miles inland on the caravan route to berber and to blow up the enemys magazine there  the force consisted of a troop of the 19th hussars and another of egyptian cavalryabout fifty men all toldunder command of captain apthorp  our intemperate friend johnson was one of the little band  he was sober then however as he sat bolt upright on his powerful steed with a very stern and grave visage for he had a strong impression that the duty before them was no childsplay  a four hours ride brought them to the village  the few arabs who dwelt in it fled at once on their approach and in a very short time the place was effectually destroyed along with a large quantity of ammunition  but no sooner had the soldiers finished the work and begun to prepare for their return than they discovered that a large force of the enemy was assembling to cut off their retreat  no time for thought after that  at least six thousand of the foe having heard of the expedition had crept down through the thick bush from the direction of hasheen thirsting for vengeance  two miles on the suakim side of handoub they formed a line and opened fire on the leading cavalry scouts  seeing that the arabs were in such force captain apthorp at once made for their flank in the direction of the seacoast  at full speed with horses fatigued by a fifteen miles journey they had to ride for life it was neck or nothing now  the egyptian cavalry under captain gregorie and accompanied by captain stopford of the grenadier guards and other officers followed closely  as they went along at racing speed with more than a dozen miles of wilderness to traverse and death behind them private king of the hussars fell from his horse wounded  captain gregorie came up with him stopped and took the wounded man up behind him  it was a generous but desperate act for what could be expected of a doubleweighted horse in such a region and with such a race before it  for about half a mile he carried the wounded trooper who then swooned and fell off dragging the captain along with him the freed horse rejoining its troop while the arabs came yelling on not a hundred and fifty yards behind  there would have been but little chance for captain gregorie at that terrible crisis if selfdenying courage equal to his own had not dwelt in the breast of private baker of the hussars  seeing what had occurred this hero coolly rode back took the captain up behind him see frontispiece and regaining his troop enabled the latter to capture and remount his own steed  of course poor kingwhether dead or alive they could not tellhad to be left to his fate  heroism would seem to feed upon itself and multiply for this same private baker soon afterwards saw two more troopers and shouted to a comrade to turn back with him to their rescue  the comrade however did not see his way to do so  perchance he did not hear  anyhow he galloped on but captain gregorie hearing the summons at once answered it turned and galloped back with baker  they were only just in time to take up and rescue the two men  at the same time captain stopford performed a similar gallant act in rescuing a dismounted trooper  it is deeds of selfsacrifice and heroism such as thesenot the storming of a breach or the fighting against overwhelming oddsthat bring out the noblest qualities of our soldiers and arouse the admiration of mankind  the race for life was so close run that when the force at last reached the seashore it was little more than sixty yards in advance of the foe and so exhausted were the horses that eight of them fell and their riders were capturedfour being englishmen and four egyptians  it is right to add that one of the egyptians also displayed conspicuous courage in rescuing a comrade  while these stirring incidents were taking place on the plain miles and some of his comrades were seated on the roof of the redoubt looking out anxiously for the return of the cavalry  at last in the afternoon a cloud of dust was seen on the horizon and the officers who had glasses could soon make out that the men appeared to be racing towards the town at full speed while the enemy on camels and horses and on foot were racing down to the sea to cut off their retreat  no sooner was this understood than our men rose with an uncontrollable burst seized their rifles flung on ammunitionbelts and rushed out to the rescue regardless for the moment of the officers shouting to them to come back the news spread like wildfire and the men ran out just as they were some in white jackets some in red others in blue many in their shirts with their sleeves rolled up cavalry artillery marines infantryall going helterskelter towards the enemy  fortunately they saw from the ships what was going on and quickly got their guns to bear so that the moment our men had escaped clear of the enemy they opened fire  but for this more men would certainly have been lost for the overtaxed horses were beginning to give in and lose ground  had they been a few minutes later in reaching the sea it is probable that not a man of that force would have returned to suakim  as it was the men came in pale and terribly fatigued  the horses could scarcely walk and two of them died on the following day  notesince the foregoing was written we have learned with profound regret that the gallant captain gregorie was killed by his horse falling with him in 1886    chapter sixteen  letters from homeflynn is exalted and brought lowrumours of war in the air  events in life sometimes ripple along like the waters of a little stream in summer  at other times they rush with the wild impetuosity of a hilltorrent in winter  for some time after the incidents just narrated the life of our hero rippledbut of course it must be clearly understood that a suakim ripple bore some resemblance to a respectable freshet elsewhere  osman digna either waited for reinforcements before delivering a grand assault or found sufficient entertainment to his mind and satisfaction to his ambition in acting the part of a mosquito by almost nightly harassment of the garrison which was thus kept continually on the alert  but there came a time at length when a change occurred in the soldierlife at suakim  events began to evolve themselves in rapid succession as well as in magnified intensity until on one particular day there camemetaphorically speakingwhat is known among the scottish hills as a spate  it began with the arrival of a mail from england  this was not indeed a matter of rare occurrence but it was one of those incidents of the campaign which never lost its freshness and always sent a thrill of pleasure to the hearts of the menpowerfully in the case of those who received letters and packets sympathetically in those who got none  at long last exclaimed corporal flynn who was observed by his comrades after the delivery of the mail to be tenderly struggling with the complicated folds of a remarkable letterremarkable for its crookedness size dirt and hieroglyphic superscription  what is it flynn asked mosesone of the unfortunates who had received no letter by that mail  a letter sure  havent ye got eyes moses  from your wife corporal  wife exclaimed flynn with scorn no  its mesilf wouldnt take the gift of a wife gratis  the letter is from me owld grandmother an shes better to me than a dozen wives rowled into wan  its hard work the writin of it cost her toopoor owld sowl  but shed tear her eyes out to plaze me she would  corporal darlintthats always the way she begins her letters now shes that proud o me since i got the stripes  i thowt me mother or brother would have writ me too but theyre not half as proud of me as my  shut up flynn cried one of the men who was trying to decipher a letter the penmanship of which was obviously the work of an unaccustomed hand  howld it upside down sometimes theyre easier to read that waymore sinsiblelike retorted the corporal  blessins on your sweet face exclaimed armstrong looking at a photograph which he had just extracted from his letter  hallo bill that your sweetheart asked sergeant hardy who was busy untying a parcel  ay sweetheart an wife too answered the young soldier with animation  let me see it willie said miles who was also one of the disconsolate nonreceivers disconsolate because he had fully expected a reply to the penitent letter which he had written to his mother  firstrate thats emmy to a tee  a splendid likeness exclaimed miles holding the photograph to the light  arrah then its dead he must be  the extreme perplexity displayed in flynns face as he said this and scratched his head produced a hearty laugh  its no laughin matter boys cried the corporal looking up with an expression so solemn that his comrades almost believed it to be genuine theres my owld uncle macgrath gone to his long home an he was the support o me grandmother  och whatll she do now wid him gone an me away at the wars  wont some other relation look after her flynn suggested moses  other relation exclaimed the corporal ive got no other relations an them that i have are as poor as rats  no uncle macgrath was the only wan wid a kind heart an a big purse  you see boys he was rich for an irishman  he had a grand farm an a beautiful bit o bog  och itll go hard wid  read on flynn and hold your tongue cried one of his comrades praps hes left the old woman a legacy  the corporal did read on and during the perusal of the letter the change in his visage was marvellous exhibiting as it did an almost magical transition from profound woe through abrupt gradations of surprise to intense joy  hooray he shouted leaping up and bestowing a vigorous slap on his thigh  hes gone an left the whole farm an the beautiful bog to me  what hae ye got there sergeant asked saunders refolding the letter he had been quietly perusing without paying any regard to the irishmans good news  a parcel of booklets from the institute answered hardy turning over the leaves of one of the pamphlets  aint it good of em  right you are hardy  the ladies there never forget us said moses pyne  hand em round sergeant  it does a fellows heart good to get a bit o readin in an outotheway place like this  comes like light in a dark place dont it comrade said stevenson the marine who paid them a visit at that moment bringing a letter which had been carried to the wrong quarter by mistake  it was for miles milton  i knowd you expected it an would be awfully disappointed at finding nothing so i brought it over at once  you come like a gleam of sunshine in a dark place  thanks stevenson many thanks said miles springing up and opening the letter eagerly  the first words sent a chill to his heart for it told of his father having been very ill but words of comfort immediately followedhe was getting slowly but surely better and his own letter had done the old man more good in a few days than all the doctors physic had done in many weeks  forgiveness was freely granted and unalterable love breathed in every line  with a relieved and thankful heart he went on reading when he was arrested by a sudden summons of his company to fall in  grasping his rifle he ran out with the rest  what is it he whispered to a sergeant as he took his place in the ranks  osman again  no hes too sly a fox to show face in the daytime  its a steamer coming with troops aboard  were goin down to receive them i believe  soon after the overworked garrison had the immense satisfaction and excitement of bidding welcome to reinforcements with a stirring british cheer  these formed only the advanceguard  for some time after that troops were landed at suakim every day  among them the 15th sikhs a splendid body of men with grand physique and fierce aspect like men who meant business  then came the coldstream guards the scots and the grenadier guards closely followed by the engineers and hospital and transport corps the shropshire regiment and many others  the desire of these fresh troops to meet the enemy was naturally strong and the earnest hope of every one was that they would soon sally forth and have a go as corporal flynn expressed it at osman digna on his own ground  poor corporal flynn  his days of soldiering were nearly over  whether it was the excess of strong feeling raised in the poor fellows breast by the news of the grand and unexpected legacy or the excitement caused by the arrival of so many splendid troops and the prospect of immediate actionor all put togetherwe cannot say but certain it is that the corporal fell sick and when the doctors examined the men with a view to decide who should march to the front and who should remain to guard the town he was pronounced unfit for active service  worse than that he was reported to have entered upon that journey from which no traveller returns  but poor flynn would not admit it though he grew weaker from day to day  at last it was reported that he was dying and sergeant hardy got leave to go off to the hospital ship to see him and convey to him many a kind message from his sorrowful comrades who felt that the regiment could ill spare his lively humorous spirit  the sergeant found him the picture of death and almost too weak to speak  my dear fellow said hardy sitting down by his cot and gently taking his hand im sorry to see you like this  im afraid you are goin to leave us  the corporal made a slight motion with his head as if of dissent and his lips moved  hardy bent his ear over them  niver a bit owld man whispered flynn  shall i read the bible to you lad inquired the sergeant  the corporal smiled faintly and nodded  after reading a few verses hardy began to talk kindly and earnestly to the dying man who lay with his eyes closed  when he was about to leave flynn looked up and giving his comrades hand a gentle squeeze said in a stronger whisper than before  thankee sergeant  its kind o ye to be so consarned about my sowl and i agrees wid ivery word ye say but im not goin away yit av ye plaze  he ceased to speak and again closed his eyes  the doctor and the chaplain chanced to enter the hospital together as hardy retired  the result of their visit was that they said the corporal was dead and orders were given to make his coffin  a firing party was also told off to bury him the next morning with military honours  early next morning accordingly the firing party started for the hospital ship with the coffin but before getting halfway to it they were signalled to go back for the man was not yet dead  in short corporal flynn had begun to talk in a wild way about his estate in ireland and his owld grandmother and either the influence of these thoughts or hardys visit had given him such a fillip that from that day he began to revive  nevertheless he had received a very severe shake and not very long after was invalided home  meanwhile as we have said busy preparations were being made by general grahamwho had arrived and taken command of the forcesto offer battle to osmans troops  in the midst of all the excitement and turmoil however the new chaplain who turned out to be a trump managed to hold a temperance meeting and the men who desired to serve god as well as their queen and country became more energetic than ever in trying to influence their fellows and save themselves from the curse of strong drink which had already played such havoc among the troops at suakim  miles attended the meeting and according to promise signed the totalabstinence pledge  owing to the postponement of meetings and the press of duty he had not been able to do it sooner  shortly after that he was passed by the doctors as fit for duty in the field  so were armstrong moses pyne and most of those strong and healthy men whose fortunes we have followed thus far  then came the bustle and excitement of preparation to go out and attack the enemy and in the midst of it all the air was full of conflicting rumoursto the effect that osman digna was about to surrender unconditionally that he would attack the town in force that he was dead or that he had been summoned to a conference by the mahdi  you may rest assured said sergeant hardy one day to his comrades as they were smoking their pipes after dinner that nobody knows anything at all for certain about the rebel chief  i heard that a spy has just come in with the information that he has determined not to wait for our attack if we go out but to attack us in our zereba said miles  he is evidently resolved not to commit the same mistake he made last year of letting us attack him  he has pluck for anything remarked moses  osman proved that same evening that he had at least pluck enough to send a pithy defiance to his foes for an insulting letter was received by general graham in which osman recounting the victories he had gained over hicks and baker pasha boasted of his having destroyed their armies and dared the general to come out and fight him  to this the british general replied reminding osman of our victories of elteb and tamai and advising him to surrender unless he wanted a worse beating than he had got before  mutual defiance having been thus comfortably hurled the troops were at once detailed for service in the field and the very next day set forth as our hero did not however accompany that expedition and as it returned to suakim without doing anything remarkableexcept some energetic and even heroic fighting which is by no means remarkable in british troopswe will pass on to the expedition which was sent out immediately after it and in which miles milton not only took an active part but distinguished himself  with several of his comrades he also entered on a new and somewhat unusual phase of a soldiers career    chapter seventeen  the expeditionenemy reportedmiles in a dilemma  every one has heard of the expedition sent out under sir john mcneill in which that gallant general and his brave troops fought with indomitable heroism not only against courageous foes but against errors which as a civilian we will not presume to criticise and against local difficulties which were said to be absolutely insurmountable  blame was due somewhere in connection with that expedition  wherever it lay we have a strong convictionfounded on the opinion of one who was presentthat it did not rest with the commander of the force  it is not however our part to comment but to describe those events which bore upon the fortunes of our hero and his immediate friends and comrades  it was about four oclock on an uncommonly hot morning that the bugle sounded in suakim and soon the place was alive with men of all arms devouring a hasty breakfast and mustering eagerly for they were elated at the near prospect of having another slap at osman  strange the unaccountably exultant joy which so many men experience at the prospect of killing each other  no doubt the briton maintains that it is all in defence of queen and country hearth and home  an excellent reason of course  but may not the soudanese claim that the defence of chief and country tent and home is an equally good reason especially when he rises to defend himself from the exactions and cruelty of those superlative tyrants the turks or rather the turkish pashasfor we verily believe that the rank and file of all civilised nations would gladly live at peace if their rulers would deal in arbitration instead of war  we almost feel that an apology is due for introducing such a remark in a book about soldiers for their duty is clear as well as hard and bravely is it done too  moreover they are in no way responsible for the deeds of those    fine old english gentlemen   who sit at home at ease   and send them forth to fight and die   beyond the stormy seas  the troops composing this expedition consisted of one squadron of the 5th lancers one battalion berkshire regiment one battalion of marines one field company royal engineers a detachment of the royal navy in charge of four gardner guns a regiment of sikhs bengal native infantry bombay native infantry and a body of madras sappers  along with these was sent an immense convoy of 1500 camels besides a large number of mules with carts bearing iron watertanks  the orders for the expedition were that they should proceed eight miles into the bush and there make three zerebas or defensive enclosures of bushes capable of sheltering the entire force  the march was begun by mcneill moving off with his european troops in square formation  the indian contingent under general hudson followed also in square and in charge of the transport  a goodly force remarked armstrong in a low tone to miles as they stepped off shoulder to shoulder for being both about the same size and unusually tall they marched together on the right flank of their company  dont speak in the ranks willie returned miles with a slight smile for he could not shut his eyes to the fact that this strict regard for orders was due more to marion drews remarks about a soldiers duty than to principle  hm grunted robert macleod who marched next to them and had no conscientious scruples about talking we may mairch oot smert eneugh but some o usll no come back sae hearty  some of us will never come back at all replied armstrong gravely  by six oclock the rearguard had left suakim and the whole of the force moved across the plain in parts of which the men and carts sank deep in the soft sand while in other parts the formations were partly broken by thick bush in which the force became somewhat entangled  the cavalry went in advance as scouts  the guns watercarts and ammunitionwagons were in the centre and the indian brigade came last surrounding the unwieldy mass of baggageanimals  last of all came the telegraph detachment unrolling as they went the wire that kept open communication with headquarters  that a mistake had been made somewhere was obvious but as the soul of military discipline is obedience without question the gallant leader pressed forward silently and steadily whatever he may have thought  soon the force became so hopelessly entangled in the difficulties of the way that the rate of advance dwindled down to little more than one mile an hour  not long after starting a trooper was seen galloping back and miles who marched at the right corner of his square observed that it was his friend johnson looking very stern indeed  their eyes met  not half enough of cavalry he growled as he flew past to report the enemy in sightretiring in small parties in the direction of tamai  in returning johnson again rode close past the same corner of the square and bending low in his saddle for a moment said to miles i have signed the pledge my boy  a slight laugh from several of those who heard him greeted the information but he probably did not hear it for next moment his charger cleared a low bush in a magnificent stride and in a few seconds man and horse were lost to sight in the bush  more need to sign his will remarked simkin in a somewhat cynical tone  he has done that too said armstrong  i heard him say so before we started  the troops were halted to enable the two generals to consult at this point  while the men stood at ease enjoying the brief rest from severe toil under such a burning sun our hero heard a low voice at his elbow say  have you signed your will john miles  it was a startling as well as a sudden question  miles turned quickly and found that it was captain lacey who had put it  the feeling of dislike with which our young soldier had regarded the captain ever since his interruption of the conversation between himself and marion on board ship had abated but had not by any means disappeared  he had too much sense however to allow the state of his feelings to influence his looks or bearing  yes sir he replied i made it out last night as you advised me in the service form  it was witnessed by our colonel and captain smart and the doctor  to say truth i thought it absurd for a man who has nothing to leave to make his will but as you said sir i should like my dear mother to get my kit and any arrears of pay that may be due to me after im gone  i did not mean you to take such a gloomy view of your prospects said captain lacey with a laugh  but you know in our profession we always carry our lives in our hands and it would be foolish not to take ordinary precautions  the order to resume the march here cut short the conversation and the force continued its slow and all but impossible advance  indeed it was soon seen that to reach the distance of eight miles out in the circumstances was quite beyond the power of the troops willing anxious and vigorous though they were for the bush became closer and higher as they advanced so that a mounted man could not see over it and so dense that the squares though only a short distance apart could not see each other  this state of things rendered the management of the baggageanimals extremely difficult for mules are proverbially intractable and camelsso meek in picturesare perhaps the most snarling biting kicking illtempered animals in the world  the day was advancing and the heat increasing while the dust raised by the passage of such a host caused so much distress to man and beast that the general began to fear that if an attack should be made by the enemy at that time the greater part of the transport would have to be sacrificed  the force was therefore halted a second time and the generals again met to consult  they were very unwilling to give in  another effort to advance was made but things grew worse and worse  the day as moses remarked was boiling redhot  the carts with the heavy watertanks sank deep in the soft sand many of the camels loads fell off and these had to be replaced  replacing a camels load implies prevailing on a hideously tall and horribly stubborn creature to kneel and this in the centre of a square which was already blocked up with carts and animals as well as shouting angry and exhausted drivers  at last it became evident that further progress that day was out of the question  the rear face of hudsons square was obliterated by the straggling and struggling multitude camels and loads were down in all directions and despair of maintaining their formation was settling down on all ranks  in these circumstances it became absolutely necessary to halt and form their zerebas where they stoodand that without delay  the best place they could find was selected  the european square formed a guard while the rest threw off jackets and with axes and choppers went to work with a will  some cut down bushes some filled sandbags to form a breastwork for guns and ammunition and others erected the bushy walls of their woodland fortification  the lancers covered about three miles of country as scouts  hudsonwho had to return to suakim that night before darkwas ordered with three regiments in line and advanced files to cover mcneill and the workingparty while the commander himself went about encouraging the tired men and urging them to increased exertion  while the soldiers of all arms were thus busily engaged a body of sailors was ordered to run one of their gardner guns up to the corner of the square where miles and armstrong stood  they halted close to them and then miles became aware that one of the nautical gunners was no other than jack molloy  hallo jack  why youve got a knack of turning up unexpectedly everywhere he exclaimed when his friend was at leisure  thats wery much your own case retorted the seaman heartily  what brought you here  miles slapped one of his legs by way of indicating the mode of conveyance  ay lad and theyd need to be stout timbers too to make headway through such a sea of sand returned molloy feeling his own limbs with tenderness  dee think were in for a brush tonight lad  before the latter could reply an aidedecamp ran up and spoke a few hurried words to captain lacey who turned to his company and called them to attention  fours rightquick march he said and away they went past the flank of hudsons men to guard a hollow which left that part of the square somewhat exposed  when halted and drawn up in line several files were thrown out in advance  miles and sutherland formed the flanking file on the right the latter being rearrank man to the former  its a grand hidinghole observed sutherland as he peered cautiously over the edge of a low bank into a hollow where rocks and undergrowth were thickly intermingled  keep a sharp lookout on your left sutherland said miles i will guard the right  he stopped abruptly and threw forward his rifle for at that moment he observed a swarthy blackbearded arab of large proportions and muscular frame creeping forward a short distance below him  evidently he had not heard or seen the approach of the two soldiers for he was gazing in a different direction from them  miles raised his rifle and took aim at the man but he felt an unconquerable repugnance to shoot  he had never yet met the enemy handtohand  his experience heretofore had been confined to longrange firing at men who were firing at himself and his comrades and in which of course he could not be sure that his bullets took effect  but now he was within fifty yards of a splendidlooking man who did not see him who was at the moment innocent of any intention of injuring him and whose expressive sideface he could clearly distinguish as he crept along with great caution towards a rock which hid the zereba of the europeans from his view  miles was a good rifleshot  a touch of the trigger he knew would be certain death to the arab  i cannot do it he muttered as he lowered his weapon and looked back over his shoulder at his comrade  the scot who was something of a naturalist was engrossed at the moment in the contemplation of a little bird which was twittering on a twig in quite an opposite direction  miles glanced again at the arab in a flutter of agitation as to what was his duty  the man might be one of the friendly natives  he could not tell  at that moment another man appeared on the scene  he was a thin but powerful native and armed with a short spear such as is used when fighting at close quarters  he obviously was not troubled with scruples about committing murder and miles soon became aware that the thin man was stalking the big arabwith what intent of course our soldier could only guess but the malignant expression of the savages countenance left little doubt on that point  here was a complication  our hero was on the point of calling sutherland from the contemplation of his little bird when he saw the thin native pounce on the arab who was still creeping on hands and knees  he turned just in time to divert the first spearthrust but not in time to draw his own long knife from its sheath as he fell  the thin savage holding him down and having him at terrible disadvantage on his back raised his spear and was about to repeat the deadly thrust when miles fired and shot him in the head  the arab rose shook himself clear of the dying man and with astounding coolness walked calmly towards a large rock though miles was reloading in haste and sutherland was taking steady aim at him  he looked at the soldiers and held up his hand with something like a smile of remonstrance as sutherland pulled the trigger  at the same moment miles struck up the muzzle and the ball whizzed over the arabs head as he passed behind the rock and disappeared  what for did ye that demanded the scot fiercely  would you kill a man that was smiling at you retorted miles  the two men ran back to report to their company what they had seen  at the same moment the company being recalled doubled back to its position in the square  here they found the defence work so far advanced that the generals were beginning to feel some confidence in their being able to repel any attack  at the same time the men were working with tremendous energy for news had just come in that the enemy was advancing in strong force    chapter eighteen  wherein are described an assault a furious fight and some strange personal encounters  it was nearly two oclock in the afternoon when captain lacey and his company resumed their place in the square  about that time an officer of the berkshire regiment represented the condition of his men as requiring attention  they certainly did require it for they had been without food since four oclock that morning and were consequently in urgent need of provender as well as rest and waterthe last having been all consumed  as it was imperative that the work should go on it was found necessary to serve out food by wings  accordingly the men of one halfbattalion received rations and water and were then sent to their zereba with the gardner guns while the other half still lying in reserve by their piled arms received their rations  the marines also sat down for brief rest and refreshment  among them was our sedate friend stevenson who invariably carried his small bible with him in all his campaigns  after quickly consuming his allowance and while waiting for water he sat down to read a few verses of the 23rd psalmfor stevenson was one of those quiet fearless men who cannot be laughed out of doing right and who have no fear of the face of man whether scowling in anger or sneering in contempt  hallo tom said a lighthearted comrade near him this is a queer time to be readin your bible  well be havin you sayin your prayers next  ive said them already fred replied the marine replacing the book in his pouch  as you say it is a queer time to be readin the word but not an unsuitable time for this may be the last chance that you and i will ever have of readin it  our next orders may be to meet god face to face  stevenson was yet speaking when a lancer was seen approaching at a wild gallop  he dashed up to the generals and informed them that the enemy was gathering in front  the message was barely delivered when another lancer rode up and reported the enemy close at hand  the order stand to your arms was promptly given and as promptly obeyed without flurry or disorder  next minute a wild uproar was heard and the lancers were seen galloping towards the square with thousands of the swarthy warriors of the desert at their heelsnay even mixed up with them  on they came a dark frantic yelling host with irresistible fury and perchance patriotism  shall we deny to those men what we claim for ourselveslove of hearth and home of country of freedom  can we not sympathise with men who groaned under an insolent and tyrannical yoke and who failing to understand or appreciate the purity of the motives by which we british were actuated could see nothing in us except the supporters of their enemies  they hurled themselves on that part of the large zereba which was defended by the bengal native infantry  these fired a volley but failed to check the impetuous rush  everything went down before the savages and the native infantry broke and fled throwing into dire confusion the transport animals which stood in their immediate rear  general mcneill himself dashed in among the panicstricken men and sought to arrest them  he succeeded for a time in rallying some of them in number 1 zereba but another rush of the arabs sent them flying a second time and some of the enemy got into the square it is said to the number of 112  the berkshire men however stood fast and not a soul who got into that square ever got out of it alive  in this wretched affair the 17th bengal native infantry lost their brave commander  he was killed while trying to rally them  the confusion was now increased by the enemy driving the baggageanimals hither and thither especially on to another halfbattalion square of the berkshire regiment  here however they were effectually checked as the atlantic billows burst in impotent turmoil on the cliffs of cornwall so the enemy fell upon and were hurled back by the steadfast berkshire regiment which scarcely lost a man while over two hundred of their opponents lay dead around them  the bombay regiment also stood fast and redeemed to some extent the credit of their country while the sikhs as might have been expected of them never flinched for a moment but strewed the plain around them with dead and dying men  there was horrible carnage for some timeunflinching valour being opposed to desperate courage and while a burning sense of injury with a resolve to conquer or die was the motive power no doubt on one side on the other there was the high sense of duty to queen and country and the pride of historical renown  owing to the suddenness of the attack and the occupation of the troops at the moment there was some mixing up of men of different regiments one company of sikhs who were helping to unload the camels when the fight began having been prevented from joining their own regiment cast in their lot with the marines  the better to help their european comrades these vigorous fellows leaped outside the zereba and lay down in front of it and the two bodies together gave the charging foe such a warm reception that they never got within twenty yards of them  but there was a fearful scene of butchery among the baggageanimals and many unequal handtohand conflicts  there was terrible slaughter also among the working parties that had gone out to cut bushes with which to finish the zerebas with coats off and away from their arms  some individuals of the marines who as a body suffered severely were surrounded by a dozen arabs and their bodies were afterwards found covered with spearwounds  this was the case with a sergeant named mitchel who had charge of a woodcutting party and had been quietly chatting with our friend stevenson just before the attack  another case was that of private stanton who had been through the egyptian campaign of 1882 had fought at kassassin telelkebir elteb and tamai  when this expedition of which we write was arranged he was one of the first to volunteer  he chanced to be outside the zereba when the attack was made and failed to appear at muster  next day he was found dead with many spearwounds at some distance from the force  poor fellow he had not been killed outright and had attempted to crawl towards the zerebas but in his confusion had crept away in the wrong direction and had slowly bled to death on the sands of the desert  during the rapid progress of this terrible scene of bloodshed miles and his friend armstrong stood and fought shoulder to shoulder in the front rank at their allotted corner of the squarechiefly with bullet but also on several occasions with bayonet when the rush of the enemy threatened to break through all barriers and drive in the line of defenders  they would certainly have succeeded had these defenders been less powerful and resolute  well done exclaimed a deep bass voice in evident enthusiasm close to miles  the latter glanced round  it was the voice of his friend jack molloy who helped to work the gardner gun and who was at the moment admiring the daring act of an officer of sikhs  two men of the berkshire regiment who had been employed outside the zereba were pursued by several arabs and it was evident that their death was almost certain when the sikh officer referred to rushed out to the rescue sprang between the men and their pursuers killed three of the latter in succession with three rapid swordcuts and enabled the soldiers to escape besides which he checked the rush at that part of the square and returned to his post in safety  the cheer of the berkshire men and others who witnessed this feat was heard to rise above even the yells of combatants the shrieks of the wounded the rattle and crash of firearms and the general turmoil and din of war  in one of the working parties that were out when the assault began was our friend moses pyne and his comrade rattling bill simkin  these had been separated from the rest of their party when the first wild rush was made by the foe  the formation of the ground favoured their dropping into a place of concealment thus for the moment saving them from the fate of being surrounded and cut to pieces like too many of their straggling comrades  for a few seconds they lay close while the enemy rushed past like a torrent to the assault just described  then moses uprose with an expression of stern resolve on his usually meek countenance  simkin he said as his comrade also got up im not goin to lie hidin here while our boys are engaged wi the savages  no more am i moses returned rattling bill with something of the jovially reckless air still lingering on his solemnised visage  but weve not much chance of getting back to the zerebas without arms  what dee call that asked moses holding out his chopper  a very good weapon to fight the bush with answered simkin but not worth much against arab spears  however comrade choppers are all we have got so we must make the most of em  they say a good workman can work with any tools  what dee propose to try  ill put myself under your orders moses for although you are a meekish sort of a fellow i really believe you have a better headpiece than most of us  i propose that we simply go at em said moses  take em in rear cut our way through and get into the zerebathats all  it dont take much of a headpiece to think that out  go ahead then  ill back you said rattling bill without the least touch of bravado as he bared his right arm to the shoulder  both men were in shirts and trousers with sleeves tucked up and their brawny arms exposedarabesquely brown up to the elbow and infantinely white above that  the intended rush might have been successful but for a change in the tactics of the enemy  seeing that they were severely repulsed at the corner of the square where molloy and his tars worked the gardner gun while miles and his comrades plied bullet and bayonet the arab chief sent a body of his followers to reinforce this point  it was just at the moment that moses and simkin made the dash from their place of concealment so that they actually leaped without having intended it into the very midst of the reinforcements  two of the arabs went down before the choppers instantly and the othersalmost panicstricken by the suddenness and severity of the assaultturned to fly supposing no doubt that an ambush had caught them  but seeing only two men they ran back and would certainly have made short work of them if rescuers had not come up  and at this point in the fight there was exhibited a curious instance of the power of friendship to render steady men reckless  the incident we have just described was witnessed by the troops for the moment the two soldiers left their place of concealment they were in full view of the large zereba  thats moses exclaimed armstrong excitedly  without a moments hesitation he sprang over the defenceworks and ran to the rescue clubbing his rifle as he went and felling two arabs therewith  you shant die alone willie muttered our hero as he also leaped the fence and followed his friend just in time to save him from three arabs who made at him simultaneously  two of these miles knocked down his comrade felled the other  then they turned back to back moses and simkin did the same and thus formed a little impromptu rallying square  this delayed the catastrophe which seemed however inevitable  the brave little quartette being surrounded by foes could do nothing but parry with almost lightning speed the spearthrusts that were made at them continually  seeing this the heart of jack molloy bounded within him and friendship for the moment overcame the sense of duty  you can only die once jack he exclaimed drew his cutlass leaped out of the zereba and went at the foe with a thunderous roar which for a moment actually made them quail  infected with a similar spirit stevenson the marine also lost his head if we may say so  resolving to run amuck for friendships sake he followed the sailor and increased the rallying square to five while molloy skirmished round it parrying spearthrusts at once with left arm and cutlass in quite a miraculous manner roaring all the time like an infuriated lion and causing the enemy to give back in horror wherever he made a rush  a root however tripped him up at last and he fell forward headlong to the ground  a dozen spears were pointed at his broad back when a tall majestic arab sprang forward and held up one hand while with the other he waved a sword  at that moment a strong force of the enemy came down with an impetuous rush on that corner of the zereba and coming between it and the little knot of combatants hid them from view  the attack at this point was very determined and for a few moments the issue seemed doubtful for although the enemy fell in heaps they came on in such numbers that the defenders were almost overwhelmed  steadiness however combined with indomitable courage prevailed  everywhere they were repulsed with tremendous loss  many instances of personal bravery occurred of course besides those we have described but we may not pause to enumerate these  tenacity of life also was curiously exhibited in the case of some of the desperately wounded  one man in charge of two mules outside the zereba was trying to bring them in when he was attacked and received three terrible spearwounds in the back and one in the arm which cut all the muscles and sinews yet this man ultimately recovered though of course with the loss of his arm  another man lost a leg and an arm and was badly wounded in the other leg and in the hand and lastly he was shot in the jaw  after being operated on and having his wounds dressed the doctor asked him how he felt  all right sir he answered  theyve crippled me in arms and legs and theyve broke my jaw but thank god they have not broke my heart yet  it was eight minutes to three when the arabs made their first rush and it was just ten minutes past three when the enemy was finally repelled and the bugle sounded cease firing  yet into these pregnant eighteen minutes all that we have described and a vast deal more was crowded nearly four hundred of our men were killed and wounded while the enemy it is believed lost over two thousand  it is said by those who were present at the engagement that the officers of the 17th bengal infantry were heard to say that if their men had not given way there would have been no disaster at all and general mcneill instead of being accused of permitting himself to be surprised would have got credit for a heroic defence against overwhelming odds if he had carried out his instructions and pressed on to the end of eight miles instead of prudently halting when he did there can be no doubt that the force would have been surprised and absolutely cut to pieces    chapter nineteen  refers to sergeant hardy amytoorlawyer sutherland and other matters  among the wounded in the great fight which we have just described was hardy the sergeant  his position at the time the arabs broke into the square was close to the right flank of the indian native regiment which gave way so that it was he and a number of the flank men of his company who had to do most of the handtohand fighting necessary to repair the disaster and drive back the enemy  of course every soldier engaged in that part of the fight was for a time almost overwhelmed in the confusion and many of them were surrounded and severely wounded  when the native infantry broke hardys captain sprang to the front sword in hand and cut down two of the foe  as he did so he was for a moment separated from his company and surrounded  a powerful arab was on the point of thrusting his spear into the captains back when hardy observed his danger bayoneted the arab and saved the officer  but it was almost at the cost of his own life for another arab with whom he had been fighting at the moment took advantage of the opportunity to thrust his spear into the chest of the sergeant who fell as was thought mortally wounded  this however was not the case for when the fight was over his wound although dangerous was not supposed to be fatal and he went into hospital on returning to suakim  he was a blue light and his temperance habits told in his favour  so did his religion for the calm equanimity with which he submitted to the will of god and bore his sufferings went far to assist the doctor in grappling with his wound but his religion did more than that for when he thought of the heaven that awaited him if he should die and of being for ever with the lord his heart was filled with joy and joy not only does not killit is absolutely a source of life  in the sergeants case it formed an important factor in restoring him to partial health  one evening some time after the battle of mcneills zereba sutherland and gaspard redgrave were seated beside the sergeants bedcheering him up a bit as they saidand chatting about the details of the recent fight  once or twice the sergeant had tried to lead the conversation to religious subjects but without success for neither sutherland nor gaspard were seriously disposed and both fought shy of such matters  well its very kind of you to come an cheer me up lads said hardy at last and i hope i may live to do the same for you if either of you ever gets knocked over  now i want each of you to do me a favour will you promise  of course we will said gaspard quickly  if we can said the more cautious scot  well then gaspard will you sing me a song  i think it would do me good  with the greatest pleasure answered the soldier but he added looking round doubtfully i dont know how they might like it here  theyll not object besides you can sing low  youve got the knack of singin softbetter than any man i ever heard  well what shall it be returned the gratified gaspard  one of sankeys hymns said the sergeant with the remotest semblance of a twinkle in his eye as he took a small hymnbook from under his pillow and gave it to his friend  gaspard did not seem to relish the idea of singing hymns but he had often heard the blue lights sing them and could not plead ignorance of the tunes besides being a man of his word he would not refuse to fulfil his promise  sing number 68 shall we gather at the river  im very fond of that hymn  in a sweet soft mellow voice that charmed all who were within hearing gaspard began the hymn and when he had finished there was heard more than one amen and thank god from the neighbouring beds  yes comrades we shall gather there said the sergeant after a brief pause for the same almighty saviour who saved me died for you as well  i aint used to wettin my cheeks as you know lads but i spose my wound has weakened me a bit  now sutherland the favour i have to ask of  if yere thinkin o askin me to pray broke in the alarmed scotsman ye may save your breath  when i promised i said if i can  noo i can not pray an its nae use askin me to try  whatever i may come to in this warld ill no be a heepycrit for ony leevin man  quite right sutherlandquite right  i had no intention of asking you to pray replied hardy with a faint smile  what i want you to do is to draw out my will for me  oh  im quite willin to do that returned the relieved scot  you see continued the sergeant one never knows what may be the result of a bad wound in a climate like this and if it pleases my father in heaven to call me home i should like the few trifles i possess to go in the right direction  thats a wiselike sentiment returned his friend with an approving nod and thoughtful frown  now as you write a capital hand and know how to express yourself on paper continued hardy it strikes me that you will do the job better than any one else and being a friend i feel that i can talk freely to you on my private affairs  so youll help me  im wullin to try serjint and ac the legal adviseramytoorlike ye ken  thank you  can you come tomorrow morning  no serjint i canna because ive to start airly the morns mornin wi a pairty to meet the scots gairds comin back frae tamai but the moment i come back ill come to ye  that will dothank you  and now gaspard whats the news from england  i hear that a mail has just come in  news that will make your blood boil said gaspard sternly  it would take a good deal of powerful news to boil the little blood that is left in me said hardy languidly  well i dont know  anyhow it makes mine boil  what dyou think of mcneills brave defence being represented in the papers as a disaster  you dont mean that  indeed i do  they say that it was a disaster whereas it was a splendid defence under singularly adverse circumstances  they say that general mcneill permitted himself to be surprised  if he had tried to carry out his instructions to the full extent it would indeed have been such a surprise that the surprising thing would have been if a single man of us had returned alive to tell the taleas you and i know full well  the truth is it was the fault of the intelligence department that nearly wrecked us and it was mcneills prudence and our pluck that saved us and yet these quilldrivers at homebah  the soldier rose in hot indignation and strode from the room  hes a wee thing roosed remarked sutherland with a goodhumoured yet slightly cynical grin  but guidnicht to ye ma man  keep up hert an ill come an draft yer wull i the mornin  so saying the amytoor lawyer took his departure and was soon tramping over the desert sands with a band of his comrades  they were not however permitted to tramp in peace for their indefatigable foe hung on their skirts and annoyed them the greater part of the way  toward evening they met the guards and as it was too late to return to suakim the force bivouacked in mcneills deserted zereba surrounded by graves and scarcely buried corpses  only those who were there can fully understand what that meant  all round the zereba and for three miles on the suakim side of it the ground was strewn thickly with the graves of europeans indians and arabs and so shallow were these that from each of them there oozed a dark dreadful stain  to add to the horrors of the scene portions of mangled and putrefying corpses protruded from many of themghastly skulls from the sockets of which the eyes had been picked by vultures and other obscene birds  limbs of brave men upon which the hyena had already begun his dreadful work and halfskeleton hands with fingers spread and bent as if still clutching the foe in deathagony protruded above the surface mixed with these and unburied were the putrefying carcases of camels and mulesthe whole filling the air with a horrible stench and the soul with a fearful loathing which ordinary language is powerless to describe and the inexperienced imagination cannot conceive  oh it is terrible to think that from the fall till now man has gone on continually producing and reproducing scenes like thissometimes no doubt unavoidably but often too often because of some trifling error or insult on the part of statesmen or some paltry dispute about a boundary or not infrequently on grounds so shadowy and complex that succeeding historians have found it almost impossible to convey the meaning thereof to the intellects of average men  amid these dreadful memorials of the recent fight the party bivouacked  next day the troops returned to suakim and sutherland after breakfast and what he called a washup went to see his friend sergeant hardy with pen ink and paper  weel serjint hoo are ye the day  pretty well thank youpretty well  ah  sutherland i have been thinking what an important thing it is for men to come to jesus for salvation while in their health and strength for now instead of being anxious about my soul as so many are when the end approaches i am rejoicing in the thought of soon meeting godmy father  sutherland my good fellow it is foolish as well as wrong to think only of this life of all men in the world we soldiers ought to know this  the sergeant spoke so earnestly and his eyes withal looked so solemnly from their sunken sockets that his friend could not help being impressed  i believe yere no far wrang serjint an i tak shame to mysel that ive been sic a harumscarum sinner up to this time  sutherland said this with a look so honest that hardy was moved to put out his large wasted hand and grasp that of his friend  comrade he said god is waiting to be gracious  jesus is ever ready and willing to save  sutherland returned the pressure but made no reply and hardy praying for a blessing on the little that had been said changed the subject by saying  you have brought paper and ink i see  ay but man ye mauna be speakin o takin yer depairture yet  this draftin o yer wull is only a precaution  quite right lad  i mean it only as a precaution returned hardy in a cheerful tone  but you seem to have caught a coldeh  what makes you cough and clear your throat so  a cauld  i wush it was only a cauld  man its the stink o thae corps that i canna get oot o my nose an thrapple  hereupon sutherland by way of entertaining his invalid friend launched out into a graphic account of the scene he had so recently witnessed at mcneills zereba  when that subject was exhausted he arranged his writing materials and began with all the solemnity of a lawyer  noo serjeant what div ye want me to pit doon  well i must explain first that i have very little to leave and no one to leave it to  what  nae friens ava  not one  i have neither wife nor child brother nor sister  i have indeed one old cousin but he is rich and would not be benefited by my poor little possessions besides hes a crossgrained old fellow and does not deserve anything even though i had something worth leaving however i bear him no illwill poor man only i dont want what i do leave to go to him which it would if i were to die without a will because of course he is my natural heir and  haud ye there man said the scot abruptly but slowly  if hes your naitral heir yere his naitral heir tae ye ken  of course i am aware of that returned the sergeant with an amused look but the old man is eccentric and has always boasted that he means to leave his wealth to some charity  indeed i know that he has already made his will leaving his money to build an hospitalfor incurables of some sort i believe  ma certy  if i was his lawyer said sutherland with ineffable scorn i wad advise him to erec an hospital in his lifetime for incurable eediots an to gang in himsel as the first patient  but come awa wi yer wull serjint  get ready then my lawyer and see that you put it down all shipshape as poor molloy would have said  oh ye needna fear said the scot im no sic an ass as to trust to my ain legal knowledge  but jist you say what ye want an ill pit it doon and then write it into a form in the reglar way  after mentioning a few trifling legacies to various comrades hardy said that he had managed to save a hundred pounds during his career which he wished to divide between his two comrades john miles and willie armstrong for whom he expressed strong regard  sutherland instead of noting this down looked at his friend in sad surprise thinking that weakness had caused his mind to wander  ye forget serjint he said softly that miles an airmstrang are baith deed  no lad no one can say they are certainly dead  aweelwe canna exactly say it but when ye consider o the born deevils that have gotten haud o them we are entitled to think them deed ony way  they are reported as missing that is all and that is enough for me you write down what i tell you lad  now have you got it down  ay fifty to each  there may be some interest due on the account said the sergeant thoughtfully besides there may be a few things in my kit that i have forgottenand its not worth while dividing such trifles between them  weel weel yeve only to mak yin o them yer residooary legitee an thatll pit it a richt  true my lawyer  let it be so said hardy with a short laugh at the thought of making so much ado about nothing  make miles my residuary legatee  and now be off draw it out fair an leave me to rest for im a trifle tired after all this legal work  the will thus carefully considered was duly made out signed and witnessed after which sergeant hardy awaited with cheerful resignation whatever fate should be appointed to him  his strong frame and constitution undamaged by youthful excess fought a vigorous battle for life and he began slowly to mend but the climate of suakim was so bad for him that he was finally sent down to the hospital at alexandria where under much more favourable circumstances he began to recover rapidly  one of the nurses there was very kind to him  finding that the sergeant was an earnest christian she had many interesting talks with him on the subject nearest his heart  one day she said to him with unusual animation  the doctor says you may go down to the soldiers institute that has recently been set up here and stay for some time to recruit  it is not intended for invalids you know but the ladies in charge are intimate friends of mine and have agreed to let you have a room  the institute stands on a very pleasant part of the shore exposed to the fresh seabreezes and there are lots of books and newspapers and games as well as lectures concerts prayermeetings biblereadings and  ay just like miss robinsons institute at portsmouth interrupted hardy  i know the sort o thing well  the alexandrian soldiers institute is also miss robinsons returned the nurse with a pleased look so if you know the one at portsmouth there is no need for my describing the other to you  the change will do you more good in a week than months at this place  and ill come to see you frequently  there is a widow lady staying there just now to whom i will introduce you  she has been helping us to nurse here for she has great regard for soldiers but her health having brokendown somewhat she has transferred her services to the institute for a time  she is the widow of a clergyman who came out here not long ago and died suddenly  you will find her a very sympathetic soul    chapter twenty  old friends in new aspects  on the evening of the third day after the conversation narrated in the last chapter sergeant hardy sat in an easychair on the verandah of the soldiers institute at alexandria in the enjoyment of a refreshing breeze which after ruffling the blue waters of the mediterranean came like a cool hand on a hot brow to bless for a short time the land of egypt  like one of aladdins palaces the institute had sprung upnot exactly in a night but in a marvellously short space of time  there was more of interest about it too than about the aladdin buildings for whereas the latter were evolved magically out of that mysterious and undefinable region termed nowhere the miss robinson edifice came direct from smoky romantic london without the advantage of supernatural assistance  when miss robinsons soldier friends were leaving for the seat of war in egypt some of them had said to her three thousand miles from home are three thousand good reasons why you should think of us  the soldiers friend took these words to heartalso to god  she did think of them and she persuaded other friends to think of them to such good purpose that she soon found herself in possession of funds sufficient to begin the work  as we have seen her energetic servant and fellowworker mr thomas tufnell was sent out to egypt to select a site for the building  the old iron and wood oratory at brompton was bought and sent out at government expensea fact which speaks volumes for the government opinion of the value of miss robinsons work among soldiers  in putting up the old oratory tufnell had transformed it to an extent that might almost have made aladdins slave of the lamp jealous certainly those who were wont to orate in the building when it stood in brompton would have failed to recognise the edifice as it arose in egypt on the boulevard ramleh between the grand square of alexandria and the sea  the nave of the old oratory had been converted into a room ninetynine feet long with couches and tables running down both sides a billiardtable in the centre writing materials in abundance and pictures on the walls  at one end of the room stood a pianoforte couches and easychairs and a door opened into a garden facing the sea  over the door were arranged several flags and above these in large letters the appropriate words in the name of the lord will we set up our banners  at the other end was a temperance refreshment bar on a verandah facing the sea men could repose on easychairs and smoke their pipes or cigars while contemplating the peculiarities of an eastern climate  it was here that our friend sergeant hardy was enjoying that blessed state of convalescence which may be described as gazing straight forward and thinking of nothing  of course there were all the other appliances of a wellequipped institutesuch as sleepingcabins managers room bibleclass room lavatory and all the rest of it while a handsome new stone building close beside it contained sittingrooms bedrooms clubroom for officers kitchens and by no means least though last a large lecturehall  but to these and many other things we must not devote too much space for old friends in new aspects claim our attention  only in passing from such details it may not be out of place to say that it has been remarked that the sight of miss robinsons buildings steadily rising from the midst of acres of ruins while mens minds were agitated by the bombardment and its results produced a sense of security which had a most beneficial and quietening effect on the town  indeed one officer of high rank went so far as to say that the institute scheme had given the inhabitants more confidence in the intentions of england than anything yet done or promised by government  in a rockingchair beside the sergeant reclined a shadow in loose remarkably loosefitting soldiers costume  what a blessed place to sit in and rest after the toils and sufferings of war said hardy to the shadow and how thankful i am to god for bringing me here  its a hivenly place intirely responded the shadow an tis mesilf as is thankful toowhats left o me anyhow an thats not much  sure ive had some quare thoughts in me mind since i come here  wan o them waswhat is the smallest amount o skin an bone thats capable of howldin a thankful spirit  i never studied algebra flynn so its of no use puttin the question to me said hardy besides im not well enough yet to tackle difficult questions but im real glad to see you my boy though there is so little of you to see  thats it sarjint thats just where it lies returned flynn in a slow weak voice  ive bin occupied wi that question toonamely how thin may a man git widout losin the power to howld up his cloes  you neednt be uneasy on that score said hardy casting an amused glance at his companion for theres plenty o flesh left yet to keep ye goin till you get to old ireland  it rejoices my heart to see you beside me thin though you are for the report up country was that you had died on the way to suez  bad luck to their reports  thats always the way of it  i do think the best way to take reports is to belaive the exact opposite o whats towld ye an so yell come nearest the truth  its thrue i had a close shave  wan day i felt a sort o lighthiddednessas if i was a kind o livin balloonand was floatin away whin the doctor came an looked at me  hes gone says he  thats a lie says i with more truth than purliteness maybe  an would ye belave iti began to mind from that hour  it was the doctor saved me widout intindin togood luck to him  anyhow he kep me from slippin my cable that time but it was the good nursin as brought me backmy blissin on the dear ladies as give their hearts to this work all for love  by the way continued flynn coughing and looking very stern for he was ashamed of a tear or two which would rise and almost overflow in spite of his efforts to restrain thembut then you see he was very weak  by the way he said youll niver guess who wan o the nurses is  who dee thinkguess  i never could guess right flynn  try  well little mrs armstrong  nonsense man  why shes nursin her old father in england i spose  miss robinson then  hm  you might as well say the prime minister  how dee spose the portsmuth institute could git along widout her  no its our friend mrs drew  what  the wife o the reverend gentleman as came out with us in the troopship  that samethough shes no longer the wife of the riverend gintleman for hes deadgood man said flynn in a sad voice  im grieved to hear that for he was a good man  and the pretty daughter what of her  thats more nor i can tell ye boy  sometimes her mother brings her to the hospital to let her see how they manage but i fancy she thinks her too young yet to go in for sitch work by hersilf  anyhow ive seen her only now an then but the poor widdy comes riglarthough i do belave she does it widout pay  the husband died of a flyer caught in the hospital a good while since  they say that lots o young fellows are afther the daughter for though the drews are as poor as church rats shes got such a swate purty face and such innocent ways wid her that id try for her mesilf av it wasnt that ive swore niver to forsake me owld grandmother  chatting thus about times past and present while they watched the soldiers and seamen who passed continuously in and out of the instituteintent on a game or some nonintoxicant refreshment or a lounge a look at the papers a confab with a comrade or a bit of readingthe two invalids enjoyed their rest to the full and frequently blessed the lady who provided such a retreat as well as her warmhearted assistants who for the love of christ and human souls had devoted themselves to carry on the work in that faroff land  i often think said hardy  but what he thought was never revealed for at that moment two ladies in deep mourning approached whom the sergeant recognised at a glance as mrs drew and her daughter marion  the faces of both were pale and sorrowful but the beauty of the younger was rather enhanced than otherwise by this and by contrast with her sombre garments  they both recognised the sergeant at once and hastening forward so as to prevent his rising greeted him with the kindly warmth of old friends  it seems such a long time since we met said the elder lady but we have never forgotten you or the comrades with whom we used to have such pleasant talks in the troopship  sure am i madam said the sergeant that they have never forgotten you and your kindkind  yes my husband was very kind to you all said the widow observing the delicacy of feeling which stopped the soldiers utterance he was kind to every one  but we have heard some rumours that have made me and my daughter very sad  is it true that a great many men of your regiment were killed and wounded at the battle fought by general mcneill  quite true madam answered the sergeant glancing at the daughter with some surprise for marion was gazing at him with an intensely anxious look and parted lips  but thank god many were spared  andandhow are the two finelooking young men that were so fond of each otherlike twins almost  sure didnt i tell ye misthress that they was both ki  hold your tongue flynn interrupted the widow with a forced smile you are one of my most talkative patients  i want to hear the truth of this matter from a man who has come more recently from the scene of action than yourself  what do you think mr hardy  you refer to john miles and william armstrong no doubt madam said the sergeant in a somewhat encouraging tone  well if flynn says they were killed he has no ground whatever for saying so  they are only reported missing  of course that is bad enough but as long as a man is only missing there is plenty of room for hope  you see they may have managed to hide or been carried off as prisoners into the interior and you may be sure the arabs would not be such fools as to kill two men like miles and armstrong theyd rather make slaves of em in which case there will be a chance of their escaping or if we should become friendly again wi these fellows theyd be set free  im so glad to hear you say so and i felt sure that my desponding patient here was taking too gloomy a view of the matter said mrs drew with a significant glance at marion who seemed to breathe more freely and to lose some of her anxious expression after the sergeants remarks  perhaps at this point a little conversation that took place between mrs drew and her daughter that same evening may not be out of place  dear may said the former did i not tell you that flynn took too gloomy a view of the case of these young soldiers in whom your dear father was so much interested  but darling is it not foolish in you to think so much about miles  it may be foolish mother but i cannot help it said marion blushing deeply for she was very modest as well as simple  may dear i wonder that you can make such an admission said the mother remonstratively  is it wrong to make such an admission to ones own mother when it is true asked marion still blushing but looking straight in her mothers eyes for she was very straightforward as well as modest and simple  of course not dear butbutin short miles is only aasoldier you know and  only a soldier interrupted marion with a flash from her soft brown eyes for she was an enthusiast as well as straightforward modest and simple  i suppose you mean that he is only a private but what then may not the poorest private in the army rise if he be but nobleminded and worthy and capable to the rank of a general or higherif there is anything higher  possibly the commanderinchiefship may be open to him  true my love but in the meantime his social position is  is quite as good as our own interrupted marion for she was a desperate little radical as well as an enthusiast straightforward modest and simple  you know he let out something about his parents and position and of course he told the truth  besides i repeat that i cannot help loving him and surely we are not responsible for our affections  we cannot love and hate to order  i might fall in love withwithwell its no good talking but anyhow i could not help it  i could be silent if you like but i could not help myself  mrs drew seemed a little puzzled how to deal with her impetuous daughter and had begun to reply when may interrupted her  flushing deeply for she was very sensitive and with a feeling that amounted almost to indignation she continued  i wonder at you motherits so unlike you as if those unworthy considerations of difference of rank and station could influence or ought to influence one in such a question as this  mrs drew paused for a moment  she knew that her daughter gave expression to the views that had marked the dealings of the husband and father so lately lost to them in every action of his life  marions happiness too during the remainder of her days might be involved in the result of the present conversation and she was moved to say  my dear has john miles ever spoken to you  oh mother how can you ask me  if he had done so would i have delayed one minute in letting you know  forgive me dearest  i did you wrong in admitting the thought even for a moment  but you spoke so earnestlyas if you might have some reason for thinking that he cared for you  dont you know answered marion looking down and a little confused that men can speak with their eyes as well as their lips  i not only feel sure that he cares for me but i feel sure from the sentiments he expressed to me on the voyage that nothing would induce him to talk to me of love while in his present position  how does all this consist my love asked mrs drew with your knowledge of the fact that he left home in anger and would not be persuaded even by your dear father to write home a penitent letter  marion was silent  this had not occurred to her before  but love is not to be turned from its object by trifles  she was all that we have more than once described her to be but she was not a metaphysician or a philosopher capable of comprehending and explaining occult mysteries enough for her if she loved miles and miles loved her and then even if he did not deserve her love she would remain truesecretly but unalterably trueto him as the needle is to the pole  has it not occurred to you dear said her mother pursuing her advantage in a meditative tone that if miles has been so plainspoken and eloquent with his blue eye that your pretty brown ones may have said something to him  never exclaimed the girl with an indignant flash  oh mother can you believe me capable ofofno i never looked at him except with the air of a perfect strangerat least of aabut why should i try to deny what could not possibly be true  mrs drew felt that nothing was to be gained from pursuing the subject or one aspect of itfurther  at any rate she said i am glad for his own sake poor young fellow that sergeant hardy spoke so hopefully  and for his comrades sakes as well said marion  you know mother that his friend armstrong is also reported as missing and stevenson the marine as well as that dear big bluff sailor jack molloy  by the way do you feel well enough to go to the lecture tonight  it is to be a very interesting one i am told with magiclantern illustrations and i dont like to go alone  i am going tonight so you may make your mind easy said her mother i would not miss this lecturer because i am told that he is a remarkably good one and the hall is likely to be quite full  in regard to this lecture and some other things connected with the alexandrian institute our friend sergeant hardy learned a good deal from the lady at the head of it not long after the time that mrs drew had the foregoing conversation with marion  it is scarcely needful to say that the ladysuperintendent was a capable christian as well as an enthusiast in her work  come to my room sergeant hardy and ill tell you all about it she said leading the way to her apartment where the sergeant placed himself upon a chair bolt upright as if he were going to have a tooth drawn or were about to illustrate some new species of sittingdrill    chapter twenty one  shows how the lady of the institute discourses to the sergeant how jacktars go out on the spree and how music conquers warriors  it seems wonderful to me madam said sergeant hardy looking round the ladys room with an admiring gaze how quickly you have got things into working order here  when i remember that last year this place was a heap of rubbish it seems like magic  ah the work of god on earth seems magical the more we reflect on it returned the lady  the fact that our institute was conceived planned and carried into successful operation by an invalid lady in spite of discouragement and at first with inadequate means is itself little short of miraculous but what is even more surprising is the fact that the government which began by throwing cold water on her portsmouth work has ended by recognising it and by affording us every facility here in alexandria  well you see madam i suppose its because they see that we soldiers and sailors likes it an it does a power o gooddont you think  no doubt but whatever may be the reason sergeant we are very thankful for the encouragement  i suppose you have heard what a grand occasion our opening day was  no madam i havent  you see away at suakim we was so constantly taken up with the attentions of osman digna that we had little time for anything but eatin and sleepin when we wasnt on sentry an fightin so that we often missed bits of news  was there a great turnout o men  indeed there was returned the lady with animation and not only of men but of all the alexandrian notables  it was on the 23rd of february last 1885 that our institute was opened by majorgeneral lennox vc cb who was in command of the garrison  this was not the first time by any means that the soldiers had paid us a visit  a number of men who like yourself sergeant hardy sympathise with our work in its spiritual aspects had been frequently coming to see how we were getting on and many a pleasant hours prayer and singing we had enjoyed with them accompanied by our little harmonium which had been sent to us by kind friends in england and every sunday evening we had had a little service in the midst of the shavings and carpenters benches  but on this grand opening day the men came down in hundreds and a great surprise some of them gotespecially the sceptical among them the entrance was decorated with palms  at the further end of the readingroom the trophy of union jacks and the royal standard which you see there now was put up by a band of jacktars who had come to help us as well as to see the fun  over the trophy was our text in the name of the lord will we set up our banners for we liked to feel that we had taken possession of this little spot in egypt for godand we believe that it will always be his  everything was bright and hearty  there were about five hundred soldiers and sailors and between two and three hundred officers and civilians of all nationalities  on the platform we had osman pasha  ha interrupted the sympathetic sergeant i only wish we could have had osman digna there too  it would do more to pacify the soudan than killing his men does  i daresay it would responded the lady with a laugh but have patience hardy we shall have him there yet and perhaps the mahdi tooor some future grand occasion  well as i was saying we had osman the governor of alexandria on our platform and a lot of bigwigs that you know nothing about but whose influence was of importance and whose appearance went far to make the place look gay of course we had music beginning with god save the queen and speechesbrilliant as well as heavy sententious and comiclike all other similar gatherings and the enthusiasm was unbounded  how could it be otherwise with sailors to cheer and soldiers to back them up  and you may be sure that in such a meeting the enthusiasm about the undertaking did not fail to extend to the soldiers friend who had originated the whole  in short it was a splendid success  of course it was said the sergeant with emphasis first because of gods blessing an second because the institoot was greatly needed why madam if it wasnt for this place the thousands of soldiers stationed here not to mention the sailors would have no place to go to spend their leave and leisure time but the drinkin dens o the town an you know well though praps not so well as i do what terrible places these are where men are tempted fleeced debauched and sometimes murdered  quite true hardy  did you hear of the case that occurred just two days ago  a sergeant of one of the regiments i forget which after paying his fare to a donkeyboy turned quietly to walk away when the scoundrel felled him with a stick and robbed him of one pound 10 shillings  the case is before the lawcourt now and no doubt the robber will receive a just reward  well as i was remarking the opening day carried us to high tide so to speak and there has been no ebb from that day to this  one comical incident however occurred just at the beginning which might have done us damage  the day after the opening all was prepared for the reception of our soldier and sailor friends  the tables were arranged with books and games the writingtable with pens ink and blottingpaper and the bar with all sorts of eatables magnificent urns coloured glass etcetera  about one oclock william our barman tasted the coffee his usual expression of selfsatisfaction gave place to one of horror he tasted the coffee again  the look of horror deepened  he ran to the boiler and the mystery was cleared up  the boiler had been filled with saltwater  our arab ibraim who carries up seawater daily to fill our baths had filled the boiler with the same  luckily there was time to correct the mistake and when our friends came trooping in at four oclock they found the coffee quite to their taste  you know very well continued the superintendent our rules never to force religion on any of our customers our object being to attract by all the legitimate means in our power  we have our bibleclasses prayermeetings temperance soirees and the like distinctas at portsmouthfrom the other advantages of the institute and are quite content if some who come at first from mere curiosity or for the enjoyment of temporal good things should afterwards continue to come from higher and spiritual motives  but if our military friends prefer to read our papers and books and play our games and use our bar they are at perfect liberty to do so without what i may style religious interference  its all fair and aboveboard you see  we fully recognise the freedom of will that god has bestowed on man  if you dont care for our spiritual fare you may let it alone  if you relish itthere it is and you are welcome  yet we hold by our right to win men if we can  in point of fact we have been very successful already in this way for our motive power from beginning to end is love  one of our most helpful soldier friendsa sergeanthas brought several men to the saviour who are now our steady supporters  one of these men whom our sergeant was the means of bringing in was a professed unbeliever of good standing and ability  the first time he was prevailed on to come to a prayermeeting he sat bolt upright while we knelt being a straightforward sort of man who refused to pretend when he could not really pray  he is now a happy follower of jesus  our large rooms are constantly filled with soldiers some chatting some making up for past privations by having a good english meal and others reading or playing games  just now happens to be our quietest hour but it wont be long before we have a bustling scene  as if to verify the ladys words there came through the doorways at that moment a sound of shouting and cheering which caused all the staff of the institute to start into active life  there they come exclaimed the lady with an intelligent smile as she hurried from the room leaving hardy to follow at a pace that was more consistent with his dignityand we may add his physical weakness  the shouts proceeded from a party of sailors on leave from one of the ironclads lying in the harbour  these being out for the dayon a spree as some of them styled ithad hired donkeys and come in a body to the institute where they knew that food of the best dressed in british fashion and familiar games were to be had along with british cheer and sympathy  when hardy reached the door he found the place swarming with bluejackets trooping up at intervals on various animals but none on foot save those who had fallen off their mounts and were trying to get on again  theyre all donkeyfied together remarked a sarcastic old saltnot one of the partywho stood beside hardy looking complacently on and smoking his pipe  they dont steer as well on land as on sea replied hardy  cause they aint used to such craft you seethats were it is sarjint said the old salt removing his pipe for a moment  just look at emsome comin along sidewise like crabs others stern foremost wy theres that grey craft wi the broad little man holdin on to its tail to prevent his slidin over its head  ive watched that grey craft for some minutes and its hind propellers have bin so often in the air that it do seem as if it was walkin upon its front legs  hallo  i was sure hed go down by the head at last  the donkey in question had indeed gone down by the head and rolled over pitching its rider on his broad shoulders which however seemed none the worse for the fall  ketch hold of his tail bill cried another man and hold his stern downsee if that wont cure his plungin  hes like a dutchman in a cross sea  keep clear o this fellows heels jack hes agoin to fire another broadside  if he does hell unship you cried jack who was himself at the same moment unshipped while the owner of the donkey and of the other donkeys shouted advice if nothing worse in arabic and broken english  in a few minutes the sailors boarded the institute and drew the whole force of the establishment to the bar in order to supply the demand  ah thin yeve got irish whisky havent ye demanded a facetious seaman  yes plenty but we call it coffee here answered the equally facetious barman whose satellites were distributing hot and cold drinks with a degree of speed that could only be the fruit of much practice  youll have to be jolly on mild swipes said one no tostikatin liquors allowed dick  hm growled dick  got any wittles here demanded another man wiping his lips with his sleeve  yes plenty  sit down and order what you want  for nothin asked the tar  for next to nothing was the prompt reply  meanwhile those whose appetites were not quite so urgent had distributed themselves about the place and were already busy with draughts billiards etcetera while those who were of more sedate and inquiring temperament were deep in the columns of the english papers and magazines  i say fred thorley aint it bang up remarked a sturdy little man through a huge slice of cake with which he had just filled his mouth  fussrate responded fred as he finished a cup of coffee at a draught and called for more  didnt i tell you sam that youd like it better than the native grogshops  if theyd ony got bitter beer sighed sam  theyve got better beer said his friend try some gingerpop  no thankee  if i cant git it strong lets at least have it hot but i say whats come o the lobsters  dont seem to be many about i thought this here institoot was got up apurpose for them  so it was lad includin us but you dont suppose that because you are out on the spree everybody else is  theyre on dooty just now wait a bit an youll see plenty of em afore long  are all that come here blue lights asked sam with a somewhat doleful visage  by no manner o means returned his friend with a laugh tho for the matter o that they wouldnt be worse men if they was but many of em are no better than they should be an dee know sam there are some of em actually as great blackguards amost as yourself  theres some comfort in that anyhow returned sam with a pleasant smile for i hates to be pecooliar  by the way fred praps they may be able to give you some noos here if you ax em about your friend jack molloy  he was a blue light wasnt he  not wen i knowd im but he was a fussrate seaman an a good friend though he was fond of his glass like yourself sam  it chanced that at this point sergeant hardy in moving about the place taking profound interest in all that he saw came within earshot of the two friends to whom he at once went up and introduced himself as a friend of jack molloy  indeed said he molloy and i fought pretty near to each other in that last affair under general mcneill so i can give you the latest news of him  can you old man  come sit down here an lets have it then said thorley  jack was an old messmate o mine  whatll you take to drink mate  nothing thankee  im allowanced by the doctor even in the matter o tea and coffee said the sergeant  as to bein an old manwell i aint much older than yourself i daresay though wounds and sickness and physic are apt to age a man in looks  sitting down beside the sailors hardy told of the great fight at mcneills zereba and how molloy and others of his friends had gone to rescue a comrade and been cut off  he relieved freds mind however by taking the most hopeful view of the matter as he had previously relieved the feelings of marion  and then the three fell to chatting on things in general and the war in particular  now dont this feel homelike said sam looking round the room with great satisfaction  if it wasnt for the heat id amost think we was in a temperance coffeehouse in old england  or owld ireland chimed in a sailor at the neighbouring table  to say naething o auld scotland added a rugged man in red hair who sat beside him  well messmate assented fred it do feel homelike an no mistake why what ever is that  the sailor paused and held up a finger as if to impose silence while he listened but there was no need to enforce silence for at that moment the sweet strains of a harmonium were heard at the other end of the long room and quietude profound descended on the company as a rich baritone voice sang with wonderful pathos the familiar notes and words of home sweet home  before that song was finished many a warrior there had to fight desperately with his own spirit to conceal the fact that his eyes were full of tears  indeed not a few of them refused to fight at all but ingloriously lowering their colours allowed the telltale drops to course over their bronzed faces as they thought of sweethearts and wives and friends and home circles and the light of other days    chapter twenty two  led into captivity  we turn once more to the nubian desert where it will be remembered we left several of our friends cut off from mcneills zereba at a critical moment when they were all but overwhelmed by a host of foes  the grandlooking arab who had so opportunely appeared on the scene and arrested the spears which were about to finish the career of jack molloy was no other than the man who had been saved by miles from the bullet of his comrade rattling bill  a kind act had in this case received its appropriate reward for a brief though slight glance and a gracious inclination of the arabs head convinced our hero that the whole party owed their lives to this mans gratitude  they were not however exempt from indignity for at the moment when jack molloy fell they were overwhelmed by numbers their arms were wrenched from their grasp and their hands were bound behind their backs  thus they were led the reverse of gently into the thick bush by a strong party of natives while the others headed by the blackbearded chief continued their attack on the zereba  it soon became evident that the men who had charge of the prisoners did not share or sympathise with the feelings of the chief who had spared their lives for they not only forced them to hurry forward as fast as they could go but gave them occasional pricks with their spearpoints when any of them chanced to trip or stumble  one of the warriors in particulara fiery mansometimes struck them with the shaft of his spear and otherwise maltreated them  it may be easily understood that men with unbroken spirits and high courage did not submit to this treatment with a good grace  miles was the first to be tested in this way  on reaching a piece of broken ground his foot caught in something and he stumbled forward  his hands being bound behind him he could not protect his head and the result was that he plunged into a prickly shrub out of which he arose with flushed and bleeding countenance  this was bad enough but when the fiery arab brought a lance down heavily on his shoulders his temper gave way and he rushed at the man in a towering rage striving at the same time with intense violence to burst his bonds  of course he failed and was rewarded by a blow on the head which for a moment or two stunned him  seeing this armstrongs power of restraint gave way and he sprang to the rescue of his friend but only to meet the same fate at the hands of the fiery arab  stunned and bleeding though not subdued they were compelled to move on again at the head of the partyspurred on now and then by a touch from the point of the fiery mans lance  indeed it seemed as if this mans passionate nature would induce him ere long to risk his chiefs wrath by disobeying orders and stabbing the prisoners  stevenson the marine was the next to suffer for his foot slipped on a stone and he fell with such violence as to be unable to rise for a few minutes  impatient of the delay the fiery man struck him so savagely with the spearshaft that even his own comrades remonstrated  if i could only burst this cord growled simkin between his teeth id  he stopped for he felt that it was unmanly as well as idle to boast in the circumstances  we must have patience comrade said stevenson as he rose pale and bloodstained from the ground  our great captain sometimes gives us the order to submit and suffer and  a prick in the fleshy part of his thigh caused him to stop abruptly  at this point the endurance of jack molloy failed him and he also went in for violent action  but jack was a genius as well as a sailor and profited by the failures of his comrades  instead of making futile efforts to break his bonds like them he lowered his hairy head and with a howl and a tremendous rush like a fishtorpedo launched himself or as it were took a header into the fiery man  no fellow as jack himself afterwards remarked could receive fifteen stone ten into his breadbasket and go on smiling  on the contrary he went down like a ninepin and remained where he fell for his comradeswho evidently did not love himmerely laughed and went on their way leaving him to revive at his leisure  the prisoners advanced somewhat more cheerfully after this event for besides being freed from pricks of the spearpoint there was that feeling of elation which usually arises in every wellbalanced mind from the sight of demerit meeting with its appropriate reward  the region over which they were thus led or driven was rather more varied than the level country behind them and towards evening it changed still further becoming more decidedly hillcountry  at night the party found themselves in the neighbourhood of one of the allimportant wells of the land beside which they encamped under a small tree  here the prisoners were allowed to sit down on the ground with one man to guard them while the others kindled a fire and otherwise arranged the encampment  supperconsisting of a small quantity of boiled corn and dried flesh was given to the prisoners whose hands were set free though their elbows were loosely lashed together and their feet tied to prevent their escape  no such idea however entered into the heads of any of them for they were by that time in the heart of an unknown range of hills in a country which swarmed with foes besides which they would not have known in what direction to fly had they been free to do so they possessed neither arms ammunition nor provisions and were at the time greatly exhausted by their forced march  perhaps jack molloy was the only man of the unfortunate party who at that moment retained either the wish or the power to make a dash for freedom  but then jack was an eccentric and exceptional man in every respect  nothing could quell his spirit and it was all but impossible to subdue his body  he was what we may term a composite character  his frame was a mixture of guttapercha leather and brass  his brain was a compound of vivid fancy and slow perception  his heart was a union of highly inflammable oil and deeply impressible butter with something remarkably tough in the centre of it  had he been a red indian he would have been a chief  if born a nigger he would have been a king  in the tenth century he might have been a seaking or something similar  born as he was in the nineteenth century he was only a jacktar and a hero  it is safe to conclude that if molloy had been set free that evening with a cutlass in his hand he wouldafter supper of coursehave attacked singlehanded the united band of forty arabs killed at least ten of them and left the remaining thirty to mourn over their mangled bodies and the loss of numerous thumbs and noses to say nothing of other wounds and bruises  luckily for his comrades he was not free that night  boys said he after finishing his scanty meal and resting on an elbow as he looked contemplatively up at the stars which were beginning to twinkle in the darkening sky it do seem to me now that ive had time to think over it quietly that our only chance o gittin out o this here scrape is to keep quiet an pretend that were uncommon fond of our dear arab friends till we throws em off their guard an then some fine night give em the slip an make sail across the desert for suakim  no doubt youre right answered miles with a sigh for being tired and sleepy just then he was not nearly as sanguine as the seaman but i have not much hope of gaining their confidenceespecially after your acting the thunderbolt so effectively on one of them  why man alive they wont mind that  it was all in the way of fair fight said molloy an the rascal was no favourite i could see that  its a wonder to me you could see anything at all after such a ram remarked moses pyne with a yawn as he lay back and rested his head on a tuft of grass  the shock seemed to me fit to sink an ironclad  but why pretend to be fond of the arabs asked stevenson  dont you think it would be sufficient that we should obey orders quietly without any humbug or pretence at all about it till a chance to escape shall come in our way  dont you think stevenson said miles that theres a certain amount of humbug and pretence even in quiet obedience to orders when such obedience is not the result of submission but of a desire to throw people off their guard  but my obedience is the result of submission returned the marine stoutly  i do really submitfirst because it is gods will for i cannot help it second because it is the only course that will enable me to escape bad treatment third because i wish to gain the goodwill of the men who have me in their power whether i escape or not and fourth  hallo old man how many heads are you goin to give us in that there sermon asked moses  this is the last head moses and you neednt be anxious for i aint going to enlarge on any of em  my fourth reason is that by doing as commonsense bids me our foes will be brought thereby to that state of mind which will be favourable to everythingour escape includedand i cant help that you know  it aint my fault if they become trustful is it  no nor it aint no part o your dooty to spoil their trustfulness by failin to take advantage of it said molloy with a grin but it do seem to me stevenson as if there wor a strong smack o the jesuit in what you say  i hope not replied the marine  anyhow no one would expect me surely to go an say straight out to these fellows im goin to obey orders an be as meek as a lamb in order to throw you off your guard an bolt when i get the chance  cernly not  cause why  firstly you couldnt say it at all till youd learned arabic returned molloy secondlyif i may be allowed for to follow suit an sermonisecause you shouldnt say it if you could an thirdly cause youd be a most awful jackass to say it if you did  now its my advice boys that we go to sleep for we wont have an easy day of it tomorrow if i may judge from today  having delivered this piece of advice with much decision the seaman extended himself at full length on the ground and went to sleep with a pleased smile on his face as if the desert sand had been his familiar couch from infancy  some of the other members of the unfortunate party were not however quite so ready for sleep  miles and his friend armstrong sat long talking over their fatewhich they mutually agreed was a very sad one but at last overcome by exhaustion if not anxiety they sank into muchneeded repose and the only sound that broke the stillness of the night was the tread of the arab sentinel as he paced slowly to and fro  the country as they advanced became more and more rugged until they found themselves at last in the midst of a hill region in the valleys of which there grew a considerable amount of herbage and underwood  the journey here became very severe to the captives for although they did not suffer from thirst so much as on the plains the difficulty of ascending steep and rugged paths with their hands bound was very great it is true the position of the hands was changed for after the second day they had been bound in front of them but this did not render their toil easy though it was thereby made a little less laborious  by this time the captives had learned from experience that if they wished to avoid the spearpoints they must walk in advance of their captors at a very smart pace  fortunately being all strong and healthy men they were well able to do so  rattling bill perhaps suffered most although after molloy he was physically one of the strongest of the party  observing that he lagged behind a little on one occasion while they were traversing a somewhat level valley stevenson offered him his arm  dont be ashamed to take it old boy said the marine kindly as his comrade hesitated  you know a fellow sometimes feels out o sorts and not up to much however stout he may be when well so just you lay hold for somehow i happen to feel as strong as an elephant today  but i aint ill returned simkin still declining and i dont see why i shouldnt be as able as you are to carry my own weight  of course you are better able to do it than i am in a general way returned his friend but i said that sometimes you know a fellow gives in he dont well know why or how an then of course his comrades that are still strong are bound to help him  here hook on and pocket your pride  youll have to do the same thing for me tomorrow mayhap when i give in  and if it does come to that ill lean heavy i promise you  youre a good fellow stevenson even though you are a blue light said simkin taking the proffered arm  perhaps its because i am a blue light returned the marine with a laugh  at all events it is certain that whatever good there may be about me at all is the result of that light which is as free to you as to me  for some minutes the couple walked along in silence  at last rattling bill spoke  i wonder he said why it is that a young and healthy fellow like me should break down sooner than you stevenson for im both bigger and strongerand yet look at us new  aint it strange  i wonder why it is  it is strange indeed returned the marine quietly  praps the climate suits me better than you  i know what youre thinkin said simkin almost testily  why dont you say that drink is the cause of itstraight out like a man  because i knew you were saying that to yourself lad so there was no need for me to say it returned his friend with a sideglance and a twinkle of the eyes  well whoever says it its a fact continued simkin almost sternly an i make no bones of admitting it  i have bin soakin away right and left since i came to this country in spite o warnins from you and other men like you and now i feel as if all my boasted strength was goin out at my heels  stevenson was silent  why dont you say i told you so asked simkin sharply  because i never say that  it only riles people besides continued the marine earnestly i was asking god at the moment to enable me to answer you wisely  you see i think it only fair to reveal some of my private thoughts to you since you are making a fatherconfessor of me  but as you admit that drink has done you damage my dear fellow there is no need for me to say anything more on that subject  what you want now is encouragement as to the future and advice as to the present shall i give you both just now or shall i wait  commence firing replied simkin with a halfjesting smile  well then as to encouragement said stevenson  a point of vital importance with men who have gone in for drink as much as you have is totalabstinence and i regard it as an evidence of gods love to you that he has brought you here  gods love that brought me here exclaimed the soldier in surprise well that is a view o the case that dont seem quite plain  plain enough if you open your eyes wide enough  see here if you was in camp now with your present notions and was to determine to give up drink youd have to face and fight two most tremendous devils  one devil is called craving the other is called temptation and all the arabs in the soudan rolled into one are not so terrible or so strong as these two when a man is left to fight them by himself  now is it not a sign of our fathers love that he has by bringing you here removed the devil temptation entirely out of your way for you cant get strong drink here for love or money  so you see you have only got craving to fight and thats encouraging aint it  dye know i believe you are not far wrong said simkin gravely and it is encouraging to know that temptations out o the way for i feel that the other devil has got me by the throat even now and that its him as has weakened me so much  thats it friend  youve got the truth by the tail now so hold on but at the same time dont be too hard on craving  its not his fault that hes here  you have poured liquor down your throat to him daily and cultivated his acquaintance and helped him to increase his strength regularly for many monthsit may be for years  i dont want to be hard on you lad but its of no use shiftin the burden on to the wrong shoulders  it is not craving but you who are the sinner  now as to advice do you really want it  well replied simkin with a humph it will be time enough for you to shut up when i sound the cease firing  my advice then is that you go down on your knees plead guilty straight off and ask for grace to help you in your time of need  what go down on my knees here before all them arabs  if i did theyd not only laugh at me but theyd soon rouse me up with their spears  im not so sure about that simkin  arabs are accustomed to go on their own knees a good deal in public  it is chiefly christians who strange to say are ashamed to be caught in that position at odd times but i speak not of ceremonies but of realities  a man may go on his knees without bending a joint any time and everywhere  now listen there is this difference between the courts of men and the court of heaven that in the former when a man pleads guilty his sentence is only modified and softened but in the latter the man who pleads guilty receives a free pardon and ultimate deliverance from all sin for the sake of jesus christ  will you accept this deliverance my friend  what the soldier replied in his heart we cannot tell for his voice was silent  before the conversation could be resumed a halt was called to partake of the midday meal and rest  that evening the party came upon a strange and animated scene  it was one of the mountain camps of osman digna where men were assembling from all quarters to swell the hordes with which their chief hoped to drive the hated europeans into the red sea  camels and other beasts of burden were bringing in supplies for the vast army and to this spot had been brought the poor fellows who had been wounded in recent battles  here the captives were thrust into a small dark hut and left to their meditations while a couple of arab sentries guarded the door    chapter twenty three  shows that suffering tends to draw out sympathy  the word captivity even when it refers to civilised lands and peoples conveys we suspect but a feeble and incorrect idea to the minds of those who have never been in a state of personal bondage still less do we fully appreciate its dread significance when it refers to foreign lands and barbarous people  it was not so much the indignities to which the captive britons were subjected that told upon them ultimately as the hard grinding restless toil and the insufficient food and restsometimes accompanied with absolute corporeal pain  a merciful man is merciful to his beast  there is not much of mercy to his beast in an arab  we have seen an arab in algiers who made use of a sore on his donkeys back as a sort of convenient spur  it is exhausting to belabour a thickskinned and obstinate animal with a stick  it is much easier and much more effective to tickle up a sore kept open for the purpose with a little bit of stick while comfortably seated on the creatures back  the fellow we refer to did that  we do not say or think that all arabs are cruel very far from it but we hold that as a race they are so  their great prophet taught them cruelty by example and precept and the records of history as well as of the african slavetrade bear witness to the fact that their tender mercies are not and never have been conspicuous  at first as we have shown indignities told pretty severely on the unfortunate englishmen  but as time went on and they were taken further and further into the interior and heavy burdens were daily bound on their shoulders and the lash was frequently applied to urge them on the keen sense of insult which had at first stirred them into wild anger became blunted and at last they reached that condition of partial apathy which renders men almost indifferent to everything save rest and food  even the submissive stevenson was growing callous  in short that process had begun which usually ends in making men either brutes or martyrs  as before we must remark that jack molloy was to some extent an exception  it did seem as if nothing but death itself could subdue that remarkable man  his huge frame was so powerful that he seemed to be capable of sustaining any weight his tyrants chose to put upon him  and the influence of hope was so strong within him that it raised him almost entirely above the region of despondency  this was fortunate for his comrades in misfortune for it served to keep up their less vigorous spirits  there was one thing about the seaman however which they could not quite reconcile with his known character  this was a tendency to groan heavily when he was being loaded  to be sure there was not much reason for wonder seeing that the arabs forced the herculean man to carry nearly double the weight borne by any of his companions but then as miles once confidentially remarked to armstrong i thought that jack molloy would rather have died than have groaned on account of the weight of his burden but after all it is a tremendously heavy onepoor fellow  one day the arabs seemed to be filled with an unusual desire to torment their victims  a man had passed the band that day on a fast dromedary and the prisoners conjectured that he might have brought news of some defeat of their friends which would account for their increased cruelty  they were particularly hard on molloy that day as if they regarded him as typical of british strength and therefore an appropriate object of revenge  after the midday rest they not only put on him his ordinary burden but added to the enormous weight considerably so that the poor fellow staggered under it and finally fell down beneath it with a very dismal groan indeed  of course the lash was at once applied and under its influence the sailor rose with great difficulty and staggered forward a few paces but only to fall again  this time however he did not wait for the lash but made very determined efforts of his own accord to rise and advance without showing the smallest sign of resentment  even his captors seemed touched for one of them removed a small portion of his burden so that thereafter the poor fellow proceeded with less difficulty though still with a little staggering and an occasional groan  that night they reached a village near the banks of a broad river where they put up for the night  after their usual not too heavy supper was over the prisoners were thrust into a sort of hut or cattleshed and left to make themselves as comfortable as they could on the bare floor  i dont feel quite so much inclined for sleep tonight said miles to molloy  no more do i remarked the sailor stretching himself like a wearied goliath on the earthen floor and placing his arms under his head for a pillow  i feel pretty well used up too said simkin throwing himself down with a sigh that was more eloquent than his tongue  he was indeed anything but rattling bill by that time  moses pyne being like his great namesake a meek man sympathised with the others but said nothing about himself though his looks betrayed him  armstrong and stevenson were silent  they seemed too much exhausted to indulge in speech  poor fellow said moses to molloy i dont wonder you are tired for you not only carried twice as much as any of us but you took part of my load  indeed he did comrades added moses turning to his friends with an apologetic air  i didnt want him to do it but he jerked part o my load suddenly out o my hand an wouldnt give it up again an you know i didnt dare to make a row for that would have brought the lash down on both of us  but i didnt want him to carry so much an him so tired  tired exclaimed the sailor with a loud laugh  why i warnt tired a bit  an you know youd have dropped down moses if i hadnt helped ye at that time  well i confess i was ready to drop returned moses with a humbled look but i would much rather have dropped than have added to your burden  how can you say you wasnt tired when you had fallen down only five minutes before an groaned heavily when you rose and your legs trembled so  i could see it  to this the seamans only reply was the expansion of his huge but handsome mouth the display of magnificent teeth the disappearance of both eyes and a prolonged quiet chuckle  why whats the matter with you jack asked stevenson  nothins the matter wi me old mancept  here he indulged in another chuckle  goin mad with overfatigue said simkin looking suspiciously at him  ay thats it messmate clean mad wi overfatigue  he wiped his eyes with the hairy back of his hand for the chuckling being hearty had produced a few tears  no but really jack what is it youre laughing at asked armstrong if there is a joke you might as well let us have the benefit of laughing along wi you for we stand much in need of something to cheer us here  well billy boy i may as well make a clean breast of it said molloy raising himself on one elbow and becoming grave  i do confess to feelin raither ashamed o myself but you mustnt be hard on me lads for circumstances alters cases you know as solomon saidleastwise if it warnt him it was job or somebody else  the fact is ive bin shammin mates  shamming  ay shammin weak  purtendin that i was shaky on the legs an so not quite up to the cargo they were puttin aboard o me  if what youve been doing means shamming weak id like to see you coming out strong observed miles with a short laugh  well praps youll see that too some day returned the sailor with an amiable look  but do you really mean that all that groaningwhich i confess to have been surprised atwas mere pretence  all sham  downright sneakin said molloy  the short an the long of it is that i seed from the first the ony way to humbug them yellowfaced baboons was to circumwent em  so i set to work at the wery beginnin  ah by takin a header said simkin into one o their breadbaskets  no no returned the seaman that i confess was a mistake  but youll admit ive made no more mistakes o the same sort since then you see i perceived that as my strength is considerable above the average the baboons would be likely to overload me so arter profound excogitation wi myself i made up my mind what to do an when they had clapped on a little more than the rest o you carried i began to groan then i began to shake a bit in my timbers an look as if i was agoin to founder  it didnt check em much for theyre awful cruel so i went fairly down by the head  i had a pretty fair guess that this would bring the lash about my shoulders an i was right but i got up wery slowly an brokendownlike so that the baboons was fairly humbugged and stopped loadin of me long afore id taken in a full cargoso you see boys ive bin sailin raither light than otherwise  but do you mean to tell me that the load youve bin carryin is not too heavy for you asked moses  thats just what i does mean to tell you lad  i could carry a good deal more an dance with it  you see they aint used to men o my size so i was able to humbug em into a miscalkilation  i ony wish i could have helped you all to do the same but theyre too cute as the yankees say  anyway moses you dont need to trouble your head when i gives you a helpin hand again  ah that expression a helping hand sounds familiar in my ears said stevenson in a sad tone  yes what do it recall lad asked molloy extending himself again on his broad back  it recalls places and friends in portsmouth jack that we may never again set eyes on  you remember the institoot  well theyve got a new branch o the work there for the surrounding civilian poor called the helping hand  you see miss robinson understands us soldiers out and out  she knew that those among us who gave up drink and sin and put on the blueribbon were not goin to keep all the benefit to ourselves she knew that we understood the meaning of the word enlist that wed think very little o the poorspirited fellow whod take the queens shillin and put on her uniform and then shirk fightin her battles and honouring her flag  so when some of us put on the lords uniform which like that of the austrians is whiteand unfurled his flag she knew wed soon be wantin to fight his battles against sinespecially against drink so instead of lookin after our welfare alone she encouraged us to hold out a helpin hand to the poorest and most miserable people in portsmouth an she found us ready to answer to the call  ah they was grand times these continued the marine with kindly enthusiasm as he observed that his comrades in sorrow were becoming interested and forgetting for the moment their own sorrows and sufferings  the blueribbon move was strong in portsmouth at the time and many of the soldiers and sailors joined it  some time after we had held out a helping hand to the poor civilians we took it into our heads to invite some of em to a grand teafight in the big hall so we asked a lot o the poorest who had faithfully kept the pledge through their first teetotal christmas and it was a scrimmage i can tell you  we got together more than forty of em men and women and there were about three hundred soldiers and sailors and their wives to wait on em an keep em company  capital exclaimed miles who had a sympathetic spiritespecially for the poor  goodgood said molloy nodding his head  that was the right thing to do an i suppose they enjoyed theirselves  enjoyed themselves exclaimed the marine with a laugh  i should just think they did  trust miss robinson for knowin how to make poor folk enjoy themselvesand for the matter of that rich folk too  how they did stuff to be sure  many of em poor things hadnt got such a blowout in all their lives before  you see they was the very poorest of the poor  you may believe what i say for i went round myself with one o the institoot ladies to invite em and i do declare to you that i never saw even pigs or dogs in such a state of destitootionnothin whatever to lie on but the bare boards  you dont say so murmured moses with deep commiseration and seemingly oblivious of the fact that he was himself pretty much in similar destitution at that moment  indeed i do  look here continued the marine becoming more earnest as he went on thousands of people dont knowcant understandwhat misery and want and suffering is going on around em  city missionaries and the like tell em about it and write about it but telling and writin dont make people know some things  they must see ay sometimes they must feel before they can rightly understand  one of the rooms we visited continued stevenson in pathetic tones belonged to a poor old couple who had been great drinkers but had been induced to put on the blueribbon  it was a pigeonhole of a room narrow up a dark stair  they had no means of support  the room was empty  everything had been pawned  the last thing given up was the womans shawl to pay the rent and they were starving  why didnt they go to the workus asked simkin  cause the workhouse separates man and wife in defiance of the divine lawwhom god hath joined together let no man put asunder  they was fond of each other was that old man and woman and had lived long together an didnt want to part till death  so they had managed to stick to the old home ay and they had stuck to their colours for the bit o blue was still pinned to the tattered coat o the man and the thin gown o the woman neither coat nor gown would fetch anything at the pawnshop and there was no smell o drink in the room  well that old couple went to the teafight  it was a bitter cold night but they came all the same with nothing to cover the womans thin old arms  the moment they appeared away went one o miss robinsons workers to the room where they keep chests full of clothes sent by charitable folk to the institoot an you should have seen that old womans wrinkled face when the worker returned wi the thickest worsted shawl she could lay hold of an put it on her shoulders as tenderly as if the old woman had been her own mother  at the same time they gave a bigcoat to the old man  but i say interrupted simkin that christmas feed an shawl an coat wouldnt keep the couple for a twelmonth if they was sent home to starve as before would it  of course not returned the marine but they wasnt sent off to starve they was looked after  ay an the people o the whole neighbourhood are now looked after for miss robinson has bought up a grogshop in nobbs laneone o the worst places in portsmouthan converted it into a temperance coffeehouse wi lots of beds to send people to when the institoot overflows an a soupkitchen for the destitoot poor an a washus for them and the soldiers wives an in short it has changed the whole place but if i go on like this ill send moses to sleep for ive heard im smotherin his yawns more than once aready  its not for want of interest in what youre sayin though old man returned moses with a tremendous unsmothered yawn which of course set all his comrades off and confirmed them in the belief that it was time to seek repose  scarcely a single comment was made on the narrative as each laid his weary head on his arm or on a folded garment and stretched himself out on the hard ground in nearly as destitute a condition as the poor folk about whom they had been hearing for while their bed was as hard as theirs and the covering as scant the meal they had recently consumed was by no means what hungry men would call satisfying  there is reason to believe however that their consideration of the sad lot of the poor at home did not render less profound or sweet that nights repose in the great african wilderness    chapter twenty four  adventures among the soudanese and strange meeting with the mahdi  day after day for many days our captives were thus driven over the burning desert suffering intensely from heat and thirst and hunger as well as from fatigue and treated with more or less cruelty according to the varying moods of their guards  at last one afternoon they arrived at a city of considerable size through the streets of which they were driven with unusual harshness by the arab soldiers who seemed to take pleasure in thus publicly heaping contempt on christian captives in the sight of the mohammedan population  their case seemed truly desperate to miles as he and his comrades passed through the narrow streets for no pitying eye but many a frown was cast on them by the crowds who stopped to gaze and scoff  what city they had reached they had no means of finding out being ignorant of arabic  indeed even though they had been able to converse with their guards it is probable that these would have refused to hold communication with them  turning out of what appeared to be a sort of marketplace they were driven rather than conducted to a whitewashed building into which they entered through a low strong door studded with large ironheaded nails  as they entered a dark passage the door was slammed and locked behind them  at first owing to their sudden entrance out of intensely bright day they seemed to be in profound darkness but when they became accustomed to the dim light they found that they were in the presence of several powerful men who carried long easternlike pistols in their girdles and curved naked swords in their hands  these stood like statues against the wall of the small room silently awaiting the orders of one whose dress betokened him of superior rank and who was engaged in writing with a reed in persian characters  a tall very blackskinned negro stood beside this officer  after a few minutes the latter laid down the reed rose up and confronted the prisoners at the same time addressing some remark to his attendant  who is you an where you come fro asked the negro addressing himself to miles whom he seemed intuitively to recognise as the chief of his party  we are british soldiers said miles drawing himself up with an air of dignity that would have done credit to the emperor of china  you see at that moment he felt himself to be the spokesman for and with his comrades the representative of the entire british army and was put upon his mettle accordingly  we come from suakim  ay blackface broke in jack molloy at that moment and you may tell him that if he has the pluck to go to suakim hell see plenty more british soldiersan british seamen toowholl give him an his friends a hot and hearty welcome wi bullet bayonet and cutlash whenever he feels inclined  are you officer asked the negro of miles and not paying the smallest attention to molloys warlike invitation  no i am not  turning to the armed men the officer gave them an order which caused them to advance and stand close to the englishmentwo beside each prisonerwith drawn swords  an extra man took up his position behind molloy evidently having regard to his superior size  then two men who looked like jailers advanced to stevenson cut the cords that bound his arms and proceeded to put iron fetters on his wrists  comrades said molloy in a low voice when he perceived that his turn was coming shall we make a burst for itkill them all get out into street cut and slash through the town and make a grand run for itor die like men  die like fools growled simkin as he suffered his hands to be manacled  no no jack said armstrong dont be rash  lets bide our time theres no sayin whatll turn up  well well sighed molloy resigning himself to his fate theres only one thing now thats sartin sure to turn up an that is the sod thatll cover our graves  youre not sure even of that man said moses pyne who was beginning to give way to despair for mayhap theyll only dig a hole in the sand an shove us in  more likely to leave the dogs an vultures to clear us out o the way said simkin whose powers of hope were being tested almost beyond endurance  while the prisoners indulged in these gloomy anticipations the operation of fixing their irons was finished after which they were taken across an inner court which was open to the sky  at the other side of this they came to another heavy ironstudded door which when opened disclosed a flight of steps descending into profound darkness  go in said the negro who had accompanied them  molloy who was first hesitated and the tremendous flush on his face and frown on his shaggy brows seemed to indicate that even yet he meditated attempting his favourite burst  but stevenson pushing past him at once descended saying as he went dont be foolish jack we must learn to submit  there were only three steps and at the bottom a room about fifteen feet square to enlighten which there was a small hole high up in one of the walls  it did little more however than render darkness visible  god help us exclaimed miles with a sensation of sinking at the heart which he had never felt before  and little wonder for as their eyes became accustomed to the dim light it was seen that the walls were blank with nothing on them to relieve the eye save the little hole or window just mentioned that the floor was of hard earth and that there was not a scrap of furniture in the roomnot even a stool or a bundle of straw on which to lie down  i will trust and not be afraid said stevenson in a low voice  who will you trust asked simkin who was not aware that his comrade had quoted scripture  i will trust god answered the marine  i wouldnt give much for your trust then returned simkin bitterly as well as contemptuously for he had given way to despair  you blue lights and christians think yourselves so much better than everybody else because you make so much talk about prayin an singin an doin your duty an servin god an submitting  its all hypocrisy  dont you believe that sergeant hardy is a good soldier asked stevenson  of course i do replied simkin in some surprise at the question  an he doesnt think much of himself does he continued the marine  certainly not  hes one o the kindest an humblest men in the regiment as i have good reason to know  yet he frequently talks to us of attendin to our duty an doin credit to the british flag an faithfully serving the queen  if this is praiseworthy in the sergeant why should the talk of duty an service an honour to god be hypocrisy in the christian  does it not seem strange that we blue lightswho have discovered ourselves to be much worse than we thought ourselves an gladly accept jesus as our saviour from sinshould be charged with thinkin ourselves better than other people  come now cried jack molloy seating himself on the floor and leaning his back against the wall it do seem to me as you putt it stevenson that the charge ought to be all the other way for we who make no purfession of religion at all thinks ourselves so far righteous that weve got no need of a saviour  suppose now as weve got to as low a state o the dumps as men can well come to we all sits down in a row an have a palaver about this matterparson stevenson bein the chief spokesman  they all readily agreed to this proposal  indeed in the circumstances any proposal that offered the faintest hope of diverting their minds from present trouble would have been welcome to them at that moment the marine was nothing loath to fall in with the fancy of his irrepressible comrade but we do not propose to follow them in the talk that ensued  we will rather turn at once to those events which affected more immediately the fortunes of the captives  on the morning after their arrival in the city there was assembled in the principal square a considerable concourse of soudan warriors  they stood chatting together in various groups in front of a public building as if awaiting some chief or great man whose richly caparisoned steed stood in front of the main entrance with its outrunner standing before it  this runner was a splendid specimen of physical manhood  he was as black as coal as graceful as apollo and apparently as powerful as herculesif one might judge from the great muscles which stood out prominently on all his limbs he wore but little clothingmerely a pair of short arab drawers of white cotton a red fez on his head and a small tippet on his shoulders  unlike negroes in general his features were cast in a mould which one is more accustomed to see in the caucasian race of mankindthe nose being straight the lips comparatively thin and the face oval while his bearing was that of a man accustomed to command  the appearance of a few soldiers traversing the square drew the eyes of all in their direction and caused a brief pause in the hum of conversation  our friends the captives were in the midst of these soldiers and beside them marched the negro interpreter whom they had first met with in the prison  at the door of the public building the soldiers drew up and allowed the captives to pass in guarded by two officers and the interpreter inside they found a number of military men and dignitaries grouped around conversing with a stern man of strongly marked features  this mantowards whom all of them showed great deferencewas engaged when the captives entered they were therefore obliged to stand aside for a few minutes  who is he asked molloy of the negro interpreter  our great leader said the negro the mahdi  what the scoundrel thats bin the cause o all this kickup asked jack molloy in surprise  the interpreter did not quite understand the seamans peculiar language but he seemed to have some idea of the drift of it for he turned up his upturned nose in scorn and made no reply  in a few minutes an officer led the captives before the mahdi who regarded them with a dark frown directing his attention particularly to jack molloy as being the most conspicuous member of the party perhaps also because molloy looked at him with an air and expression of stern defiance  selecting him as a spokesman for the others the mahdi using the negro as an interpreter put him through the following examination  where do you come from he asked sternly  from suakim answered molloy quite as sternly  what brought you here  your dirtyfaced baboons  it is probable that the negro used some discretion in translating this reply for the chief did not seem at all offended but with the same manner and tone continued  do you know the number of men in suakim  yes  tell mehow many  to this molloy answered slowly quite enoughif you had only the pluck to come out into the open an fight like mento give you such a lickin that there wouldnt be a baboon o you left in the whole soudan  again it is probable that the interpreter did not give this speech verbatim for while he was delivering it the mahdi was scanning the features of the group of prisoners with a calm but keen eye  making a sign to one of his attendants to lead molloy to one side he said a few words to another who thereupon placed miles in front of his master  are you an officer was the first question put  no answered our hero with quiet dignity but without the slightest tinge of defiance either in tone or look  will you tell me how many men you have in suakim  no  dare you refuse  yes it is against the principles of a british soldier to give information to an enemy  thats right john miles said molloy in an encouraging tone give it im hot  they can only kill us once an  silence hissed the mahdi between his teeth  silence echoed the interpreter  all right you nigger  tell the baboon to go on  i wont run foul of him again he aint worth it  this was said with freeandeasy contempt  do you not know resumed the mahdi turning again to miles with a fierce expression that i have power to take your life  you have no power at all beyond what god gives to you said miles quietly  even the angry mahdi was impressed with the obvious truth of this statement but his anger was not much allayed by it  know you not he continued that i have the power to torture you to death  our hero did not at once reply  he felt that a grand crisis in his life had arrived that he stood there before an assemblage of unbelievers and that to some extent the credit of his countrymen for courage fidelity and christianity was placed in his hands  mahdi he said impressively as he drew himself up you have indeed the power to torture and kill me but you have not the power to open my lips or cause me to bring dishonour on my country  brayvo johnny  pitch into him cried the delighted molloy  fool exclaimed the mahdi whose ire was rekindled as much by the seamans uncomprehended comment as by our heros fearless look and tone you cannot bring dishonour on a country which is already dishonoured what dishonour can exceed that of being leagued with the oppressor against the oppressed  go  you shall be taught to sympathise with the oppressed by suffering oppression  he waved his hand and quickly leaving the court walked towards his horse where the finelooking negro runner stood and held his stirrup while he prepared to mount  instead of mounting however he stood for a few seconds looking thoughtfully at the ground  then he spoke a few words to the runner who bowed his head slightly as his master mounted and rode away  grasping a small lance and flag which seemed to be the emblems of his office he ran off at full speed in front of the horse to clear the way for his master  at the entrance to the building an official of some sort took hold of miless arm and led him away  he glanced back and observed that two armed men followed  at the same time he saw molloys head towering above the surrounding crowd as he and his comrades were led away in another direction  that was the last he saw of some at least of his friends for a considerable time  poor miles was too much distressed at this sudden and unexpected separation to take much note of the things around him  he was brought back to a somewhat anxious consideration of his own affairs by being halted at the gate of a building which was more imposing both in size and appearance than the houses around it  entering at the bidding of his conductors he found himself in an open court and heard the heavy door closed and bolted behind him  thereafter he was conducted to a small chamber which although extremely simple and almost devoid of furniture was both cleaner and lighter than that in which he and his comrades had been at first immured  he observed however with a feeling of despondency that it was lighted only by small square holes in the roof and that the door was very substantial  here his conductor left him without saying a word and bolted the door as he listened to the retreating steps of his jailer echoing on the marble pavement of the court a feeling of profound dejection fell upon our heros spirit and he experienced an almost irresistible tendency to give way to unmanly tears  shame however came to his aid and enabled him to restrain them  in one corner of the little room there was a piece of thick matting sitting down on it with his back against the wall the poor youth laid his face in his hands and began to think and to pray  but the prayer was not audible and who can describe the wide range of thoughtthe grief the anxiety for comrades as well as for himself the remorse the intense longing to recall the past the wish that he might awake and find that it was only a wild dream and above all the bitteralmost vengefulselfcondemnation  he was aroused from this condition by the entrance of a slave bearing a round wooden tray on which were a bowl of food and a jug of water  placing these before him the slave retired without speaking though he bestowed a glance of curiosity on the white infidel dog before closing the door  appetite had ever been a staunch friend to miles milton  it did not fail him now  soldierlife has usually the effect of making its devotees acutely careful to take advantage of all opportunities  he set to work on the bowlful of food with a will and was not solicitous to ascertain what it consisted of until it was safely washed down with a draught from the jug  being then too late to enter on an inquiry as to its nature he contented himself with a pleasing recollection that the main body of the compost was rice one of the constituents oil and that the whole was by no means bad  he also wished that there had been more of it and then resumed his previousand only possibleamusement of meditation  thinking like fighting is better done on a full stomach  he had gradually thought himself into a more hopeful state of mind when he was again interrupted by the entrance of visitorstwo armed men and the magnificent negro runner whom he had observed holding the mahdis horse one of the armed men carried a small bundle which he deposited on the ground and then stood beside his companion  both stood like sentinels with drawn swords ready apparently to obey the commands of the runner  advancing to the captive the latter producing a key unlocked and removed his manacles  these he handed to one of the men and turning again to miles said to his great surprise in english  undress and put on de tings in bundle  we may here observe that up to this time miles and his comrades in adversity had worn day and night the garments in which they had been captured  our hero was not sorry therefore at the prospect of a change  untying the bundle to see what substitute was given for his uniform he found that it contained only a pair of loose cotton drawers and a red fez  is this all he asked in surprise  all answered the negro  and what if i refuse to undress asked miles  your cloes will be tore off your back and you be bastinado  this was said so calmly and the three grave powerful men seemed so thoroughly capable of performing the deed that our hero wisely submitted to the inevitable and took off his uniform which one of the guards gathered up piece by piece as it was removed  then he pulled on the drawers which covered him from the waist to a little below the knees  when he had put on the red fez he found himself clothed in exactly the same costume as the runner with the exception of a small green tippet which barely covered the top of his shoulders and seemed to be worn rather as an ornament than a piece of clothing though perhaps it formed a slight protection from the sun  in this cool costume they left him carrying away his uniform as if more thoroughly to impress on him what uncommonly cool things they were capable of doing in the hot regions of the soudan    chapter twenty five  miles is promotedmolloy overthrows the mahdi and is elevated for so doing  next day miles milton became painfully aware of the fact that his life in captivity was not to be one of ease or idleness  soon after daybreak the door of his prison creaked on its ponderous hinges and he started up from the mat on which he had slept without covering of any kind  his visitor was the mahdis runner who after closing the door came and sat down beside him cross legged a la turk and tailor  for a brief space the handsome black stared steadily at miles who returned the compliment as steadily not being sure whether curiosity or insolence lay at the foundation of the stare  englishmin said the runner at last you is unfortnit  i am indeed returned miles at the same time i am fortunate in so unexpectedly finding one who recognises the fact and who can tell me so in my own tongue  may i venture to hope that you are friendly towards me  yes i am your friend but my friendness can do for you noting  like youself i am captiveslave  but in my own land i was a chief and friend of the great and good gordon so i is friend to all englishmin once i was terpreter to gordon but the mahdi came  i fell into his hands and now i do run befront his horse an hold de stirrup  i comes to you from the mahdi wid bad news  indeed  but i need not wonder  you could scarcely come from him with good news  what have you to tell  the mahdi has made you his runner answered the negro  that is strange news rather than bad is it not  no it is bad  he do dis cause he hate you  somehow you has anger him  he say he will tame you  he try to tame me said the negro with sudden and tremendous ferocity an him tink he do it  but i only waits my chance to kill him  now he send me again to dirty work an put you in my place to humble youto insult you before every one who will say look de bold christin dog lick de dust now an hold de mahdis stirrup  this is indeed bad news  but how is it that you who seem to be free do not use your opportunity to escape  i saw you holding the mahdis horse  it seems to be a splendid one  why did you not jump on its back and fly  the runner frowned and then changing his mood smiled sadly  you is young he said and knows noting  at night i am locked up like yourself  in de daytime de city is full of enemies who all knows me  do you tink dey will salute and say go in peace to de runner of de mahdi when he is running away with his best horse  perhaps not said miles but i would try if i were you  you will be me very soon returned the runner and you can try  i did trytwice  i was caught both times and beat near to death  but i did not die  i learn wisdom and now i submit and wait my chance to kill him  if you is wise you begin at once to submit and wait too  there is truth in what you say rejoined miles after a few minutes thought  i will take your advice and submit and wait but only till the opportunity to escape offers  i would not murder the man even if i had the chance  your words remind me of de good gordon  he was not vengeful  he loved god said the runner in a low and very different tone  but he added gordon was a white man  he did notcould notunderstand de feelings of de black chief  as the last remark opened up ground which miles was not prepared to traverse he made no rejoinder but asked the runner what the mahdi required of him in his new capacity  he require you to learn de city so as you know how to run when you is toldan i is to teach you so you come wid me said the runner rising  but am i to go in this costume or rather in this halfnaked state asked miles rising and spreading out his hands as he looked down at his unclothed chest and lower limbs  you not cause for be ashamed replied the runner with a nod  this was true for the hard travelling which miles had recently endured and the heavy burdens which he had borne had developed his muscles to such an extent that his frame was almost equal to that of the negro and a fit subject for the sculptors chisel  your white skin will praps blister at first continued the runner but your master will be glad for dat  here is a ting however will save you shoulders  now you makes fussrate runner  he took the little green tippet off his own shoulders and fastened it on those of his successor  come now he added let us see how you can run  they passed out into the street together and then poor miles felt the full sense of his degradation when he saw some of the passersby stop to gaze with looks of hatred or contempt or amusement at the christian captive  but he had not much leisure to think or feel for the negro ran him down one street and up another at a pace which would soon have exhausted him if besides being a naturally good runner he had not recently been forced to undergo such severe training  during the run his guide pointed out and named most of the chief places buildings and mosques  you will do said the negro pausing at length and turning towards his companion with a look of approval you amost so good as myself  with this compliment he proceeded to instruct the new runner in his duties and at night miles found himself again in his prison ready to do full justice to his bowl of ricecompost and to enjoy his blanketless mat bedif a man can be said to enjoy anything about which he is profoundly unconscious during the time of its enjoyment  next morning he awoke with a sensation that led him for a moment to fancy he must have gone supperless to bed  while he was waiting impatiently for breakfast he revolved several ideas in his mind one of which was that come what might he would not suffer any indignity however gross to get the better of him  he would take a leaf out of his friend stevensons book and bear patiently whatever was sent to him in the hope that by so doing he might gain the goodwill of his captors and thus perhaps be in a better position to take advantage of any opportunity to escape that might occur  he was very confident of his power of selfrestraint and trusted a good deal to that determination of will which we have before referred to as being one of his characteristics  that same day his powers were severely tested  all the morning he was left in his prison to fret in idleness but towards the afternoon he was called by his friend the exrunner to go out to his work  do what you is told an hold you tongue an keep your eyes on de ground  dems my advice said the negro as he resigned the bridle of the mahdis steed to his successor and placed the lance of office in his hand  just as he did so the mahdi came out of a doorway and advanced towards them while the negro retired and mingled with the crowd which had assembled to see the chief mount his horse  miles tried faithfully to attend to his friends injunctions but could not resist one glance at his new master which showed him that a cynical smile rested on his swarthy countenance a smile which he also observed was copied by those of the crowd who did not prefer to regard him with scowling looksfor the people of the soudan were naturally enough filled with indignation against all europeans and especially against the british at that time  the glance did not improve miless state of mind nevertheless he forced himself to look at the ground with an utterly expressionless face as he held the mahdis stirrup  he received a slight push from his masters foot instead of thanks when he had mounted but miles resolutely kept his eyes on the ground and restrained his rising wrath ignorant of the fact that the mahdi wished to point out the direction in which he was to run  a smart blow from the ridingswitch on his naked back aroused him to his duty and caused a slight laugh among the onlookers  never before perhaps was the mahdi so near his end as at that moment for as our hero felt the sting and heard the low laugh all the blood in his body seemed to leap into his brow and the lance of office quivered as his hand tightened on it  the fact that two guards with drawn swords stood at his side and that their weapons would have been in his heart before he could have accomplished the deed would probably have failed to restrain him had not his pride of purpose as we may style it come to his aid  he looked up with a frown indeed but without uttering a word  the mahdi pointed along one of the streets and miles instantly bounded awayheartily glad to be able to let off his superfluous feeling in violent action  for several hours his master kept him runningevidently on purpose to try his powers as a jockey might test the qualities of a new horse and strong though he was the poor youth began at last to feel greatly distressed and to pant a good deal  still his pride and a determination not to be beaten sustained him  at one point of his course he was passing a band of slaves who were labouring to lift a large beam of wood when the sound of a familiar voice caused him to look up and then he saw his friend jack molloy in costume like his own minus the fez and tippet with one of his great shoulders under the beam and the sweat pouring down his face  hallo miles exclaimed the seaman  but our hero did not dare to pause and could not speak  his glancing aside however had the effect of causing him to stumble and being too much exhausted at the time to recover himself he fell heavily to the ground  as he slowly rose up halfstunned the mahdi could scarcely avoid riding him down  as it was he stooped and a second time laid his ridingswitch smartly on the poor youths naked shoulders  jack molloy who saw the cruel act lost all control of himself uttered one of his leonine roars sprang into the middle of the road and seized the reins of the mahdis horse  the startled animal reared and attempted to swerve  molloy assisted the swerve by a violent sidepull at the reins  at the same time he caught one of the upraised forelegs and with an almost superhuman exertion of strength hurled both horse and rider to the ground  a very howl of consternation and amazement burst from the populace as they beheld their mahdi lying flat and motionless on his back as if dead  of course jack molloy was instantly seized by an overpowering number of soldiers bound hand and foot and carried back to his dungeon while the mahdi was tenderly raised and conveyed to the house which he inhabited at that time  miles had also been seized and dragged somewhat violently back to his prison  as for the other members of the captive band none of them were there at the time  they were all separated at the time our hero was taken from them and each remained for a considerable time in ignorance of the fate of his fellows  we may say at once here that they were all put to severe and menial labour  each also had his uniform exchanged for a pair of arabian drawers and a felt cap or a fez so that they were little better than naked  this would have mattered littlethe weather being very warmif their skins had been accustomed to the powerful rays of a tropical sun  but the effect on them was so severe that their taskmasters in an unwonted gush of pity at last gave them each a loose garment of sacking which served as a partial protection  after the incident which has just been related miles was permitted to remain during the rest of that day and night in his room  not so jack molloy  the anger of the populace was so powerfully aroused against the impetuous sailor that they clamoured for his instant execution and at last unable or unwilling to resist the pressure of public opinion the officers in charge of him gave in  they put a rope round his neck and led him to a spot where criminals were wont to be executed  as he went along and saw only scowling faces whenever he looked round in the hope of meeting some pitying eye the poor man began to feel convinced that his last hour had in very truth arrived  well well whod ha thowt it would ever come to this he sighed shaking his head mournfully as he came in sight of the place of execution  but after all ye richly desarve it john molloy for youve bin a bad lot the greater part o your life  again he looked on either side of him for hope was strongly enshrined in his broad bosom but not a friendly or even pitiful face could he see among all the hundreds that surrounded him  arrived at the place he glanced up at the beam over his head and for one moment thought of trying like samson to burst the bonds that held him but it was only for a moment  the impossibility of freeing himself was too obvious  he meekly bowed his head  another instant and the rope tightened round his neck and he felt himself swinging in the air  before his senses had quite left him however he felt his feet again touch the ground  the choking sensation passed away and he found himself supported by two men  a burst of mocking laughter then proved to the wretched man that his tormentors had practised on him the refined cruelty of halfhanging him  if he had had any doubt on this subject the remark of the interpreter as he afterwards left him in his cell to recover as best he might would have dispelled it  we will ang you dead de nex time    chapter twenty six  cruel treatmentdespair followed by hope and a joyful discovery  after the rough treatment he had received the mahdi as we may well believe did not feel more amiably disposed towards his prisoners  of course he had no reason for blaming miles for what had occurred nevertheless he vented his wrath against white men in general on him by keeping him constantly on the move and enforcing prolonged and unusual speed while running besides subjecting him publicly to many insults  it was a strange school in which to learn selfrestraint and humility but our hero profited by the schooling  necessity is a stern teacher and she was the headmistress of that school  among other things she taught miles to reason extensivelynot very profoundly perhaps nor always correctly but at all events in a way that he never reasoned before  the best way to convey to the reader the state of his mind will be to let him speak for himself  as he had a habit of thinking aloud for sociability as it werein the dark cell to which he had been relegated we have only to bend down our ear and listen  one night about a week after the overthrow of his tyrant master miles was seated on the hard floor of his cell leaning against the wall with his knees drawn up and his face in his handshis usual attitude when engaged in meditation after a hard days work  i wouldnt mind so much he murmured if i only saw the faintest prospect of its coming to an end but to go on thus from day to day perhaps year to year is terrible  no that cannot be if we cannot escape it wont be long till the end comes  a pause  the endthe end of a rope with a noose on it is likely to be my end unless i burst up and run amuck  no no miles milton dont you think of that what good would it do to kill halfadozen arabs to accompany you into the next world  the poor wretches are only defending their country after all  another pause  besides you deserve what youve got for so meanly forsaking your poor mother think o that miles when you feel tempted to stick your lance into the mahdis gizzard as molloy would have said  ah poor molloy  i fear that i shall never see you again in this life  after giving the mahdi and his steed such a tremendous heave they would be sure to kill you perhaps they tortured you to  he stopped at this point with an involuntary shudder  i hope not he resumed after another pause  i hope we may yet meet and devise some means of escape  god grant it  true the desert is vast and scorching and almost waterlessi may as well say foodless too and it swarms with foes but what then  have not most of the great deeds of earth been accomplished in the face of what seemed insurmountable difficulties  besides  he paused again here and for a longer time because there came suddenly into his mind words that had been spoken to him long ago by his mother with god all things are possible  yes miles he continued you must make up your mind to restrain your anger and indignation because it is useless to give vent to them thats but a low motive after all  is it worthy of an intelligent man i get a slap in the face and bear it patiently because i cant help myself  i get the same slap in the face in circumstances where i can help myself and i resent it fiercely  humble when i must be so fierce when ive got the power  is not this unmanlychildishhumbug there is no principle here  principle  i do believe i never had any principle in me worthy of the name  i have been drifting up to this time before the winds of caprice and selfish inclination  a long pause here  well it just comes to this that whatever happens i must submit with a good graceat least as good grace as i canand hope that an opportunity to escape may occur before long  i have made up my mind to do itand when i once make up my mind i  he paused once more at this point and the pause was so long that he turned it into a full stop by laying his head on the block of wood which formed his pillow and going to sleep  it will be seen from the above candid remarks that our hero was not quite as confident of his power of will as he used to bealso that he was learning a few useful facts in the school of adversity  one evening after a harder day than usual miles was conducted to the prison in which he and his companions had been confined on the day of their arrival  looking round the cell he observed on becoming accustomed to the dim light that only one other prisoner was there  he was lying on the bare ground in a corner coiled up like a dog and with his face to the wall relieved to find that he was not to be altogether alone miles sat down with his back against the opposite wall and awaited the waking of his companion with some interest for although his face was not visible and his body was clothed in a sort of sacking his neck and lower limbs showed that he was a white man  but the sleeper did not seem inclined to waken just then  on the contrary he began ere long to snore heavily  miles gradually fell into a train of thought that seemed to bring back reminiscences of a vague indefinable sort  then he suddenly became aware that the snore of the snorer was not unfamiliar  he was on the point of rising to investigate this when the sleeper awoke with a start sat bolt upright with a look of owlish gravity and presented the features of jack molloy  miles my lad cried jack springing up to greet his friend warmly i thought you was dead  and jack my dear friend returned miles i thoughtat least i fearedthat you must have been tortured to death  an you wasnt far wrong my boy  stand close to me and look me straight in the eyes  dee think im any taller  not muchat least not to my perception  why  i wonder at that now said molloy for ive bin hanged three times an should have bin pulled out a bit by this time considering my weight  his friend smiled incredulously  you may laugh lad but its no laughin matter said molloy feeling his neck tenderly  the last time i really thought it was all up wi me for the knot somehow got agin my windpipe an i was all but choked if they had kep me up half a minute longer it would have bin all over i amost wished they had for though i never was much troubled wi the narves im beginnin now to have a little fellowfeelin for the sufferins o the narvish  do you really mean my dear fellow that the monsters have been torturing you in this way asked miles with looks of sympathy  ay john miles thats just what i does mean returned the seaman with an anxious and startled look at the door on the other side of which a slight noise was heard at the moment  theyve halfhanged me three times already  the last time was only yesterday an at any moment they may come to give me another turn  its the uncertainty o the thing that tries my narves  i used to boast that i hadnt got none once but the arabs know how to take the boastin out of a fellow  if theyd only take me out to be hanged right off an done with it i wouldnt mind it so much but its the constant tenterhooks of uncertainty that floors me  howsever i aint quite floored yet  but lets hear about yourself miles  come sit down  i gets tired sooner than i used to do since they took to hangin me  how have they bin sarvin you out since i last saw ye  not near so badly as they have been serving you old boy said miles as he sat down and began to detail his own experiences  but tell me he added have you heard anything of our unfortunate comrades since we parted  nothingat least nothing that i can trust to  i did hear that poor moses pyne is dead that they had treated him the same as me and that his narves couldnt stand it that he broke down under the strain an died  but i dont believe it  not that these arabs wouldnt kill him that way but the interpreter who told me has got falsehood so plainly writ in his ugly face that i would fain hope our kindhearted friend is yet alive  god grant it may be so said miles fervently  and i scarcely think that even the cruellest of men would persevere in torturing such a gentle fellow as moses  mayhap youre right returned molloy anyhow well take what comfort we can out o the hope  talkin o comfort what dee think has bin comfortin me in a most wonderful way  youll never guess  what is it then  one o them little books as miss robinson writes and gives to soldiers and sailorsthe victory its called havin a good deal in it about nelsons flagship and nelson himself but theres a deal more than that in itwords that has gone straight to my heart and made me see gods love in christ as i never saw it before  our comrade stevenson gave it to me before we was nabbed by the arabs an ive kep it in the linin o my straw hat ever since  you see its a thin little thingthough theres oceans o truth in itan its easy stowed away  i forgot all about it till i was left alone in this place and then i got it out an god in his marcy made it like a light in the dark to me  stevenson came by it in a strange way  he told me he was goin over a battlefield after a scrimmage near suakim lookin out for the wounded when he noticed somethin clasped in a dead mans hand  the hand gripped it tight as if unwillin to part with it an when stevenson got it he found that it was this little book the victory  here it is  i wouldnt change it for a golden sov to every page  as he spoke footsteps were heard approaching the door  with a startled air molloy thrust the book into its place and sprang up  see there now he said remonstratively whod ever ha thowt that id come to jerk about like that  before the door opened however the momentary weakness had passed away and our seaman stood upright with stern brow and compressed lips presenting to those who entered as firm and selfpossessed a man of courage as one could wish to see  i knowed it he said in a quiet voice to his friend as two strong armed men advanced and seized him while two with drawn swords stood behind him  at the same time two others stood guard over miles theyre goin to give me another turn  god grant that it may be the last  yesde last  you be surely dead dis time said the interpreter with a malignant smile  if you hadnt said it i would have had some hope that the end was come said molloy as they put a rope round his neck and led him away  goodbye miles he added looking over his shoulder if i never come back an you ever gets home again give my kind regards to miss robinsongod bless her  next moment the door closed and miles was left alone  it is impossible to describe the state of mind in which our hero paced his cell during the next hour  the intense pity mingled with anxiety and fierce indignation that burned in his bosom were almost unbearable oh he thought if i were only once more free for one moment with a weapon in my hand id  he wisely checked himself in the train of useless thought at this point then he sat down on the floor covered his face with his hands and tried to pray but could not  starting up he again paced wildly about the cell like a caged tiger  after what seemed to him an age he heard footsteps in the outer court  the door opened and the sailor was thrust in  staggering forward a step or two he was on the point of falling when miles caught him in his arms and let him sink gently on the ground and sitting down beside him laid his head upon his knee from the inflamed red mark which encircled the seamans powerful neck it was obvious enough that the cruel monsters had again put him to the tremendous mental agony of supposing that his last hour had come  help me up lad and set my back agin the wall he said in a low voice  as miles complied one or two tears that would not be repressed fell from his eyes on the sailors cheek  youre a good fellow said molloy looking up  i thank the lord for sendin you to comfort me and i do need comfort a bit just now dee know  thereim better aready an ill be upside wi them next time for i feels somehow that i couldnt stand another turn  poor moses i do hope that the interpreter is the liar he looks and that they havent treated the poor fellow to this sort o thing  even while he spoke the door of the cell again opened and armed men entered  ay here you are cried the sailor rising quickly and attempting to draw himself up and show a bold front  come away an welcome  im ready for ee  but the men had not come for molloy  they wanted miles over whom there came a sudden and dreadful feeling of horror as he thought they were perhaps going to subject him to the same ordeal as his friend  keep up heart lad and trust in the lord said the sailor in an encouraging tone as they led our hero away  the words were fitly spoken and went far to restore to the poor youth the courage that for a moment had forsaken him  as he emerged into the bright light which dazzled him after the darkness of his prisonhouse he thought of the sun of righteousness and of the dear mother who had sought so earnestly to lead him to god in his boyhood  one thing that greatly encouraged him was the fact that no rope had been put round his neck as had been done to molloy and he also observed that his guards did not treat him roughly  moreover they led him in quite a different direction from the open place where he well knew that criminals were executed  he glanced at the interpreter who marched beside him and thought for a moment of asking him what might be his impending fate but the mans look was so forbidding that he forbore to speak  presently they stopped before a door which was opened by a negro slave and the guards remained outside while miles and the interpreter entered the court into which they were ushered was open to the sky and contained a fountain in the centre with boxes of flowers and shrubs around it  at the inner end of it stood a tall powerful arab leaning on a curved sword  miles saw at a glance that he was the same man whose life he had saved and who had come so opportunely to the rescue of his friend molloy  but the arab gave him no sign of recognition  on the contrary the glance which he bestowed on him was one of calm stern indifference  ask him he said at once to the interpreter where are the christian dogs who were captured with him  tell him replied miles when this was translated that i know nothing about the fate of any of them except one  which one is that  the sailor answered miles  where is he  in the prison i have just left  and you know nothing about the others  nothing whatever  the arab seemed to ponder these replies for a few minutes  then turning to the interpreter he spoke in a tone that seemed to miles to imply the giving of some strict orders after which with a wave of his hand and a majestic inclination of the head he dismissed them  although there was little in the interview to afford encouragement miles nevertheless was rendered much more hopeful by it all the more that he observed a distinct difference in the bearing of the interpreter towards him as they went out  who is that he ventured to ask as he walked back to the prison  that is mohammed the mahdis cousin answered the interpreter  miles was about to put some more questions when he was brought to a sudden stand and rendered for the moment speechless by the sight of moses pynenot bearing heavy burdens or labouring in chains as might have been expected but standing in a shallow recess or niche in the wall of a house busily engaged over a small brazier cooking beans in oil and selling the same to the passersby  what you see demanded the interpreter  i see an old friend and comrade  may i speak to him asked miles eagerly  you may answered the interpreter  the surprise and joy of moses when his friend slapped him on the shoulder and saluted him by name is not easily described  i am so glad to see you old fellow he said with sparkling eyes i thought you must be dead for ive tried so often to find out what had become of you  have some beans and oil  he dipped a huge ladleful out of the pot as if he were going to administer a dose on the spot  no thank you moses im a prisoner  these are my guards  i wonder they have allowed me even to exchange a word with you  must be quick they told us you had been halfhanged till you were frightened to death  they told you lies then  ive been very well treated but what troubles me is i cant find out where any of our comrades have gone to  i can tell only of one  molloy is alive  i wish i could say hes well  of the others im as ignorant as yourself  but ive seen a friend who  at this point he was interrupted by the interpreter and told to move on which he was fain to do with a cheery goodbye to moses and a wave of the hand  arrived at the prison he found that molloy had been removed to a more comfortable room into which he was also ushered and there they were left alone together  dyou feel better now my poor fellow asked miles when the door was shut  better bless you yes  i feels far too well  theyve given me a rare blowout of beans an oil since you were taken off to be hanged and i feels so strong that the next turn off wont finish me  i could never have eaten em thinkin of you but dee know i was quite sure from the way they treated you as you went out that it warnt to be hangin wi you this time  an when they putt me into this here room an produced the beans an oil i began to feel quite easy in my mind about you  it was the man that brought your marchin orders that told em to putt me here  dee know lad i cant help feelin that a friend o some sort must have bin raised up to us  youre right jack i have just seen the arab whose life i saved and who saved yours  its very strange too that beans and oil should have been your fare today for i have also seen moses pyne in the street not halfanhour since cooking and selling beans and oil  you dont mean that  indeed i do  ive spoken to him  sitting down on a stoolfor they were promoted to a furnished apartmentmiles entered into an elaborate account of all that had befallen him since the hour that he had been taken out as they both thought to be hanged    chapter twenty seven  in which hopes and fears rise and fall  there is a tide in the affairs of men undoubtedly and the tide in the affairs of miles milton and his comrades appeared to have reached lowwater at this time for on the day mentioned in the last chapter it began to turn and continued for a considerable time to rise  the first clear evidence of the change was the blowout of beans and oil coupled with the change of prison  the next was the sudden appearance of the beansandoilman himself  why i do believeitsits moses exclaimed molloy as his old comrade entered the prison  give us your flipper  man alive but im right glad to see you  we thought you waslets have a look at your neck  no nothing there  i knowed as that interpreter was a liar  but what brings you here lad  what mischief have ee bin up to  thats what puzzles myself jack said moses shaking hands warmly with miles  ive done nothing that i know of except sell beans and oil  its true i burned em sometimes a bit but theyd hardly put a fellow in jail for thatwould they  however im glad theyve done it whatever the reason seeing that it has brought us three together again but i say continued moses while a look of anxiety came over his innocent face what can have become of our other comrades  you may well ask that lad  ive asked the same question of myself for many a day but have never bin able to get from myself a satisfactory answer  im wery much afeared that well never see em again  it seemed almost to be a springtide in the affairs of the trio at that time for while the seaman was speakingas if to rebuke his want of faiththe door opened and their comrade armstrong walked in  for a few moments they were all rendered speechless  then miles sprang up seized his friend by both shoulders and gazed into his face it was a very thin and careworn face at that time as if much of the bloom of youth had been wiped from it for ever  willie  am i dreaming exclaimed miles  if you are so must i be replied his friend for when i saw you last you had not taken to halfnakedness as a costume  come now retorted miles you have not much to boast of in that way yourself  there you are wrong miles for i have to boast that i made my garment myself  true its only a sack but i cut the hole in the bottom of it for my head with my own hand and stitched on the short sleeves with a packingneedle  but i say whats been the matter with molloy  have they been working you too hard jack  no willum no i cant exactly say that but theyve bin hangin me too hard  ill tell ee all about it in coorse o time  man alive but they have took the flesh off your bones somehow lets seeno your necks all right  must have bin some other way  the way was simple enough returned the other  when they separated us all at first they set me to the hardest work they could findto dig draw water carry burdens that a horse might object to sweep and clean up in fact everything and anything and theyve kep us hard at it ever since  i say us because rattlin bill simkin was set to help me after the first day an weve worked all along together  poor simkin there aint much rattle in him now except his bones  i dont know why they sent me here and not him  and i cant well make out whether im sent here for extra punishment or as a favour  have you seen or heard anything of stevenson asked moses  i saw him once about a week ago staggering under a great logwhether in connection with housebuilders or not i cant tell  it was only for a minute and i got a tremendous cut across the back with a cane for merely trying to attract his attention  the tide it will be seen had been rising pretty fast that afternoon it may be said to have come in with a rush when towards evening the door of their prison once more opened and simkin with stevenson were ushered in together both clothed alike in an extemporised sackgarment and short drawers with this difference that the one wore a species of felt hat the other a fez  they were still in the midst of delighted surprise at the turn events seemed to be taking when two men entered bearing trays on which were six smoking bowls of beans and oil  hallo  moses your business follows you even to prison exclaimed molloy  true jack and ill follow my business up returned moses sitting down on the ground which formed their convenient table and going to work  we need scarcely say that his comrades were not slow to follow his example  the tide may be said to have reached at least halfflood if not more when on the following morning the captives were brought out and told by the interpreter that they were to accompany a body of troops which were about to quit the place under the command of mohammed the mahdis cousin  does the mahdi accompany us  miles ventured to ask  no  the mahdi has gone to khartoum returned the interpreter who then walked away as if he objected to be further questioned  the hopes which had been recently raised in the breasts of the captives to a rather high pitch were however somewhat reduced when they found that their supposed friend mohammed treated them with cool indifference did not even recognise them and the disappointment was deepened still more when all of them except miles were loaded with heavy burdens and made to march among the baggageanimals as if they were mere beasts of burden  the savage warriors also treated them with great rudeness and contempt  miles soon found that he was destined to fill his old post of runner in front of mohammed his new master  this seemed to him unaccountable for runners he understood were required only in towns and cities not on a march  but the hardships attendant on the post and the indignities to which he was subjected at last convinced him that the mahdi must have set the mind of his kinsman against him and that he was now undergoing extra punishment as well as unique degradation  the force that took the field on this occasion was a very considerable onewith what precise object in view was of course unknown to all except its chiefs but the fact that it marched towards the frontiers of egypt left no doubt in the mind of any one  it was a wild barbaric host badly armed and worse drilled but fired with a hatred of all europeans and a burning sense of wrong  what think ye now miles asked armstrong as the captives sat grouped together in the midst of the host on the first night of their camping out in the desert  i think that everything seems to be going wrong answered miles in a desponding tone  at first i thought that mohammed was our friend but he has treated me so badly that i can think so no longer  dont you think he may be doing that to blind his followers as to his friendship said moses for myself i cant help thinkin he must be grateful for what you did miles  i only wish you had not touched my rifle that day said rattling bill fiercelybeing fatigued and out of temperfor the blackguard would have bin in kingdom come by this time  theres no gratitude in an arab  i have no hope at all now  my hope is in god said stevenson  well mate commonsense tells me that that should be our best ground of hope observed molloy but common experience tells me that the almighty often lets his own people come to grief  god never lets em come to grief in the sense that you mean returned the marine  if he kills his people he takes them away from the evil to come and death is but a doorway into glory  if he sends grief and suffering it is that they may at last reach a higher state of joy  pooh according to that view nothing can go wrong with them that you call his people said simkin with contempt  right you are comrade rejoined stevenson nothing can go wrong with us nothing can separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord and you may be one of us this minute if you will accept gods offer of free salvation in christ  silence followed for simkin was too angry as well as worn out to give his mind seriously to anything at that time and the others were more or less uncertain as to the truth of what was advanced  sleep profound and dreamless soon banished these and all other subjects from their minds  blessed sleep so aptly as well as beautifully styled tired natures sweet restorer  that great host of dusky warriorssome unquestionably devout many cruel and relentless not a few probably indifferent to everything except self and all bent on the extermination of their whiteskinned foeslay down beside their weapons and shared in that rest which is sent alike to the just and to the unjust through the grand impartiality forbearance and love of a god whom many people apparently believe to be a respecter of persons  a few days later the little army came to the edge of a range of hills beyond which lay the plains of the vast nubian desert  at night they encamped at the base of the hillcountry through which they had been travelling and the captives were directed to take up their position in front of an old ruined hut where masses of broken stones and rubbish made the ground unsuitable for camping on  just like them growled simkin looking about for a fairly level spot theres not a place big enough for a dog to lie on  supper made rattling bill a little more amiable though not much more forgiving to his foes  a threequarters moon soon afterwards shed a faint light on the host which except the sentries was sound asleep  towards midnight a solitary figure moved slowly towards the place where the captives lay and awakened miles who sat up stared winked and rubbed his eyes two or three times before he could bring himself to believe that his visitor was no other than the chief of the host mohammed  rise  com  i speak small engleesh  miles rose at once and followed the chief into the ruined hut  clear de ground he said pointing to the centre of the floor  our hero obeyed and when the loose rubbish was cleared away the moonbeams shining through the ruined roof fell on a ring bolt  being ordered to pull it he raised a cover or trapdoor and discovered beneath what appeared to be a cellar  now said mohammed listen you an friends go downall  i shut door and cover uprubsh  when we all go way com out and go home see yonder is home  he pointed to the northeastward where a glowing star seemed to hang over the margin of the great level desert  you are generousyou are kind exclaimed miles with a burst of enthusiasm  me grateful said mohammed extending his hand in european fashion which miles grasped warmly  go wake you comerads  tell what me say and com quick  miles was much too welldisciplined a soldier to hesitate though he would have liked much to suggest that some of the troops might before starting take a fancy to explore the ruin and to ask how long they should remain in the cellar before venturing out  quietly awaking all his comrades and drawing their surprised heads together he whispered his tale in their wondering ears  after that they were quite prepared to act and accompanied him noiselessly into the ruin  is the cellar deep asked miles as he was about to descend  no not deep  but what about grubwhittles meat an wateryou know said molloy with difficulty accommodating his words to a foreigner  well starve if we go adrift on the desert with nothin to eat or drink  herefood said mohammed unslinging a wellfilled haversack from his shoulders and transferring it to those of the sailor  stop there he continued pointing to the cellar till you hears gunsshootnoise i have make preprations  after that silence  then com out an go home  once again he pointed towards the glowing star in the northeast  mohammed exclaimed molloy becoming suddenly impressed with the generous nature of the arabs action i dont know as youre a descendant o the prophet but i do know that youre a brick  give us your flipper before we part  with a grave expression of kindliness and humour the chief shook hands with the seaman  then the captives all descended into the hole which was not more than four feet deep after which the arab shut the trap covered it as before with a little rubbish and went away  suppose he has bolted the door suggested moses  hold your tongue man and listen for the signal said miles  i forget what he said the signal was to be observed simkin  gunsshootnoiseafter that silence said armstrong  its a queer signal  but not difficult to recognise when we hear it remarked miles  the time seemed tremendously long as they sat there listeningthe cellar was too low for them to standand they began to fancy that all kinds of horrible shapes and faces appeared in the intense darkness around them  when they listened intensely kept silent and held their breath their hearts took to beating the drums of their ears and when a sudden breath or sigh escaped it seemed as if some african monster were approaching from the surrounding gloom  is that you simkin thats breathin like a grampus asked molloy after a long pause  i was just goin to ask you to stop snorin retorted the soldier  hush  theres a shot  it was indeed a distant shot followed immediately by several more then a rattle of musketry followednearer at hand  instantly as if the earth had just given birth to them the host of dusky warriors sprang up with yells of surprise and defiance and spear in hand rushed in the direction of the firing  for a few minutes the listeners in the cellar heard as it had been a mighty torrent surging past the ruined hut  gradually the force of the rush began to abate while the yells and firing became more distant at last all sounds ceased and the listeners were again oppressed by the beating on the drums of their ears  theyre all goneevery mothers son said molloy at last breaking the oppressive silence  thats so said rattling bill up wi the trap miles  youre under it aint you  im suffocating in this hole  im not under it  molloy came down last said miles  what if we cant find it suggested stevenson  horrible said moses in a hoarse whisper and this may be a huge cavern with miles of space around us instead of a small cellar  here it is cried the sailor making a heave with his broad back  i sayit wont move  ah i wasnt rightly under it  yo heaveo  up went the door with a crash and the soft moonlight streamed in upon them  a few seconds more and they stood outside the hutapparently the only living beings in all that region which had been so full of human life but a few minutes before  now we must lose no time in getting away from this place and covering as much of the desert as we can during the night said miles for it strikes me that well have to lie quiet during the day for fear of being seen and chased  they spoke together in whispers for a few minutes deciding the course they meant to pursue  then molloy shouldered the provision bag miles grasped his official lancethe only weapon they had among themand off they set on their journey across the desert like a ship entering on an unknown sea without the smallest idea of how far they were from the frontier of egypt and but a vague notion of the direction in which they ought to go    chapter twenty eight  a horrible situation  all that night our fugitives walked steadily in the direction of their guidingstar until the dawn of day began to absorb its light  then they selected a couple of prominent bushes on the horizon and by keeping these always in their relative positions were enabled to shape their course in what they believed to be the right direction  by repeating the process continuously they were enabled to advance in a fairly straight line  molloy as we have said carried the provision bag and although it was a very heavy one he refused to let his comrades relieve him of it until breakfasttime  then it was discovered that inside of the large bag there were rolled tight up four smaller bags with shoulderstraps to them  a knowin feller that mohammed is said jack molloy as he handed a bag to each he understands how to manage things  lets see what sort o grub he has  corncakes i do believe an dates or some sort o dried fruit anwaterbottles well that is a comfort  now then boys go ahead  we cant afford to waste time over our meals  the others so thoroughly agreed with their friend on this point that they began to eat forthwith almost in silence  then the provisions having been distributed they resumed their march which was almost a forced one so anxious were they to get as far away as possible from the arab army  coming to a large mimosa bush in the course of the morning they halted and sat down to rest a little and hold what the sailor called a palaver  you see boys he said itll be of no manner of use our scuddin away before the wind under a press o canvas like this without some settled plan  aint our plan to git away from the arabs as fast as we can said moses pyne who sat on a stone at the sailors feet  yes moses but thats only part of it returned molloy  we must keep away as well as get awayan that wont be quite so easy for the country is swarmin wi the darkskinned rascals as the many tracks we have already passed shows us  if we was to fall in wi a band of em even a small onewe would be took again for sartin for weve got nothin to fight wi but our fists  these would offer but poor resistance to bullet and steel said armstrong and that lance youre so fond of miles wouldnt be worth much  not much admitted miles surveying the badge of his late office but better than nothing  what if the arabs should change their course and fall in with us again asked moses  no fear o that seein that mohammed himself gave us our sailin orders an laid our course for us but it would never do to fall in wi other bands so i proposes that we cast anchor where we are for theres pretty good holdin ground among them bushes keep quiet all day an travel only at night  ive got the krect bearins just now so wen the stars come out well be able to fix on one layin in the right direction and clap on all sail slow and aloftstun sls skyscrapers an all the rest on it  a good plan jack said armstrong but what if it should come cloudy and blot out the stars  besides added miles you forget that men of the desert are skilled in observing signs and in following tracks  should any of them pass near this little clump of bushes and observe our footsteps going towards it they will at once come to see if we are still here  molloy put his head on one side and looked perplexed for a moment  never mind  let em come he said with a sudden look of sagacity well circumwent em  theres nothin like circumwention wen youve got into a fix  see here  well dig a hole in a sandbank big enough to hold us all an well cut a big bush an stick it in front of the hole so as theyll never see it  we can keep a bright lookout you know an if anything heaves in sight on the horizon down we go into the hole stick up the bush an there you areall safe under hatches till the enemy clears off  but they will trace our footsteps up to the hole or the bush said miles and wonder why they can trace them no further  what then  again the seaman fell into perplexed meditation out of which he emerged with a beaming smile  why then my lad well bamboozle em  theres nothin like bamboozlement wen circumwention fails  putt the two together an theyre like a hurricane in the tropics carries all before it  well bamboozle em by runnin for an hour or two all over the place so as no mortal man seein our footprints will be able to tell where we comed from or what weve bin adoin of  you dont know the men of the desert jack rejoined miles with a laugh  theyd just walk in a circle round the place where you propose to run about and bamboozle them till they found where our tracks entered this bit of bush  then as theyd see no tracks leaving it of course theyd know that we were still there  dyou see  thats a puzzler for you jack remarked moses as he watched the perplexed expression looming up again like a cloud on the sailors face  by no manner o means retorted molloy with sudden gravity  i sees my way quite clear out o that  you remember the broad track not half a mile off from where we now sit  yes made i suppose by a pretty big band o some sort crossin the desert said moses  well lad arter runnin about in the bush to bamboozle of em as aforesaid well march back to that track on the souwestardas it may bean then do the same on the norwestardso to speakan so lead em to suppose we was a small party as broke off or was sent off from the main body to reconnoitre the bit o bush an had rejoined the main body further on  thats what i call circumwentin dee see  while this palaver was going on stevenson and bill simkin were standing a short way off taking observation of something in the far distance  in a few minutes they ran towards their comrades with the information that a band of men were visible on the horizon moving they thought in an opposite direction to their line of march  it may be so said miles after a brief survey but we cant be sure we must put part of your plan in force anyhow jack molloy  away into the scrub all of you and stoop as you go  in saying this our hero almost unintentionally took command of the little party which at once tacitly accorded him the position  leading themas every leader oughthe proceeded to the centre of the clump of bushes where finding a natural hollow or hole in the sand at the root of a mimosa bush three of them went down on hands and knees to scoop it out deeper while the others cut branches with molloys claspknife  using flat stones chips of wood and hands as shovels they managed to dig out a hole big enough to conceal them all the opening to which was easily covered by a mass of branches  it is doubtful whether this ingenious contrivance would have availed them if men of the desert had passed that way but fortune favoured them  the band whether friends or foes passed far off to the westward leaving them to enjoy their place of fancied security  to pass the first day there was not difficult  the novelty of the position was great the interest of the thing immense  indefinite hopes of the future were strong and they had plenty to say and speculate about during the passing hours  when night came preparation was made for departure  the provision bags were slung a moderate sip of water indulged in and they set forth after a very brief prayer by stevenson that god would guide them safely on their way  there was no formality in that prayer  the marine did not ask his comrades to kneel or to agree with him  he offered it aloud in a few seconds in the name of jesus leaving his hearers to join him or not as they pleased  see that you lay your course fair now molloy said miles as they sallied out upon the darkening plain  trust me lad ive taken my bearins  it was very dark the first part of the night as the moon did not rise till late but there was quite enough light to enable them to proceed with caution though not enough to prevent their taking an occasional bush or stump for an advancing foe  all went well however until dawn the following morning when they began to look about for a suitable clump of bushes in which to conceal themselves  no such spot could they find  never mind lads said the inexhaustible molloy well just go on till we find a place  were pretty tough just now thats one comfort  they were indeed so tough that they went the whole of that day with only one or two brief halts to feed  towards evening however they began to feel wearied and with one consent determined to encamp on a slight eminence a short way in advance the sides of which were covered with low scrub  as they approached the spot an unpleasant odour reached them  it became worse as they advanced  at last on arriving they found to their surprise and horror that the spot had been a recent battlefield and was strewn with corpses and broken weapons  some days must have elapsed since the fight which strewed them there for the bodies had been all stripped and many of them were partially buried while others had been hauled half out of their graves by those scavengers of the desert hyenas and vultures  impossible to halt here said armstrong  i never witness a sight like this that it does not force on me the madness of warfare  what territorial gain can make up for these lost livesthe flower of the manhood of both parties  but what are we to do objected molloy  men must defend their rights  not necessarily so said stevenson  men have to learn to bear and forbear  i have learned to take advantage of what luck throws in my way said rattling bill picking up a rifle which must have escaped the observation of the plunderers who had followed the army  the body of the poor fellow who had owned it was found concealed under a bush not far off  he was an english soldier and a very brief inspection showed that the battle had been fought by a party of british and egyptian troops against the soudanese  it seemed as if the plunderers had on this occasion been scared from their horrible work before completing it for after a careful search they found rifles with bayonets and pouches full of ammunition more than sufficient to arm the whole party  there are uniforms enough too to fit us all out said simkin as they were about to leave the scene of slaughter  no dead mens cloes for me said moses pyne with a shrug of disgust  jack molloy declared that he had become so used to loose cotton drawers and an easyfittin sack that for his part he had no desire to go back to civilised costume and as the rest were of much the same opinion no change was made in the habiliments of the party except that each appropriated a pair of boots and miles exchanged his green tippet for a flannel shirt and a pith helmet  he also took a revolver with some difficulty from the dead hand of a soldier and stuck it in his belt  thus improved in circumstances they gladly quitted the ghastly scene and made for a bushy hillock a few hundred yards in advance  on the way they were arrested by the sound of distant firing  mohammed must have met our countrymen exclaimed molloy with excited looks as they halted to listen  it may be so but there are other bands about besides his said miles whats that a cheer  ay a british cheer in the far distance replied to by yells of defiance  molloy echoed the cheer in spite of his better judgment  lets run an jine em he exclaimed  come along then cried miles with the ardour of inexperienced youth  stop are ye mad cried stevenson  dont it stand to reason that the enemy must be between us an suakim and thats the same as sayin theyre between us an our friends  moreover the cheerin proves that our side must be gettin the best of it an are drivin the enemy this way so all weve got to do is to hide on that hillock an bide our time  right you are comrade cried rattling bill examining his cartridges and asserting with an oath that nothing would afford him greater pleasure than a good handtohand fight with the black and something worse scoundrels  dont swear at your enemies simkin said the marine quietly but when you get the chance fire low  agreeing with stevensons advice to bide their time the little band was soon on the top of the hillock and took up the best position for defending the place also for observing the fight which they could now see was drawing gradually nearer to them  they were not kept waiting long for the natives were in full flight hotly pursued by the english and indian cavalry  a slight breeze blowing from the north carried not only the noise but soon the smoke of the combat towards them  as they drew nearer a large detachment of native spearmen was seen to make for the hillock evidently intending to make a stand there  now comes our turn said armstrong examining the lock of his rifle to see that all was right  england expecs every man etceterer said molloy with a glance at miles  capting you may as well let us know your plans so as we may work together  miles was not long in making up his mind  youll fire at first by command he said quickly but decidedly then down on your faces flat and load  after that wait for orders  when it comes to the pushas its sure to do at lastwell stand back to back and do our best  god help us to do it well  dont hurry boys especially in square  let every shot tell  he had barely concluded this brief address when the yelling savages reached the hillock  miles could even see the gleaming of their teeth and eyes and the blood of the slightly wounded coursing down their black skins as they rushed panting towards the place where he and his little party were crouching  then he gave the word readypresent  the smoke fire and death to the leading men which belched from the bushes did not check the rush for more than a moment  and even that check was the result of surprise more than fear  a party of those arabs who were armed with rifles instantly replied but the bullets passed harmlessly over the prostrate men  again the voice of miles was heard readypresent and again the leading men of the enemy fell but the rushing host only divided and swept round the hillock so as to take it on both sides at once  nowform square and pick each man cried miles springing up and standing back to back with armstrong  molloy stood shoulder to shoulder with him and backed bill simkin while stevenson did the same for moses pyne  the bushes did not rise much above their waists and as the dusky host suddenly beheld the knot of strangelooking men whose bristling bayonets glistened in the setting sunshine and whose active rifles were still dealing death among their ranks they dashed at the hilltop with a yell of mingled rage and surprise  another moment and spearmen were dancing round the little square like incarnate fiends but the white men made no sound  each confined himself to two actsnamely load and fireand at every shot a foremost savage fell until the square became encircled with dead men  another moment and a party of arab riflemen ran to the front and took aim  just then a tremendous cheer was heard  the defenders of the hillock made a wild reply which was drowned in a furious fusillade the entire savage host seemed to rush over the spot sweeping all before it while smoke rolled after them as well as lead and fire  in the midst of the hideous turmoil miles received a blow which shattered his left wrist  grasping his rifle with his right hand he laid about him as best he could  next moment a blow on the head from behind stretched him senseless on the ground  the return of our hero to consciousness revealed to him that he was still lying on the battlefield that it was night and that an intolerable weight oppressed his chest  this last was caused by a dead native having fallen across him  on trying to get rid of the corpse he made the further discovery that nearly all his strength was gone and that he could scarcely move his right arm although it was free and as far as he could make out unwounded  making a desperate effort he partially relieved himself and raising his head tried to look round his ears had already told him that near to him wounded men were groaning away the little of life that remained to them he now saw that he was surrounded by heaps of dead men  excepting the groans referred to the night was silent and the moon shone down on hundreds of upturned facesthe bloodless grey of the black men contrasting strangely with the deadly pallor of the white all quiet and passionless enough now here and there the head of a warrior resting peacefully on the bosom or shoulder of the foe who had killed him  a slight noise on his right caused miles to turn his head in that direction where he saw a wounded comrade make feeble efforts to raise himself and then fall back with a deep groan  in other circumstances our hero would have sprung to his assistance but at that moment he felt as if absolutely helpless indeed he was nearly so from loss of blood he made one or two efforts to rise but the weight of the dead man held him down and after a few brief attempts he fainted  recovering again he looked round attracted by the sound of a struggle on his right  one of those fiends in human form the plunderers of a battlefield had in his ghoulish progress come across the wounded man who lay close to miles and the man was resisting him  the other put a quick end to the strife by drawing a knife across the throat of the poor fellow  a horror of great darkness seemed to overwhelm miles as he saw the blood gush in a deluge from the gaping wound  he tried to shout but as in a nightmare he could neither speak nor move  as the murderer went on rifling his victim miles partially recovered from his trance of horror and anxiety for his own life nerved him to attempt action of some sort  he thought of the revolver for the first time at that moment and the remembrance seemed to infuse new life into him  putting his right hand to his belt he found it there but drew it with difficulty  doubting his power to discharge it by means of the trigger alone he made a desperate effort and cocked it  the click made the murderer start  he raised himself and looked round our hero shut his eyes and lay perfectly still  supposing probably that he must have been mistaken the man resumed his work  miles could have easily shot him where he kneeled if he had retained power to lift his arm and take an aim  as it was he had strength only to retain the weapon in his grasp  after a short time that seemed an age to the helpless watcher the murderer rose and turned his attention to another dead man but passing him came towards miles whose spirit turned for one moment to god in an agonising prayer for help  the help came in the form of revived courage  calm cool firm selfpossession seemed to overbear all other feelings  he half closed his eyes as the murderer approached and gently turned the muzzle of the revolver upwards  he even let the man bend over him and look close into his face to see if he were dead then he pulled the trigger  miles had aimed he thought at the mans breast but the bullet entered under his chin and went crashing into his brain  a gush of warm blood spouted over miless face as the wretch plunged over him head first and fell close by his side  he did not die at once  the nature of the ground prevented miles from seeing him but he could hear him gradually gasp his life away  a few minutes later and footsteps were heard ascending the hillock miles grasped his revolver with a hand that now trembled from increasing weakness but he was by that time unable to put the weapon on full cock despair had wellnigh seized him when a familiar voice was heard  this way lads  im sure it was hereabouts that i saw the flash  macleod gasped miles as the big scotsman was about to pass  losh me  john miles is that you  are ye leevin  scarcely was all that the poor youth could utter ere he became again insensible  a fatigue party tramped up with a stretcher at the moment  macleod with a handkerchief checked the ebbing tide of life and they bore away from the bloody field what seemed little more than the mortal remains of poor miles milton    chapter twenty nine  describes a few meetings and several surprises  the fight described in the last chapter was only one of the numerous skirmishes that were taking place almost daily near suakim at that time but it turned out to be a serious occasion to our hero for it cost him one of his hands and put an end to his soldiering days for ever  on being taken to the british lines the surgeons saw at once that amputation a little above the wrist was absolutely necessary  of course milesalthough overwhelmed with dismay on hearing the fiat of the doctorscould offer no objection  with the informal celerity of surgical operations as practised in the field the shattered limb was removed and almost before he could realise the full significance of what was being done our poor hero was minus his left hand  besides this he was so cut and battered about that most of his hair had to be cut off and his head bandaged and plastered so that those of his old comrades who chanced to be with the troops at the time could recognise him only by his voice  even that was scarcely audible when he was carried into suakim  at this time the hospitals at suakim were overcrowded to such an extent that many of the wounded and invalids had to be sent on by sea to suez and the hospitals at ramleh  miles was sent on along with these and finally found rest at alexandria  and great was the poor fellows need of rest for besides the terrible sufferings and hardships he had endured while in captivity the wounds and bruises the loss of blood and of his left hand and the fatigue of the voyage his mind was overwhelmed by the consideration that even if he should recover he was seriously maimed for life  in addition to all this suffering miles while at suakim had received a blow which wellnigh killed him  a letter came informing him of the sudden death of his father and bitter remorse was added to his misery as he lay helpless in his cot on the red sea  the consequent depression acting on his already exhausted powers after he reached alexandria brought him to the verge of the grave  indeed one of the nurses said one day to one of her fellows with a shake of her head ah poor fellow he wont last long  wont he thought miles with a feeling of strong indignation  much you know about it  you see miles possessed a tendency to abstract reasoning and could meditate upon his own case without so to speak much reference to himself  his indignation was roused by the fact that any one calling herself a nurse should be so stupid as to whisper beside a patient words that he should not hear  he did not know that the nurse in question was a new onenot thoroughly alive to her duties and responsibilities  strange to say her stupidity helped to render her own prophecy incorrect for the indignation quickened the soldiers feeble pulse and that gave him a fillip in the right direction  the prostration however was very great and for some time the life of our hero seemed to hang by a thread  during this dark period the value of a godly mothers teaching became deeply impressed on him by the fact that texts from gods word which had been taught him in childhood and which he seemed to have quite forgotten came trooping into his mind and went a long way to calm and comfort him  he dwelt with special pleasure on those that told of love and mercy in jesus to the thankless and undeserving for now that strength health and the high hopes of a brilliant career were shattered at one blow his eyes were cleared of lifes glamour to see that in his existence hitherto he had been ungodlynot in the sense of his being much worse than ordinary people but in the sense of his being quite indifferent to his maker and that his fancied condition of notsobadness would not stand the test of a dying hour  about this time too he became desperately anxious to write to his mother not by dictation but with his own hand  this being impossible in the circumstances he began to fret and his power to sleep at length failed him  then a strange desire to possess a rose seized himperhaps because he knew it to be his mothers favourite flower  whatever the cause the longing increased his insomnia and as he did not say perhaps did not know that the want of a rose had anything to do with his complaint no one at first thought of procuring one for him  he was lying meditating wakefully about many things one day when one of the nurses approached his bed  he did not see her at first because his head was so swathed in bandages that only one eye was permitted to do duty and that as molloy might have said was on the leeside of his nosesupposing the side next the nurse to represent the windard side  i have been laid up a long time said a lady who accompanied the nurse and have been longing to resume my visits here as one or two patients whom i used to nurse are still in hospital  the heart of miles gave a bound such as it had not attempted since the night he witnessed the murder on the battlefield for the voice was that of mrs drew  this is one of our latest arrivals remarked the nurse lowering her voice as they advanced  a poor young soldierlost a hand and badly woundedcant sleep  he has taken a strange longing of late for a rose and i have asked a friend to fetch one for him  how lucky that we happen to have one with us said mrs drew looking back over her shoulder where her daughter stood concealed from view by her ample person  marion dear will you part with your rosebud to a wounded soldier  certainly mother i will give it him myself  she stepped quickly forward and looked sadly at the solitary glowing eye which gazed at her as she unfastened a rosebud from her bosom  it was evident that she did not recognise miles and no wonder for besides the mass of bandages from out of which his one eye glowed there was a strip of plaster across the bridge of his nose a puffy swelling in one of the cheeks and the handsome mouth and chin were somewhat veiled by a rapidly developing moustache and beard  miles did not speakhe could not speak he scarcely dared to breathe as the girl placed a red rosebud in his thin hand  his trembling fingers not only took the rose but the hand that gave it and pressed it feebly to his lips  with a few words of comfort and good wishes the ladies passed on  then miles drew the rose down under the bedclothes put it to his lips and with a fervently thankful mind fell into the first profound slumber that he had enjoyed for many days  this was a turningpoint  from that day miles began to mend  he did not see marion again for some time for her visit had been quite incidental but he was satisfied to learn that she was staying at the institute with her mother assisting the workers there  he wisely resolved to do and say nothing at that time but patiently to wait and get well for he had a shrewd suspicion that to present himself to marion under existing circumstances would be to say the least injudicious  meanwhile time which waits for no man passed on  as miles became stronger he began to go about the hospital chatting with the convalescent patients and trying to make himself generally useful  on one of these occasions he met with a man who gave him the sorrowful news that sergeant hardy was dead leaving miles his executor and residuary legatee  he also learned to his joy that his five comrades armstrong molloy stevenson moses and simkin had escaped with their lives from the fight on the hillock where he fell and that though all were more or less severely wounded they were doing well at suakim moreover continued his informant i expect to hear more about em tonight for the mail is due and ive got a brother in suakim  that night not only brought news of the five heroes but also brought themselves for having all been wounded at the same time all had been sent to alexandria together  as they were informed at suakim that their comrade miles had been invalided home they did not of course make further inquiry about him there  while they stayed there awaiting the troopship which was to take them home they made miss robinsons institute their constant rendezvous for there they not only found all the comforts of english life but the joy of meeting with many old comrades not a few of whom were either drawn or being drawn to god by the influences of the place  it chanced that at the time of their arrival mrs drew and her daughter had gone to visit an english family living in the city and did not for several days return to the institute thus the invalids failed to meet their lady friends at first  but about this time there was announced a source of attraction in the large hall which brought them together this attractionwhich unites all creeds and classes and nationalities in one great bond of sympathywe need hardly say was music  a concert was to take place in the great hall of the institute for some local charity we believe but are not sure at which the elite of alexandria was expected and the musical talent of alexandria was to performamong others the band of the somethingth regiment  and let us impress on you reader that the band of the somethingth regiment was something to be proud of  this brought numerous friends to the officers house and great numbers of soldiers and jacktars to the various rooms of the institute  in one of these rooms towards evening our friend stevenson was engaged at the request of the superintendent in relating to a number of earnestminded men a brief account of the wonderful experiences that he and his comrades had recently had in the soudan and jack molloy sat near him emphasising with a nod of his shaggy head or a right you are messmate or a slap on his thigh all the marines points especially those in which his friend passing over second causes referred all their blessings and deliverances direct to his loving god and father  in another room a biblereading was going on accompanied by prayer and praise  in the larger rooms tea coffee etcetera were being consumed to an extent that no fellow can understand except those who did it  games and newspapers and illustrated magazines etcetera were rife elsewhere while a continuous roar rather the conventional buzz of conversation was going on everywhere  but apparently not a single oath in the midst of it all  the moral atmosphere of the place was so pure that even bad men respectedperhaps approvedit  just before the hour of the concert our friends the five invalids sat grouped round a table near the door  they were drinking tea and most of them talking with tremendous animationfor not one of them had been wounded in the tongue  indeed it did not appear that any of them had been very seriously wounded anywhere  while they were yet in the midst of their talk two ladyworkers came down the long room followed by two other ladies in deep mourning the younger of whom suddenly sprang towards our quintet and clasping her hands stood speechless before them staring particularly at jack molloy who returned the gaze with interest  beg pardn miss drew exclaimed the sailor starting up in confusion and pulling his forelock but youve hove me all aback  mr molloy gasped marion grasping his hand and looking furtively round is it possible  have you all escaped  isis  yes miss weve all escaped thank god an were all herecept john miles in coorse for hes bin invalided home  hes no more invalided home than yourself jack said a seaman who was enjoying his coffee at a neighbouring table leastwise i seed john miles myself yesterday in hospital wi my own two eyes as isnt apt to deceive me  are ye sure o that mate cried molloy turning in excitement to the man and totally forgetting marion  mother let us go out whispered the latter leaning heavily on mrs drews arm  they passed out to the verandahscarcely observed owing to the excitement of the quintet at the sailors newsand there she would have fallen down if she had not been caught in the arms of a soldier who was advancing towards the door  mr miles exclaimed mrs drew as she looked up in amazement at the scarred and worn face  ay mrs drew through gods mercy i am here  but help me i have not strength to carry her now  marion had nearly fainted and was led with the assistance of her mother to a retired part of the garden and placed in an easychair  seeing that the girl was recovering the other ladies judiciously left them and miles explained to the mother while she applied smellingsalts to marion that he had come on purpose to meet them hoping and expecting that they would be attracted to the concert like all the rest of the world though he had scarcely looked for so peculiar a meeting  but how did you know we were here at all asked mrs drew in surprise  i saw you in the hospital replied miles with a peculiar look  your kind daughter gave me a rose  he pointed as he spoke to a withered bud which was fastened to his coat  butbutthat young man had lost his hand the nurse told us so exclaimed mrs drew with a puzzled look  miles silently pointed to the handless arm which hung at his left side  marion had turned towards him with a halffrightened look  she now leaned back in her chair and covered her face with both hands  mr miles said the wise old lady with a sudden and violent change of subject your friends armstrong and molloy are in the institute at this moment waiting for you  our hero needed no second hint  next minute he dashed into the entrance hall with wonderful vigour for an invalid for he heard the bass voice of molloy exclaiming  i dont care a button leave or no leave ill make my way to john mi hallo  the hallo was caused by his being rushed into by the impetuous miles with such force that they both staggered  why john youre like the ram of an ironclad  is it really yourself give us your flipper my boy  but the flipper was already in that of willie armstrong while the others crowded round him with congratulations  wot on airths all the noise about in that there corner exclaimed a jacktar who was trying hard to tell an interminable story to a quiet shipmate in spite of the din  its only that weve diskivered our captin cried molloy eager to get any one to sympathise  wot captins that growled the jacktar  why him as led us on the hillock to be sure at suakim  when acts of heroism and personal prowess are of frequent occurrence deeds of daring are not apt to draw general attention unless they rise above the average  the affair of the hillock however as it got to be called although unnoticed in despatches or the public prints was wellknown among the rank and file who did the work in those hot regions  when therefore it became known that the six heroes who had distinguished themselves on that hillock were present a great deal of interest was exhibited  this culminated when a little man rushed suddenly into the room and with a wild hooroo seized molloy round the waisthe wasnt tall enough to get him comfortably by the neckand appeared to wrestle with him  its corporal flynnor his ghost exclaimed molloy  sure an its both him an his ghost togither exclaimed the corporal shaking hands violently all round  i thought ye was sent home said moses  niver a bit man they tell awful lies where youve come from  i wouldnt take their consciences as a gift  im as well as iver and better but im goin home for all that to see me owld grandmother  ye neednt laugh you spalpeens  come three cheers boys for the heroes o the hillock  most heartily did the men there assembled respond to this call and then the entire assembly cleared off to the concert with the exception of miles milton  he as corporal flynn knowingly observed had other fish to fry  he fried these fish in company with mrs and marion drew but as the details of this culinary proceeding were related to us in strict confidence we refuse to divulge them and now draw the curtain down on the ancient land of egypt    chapter thirty  conclusion  once more we return to the embarkation jetty at portsmouth  there as of old we find a huge whitepainted troopship warping slowly in her bulwarks and ports crowded with white helmets and eager faces gazing at the equally eager but anxious faces on shore  miss robinsons coffeeshed shows signs of life  our friend brown is stimulating the boiler  the great solitary porthole has been opened and the neverfailing ladyworkers are there preparing their ammunition and getting ready for action for every troopship that comes to portsmouth from foreign shores laden with the bronzed warriors of britain has to face the certainty of going into action with that unconquerable little coffeeshed  we do not however mean to draw the reader again through the old scene further than to point out that among the many faces that loom over these bulwarks five are familiar namely those of our friends miles milton william armstrong moses pyne stevenson and simkin  jack molloy is not with them because he has preferred to remain in egypt believing himself to be capable of still further service to queen and country  a feeling of great disappointment oppresses miles and his friend armstrong for they fail to recognise in the eager crowd those whom they had expected to see  my mother must be ill muttered miles  so must my emmy murmured his friend  there was a very anxious little widow on the jetty who could not manage to distinguish individuals in the sea of brown faces and white helmets because the tears in her eyes mixed them all up most perplexingly  it is not surprising that miles had totally failed to recognise the mother of old in the unfamiliar widows weedsespecially when it is considered that his was a shrinking timid mother who kept well in the background of the demonstrative crowd  their eyes met at last however and those of the widow opened wide with surprise at the change in the son while those of the son were suddenly blinded with tears at the change in the mother  then they metand such a meetingin the midst of men and women elbowing crowding embracing exclaiming rejoicing chaffing weeping it was an awkward state of things but as every one else was in the same predicament and as all were more or less swallowed up in their own affairs miles and his mother were fain to make the best of it  they retired under the partial shelter of a bulkhead where blocktackles and nautical debris interfered with their footing and tarry odours regaled their noses and there in semipublicity they interchanged their first confidences  suddenly mrs milton observed a tall young fellow standing not far off looking wistfully at the bewildering scene apparently in deep dejection  who is that miles she asked  why thats my comrade chum and friend whom i have so often written about willie armstrong  come  i will introduce you  oh how selfish of me cried the widow starting forward and not waiting for the introduction mr armstrongim so sorry forgive me  i promised to let you know that your wife waits to meet you at the soldiers institute  the difference between darkness and light seemed to pass over the soldiers face then a slight shade of anxiety clouded it  she is not ill is she  no no quite well said mrs milton with a peculiar smile but she thought it wiser not to risk a meeting on the jetty as the east wind is sharp  im so sorry i did not tell you at once but i selfishly thought only  pray make no apology madam interrupted armstrong  im so thankful that all is well  i had begun to fear that something must be wrong for my emmy never disappoints me  if she thinks it wiser not to meet on the jetty it is wiser  a crowd of men pushed between them at this moment  immediately after a female shout was heard followed by the words there he is  och its himsilfthe darlint  mrs flynn had discovered the little corporal and her trooper son terence who had come down with her stood by to see fairplay while the two embraced  drifting with a rather rapid tide of mingled human beings miles and his mother soon found themselves stranded beside the coffeeshed  retiring behind this they continued their conference there disturbed only by wind and weather while the distribution of hot coffee was going on in front  meanwhile when leave was obtained armstrong made his way to the institute where the old scene of bustle and hilarity on the arrival of a troopship was going on  here in a private room he discovered emmy and the cause of her not appearing on the jetty  look at himwillie the second cried the little woman holding up a bundle of some sort  the soldier was staggered for a momentthe only infantry that had ever staggered himfor his wife had said nothing about this bundle in her letters  he recovered however and striding across the room embraced the wife and the bundle in one tremendous hug  the wife did not object but the bundle did and instantly set up a howl that quite alarmed the father and was sweetest music in the mothers ears  now tell me said the little woman after calming the baby and putting it in a crib have you brought miles milton home all safe  yes all right emmy  and is he married to that dear girl you wrote about  no not yetof course  but are they engaged  no  miles told me that he would not presume to ask her while he had no home to offer her  pooh  hes a goose  he ought to make sure of her and let the home look after itself  he may lose her  girls you know are changeable giddy things  i know nothing of the sort emmy  the young wife laughed andwell there is no need to say what else she did  about the same time mrs milton and her son were seated in another private room of the institute finishing off that interchange of confidences which had begun in such confusion  as it happened they were conversing on the same subject that occupied emmy and her husband  you have acted rightly miles said the mother for it would have been unfair and selfish to have induced the poor girl to accept you until you had some prospect of a home to give her  god will bless you for doing the right and trusting to him  and now dear boy are you prepared for bad news  prepared for anything answered miles pressing his mothers hand but i hope the bad news does not affect you mother  it does  your dear father died a bankrupt  i shrank from telling you this when you were wounded and ill  so you have to begin again the battle of life with only one hand my poor boy for the annuity i have of twenty pounds a year will not go far to keep us both  mrs milton tried to speak lightly on this point by way of breaking it to her son but she nearly broke down for she had already begun to feel the pinch of extreme poverty and knew it to be very very different from what welloff people fancy  the grave manner in which her son received this news filled her with anxiety  mother he said after pondering in silence for a few moments and taking her hand in his while he slipped the handless arm round her waist the news is indeed serious but our father whom you have trusted so long will not fail us now  happily it is my right hand that has been spared and wonders you know may be wrought with a strong right hand especially if assisted by a strong left stump into which spoons forks hooks and all manner of ingenious contrivances can be fitted  now cheer up little mother and ill tell you what we will do  but first is there nothing left  do the creditors take everything  all i believe except some of the furniture which has been kindly left for us to start afresh with  but we must quit the old home next month at least so i am told by my kind little lawyer who looks after everything for i understand nothing  your mention of a lawyer reminds me mother that a poor sergeant who died a short time ago in egypt made me his executor and as i am painfully ignorant of the duties of an executor ill go and see this kind little lawyer if you will give me his address  leaving miles to consult his lawyer we will now turn to a meetinga grand teafightin the great hall of the institute that took place a few days after the return of the troopship which brought our hero and his friends to england  some telling incidents occurred at this fight which render it worthy of notice  first miss robinson herself presided and gave a stirring address which if not of much interest to readers who did not hear it was a point of immense attraction to the hundreds of soldiers sailors and civilians to whom it was delivered for it was full of sympathy and information and humour and encouragement and above all of the gospel  everybody worth mentioning was therethat is everybody connected with our tale who was in england at the time  miles and his mother of course were there and armstrong with emmyay and with willie the second toowho was pronounced on all hands to be the born image of his father alas for his father if that had been true  a round piece of dough with three holes punched in it and a little knot in the midst would have borne as strong a resemblance to miles as that baby did  nevertheless it was a magnificent baby and so good undeniably good for it slept soundly in its little mothers lap the whole evening  stevenson was also there you may be sure and so were moses and sutherland and rattling bill simkin and corporal flynn with his mother and terence the irish trooper who fraternised with johnson the english trooper who was also home on the sicklistthough he seemed to have a marvellous colour and appetite for a sick man  is that the soldiers friend asked simkin in a whisper of a man who stood near him as a lady came on the platform and took the chair  ay thats her answered the manand the speaker was thomas tufnell the extrooper of the queens bays and the present manager of the instituteay thats the soldiers friend  well i might have guessed it returned simkin from the kindly way in which she shook hands with a lot of soldiers just now  yes she has shook hands with a good many redcoats in her day has the soldiers friend returned the manager  why i remember on one occasion when she was giving a lecture to soldiers and so many men came forward to shake hands with her that as she told me herself her hand was stiff and swelled all night after it  but its not so much for what she has done for ourselves that were grateful to her remarked a corporal who sat on simkins right as for what she has done for our wives widows and children through the soldiers and sailors wives aid association  lookin arter them when were away fightin our countrys battles has endeared her to us more than anything else  thus favourably predisposed simkin was open to good impressions that night  but indeed there was an atmospherea spirit of goodwillin the hall that night which rendered many others besides simkin open to good impressions  among the civilians there was a man named sloper who had for some time past been carefully fished for by an enthusiastic young redcoat whom he had basely misled and swindled  he had been at last hooked by the young redcoat played and finally landed in the hall with his captor beside him to keep him therefor sloper was a slippery fish with much of the eel in his nature  perhaps the most unexpected visitors to the hall were two ladies in mourning who had just arrived from egypt by way of brindisi  mrs and miss drew having occasion to pass through portsmouth on their way home learned that there was to be a teafight at the institute and marion immediately said i should like so much to see it  however much so much was mrs drew said she would like to see it as much so away they went and were conducted to the front row there miles saw them  with his heart in his mouth and his head in confusion he quietly rose bade his wondering mother get up conducted her to the front seat and setting her down beside the drews introduced them  then sitting down beside marion he went in for a pleasant evening  and it was a pleasant evening  besides preliminary tea and buns there were speeches songs recitations etceteraall being received with immense satisfaction by a crowded house which had not yet risen to the unenviable heights of classical taste and blaseism  as for miles and marion nothing came amiss to them  if a singer had put b flat in the place of a natural they would have accepted it as quite natural  if a humourist had said the circle was a square they would have believed itin a senseand tried to square their reason accordingly  but nothing is without alloy in this life  to the surprise of miles and his mother their kind little lawyer also made his appearance in the hall  more than that he insisted by signs that miles should go out and speak with him  but miles was obdurate  he was anchored and nothing but cutting the cable could move him from his anchorage  at last the kind little man pushed his way through the crowd  i must have a word with you my dear sir  it is of importance he said  thus adjured miles unwillingly cut the cable and drifted into a passage  my dear sir said the little man seizing his hand i congratulate you  youre very kind but pray explain why  i find that you are heir to a considerable fortune  miles was somewhat interested in this and asked hows that  well you remember hardys will which you put into my hands a few days ago  yes what then  that cant be the fortune  indeed it is  hardy you remember made you his residuary legatee  i find on inquiry that the old cousin you told me about who meant to leave all his money to build a hospital changed his mind at the last and made out a will in favour of hardy who was his only relative  so you see you being hardys heir have come into possession of something like two thousand a year  to this miles replied by a whistle of surprise and then said is that all  upon my word sir said the kind little lawyer in a blaze of astonishment you appear to take this communication in a peculiar manner  you mistake me returned miles with a laugh  i dont mean is that all the fortune but is that all you have to say  it is and to my mind i have said a good deal  you certainly have  and believe me i am not indifferent or unthankful butbutthe fact is that at present i am particularly engaged  goodbye and thank you  so saying miles shook the puzzled old gentleman heartily by the hand and hurried back to his anchorage in the hall  ive done it mother whispered miles two days thereafter in the privacy of the institute readingroom  miles said the startled lady with a reproachful look i thought you said that nothing would induce you  circumstances have altered mother  i have had a long consultation with your kind little lawyer and he has related some interesting facts to me  here followed a detailed account of the facts  so you see i went and proposed at oncenot to the lawyerto marion  and was accepted  wellyes  i could hardly believe it at the time  i scarcely believe it now so im going back this afternoon to make quite sure  i congratulate you my darling boy for a good wife is gods best gift to man  how do you know she is good mother  i know it becausei know it  anybody looking in her face can see it  and with two thousand a year why  one thousand mother  i thought you said two my son  so i did  that is the amount of the fortune left by the eccentric old hospitalforincurables founder  when poor hardy made out his will he made me residuary legatee because the trifle he had to leavehis kit etceterawas not worth dividing between me and armstrong  if it had been worth much he would have divided it  it is therefore my duty now to divide it with my friend  but in our anxiety to tell you these interesting facts dear reader we have run ahead of the teafight  to detail all its incidents all its bearings all its grand issues and blessed influences would require a whole volume  we return to it only to mention one or two gratifying facts  it was essentially a temperancethat is a totalabstinence a blueribbonmeeting and at the end the soldiers friend earnestly invited all who felt so disposed to come forward and sign the pledge at the same time medals and prizes were presented to those among the civilians who had loyally kept their pledge intact for certain periods of time  on an average over a thousand pledges a year are taken at the institute and we cannot help thinking that the year we are writing of must have exceeded the averageto judge from the numbers that pressed forward on this particular night  there were soldiers sailors and civilians men women and children amongst the first rattling bill simkin walked to the fronthis moral courage restored to an equality with his physical heroismand put down his name  so did johnson and sutherlandthe former as timid before the audience as he had been plucky before the soudanese but walking erect nevertheless as men do when conscious that they are in the right the latter as bold as brassas if to defy the world in arms to make him ever again drink another drop of anything stronger than tea  moses pyne also put on the blue although to do him justice he required no protection of that sort and so did corporal flynn and terence and their motherwhich last if truth must be told stood more in need of the pledge than her stout sons  among the civilians several noted personages were influenced in the right direction  chief among these was sodden bleareyed disreputable sloper whose trembling hand scrawled a hieroglyphic supposed to represent his name which began indeed with an s but ended in a mysterious prolongation and was further rendered indecipherable by a penitent tear which fell upon it from the point of his red red nose  some people laughed and said that there was no use in getting sloper to put on the blueribbon that he was an utterly demoralised man that he had no strength of character that no power on earth could save him they were right  no power on earth could save himor them  these people forgot that it is not the righteous but sinners who are called to repentance  time passed away and wrought its wonted changes  among other things it brought back to portsmouth big burly jack molloy as hearty and vigorous as he was when being halfhanged in the soudan butminus a leg  poor jack a spent cannonballwould that it had been spent in vainremoved it below the knee much more promptly than it could have been taken off by the surgeons knife  but what was loss to the royal navy was gain to portsmouth for jack molloy came home and devoted himself heart and soul to the lending of a helping hand to his fellowcreatures in distressdevoting his attentions chiefly to the region lying round nobbs lane and causing himself to be adored principally by old women and children  and there and thus he probably works to this dayat least some very like him do  when not thus engaged he is prone to take a cruise to a certain rural district in the south of england where he finds congenial company in two very tall erect moustached dignified gentlemen who have a tendency to keep step as they walk one of whom has lost his left hand and who dwell in two farmhouses close together  these two gentlemen have remarkably pretty wives and wonderfully boisterous children and the uproar which these children make when molloy comes to cast anchor among them is stupendous  as for the appearance of the brood and of jack after a spree among the hay the word has yet to be invented which will correctly describe it  the two militarylooking farmers are spoken of by the people around as philanthropists  like true philanthropists whose foundationmotive is love to god they do not limit their attentions to their own little neighbourhood but allow their sympathies and their benefactions to run riot round the worldwheresoever there is anything that is true honourable just pure lovely or of good report to be thought of or done or assisted  only one of these acts of sympathy and benefaction we will mention every christmas there is received by miss robinson at the soldiers institute portsmouth a huge hamper full of old and new garments of all kindsshoes boots gowns frocks trousers shawls comforters etceterawith the words written inside the lidblessed are they that consider the poor  and on the same day come two cheques in a letter we refuse for the best of all reasons to divulge the amount of those cheques but we consider it no breach of confidence to reveal the fact that the letter containing them is signed by two old and grateful blue lights  the end
