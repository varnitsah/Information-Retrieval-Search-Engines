94954298	la mere bauche from tales from all countries     the pyreneean valley in which the baths of vernet are situated is not much known to english or indeed to any travellers  tourists in search of good hotels and picturesque beauty combined do not generally extend their journeys to the eastern pyrenees  they rarely get beyond luchon and in this they are right as they thus end their peregrinations at the most lovely spot among these mountains and are as a rule so deceived imposed on and bewildered by guides innkeepers and horseowners at this otherwise delightful place as to become undesirous of further travel  nor do invalids from distant parts frequent vernet  people of fashion go to the eaux bonnes and to luchon and people who are really ill to bareges and cauterets it is at these places that one meets crowds of parisians and the daughters and wives of rich merchants from bordeaux with an admixture now by no means inconsiderable of englishmen and englishwomen  but the eastern pyrenees are still unfrequented  and probably they will remain so for though there are among them lovely valleysand of all such the valley of vernet is perhaps the most lovelythey cannot compete with the mountain scenery of other touristsloved regions in europe  at the port de venasquez and the breche de roland in the western pyrenees or rather to speak more truly at spots in the close vicinity of these famous mountain entrances from france into spain one can make comparisons with switzerland northern italy the tyrol and ireland which will not be injurious to the scenes then under view  but among the eastern mountains this can rarely be done  the hills do not stand thickly together so as to group themselves the passes from one valley to another though not wanting in altitude are not close pressed together with overhanging rocks and are deficient in grandeur as well as loveliness  and then as a natural consequence of all this the hotelsare not quite as good as they should be  but there is one mountain among them which can claim to rank with the pic du midi or the maledetta  no one can poohpooh the stern old canigou standing high and solitary solemn and grand between the two roads which run from perpignan into spain the one by prades and the other by le boulon  under the canigou towards the west lie the hot baths of vernet in a close secluded valley which as i have said before is as far as i know the sweetest spot in these eastern pyrenees  the frequenters of these baths were a few years back gathered almost entirely from towns not very far distant from perpignan narbonne carcassonne and bezieres and the baths were not therefore famous expensive or luxurious but those who believed in them believed with great faith and it was certainly the fact that men and women who went thither worn with toil sick with excesses and nervous through overcare came back fresh and strong fit once more to attack the world with all its woes  their character in latter days does not seem to have changed though their circle of admirers may perhaps be somewhat extended  in those days by far the most noted and illustrious person in the village of vernet was la mere bauche  that there had once been a pere bauche was known to the world for there was a fils bauche who lived with his mother but no one seemed to remember more of him than that he had once existed  at vernet he had never been known  la mere bauche was a native of the village but her married life had been passed away from it and she had returned in her early widowhood to become proprietress and manager or as one may say the heart and soul of the hotel bauche at vernet  this hotel was a large and somewhat rough establishment intended for the accommodation of invalids who came to vernet for their health it was built immediately over one of the thermal springs so that the water flowed from the bowels of the earth directly into the baths there was accommodation for seventy people and during the summer and autumn months the place was always full  not a few also were to be found there during the winter and spring for the charges of madame bauche were low and the accommodation reasonably good  and in this respect as indeed in all others madame bauche had the reputation of being an honest woman  she had a certain price from which no earthly consideration would induce her to depart and there were certain returns for this price in the shape of dejeuners and dinners baths and beds which she never failed to give in accordance with the dictates of a strict conscience  these were traits in the character of an hotelkeeper which cannot be praised too highly and which had met their due reward in the custom of the public  but nevertheless there were those who thought that there was occasionally ground for complaint in the conduct even of madame bauche  in the first place she was deficient in that pleasant smiling softness which should belong to any keeper of a house of public entertainment  in her general mode of life she was stern and silent with her guests autocratic authoritative and sometimes contradictory in her house and altogether irrational and unconciliatory when any change even for a day was proposed to her or when any shadow of a complaint reached her ears  indeed of complaint as made against the establishment she was altogether intolerant  to such she had but one answer  he or she who complained might leave the place at a moments notice if it so pleased them  there were always others ready to take their places the power of making this answer came to her from the lowness of her prices and it was a power which was very dear to her  the baths were taken at different hours according to medical advice but the usual time was from five to seven in the morning  the dejeuner or early meal was at nine oclock the dinner was at four after that no eating or drinking was allowed in the hotel bauche there was a cafe in the village at which ladies and gentlemen could get a cup of coffee or a glass of eau sucre but no such accommodation was to be had in the establishment  not by any possible bribery or persuasion could any meal be procured at any other than the authorised hours  a visitor who should enter the salle a manger more than ten minutes after the last bell would be looked at very sourly by madame bauche who on all occasions sat at the top of her own table  should any one appear as much as half an hour late he would receive only his share of what had not been handed round  but after the last dish had been so handed it was utterly useless for any one to enter the room at all  her appearance at the period of our tale was perhaps not altogether in her favour  she was about sixty years of age and was very stout and short in the neck  she wore her own gray hair which at dinner was always tidy enough but during the whole day previous to that hour she might be seen with it escaping from under her cap in extreme disorder  her eyebrows were large and bushy but those alone would not have given to her face that look of indomitable sternness which it possessed  her eyebrows were serious in their effect but not so serious as the pair of green spectacles which she always wore under them  it was thought by those who had analysed the subject that the great secret of madame bauches power lay in her green spectacles  her custom was to move about and through the whole establishment every day from breakfast till the period came for her to dress for dinner  she would visit every chamber and every bath walk once or twice round the salle a manger and very repeatedly round the kitchen she would go into every hole and corner and peer into everything through her green spectacles  and in these walks it was not always thought pleasant to meet her  her custom was to move very slowly with her hands generally clasped behind her back  she rarely spoke to the guests unless she was spoken to and on such occasions she would not often diverge into general conversation  if any one had aught to say connected with the business of the establishment she would listen and then she would make her answersoften not pleasant in the hearing  and thus she walked her path through the world a stern hard solemn old woman not without gusts of passionate explosion but honest withal and not without some inward benevolence and true tenderness of heart  children she had had many some seven or eight  one or two had died others had been married she had sons settled far away from home and at the time of which we are now speaking but one was left in any way subject to maternal authority  adolphe bauche was the only one of her children of whom much was remembered by the present denizens and hangerson of the hotel he was the youngest of the number and having been born only very shortly before the return of madame bauche to vernet had been altogether reared there  it was thought by the world of those parts and rightly thought that he was his mothers darlingmore so than had been any of his brothers and sistersthe very apple of her eye and gem of her life  at this time he was about twentyfive years of age and for the last two years had been absent from vernetfor reasons which will shortly be made to appear  he had been sent to paris to see something of the world and learn to talk french instead of the patois of his valley and having left paris had come down south into languedoc and remained there picking up some agricultural lore which it was thought might prove useful in the valley farms of vernet  he was now expected home again very speedily much to his mothers delight  that she was kind and gracious to her favourite child does not perhaps give much proof of her benevolence but she had also been kind and gracious to the orphan child of a neighbour nay to the orphan child of a rival innkeeper  at vernet there had been more than one water establishment but the proprietor of the second had died some few years after madame bauche had settled herself at the place  his house had not thrived and his only child a little girl was left altogether without provision  this little girl marie clavert la mere bauche had taken into her own house immediately after the fathers death although she had most cordially hated that father  marie was then an infant and madame bauche had accepted the charge without much thought perhaps as to what might be the childs ultimate destiny  but since then she had thoroughly done the duty of a mother by the little girl who had become the pet of the whole establishment the favourite plaything of adolphe bauche and at last of course his early sweetheart  and then and therefore there had come troubles at vernet  of course all the world of the valley had seen what was taking place and what was likely to take place long before madame bauche knew anything about it  but at last it broke upon her senses that her son adolphe bauche the heir to all her virtues and all her riches the first young man in that or any neighbouring valley was absolutely contemplating the idea of marrying that poor little orphan marie clavert  that any one should ever fall in love with marie clavert had never occurred to madame bauche  she had always regarded the child as a child as the object of her charity and as a little thing to be looked on as poor marie by all the world  she looking through her green spectacles had never seen that marie clavert was a beautiful creature full of ripening charms such as young men love to look on marie was of infinite daily use to madame bauche in a hundred little things about the house and the old lady thoroughly recognised and appreciated her ability  but for this very reason she had never taught herself to regard marie otherwise than as a useful drudge she was very fond of her protegeeso much so that she would listen to her in affairs about the house when she would listen to no one elsebut maries prettiness and grace and sweetness as a girl had all been thrown away upon maman bauche as marie used to call her  but unluckily it had not been thrown away upon adolphe  he had appreciated as it was natural that he should do all that had been so utterly indifferent to his mother and consequently had fallen in love  consequently also he had told his love and consequently also marie had returned his love  adolphe had been hitherto contradicted but in few things and thought that all difficulty would be prevented by his informing his mother that he wished to marry marie clavert  but marie with a womans instinct had known better  she had trembled and almost crouched with fear when she confessed her love and had absolutely hid herself from sight when adolphe went forth prepared to ask his mothers consent to his marriage  the indignation and passionate wrath of madame bauche were past and gone two years before the date of this story and i need not therefore much enlarge upon that subject  she was at first abusive and bitter which was bad for marie and afterwards bitter and silent which was worse  it was of course determined that poor marie should be sent away to some asylum for orphans or penniless paupers in short anywhere out of the way  what mattered her outlook into the world her happiness or indeed her very existence  the outlook and happiness of adolphe bauchewas not that to be considered as everything at vernet  but this terrible sharp aspect of affairs did not last very long  in the first place la mere bauche had under those green spectacles a heart that in truth was tender and affectionate and after the first two days of anger she admitted that something must be done for marie clavert and after the fourth day she acknowledged that the world of the hotel her world would not go as well without marie clavert as it would with her  and in the next place madame bauche had a friend whose advice in grave matters she would sometimes take  this friend had told her that it would be much better to send away adolphe since it was so necessary that there should be a sending away of some one that he would be much benefited by passing some months of his life away from his native valley and that an absence of a year or two would teach him to forget marie even if it did not teach marie to forget him  and we must say a word or two about this friend  at vernet he was usually called m le capitaine though in fact he had never reached that rank  he had been in the army and having been wounded in the leg while still a souslieutenant had been pensioned and had thus been interdicted from treading any further the thorny path that leads to glory  for the last fifteen years he had resided under the roof of madame bauche at first as a casual visitor going and coming but now for many years as constant there as she was herself  he was so constantly called le capitaine that his real name was seldom heard  it may however as well be known to us that this was theodore campan  he was a tall welllooking man always dressed in black garments of a coarse description certainly but scrupulously clean and well brushed of perhaps fifty years of age and conspicuous for the rigid uprightness of his backand for a black wooden leg  this wooden leg was perhaps the most remarkable trait in his character  it was always jet black being painted or polished or japanned as occasion might require by the hands of the capitaine himself  it was longer than ordinary wooden legs as indeed the capitaine was longer than ordinary men but nevertheless it never seemed in any way to impede the rigid punctilious propriety of his movements  it was never in his way as wooden legs usually are in the way of their wearers  and then to render it more illustrious it had round its middle round the calf of the leg we may so say a band of bright brass which shone like burnished gold  it had been the capitaines custom now for some years past to retire every evening at about seven oclock into the sanctum sanctorum of madame bauches habitation the dark little private sittingroom in which she made out her bills and calculated her profits and there regale himself in her presenceand indeed at her expense for the items never appeared in the billwith coffee and cognac  i have said that there was never eating or drinking at the establishment after the regular dinnerhours but in so saying i spoke of the world at large  nothing further was allowed in the way of trade but in the way of friendship so much was nowadays always allowed to the capitaine  it was at these moments that madame bauche discussed her private affairs and asked for and received advice  for even madame bauche was mortal nor could her green spectacles without other aid carry her through all the troubles of life  it was now five years since the world of vernet discovered that la mere bauche was going to marry the capitaine and for eighteen months the world of vernet had been full of this matter  but any amount of patience is at last exhausted and as no further steps in that direction were ever taken beyond the daily cup of coffee that subject died awayvery much unheeded by la mere bauche  but she though she thought of no matrimony for herself thought much of matrimony for other people and over most of those cups of evening coffee and cognac a matrimonial project was discussed in these latter days  it has been seen that the capitaine pleaded in maries favour when the fury of madame bauches indignation broke forth and that ultimately marie was kept at home and adolphe sent away by his advice  but adolphe cannot always stay away madame bauche had pleaded in her difficulty  the truth of this the capitaine had admitted but marie he said might be married to some one else before two years were over  and so the matter had commenced  but to whom should she be married  to this question the capitaine had answered in perfect innocence of heart that la mere bauche would be much better able to make such a choice than himself  he did not know how marie might stand with regard to money  if madame would give some little dot the affair the capitaine thought would be more easily arranged  all these things took months to say during which period marie went on with her work in melancholy listlessness  one comfort she had adolphe before he went had promised to her holding in his hand as he did so a little cross which she had given him that no earthly consideration should sever themthat sooner or later he would certainly be her husband  marie felt that her limbs could not work nor her tongue speak were it not for this one drop of water in her cup  and then deeply meditating la mere bauche hit upon a plan and herself communicated it to the capitaine over a second cup of coffee into which she poured a full teaspoonful more than the usual allowance of cognac  why should not he the capitaine himself be the man to marry marie clavert  it was a very startling proposal the idea of matrimony for himself never having as yet entered into the capitaines head at any period of his life but la mere bauche did contrive to make it not altogether unacceptable  as to that matter of dowry she was prepared to be more than generous  she did love marie well and could find it in her heart to give her anythingany thing except her son her own adolphe  what she proposed was this  adolphe himself would never keep the baths  if the capitaine would take marie for his wife marie madame bauche declared should be the mistress after her death subject of course to certain settlements as to adolphes pecuniary interests  the plan was discussed a thousand times and at last so far brought to bear that marie was made acquainted with ithaving been called in to sit in presence with la mere bauche and her future proposed husband  the poor girl manifested no disgust to the stiff ungainly lover whom they assigned to herwho through his whole frame was in appearance almost as wooden as his own leg  on the whole indeed marie liked the capitaine and felt that he was her friend and in her country such marriages were not uncommon  the capitaine was perhaps a little beyond the age at which a man might usually be thought justified in demanding the services of a young girl as his nurse and wife but then marie of herself had so little to give except her youth and beauty and goodness  but yet she could not absolutely consent for was she not absolutely pledged to her own adolphe  and therefore when the great pecuniary advantages were one by one displayed before her and when la mere bauche as a last argument informed her that as wife of the capitaine she would be regarded as second mistress in the establishment and not as a servant she could only burst out into tears and say that she did not know  i will be very kind to you said the capitaine as kind as a man can be  marie took his hard withered hand and kissed it and then looked up into his face with beseeching eyes which were not without avail upon his heart  we will not press her now said the capitaine  there is time enough  but let his heart be touched ever so much one thing was certain  it could not be permitted that she should marry adolphe  to that view of the matter he had given in his unrestricted adhesion nor could he by any means withdraw it without losing altogether his position in the establishment of madame bauche  nor indeed did his conscience tell him that such a marriage should be permitted  that would be too much  if every pretty girl were allowed to marry the first young man that might fall in love with her what would the world come to  and it soon appeared that there was not time enoughthat the time was growing very scant  in three months adolphe would be back  and if everything was not arranged by that time matters might still go astray  and then madame bauche asked her final question  you do not think do you that you can ever marry adolphe  and as she asked it the accustomed terror of her green spectacles magnified itself tenfold marie could only answer by another burst of tears  the affair was at last settled among them  marie said that she would consent to marry the capitaine when she should hear from adolphes own mouth that he adolphe loved her no longer  she declared with many tears that her vows and pledges prevented her from promising more than this  it was not her fault at any rate not now that she loved her lover  it was not her faultnot now at leastthat she was bound by these pledges  when she heard from his own mouth that he had discarded her then she would marry the capitaineor indeed sacrifice herself in any other way that la mere bauche might desire what would anything signify then  madame bauches spectacles remained unmoved but not her heart marie she told the capitaine should be equal to herself in the establishment when once she was entitled to be called madame campan and she should be to her quite as a daughter  she should have her cup of coffee every evening and dine at the big table and wear a silk gown at church and the servants should all call her madame a great career should be open to her if she would only give up her foolish girlish childish love for adolphe  and all these great promises were repeated to marie by the capitaine  but nevertheless there was but one thing in the world which in maries eyes was of any value and that one thing was the heart of adolphe bauche  without that she would be nothing with thatwith that assured she could wait patiently till doomsday  letters were written to adolphe during all these eventful doings and a letter came from him saying that he greatly valued maries love but that as it had been clearly proved to him that their marriage would be neither for her advantage nor for his he was willing to give it up  he consented to her marriage with the capitaine and expressed his gratitude to his mother for the pecuniary advantages which she had held out to him  oh adolphe adolphe  but alas alas is not such the way of most mens heartsand of the hearts of some women  this letter was read to marie but it had no more effect upon her than would have had some dry legal document  in those days and in those places men and women did not depend much upon letters nor when they were written was there expressed in them much of heart or of feeling  marie would understand as she was well aware the glance of adolphes eye and the tone of adolphes voice she would perceive at once from them what her lover really meant what he wished what in the innermost corner of his heart he really desired that she should do  but from that stiff constrained written document she could understand nothing  it was agreed therefore that adolphe should return and that she would accept her fate from his mouth  the capitaine who knew more of human nature than poor marie felt tolerably sure of his bride adolphe who had seen something of the world would not care very much for the girl of his own valley  money and pleasure and some little position in the world would soon wean him from his love and then marie would accept her destinyas other girls in the same position had done since the french world began  and now it was the evening before adolphes expected arrival  la mere bauche was discussing the matter with the capitaine over the usual cup of coffee  madame bauche had of late become rather nervous on the matter thinking that they had been somewhat rash in acceding so much to marie  it seemed to her that it was absolutely now left to the two young lovers to say whether or no they would have each other or not  now nothing on earth could be further from madame bauches intention than this  her decree and resolve was to heap down blessings on all persons concernedprovided always that she could have her own way but provided she did not have her own way to heap downanything but blessings  she had her code of morality in this matter  she would do good if possible to everybody around her  but she would not on any score be induced to consent that adolphe should marry marie clavert  should that be in the wind she would rid the house of marie of the capitaine and even of adolphe himself  she had become therefore somewhat querulous and selfopinionated in her discussions with her friend  i dont know she said on the evening in question i dont know it may be all right but if adolphe turns against me what are we to do then  mere bauche said the capitaine sipping his coffee and puffing out the smoke of his cigar adolphe will not turn against us  it had been somewhat remarked by many that the capitaine was more at home in the house and somewhat freer in his manner of talking with madame bauche since this matrimonial alliance had been on the tapis than he had ever been before  la mere herself observed it and did not quite like it but how could she prevent it now  when the capitaine was once married she would make him know his place in spite of all her promises to marie  but if he says he likes the girl continued madame bauche  my friend you may be sure that he will say nothing of the kind  he has not been away two years without seeing girls as pretty as marie and then you have his letter  that is nothing capitaine he would eat his letter as quick as you would eat an omelet aux fines herbes  now the capitaine was especially quick over an omelet aux fines herbes  and mere bauche you also have the purse he will know that he cannot eat that except with your good will  ah exclaimed madame bauche poor lad  he has not a sous in the world unless i give it to him  but it did not seem that this reflection was in itself displeasing to her  adolphe will now be a man of the world continued the capitaine he will know that it does not do to throw away everything for a pair of red lips  that is the folly of a boy and adolphe will be no longer a boy  believe me mere bauche things will be right enough  and then we shall have marie sick and ill and half dying on our hands said madame bauche  this was not flattering to the capitaine and so he felt it perhaps so perhaps not he said  but at any rate she will get over it  it is a malady which rarely kills young womenespecially when another alliance awaits them  bah said madame bauche and in saying that word she avenged herself for the too great liberty which the capitaine had lately taken  he shrugged his shoulders took a pinch of snuff and uninvited helped himself to a teaspoonful of cognac  then the conference ended and on the next morning before breakfast adolphe bauche arrived  on that morning poor marie hardly knew how to bear herself  a month or two back and even up to the last day or two she had felt a sort of confidence that adolphe would be true to her but the nearer came that fatal day the less strong was the confidence of the poor girl she knew that those two longheaded aged counsellors were plotting against her happiness and she felt that she could hardly dare hope for success with such terrible foes opposed to her  on the evening before the day madame bauche had met her in the passages and kissed her as she wished her good night  marie knew little about sacrifices but she felt that it was a sacrificial kiss  in those days a sort of diligence with the mails for olette passed through prades early in the morning and a conveyance was sent from vernet to bring adolphe to the baths  never was prince or princess expected with more anxiety  madame bauche was up and dressed long before the hour and was heard to say five several times that she was sure he would not come  the capitaine was out and on the high road moving about with his wooden leg as perpendicular as a lamppost and almost as black  marie also was up but nobody had seen her  she was up and had been out about the place before any of them were stirring but now that the world was on the move she lay hidden like a hare in its form  and then the old charabanc clattered up to the door and adolphe jumped out of it into his mothers arms  he was fatter and fairer than she had last seen him had a larger beard was more fashionably clothed and certainly looked more like a man  marie also saw him out of her little window and she thought that he looked like a god was it probable she said to herself that one so godlike would still care for her  the mother was delighted with her son who rattled away quite at his ease  he shook hands very cordially with the capitaineof whose intended alliance with his own sweetheart he had been informed and then as he entered the house with his hand under his mothers arm he asked one question about her  and where is marie said he marie oh upstairs you shall see her after breakfast said la mere bauche  and so they entered the house and went in to breakfast among the guests  everybody had heard something of the story and they were all on the alert to see the young man whose love or want of love was considered to be of so much importance  you will see that it will be all right said the capitaine carrying his head very high  i think so i think so said la mere bauche who now that the capitaine was right no longer desired to contradict him  i know that it will be all right said the capitaine  i told you that adolphe would return a man and he is a man  look at him he does not care this for marie clavert and the capitaine with much eloquence in his motion pitched over a neighbouring wall a small stone which he held in his hand  and then they all went to breakfast with many signs of outward joy and not without some inward joy for madame bauche thought she saw that her son was cured of his love  in the mean time marie sat up stairs still afraid to show herself  he has come said a young girl a servant in the house running up to the door of maries room  yes said marie i could see that he has come  and oh how beautiful he is said the girl putting her hands together and looking up to the ceiling  marie in her heart of hearts wished that he was not half so beautiful as then her chance of having him might be greater  and the company are all talking to him as though he were the prefet said the girl  never mind who is talking to him said marie go away and leave meyou are wanted for your work  why before this was he not talking to her  why not if he were really true to her  alas it began to fall upon her mind that he would be false  and what then what should she do then  she sat still gloomily thinking of that other spouse that had been promised to her  as speedily after breakfast as was possible adolphe was invited to a conference in his mothers private room  she had much debated in her own mind whether the capitaine should be invited to this conference or no  for many reasons she would have wished to exclude him  she did not like to teach her son that she was unable to manage her own affairs and she would have been well pleased to make the capitaine understand that his assistance was not absolutely necessary to her but then she had an inward fear that her green spectacles would not now be as efficacious on adolphe as they had once been in old days before he had seen the world and become a man  it might be necessary that her son being a man should be opposed by a man  so the capitaine was invited to the conference  what took place there need not be described at length  the three were closeted for two hours at the end of which time they came forth together  the countenance of madame bauche was serene and comfortable her hopes of ultimate success ran higher than ever  the face of the capitaine was masked as are always the faces of great diplomatists he walked placid and upright raising his wooden leg with an ease and skill that was absolutely marvellous  but poor adolphes brow was clouded  yes poor adolphe for he was poor in spirit he had pledged himself to give up marie and to accept the liberal allowance which his mother tendered him but it remained for him now to communicate these tidings to marie herself  could not you tell her he had said to his mother with very little of that manliness in his face on which his mother now so prided herself  but la mere bauche explained to him that it was a part of the general agreement that marie was to hear his decision from his own mouth  but you need not regard it said the capitaine with the most indifferent air in the world  the girl expects it  only she has some childish idea that she is bound till you yourself release her i dont think she will be troublesome  adolphe at that moment did feel that he should have liked to kick the capitaine out of his mothers house  and where should the meeting take place  in the hall of the bath house suggested madame bauche because as she observed they could walk round and round and nobody ever went there at that time of day but to this adolphe objected it would be so cold and dismal and melancholy  the capitaine thought that mere bauches little parlour was the place but la mere herself did not like this  they might be overheard as she well knew and she guessed that the meeting would not conclude without some sobs that would certainly be bitter and might perhaps be loud  send her up to the grotto and i will follow her said adolphe  on this therefore they agreed  now the grotto was a natural excavation in a high rock which stood precipitously upright over the establishment of the baths  a steep zigzag path with almost never ending steps had been made along the face of the rock from a little flower garden attached to the house which lay immediately under the mountain  close along the front of the hotel ran a little brawling river leaving barely room for a road between it and the door over this there was a wooden bridge leading to the garden and some two or three hundred yards from the bridge began the steps by which the ascent was made to the grotto  when the season was full and the weather perfectly warm the place was much frequented  there was a green table in it and four or five deal chairs a green garden seat also was there which however had been removed into the innermost back corner of the excavation as its hinder legs were somewhat at fault  a wall about two feet high ran along the face of it guarding its occupants from the precipice  in fact it was no grotto but a little chasm in the rock such as we often see up above our heads in rocky valleys and which by means of these steep steps had been turned into a source of exercise and amusement for the visitors at the hotel  standing at the wall one could look down into the garden and down also upon the shining slate roof of madame bauches house and to the left might be seen the sombre silent snowcapped top of stern old canigou king of mountains among those eastern pyrenees  and so madame bauche undertook to send marie up to the grotto and adolphe undertook to follow her thither  it was now spring and though the winds had fallen and the snow was no longer lying on the lower peaks still the air was fresh and cold and there was no danger that any of the few guests at the establishment would visit the place  make her put on her cloak mere bauche said the capitaine who did not wish that his bride should have a cold in her head on their weddingday  la mere bauche pished and pshawed as though she were not minded to pay any attention to recommendations on such subjects from the capitaine  but nevertheless when marie was seen slowly to creep across the little bridge about fifteen minutes after this time she had a handkerchief on her head and was closely wrapped in a dark brown cloak  poor marie herself little heeded the cold fresh air but she was glad to avail herself of any means by which she might hide her face  when madame bauche sought her out in her own little room and with a smiling face and kind kiss bade her go to the grotto she knew or fancied that she knew that it was all over  he will tell you all the truthhow it all is said la mere  we will do all we can you know to make you happy marie  but you must remember what monsieur le cure told us the other day  in this vale of tears we cannot have everything as we shall have some day when our poor wicked souls have been purged of all their wickedness  now go dear and take your cloak  yes maman  and adolphe will come to you  and try and behave well like a sensible girl  yes mamanand so she went bearing on her brow another sacrificial kissand bearing in her heart such an unutterable load of woe  adolphe had gone out of the house before her but standing in the stable yard well within the gate so that she should not see him he watched her slowly crossing the bridge and mounting the first flight of the steps  he had often seen her tripping up those stairs and had almost as often followed her with his quicker feet  and she when she would hear him would run and then he would catch her breathless at the top and steal kisses from her when all power of refusing them had been robbed from her by her efforts at escape there was no such running now no such following no thought of such kisses  as for him he would fain have skulked off and shirked the interview had he dared  but he did not dare so he waited there out of heart for some ten minutes speaking a word now and then to the bathman who was standing by just to show that he was at his ease  but the bathman knew that he was not at his ease  such wouldbe lies as those rarely achieve deceptionare rarely believed  and then at the end of the ten minutes with steps as slow as maries had been he also ascended to the grotto  marie had watched him from the top but so that she herself should not be seen  he however had not once lifted up his head to look for her but with eyes turned to the ground had plodded his way up to the cave  when he entered she was standing in the middle with her eyes downcast and her hands clasped before her  she had retired some way from the wall so that no eyes might possibly see her but those of her false lover  there she stood when he entered striving to stand motionless but trembling like a leaf in every limb  it was only when he reached the top step that he made up his mind how he would behave  perhaps after all the capitaine was right perhaps she would not mind it  marie said he with a voice that attempted to be cheerful this is an odd place to meet in after such a long absence and he held out his hand to her  but only his hand  he offered her no salute he did not even kiss her cheek as a brother would have done  of the rules of the outside world it must be remembered that poor marie knew but little  he had been a brother to her before he had become her lover  but marie took his hand saying yes it has been very long  and now that i have come back he went on to say it seems that we are all in a confusion together  i never knew such a piece of work however it is all for the best i suppose  perhaps so said marie still trembling violently and still looking upon the ground  and then there was silence between them for a minute or so  i tell you what it is marie said adolphe at last dropping her hand and making a great effort to get through the work before him i am afraid we two have been very foolish  dont you think we have now  it seems quite clear that we can never get ourselves married dont you see it in that light  maries head turned round and round with her but she was not of the fainting order  she took three steps backwards and leant against the wall of the cave  she also was trying to think how she might best fight her battle  was there no chance for her  could no eloquence no love prevail  on her own beauty she counted but little but might not prayers do something and a reference to those old vows which had been so frequent so eager so solemnly pledged between them  never get ourselves married she said repeating his words never adolphe  can we never be married  upon my word my dear girl i fear not  you see my mother is so dead against it  but we could wait could we not  ah but thats just it marie  we cannot wait  we must decide nowtoday  you see i can do nothing without money from herand as for you you see she wont even let you stay in the house unless you marry old campan at once  hes a very good sort of fellow though old as he is  and if you do marry him why you see youll stay here and have it all your own way in everything  as for me i shall come and see you all from time to time and shall be able to push my way as i ought to do  then adolphe you wish me to marry the capitaine  upon my honour i think it is the best thing you can do i do indeed  oh adolphe  what can i do for you you know  suppose i was to go down to my mother and tell her that i had decided to keep you myself what would come of it  look at it in that light marie  she could not turn you outyou her own son  but she would turn you out and deuced quick too i can assure you of that i can upon my honour  i should not care that and she made a motion with her hand to show how indifferent she would be to such treatment as regarded herself not that if i still had the promise of your love  but what would you do  i would work  there are other houses beside that one and she pointed to the slate roof of the bauche establishment  and for mei should not have a penny in the world said the young man  she came up to him and took his right hand between both of hers and pressed it warmly oh so warmly  you would have my love said she my deepest warmest best hearts love should want nothing more nothing on earth if i could still have yours  and she leaned against his shoulder and looked with all her eyes into his face  but marie thats nonsense you know  no adolphe it is not nonsense  do not let them teach you so what does love mean if it does not mean that  oh adolphe you do love me you do love me you do love me  yesi love you he said slowlyas though he would not have said it if he could have helped it  and then his arm crept slowly round her waist as though in that also he could not help himself  and do not i love you said the passionate girl  oh i do so dearly with all my heart with all my soul  adolphe i so love you that i cannot give you up  have i not sworn to be yours sworn sworn a thousand times  how can i marry that man  oh adolphe how can you wish that i should marry him  and she clung to him and looked at him and besought him with her eyes  i shouldnt wish itonly and then he paused  it was hard to tell her that he was willing to sacrifice her to the old man because he wanted money from his mother   only what  but adolphe do not wish it at all  have you not sworn that i should be your wife  look here look at this and she brought out from her bosom a little charm that he had given her in return for that cross  did you not kiss that when you swore before the figure of the virgin that i should be your wife  and do you not remember that i feared to swear too because your mother was so angry and then you made me  after that adolphe  oh adolphe tell me that i may have some hope  i will wait oh i will wait so patiently  he turned himself away from her and walked backwards and forwards uneasily through the grotto  he did love herlove her as such men do love sweet pretty girls  the warmth of her hand the affection of her touch the pure bright passion of her tearladen eye had re awakened what power of love there was within him  but what was he to do  even if he were willing to give up the immediate golden hopes which his mother held out to him how was he to begin and then how carry out this work of selfdevotion  marie would be turned away and he would be left a victim in the hands of his mother and of that stiff woodenlegged militairea penniless victim left to mope about the place without a grain of influence or a morsel of pleasure  but what can we do he exclaimed again as he once more met maries searching eye  we can be true and honest and we can wait she said coming close up to him and taking hold of his arm  i do not fear it and she is not my mother adolphe  you need not fear your own mother  fear no of course i dont fear  but i dont see how the very devil we can manage it  will you let me tell her that i will not marry the capitaine that i will not give up your promises and then i am ready to leave the house  it would do no good  it would do every good adolphe if i had your promised word once more if i could hear from your own voice one more tone of love  do you not remember this place  it was here that you forced me to say that i loved you  it is here also that you will tell me that i have been deceived  it is not i that would deceive you he said  i wonder that you should be so hard upon me  god knows that i have trouble enough  well if i am a trouble to you be it so  be it as you wish and she leaned back against the wall of the rock and crossing her arms upon her breast looked away from him and fixed her eyes upon the sharp granite peaks of canigou  he again betook himself to walk backwards and forwards through the cave  he had quite enough of love for her to make him wish to marry her quite enough now at this moment to make the idea of her marriage with the capitaine very distasteful to him enough probably to make him become a decently good husband to her should fate enable him to marry her but not enough to enable him to support all the punishment which would be the sure effects of his mothers displeasure  besides he had promised his mother that he would give up mariehad entirely given in his adhesion to that plan of the marriage with the capitaine  he had owned that the path of life as marked out for him by his mother was the one which it behoved him as a man to follow  it was this view of his duties as a man which had i been specially urged on him with all the capitaines eloquence and old campan had entirely succeeded  it is so easy to get the assent of such young men so weak in mind and so weak in pocket when the arguments are backed by a promise of two thousand francs a year  ill tell you what ill do at last he said  ill get my mother by herself and will ask her to let the matter remain as it is for the present  not if it be a trouble m adolphe and the proud girl still held her hands upon her bosom and still looked towards the mountain  you know what i mean marie  you can understand how she and the capitaine are worrying me  but tell me adolphe do you love me  you know i love you only  and you will not give me up  i will ask my mother  i will try and make her yield  marie could not feel that she received much confidence from her lovers promise but still even that weak and unsteady as it was even that was better than absolute fixed rejection  so she thanked him promised him with tears in her eyes that she would always always be faithful to him and then bade him go down to the house she would follow she said as soon as his passing had ceased to be observed  then she looked at him as though she expected some sign of renewed love  but no such sign was vouchsafed to her  now that she thirsted for the touch of his lip upon her check it was denied to her  he did as she bade him he went down slowly loitering by himself and in about half an hour she followed him and unobserved crept to her chamber  again we will pass over what took place between the mother and the son but late in that evening after the guests had gone to bed marie received a message desiring her to wait on madame bauche in a small salon which looked out from one end of the house  it was intended as a private sittingroom should any special stranger arrive who required such accommodation and therefore was but seldom used here she found la mere bauche sitting in an armchair behind a small table on which stood two candles and on a sofa against the wall sat adolphe  the capitaine was not in the room  shut the door marie and come in and sit down said madame bauche it was easy to understand from the tone of her voice that she was angry and stern in an unbending mood and resolved to carry out to the very letter all the threats conveyed by those terrible spectacles  marie did as she was bid  she closed the door and sat down on the chair that was nearest to her  marie said la mere baucheand the voice sounded fierce in the poor girls ears and an angry fire glimmered through the green glasseswhat is all this about that i hear  do you dare to say that you hold my son bound to marry you  and then the august mother paused for an answer  but marie had no answer to give  see looked suppliantly towards her lover as though beseeching him to carry on the fight for her  but if she could not do battle for herself certainly he could not do it for her  what little amount of fighting he had had in him had been thoroughly vanquished before her arrival  i will have an answer and that immediately said madame bauche i am not going to be betrayed into ignominy and disgrace by the object of my own charity  who picked you out of the gutter miss and brought you up and fed you when you would otherwise have gone to the foundling  and this is your gratitude for it all  you are not satisfied with being fed and clothed and cherished by me but you must rob me of my son  know this then adolphe shall never marry a child of charity such as you are  marie sat still stunned by the harshness of these words  la mere bauche had often scolded her indeed she was given to much scolding but she had scolded her as a mother may scold a child  and when this story of maries love first reached her ears she had been very angry but her anger had never brought her to such a pass as this indeed marie had not hitherto been taught to look at the matter in this light  no one had heretofore twitted her with eating the bread of charity  it had not occurred to her that on this account she was unfit to be adolphes wife  there in that valley they were all so nearly equal that no idea of her own inferiority had ever pressed itself upon her mind  but now  when the voice ceased she again looked at him but it was no longer a beseeching look  did he also altogether scorn her  that was now the inquiry which her eyes were called upon to make  no she could not say that he did  it seemed to her that his energies were chiefly occupied in pulling to pieces the tassel on the sofa cushion  and now miss let me know at once whether this nonsense is to be over or not continued la mere bauche and i will tell you at once i am not going to maintain you here in my house to plot against our welfare and happiness  as marie clavert you shall not stay here capitaine campan is willing to marry you and as his wife i will keep my word to you though you little deserve it  if you refuse to marry him you must go  as to my son he is there and he will tell you now in my presence that he altogether declines the honour you propose for him  and then she ceased waiting for an answer drumming the table with a wafer stamp which happened to be ready to her hand but marie said nothing  adolphe had been appealed to but adolphe had not yet spoken  well miss said la mere bauche  then marie rose from her seat and walking round she touched adolphe lightly on the shoulder  adolphe she said it is for you to speak now  i will do as you bid me  he gave a long sigh looked first at marie and then at his mother shook himself slightly and then spoke  upon my word marie i think mother is right  it would never do for us to marry it would not indeed  then it is decided said marie returning to her chair  and you will marry the capitaine said la mere bauche  marie merely bowed her head in token of acquiescence  then we are friends again  come here marie and kiss me  you must know that it is my duty to take care of my own son  but i dont want to be angry with you if i can help it i dont indeed  when once you are madame campan you shall be my own child and you shall have any room in the house you like to choosethere  and she once more imprinted a kiss on maries cold forehead  how they all got out of the room and off to their own chambers i can hardly tell  but in five minutes from the time of this last kiss they were divided  la mere bauche had patted marie and smiled on her and called her her dear good little madame campan her young little mistress of the hotel bauche and had then got herself into her own room satisfied with her own victory  nor must my readers be too severe on madame bauche  she had already done much for marie clavert and when she found herself once more by her own bedside she prayed to be forgiven for the cruelty which she felt that she had shown to the orphan  but in making this prayer with her favourite crucifix in her hand and the little image of the virgin before her she pleaded her duty to her son  was it not right she asked the virgin that she should save her son from a bad marriage  and then she promised ever so much of recompense both to the virgin and to marie a new trousseau for each with candles to the virgin with a gold watch and chain for marie as soon as she should be marie campan  she had been cruel she acknowledged it but at such a crisis was it not defensible  and then the recompense should be so full  but there was one other meeting that night very short indeed but not the less significant  not long after they had all separated just so long as to allow of the house being quiet adolphe still sitting in his room meditating on what the day had done for him heard a low tap at his door  come in he said as men always do say and marie opening the door stood just within the verge of his chamber  she had on her countenance neither the soft look of entreating love which she had worn up there in the grotto nor did she appear crushed and subdued as she had done before his mother she carried her head somewhat more erect than usual and looked boldly out at him from under her soft eyelashes  there might still be love there but it was love proudly resolving to quell itself adolphe as he looked at her felt that he was afraid of her  it is all over then between us m adolphe she said  well yes  dont you think it had better be so eh marie  and this is the meaning of oaths and vows sworn to each other so sacredly  but marie you heard what my mother said  oh sir  i have not come to ask you again to love me  oh no  i am not thinking of that  but this this would be a lie if i kept it now it would choke me if i wore it as that mans wife  take it back and she tendered to him the little charm which she had always worn round her neck since he had given it to her  he took it abstractedly without thinking what he did and placed it on his dressingtable  and you she continued can you still keep that cross  oh no you must give me back that  it would remind you too often of vows that were untrue  marie he said do not be so harsh to me  harsh said she no there has been enough of harshness  i would not be harsh to you adolphe  but give me the cross it would prove a curse to you if you kept it  he then opened a little box which stood upon the table and taking out the cross gave it to her  and now goodbye she said  we shall have but little more to say to each other  i know this now that i was wrong ever to have loved you  i should have been to you as one of the other poor girls in the house  but oh how was i to help it  to this he made no answer and she closing the door softly went back to her chamber  and thus ended the first day of adolphe bauches return to his own house  on the next morning the capitaine and marie were formally betrothed this was done with some little ceremony in the presence of all the guests who were staying at the establishment and with all manner of gracious acknowledgments of maries virtues  it seemed as though la mere bauche could not be courteous enough to her  there was no more talk of her being a child of charity no more allusion now to the gutter  la mere bauche with her own hand brought her cake with a glass of wine after her betrothal was over and patted her on the cheek and called her her dear little marie campan  and then the capitaine was made up of infinite politeness and the guests all wished her joy and the servants of the house began to perceive that she was a person entitled to respect  how different was all this from that harsh attack that was made on her the preceding evening only adolphehe alone kept aloof  though he was present there he said nothing  he and he only offered no congratulations  in the midst of all these gala doings marie herself said little or nothing  la mere bauche perceived this but she forgave it  angrily as she had expressed herself at the idea of maries daring to love her son she had still acknowledged within her own heart that such love had been natural  she could feel no pity for marie as long as adolphe was in danger but now she knew how to pity her  so marie was still petted and still encouraged though she went through the days work sullenly and in silence  as to the capitaine it was all one to him  he was a man of the world  he did not expect that he should really be preferred con amore to a young fellow like adolphe  but he did expect that marie like other girls would do as she was bid and that in a few days she would regain her temper and be reconciled to her life  and then the marriage was fixed for a very early day for as la mere said what was the use of waiting  all their minds were made up now and therefore the sooner the two were married the better  did not the capitaine think so  the capitaine said that he did think so  and then marie was asked  it was all one to her she said  whatever maman bauche liked that she would do only she would not name a day herself  indeed she would neither do nor say anything herself which tended in any way to a furtherance of these matrimonials  but then she acquiesced quietly enough if not readily in what other people did and said and so the marriage was fixed for the day week after adolphes return  the whole of that week passed much in the same way  the servants about the place spoke among themselves of maries perverseness obstinacy and ingratitude because she would not look pleased or answer madame bauches courtesies with gratitude but la mere herself showed no signs of anger  marie had yielded to her and she required no more  and she remembered also the harsh words she had used to gain her purpose and she reflected on all that marie had lost  on these accounts she was forbearing and exacted nothingnothing but that one sacrifice which was to be made in accordance to her wishes  and it was made  they were married in the great salon the dining room immediately after breakfast  madame bauche was dressed in a new puce silk dress and looked very magnificent on the occasion she simpered and smiled and looked gay even in spite of her spectacles and as the ceremony was being performed she held fast clutched in her hand the gold watch and chain which were intended for marie as soon as ever the marriage should be completed  the capitaine was dressed exactly as usual only that all his clothes were new  madame bauche had endeavoured to persuade him to wear a blue coat but he answered that such a change would not he was sure be to maries taste  to tell the truth marie would hardly have known the difference had he presented himself in scarlet vestments  adolphe however was dressed very finely but he did not make himself prominent on the occasion  marie watched him closely though none saw that she did so and of his garments she could have given an account with much accuracyof his garments ay and of every look is he a man she said at last to herself that he can stand by and see all this  she too was dressed in silk  they had put on her what they pleased and she bore the burden of her wedding finery without complaint and without pride  there was no blush on her face as she walked up to the table at which the priest stood nor hesitation in her low voice as she made the necessary answers  she put her hand into that of the capitaine when required to do so and when the ring was put on her finger she shuddered but ever so slightly  no one observed it but la mere bauche  in one week she will be used to it and then we shall all be happy said la mere to herself  and ii will be so kind to her  and so the marriage was completed and the watch was at once given to marie  thank you maman said she as the trinket was fastened to her girdle  had it been a pincushion that had cost three sous it would have affected her as much  and then there was cake and wine and sweetmeats and after a few minutes marie disappeared  for an hour or so the capitaine was taken up with the congratulating of his friends and with the efforts necessary to the wearing of his new honours with an air of ease but after that time he began to be uneasy because his wife did not come to him  at two or three in the afternoon he went to la mere bauche to complain  this lackadaisical nonsense is no good he said  at any rate it is too late now  marie had better come down among us and show herself satisfied with her husband  but madame bauche took maries part  you must not be too hard on marie she said  she has gone through a good deal this week past and is very young whereas capitaine you are not very young  the capitaine merely shrugged his shoulders  in the mean time mere bauche went up to visit her protegee in her own room and came down with a report that she was suffering from a headache  she could not appear at dinner madame bauche said but would make one at the little party which was to be given in the evening  with this the capitaine was forced to be content  the dinner therefore went on quietly without her much as it did on other ordinary days  and then there was a little time for vacancy during which the gentlemen drank their coffee and smoked their cigars at the cafe talking over the event that had taken place that morning and the ladies brushed their hair and added some ribbon or some brooch to their usual apparel  twice during this time did madame bauche go up to maries room with offers to assist her  not yet maman not quite yet said marie piteously through her tears and then twice did the green spectacles leave the room covering eyes which also were not dry  ah what had she done  what had she dared to take upon herself to do  she could not undo it now  and then it became quite dark in the passages and out of doors and the guests assembled in the salon  la mere came in and out three or four times uneasy in her gait and unpleasant in her aspect and everybody began to see that things were wrong  she is ill i am afraid said one  the excitement has been too much said a second and he is so old whispered a third  and the capitaine stalked about erect on his wooden leg taking snuff and striving to look indifferent but he also was uneasy in his mind  presently la mere came in again with a quicker step than before and whispered something first to adolphe and then to the capitaine whereupon they both followed her out of the room  not in her chamber said adolphe  then she must be in yours said the capitaine  she is in neither said la mere bauche with her sternest voice nor is she in the house  and now there was no longer an affectation of indifference on the part of any of them  they were anything but indifferent  the capitaine was eager in his demands that the matter should still be kept secret from the guests  she had always been romantic he said and had now gone out to walk by the river side  they three and the old bathman would go out and look for her  but it is pitch dark said la mere bauche  we will take lanterns said the capitaine  and so they sallied forth with creeping steps over the gravel so that they might not be heard by those within and proceeded to search for the young wife  marie  marie said la mere bauche in piteous accents do come to me pray do  hush said the capitaine  theyll hear you if you call  he could not endure that the world should learn that a marriage with him had been so distasteful to marie clavert  marie dear marie called madame bauche louder than before quite regardless of the capitaine s feelings but no marie answered  in her innermost heart now did la mere bauche wish that this cruel marriage had been left undone  adolphe was foremost with his lamp but he hardly dared to look in the spot where he felt that it was most likely that she should have taken refuge  how could he meet her again alone in that grotto yet he alone of the four was young  it was clearly for him to ascend  marie he shouted are you there as he slowly began the long ascent of the steps  but he had hardly begun to mount when a whirring sound struck his ear and he felt that the air near him was moved and then there was a crash upon the lower platform of rock and a moan repeated twice but so faintly and a rustle of silk and a slight struggle somewhere as he knew within twenty paces of him and then all was again quiet and still in the night air  what was that asked the capitaine in a hoarse voice  he made his way half across the little garden and he also was within forty or fifty yards of the flat rock  but adolphe was unable to answer him he had fainted and the lamp had fallen from his hands and rolled to the bottom of the steps  but the capitaine though even his heart was all but quenched within him had still strength enough to make his way up to the rock and there holding the lantern above his eyes he saw all that was left for him to see of his bride  as for la mere bauche she never again sat at the head of that tablenever again dictated to guestsnever again laid down laws for the management of any one  a poor bedridden old woman she lay there in her house at vernet for some seven tedious years and then was gathered to her fathers  as for the capitainebut what matters  he was made of sterner stuff  what matters either the fate of such a one as adolphe bauche
