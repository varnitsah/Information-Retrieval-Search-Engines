98641848	battlepieces and aspects of the war  by herman melville    1866     the battlepieces in this volume are dedicated to the memory of the three hundred thousand who in the war for the maintenance of the union fell devotedly under the flag of their fathers    with few exceptions the pieces in this volume originated in an impulse imparted by the fall of richmond they were composed without reference to collective arrangement but being brought together in review naturally fall into the order assumed  the events and incidents of the conflictmaking up a whole in varied amplitude corresponding with the geographical area covered by the warfrom these but a few themes have been taken such as for any cause chanced to imprint themselves upon the mind  the aspects which the strife as a memory assumes are as manifold as are the moods of involuntary meditationmoods variable and at times widely at variance yielding instinctively one after another to feelings not inspired from any one source exclusively and unmindful without purposing to be of consistency i seem in most of these verses to have but placed a harp in a window and noted the contrasted airs which wayward wilds have

sheet of lead and events that came resounding   with the cry that all was lost like the thundercracks of massy ice   in intensity of frost bursting one upon another   through the horror of the calm   the paralysis of arm in the anguish of the heart and the hollowness and dearth   the appealings of the mother   to brother and to brother not in hatred so to part and the fissure in the hearth   growing momently more wide then the glances tween the fates   and the doubt on every side and the patience under gloom in the stoniness that waits the finality of doom   ii  so the winter died despairing   and the weary weeks of lent and the icebound rivers melted   and the tomb of faith was rent o the rising of the people   came with springing of the grass they rebounded from dejection   and easter came to pass and the young were all elation   hearing sumters cannon roar and they thought how tame the nation   in the age that went before and michael seemed gigantical   the archfiend

      was your old stone fleet    donelson february 1862   the bitter cup   of that hard countermand which gave the envoys up still was wormwood in the mouth   and clouds involved the land when pelted by sleet in the icy street   about the bulletinboard a band of eager anxious people met and every wakeful heart was set on latest news from west or south no seeing here cries onedont crowd you tall man pray you read aloud  important     we learn that general grant   marching from henry overland and joined by a force up the cumberland sent   some thirty thousand the command on wednesday a good position won began the siege of donelson  the stronghold crowns a riverbluff   a good broad mile of leveled top inland the ground rolls off   deepgorged and rocky and broken up a wilderness of trees and brush   the spaded summit shows the roods of fixed intrenchments in their hush   breastworks and riflepits in woods perplex the base                    the welcome weather   is clear and mild tis much like may the ancient boughs that lace together along the stream and hang far forth   strange with green mistletoe betray a dreamy contrast to the north  our troops are full of spiritssay   the siege wont prove a creeping one they purpose not the lingering stay of old beleaguerers not that way   but full of vim from western prairies won   theyll make ere long a dash at donelson  washed by the storm till the paper grew every shade of a streaky blue that bulletin stood the next day brought a second   later from the fort grants investment is complete     a semicircular one both wings the cumberlands margin meet then backwkard curving clasp the rebel seat   on wednesday this good work was done   but of the doers some lie prone each wood each hill each glen was fought for the bold inclosing line we wrought for flamed with sharpshooters each cliff cost a limb or life but back we forced reserves and all made good our hold and so we rest                 events unfold on thursday added ground was won   a long bold steep we near the den later the foe came shouting down   in sortie which was quelled and then we stormed them on their left a chilly change in the afternoon the sky late clear is now bereft of sun last night the ground froze hard rings to the enemy as they run within their works a ramrod bites the lip it meets the cold incites to swinging of arms with brisk rebound smart blows gainst lusty chests resound  along the outer line we ward   a crackle of skirmishing goes on our lads creep round on hand and knee   they fight from behind each trunk and stone   and sometimes flying for refuge one finds tis an enemy shares the tree some scores are maimed by boughs shot off   in the glades by the forts big gun   we mourn the loss of colonel morrison   killed while cheering his regiment on their far sharpshooters try our stuff and ours return them puff for puff tis diamondcuttingdiamond work   woe on the rebel cannoneer who shows his head our fellows lurk   like indians that waylay the deer by the wild saltspringthe sky is dun fordooming the fall of donelson  stern weather is all unwonted here   the people of the country own we brought it yea the earnest north has elementally issued forth   to storm this donelson  further          a yelling rout of ragamuffins broke profuse   today from out the fort   sole uniform they wore a sort of patch or white badge as you choose   upon the arm but leading these or mingling were men of face and bearing of patrician race splendid in courage and gold lace   the officers before the breeze made by their charge down went our line but rallying charged back in force and broke the sally yet with loss this on the left upon the right meanwhile there was an answering fight   assailants and assailed reversed the charge too upward and not down up a steep ridgeside toward its crown   a strong redoubt but they who first gained the forts base and marked the trees felled heaped in horned perplexities   and shagged with brush and swarming there fierce wasps whose sting was present death they faltered drawing bated breath   and felt it was in vain to dare yet still perforce returned the ball firing into the tangled wall till ordered to come down they came but left some comrades in their fame red on the ridge in icy wreath and hanging gardens of cold death   but not quite unavenged these fell our ranks once out of range a blast   of shrapnel and quick shell burst on the rebel horde still massed   scattering them pellmell     this fightingjudging what we read     both charge and countercharge     would seem but thursdays told at large     before in brief reporteded night closed in about the den   murky and lowering ere long chill rains a night not soon to be forgot   reviving old rheumatic pains and longings for a cot    no blankets overcoats or tents coats thrown aside on the warm march here we looked not then for changeful cheer tents coats and blankets too much care   no fires a fire a mark presents   near by the trees show bulletdents rations were eaten cold and raw   the men well soaked come snow and more a midnight sally small sleeping done     but such is war no matter well have fort donelson            ugh ugh twill drag alongdrag along growled a cross patriot in the throng his battered umbrella like an ambulancecover riddled with bulletholes spattered all over hurrah for grant cried a stripling shrill three urchins joined him with a will and some of taller stature cheered meantime a copperhead passed he sneered   win or lose he pausing said caps fly the same all boys mere boys any thing to make a noise   like to see the list of the dead these craven southerners hold out ay ay theyll give you many a bout   well beat in the end sir firmly said one in staid rebuke a solid merchant square and stout   and do you think it that way tend sir asked the lean cooperhead with a look of splenetic pity yes i do his yellow deaths head the croaker shook the countrys ruined that i know a shower of broken ice and snow   in lieu of words confuted him they saw him hustled round the corner go   and each bystander saidwell suited him  next day another crowd was seen in the dark weathers sleety spleen baldheaded to the storm came out a man who mid a joyous shout silently posted this brief sheet  glorious victory of the fleet  fridays great event  the enemys waterbatteries beat  we silenced every gun  the old commodores compliments sent plump into donelson  well well go on exclaimed the crowd to him who thus much read aloud thats all he said what nothing more enough for a cheer thoughhip hurrah but heres old baldy come again more newsand now a different strain  our own reporter a dispatch compiles   as best he may from varied sources  large reenforcements have arrived   munitions men and horses for grant and all debarked with stores    the enemys fieldworks extend six miles the gate still hid so well contrived  yesterday stung us frozen shores   snowclad and through the drear defiles  and over the desolate ridges blew a lapland wind                the main affair   was a good two hours steady fight between our gunboats and the fort   the louisvilles wheel was smashed outright a hundredandtwentyeightpound ball came planetlike through a starboard port killing three men and wounding all the rest of that guns crew the captain of the gun was cut in two then splintering and ripping went nothing could be its continent   in the narrow stream the louisville unhelmed grew lawless swung around   and would have thumped and drifted till all the fleet was driven aground but for the timely order to retire  some damage from our fire tis thought was done the waterbatteries of the fort  little else took place that day   except the field artillery in line would now and thenfor love they say     exchange a valentine the old sharpshooting going on some plan afoot as yet unknown so friday closed round donelson  later       great suffering through the night a stinging one our heedless boys   were nipped like blossoms some dozen   hapless wounded men were frozen during day being struck down out of sight and helpcries drowned in roaring noise they were left just where the skirmish shifted left in dense underbrush nowdrifted some seeking to crawl in crippled plight so stiffenedperished                         yet in spite of pangs for these no heart is lost hungry and clothing stiff with frost our men declare a nearing sun shall see the fall of donelson   and this they say yet not disown the dark redoubts round donelson   and iceglazed corpses each a stone     a sacrifice to donelson they swear it and swerve not gazing on a flag deemed black flying from donelson some of the wounded in the wood   were cared for by the foe last night though he could do them little needed good   himself being all in shivering plight the rebel is wrong but human yet hes got a heart and thrusts a bayonet he gives us battle with wondrous will the bluffs a perverted bunker hill  the stillness stealing through the throng the silent thought and dismal fear revealed         they turned and went     musing on right and wrong     and mysteries dimly sealed breasting the storm in daring discontent the storm whose black flag showed in heaven as if to say no quarter there was given     to wounded men in wood   or true hearts yearning for the good all fatherless seemed the human soul but next day brought a bitterer bowl   on the bulletinboard this stood    saturday morning at 3 am     a stir within the fort betrayed   that the rebels were getting under arms     some plot these early birds had laid   but a lancing sleet cut him who stared   into the storm after some vague alarms   which left our lads unscared   out sallied the enemy at dim of dawn     with cavalry and artillery and went     in fury at our environment   under cover of shot and shell     three columns of infantry rolled on     vomited out of donelson   rolled down the slopes like rivers of hell     surged at our line and swelled and poured   like breaking surf but unsubmerged     our men stood up except where roared   the enemy through one gap we urged   our all of manhood to the stress   but still showed shattered in our desperateness       back set the tide   but soon afresh rolled in     and so it swayed from side to side   far batteries joining in the din   though sharing in another fray     till all became an indian fight   intricate dusky stretching far away   yet not without spontaneous plan     however tangled showed the plight   duels all over tween man and man   duels on cliffside and down in ravine     duels at long range and bone to bone   duels every where flitting and half unseen     only by courage good as their own   and strength outlasting theirs     did our boys at last drive the rebels off   yet they went not back to their distant lairs     in stronghold but loud in scoff   maintained themselves on conquered ground   uplands built works or stalked around   our right wing bore this onset noon   brought calm to donelson  the reader ceased the storm beat hard   twas day but the officegas was lit   nature retained her sulkingfit       in her hand the shard flitting faces took the hue of that washed bulletinboard in view and seemed to bear the public grief as private and uncertain of relief yea many an earnest heart was won   as broodingly he plodded on to find in himself some bitter thing some hardness in his lot as harrowing       as donelson  that night the board stood barren there   oft eyes by wistful people passing   who nothing saw but the rainbeads chasing each other down the wafered square as down some stormbeat graveyard stone but next day showed                       more news last night   story of saturday afternoon  vicissitudes of the war    the damaged gunboats cant wage fight for days so says the commodore thus no diversion can be had under a sunless sky of lead   our grimfaced boys in blacked plight gaze toward the ground they held before and then on grant he marks their mood and hails it and will turn the same to good spite all that they have undergone their desperate hearts are set upon this winter fort this stubborn fort this castle of the last resort       this donelson  1 pm            an order given   requires withdrawal from the front   of regiments that bore the brunt of mornings fray their ranks all riven are being replaced by fresh strong men great vigilance in the foemans den he snuffs the stormers need it is that for that fell assault of his that rout inflicted and selfscorn immoderate in noble natures torn by sense of being through slackness overborne the rebel be given a quick return the kindest face looks now half stern balked of their prey in airs that freeze some fierce ones glare like savages and yet and yet strange moments are wellblood and tears and anguished war the mornings battleground is seen   in lifted glades like meadows rare   the blooddrops on the snowcrust there like clover in the whiteweek show   flushed fields of death that call again   call to our men and not in vain for that way must the stormers go  3 pm            the work begins light drifts of men thrown forward fade   in skirmishline along the slope where some dislodgments must be made   ere the stormer with the stronghold cope  lew wallace moving to retake the heights late lost                        herewith a break   storms at the west derange the wires doubtless ere morning we shall hear the end we look for news to cheer   let hope fan all her fires   next day in large bold hand was seen the closing bulletin  victory         our troops have retrieved the day by one grand surge along the line the spirit that urged them was divine   the first works flooded naught could stay the stormers on still on bayonets for donelson  over the ground that morning lost rolled the blue billows tempesttossed   following a hat on the point of a sword spite shell and roundshot grape and canister up they climbed without rail or banister   up the steep hillsides long and broad driving the rebel deep within his works tis nightfall not an enemy lurks   in sight the chafing men       fret for more fight   tonight tonight let us take the den but night is treacherous grant is wary of brave blood be a little chary patience the fort is good as won tomorrow and into donelson  later and last                  the fort is ours    a flag came out at early morn bringing surrender from their towers   floats out the banner late their scorn in dover hut and house are full   of rebels dead or dying   the national flag is flying from the crammed courthouse pinnacle great boatloads of our wounded go today to nashville the sleetwinds blow but all is right

killed and wounded see the morrows dispatch today tis victory  the man who read this to the crowd   shouted as the end he gained   and though the unflagging tempest rained     they answered him aloud and hand grasped hand and glances met in happy triumph eyes grew wet o to the punches brewed that night went little water windows bright beamed rosy on the sleet without and from the deep street came the frequent shout while some in prayer as these in glee blessed heaven for the wintervictory  but others were who wakeful laid   in midnight beds and early rose   and feverish in the foggy snows snatched the damp paperwife and maid   the deathlist like a river flows     down the pale sheet and there the whelming waters meet    ah god may time with happy haste   bring wail and triumph to a

general mcclellans campaigns will stand but if during the excitement of the conflict aught was spread abroad tending the unmerited disparagement of the man it must necessarily die out though not perhaps without leaving some traces which may or may not prove enduring some there are whose votes aided in the reelection of abraham lincoln who yet believed and retain the belief that general mcclellan to say the least always proved himself a patriotic and honorable soldier the feeling which surviving comrades entertain for their late commnder is one which from its passion is susceptible of versified representation and such it receives  6 at antietam stonewall jackson led one wing of lees army consequenty sharing that day in whatever may be deemed to have been the fortunes of his

draftrioters  10 although the month was november the day was in character an october onecool clear bright intoxicatingly invigorating one of those days peculiar to the ripest hours of our american autumn this weather must have had much to do with the spontaneous enthusiasm which seized the troopsand enthusiasm aided doubtless by glad thoughts of the victory of lookout mountain won the day previous and also by the elation attending the capture after a fierce struggle of the long ranges of riflepits at the mountains base where orders for the time should have stopped the advance but there and then it was that the army took the bit between its teeth and ran away with the generals to the victory commemorated general grant at culpepper a few weeks prior to crossing the rapidan for the wilderness expressed to a visitor his impression of the impulse and the spectacle said he i never saw any thing like it language which seems curiously undertoned considering its application but from the taciturn commander it was equivalent to a superlative or hyperbole from the talkative  the height of the ridge according to the account at hand varies along its length from six to seven hundred feet above the plain it slopes at an angle of about fortyfive degrees  11 the great parrott gun planted in the marshes of james island and employed in the prolonged though at times intermitted bombardment of charleston was known among our soldiers as the swamp angel  st michaels characterized by its venerable tower was the historic and aristrocratic church of the town  12 among the northwestern regiments there would seem to have been more than one which carried a living eagle as an added ensign the bird commemorated here was according the the account borne aloft on a perch beside the standard went through successive battles and campaigns was more than once under the surgeons hands and at the close of the contest found honorable repose in the capital of wisconsin from which state he had gone to the wars  13 the late major general mcpherson commanding the army of the tennessee a major of ohio and a west pointer was one of the foremost spirits of the war young though a veteran hardy intrepid sensitive in honor full of engaging qualities with manly beauty possessed of genius a favorite with the army and with grant and sherman both generals have generously acknowledged their professional obligiations to the able engineer and admirable soldier their subordinate and junior  in an informal account written by the achilles to this sarpedon he says on that day we avenged his death near twentytwo hundred of the enemys dead remained on the ground when night closed upon the scene of action  it is significant of the scale on which the war was waged that the engagement thus written of goes solely so far as can be learned under the vague designation of one of the battles before atlanta  14 the piece was written while yet the reports were coming north of shermans homeward advance from savannah it is needless to point out its purely dramatic character  though the sentiment ascribed in the beginning of the second stanza must in the present reading suggest the historic tragedy of the 14th of april nevertheless as intimated it was written prior to that event and without any distinct application in the writers mind after consideration it is allowed to remain  few need be reminded that by the less intelligent classes of the south abraham lincoln by nature the most kindly of men was regarded as a monster wantonly warring upon liberty he stood for the personification of tyrannic power each union soldier was called a lincolnite  undoubtedly sherman in the desolation he inflicted after leaving atlanta acted not in contravention of orders and all in a military point of view if by military judged deemed to have been expedient and nothing can abate general shermans shining renown his claims to it rest on no single campaign still there are those who can not but contrast some of the scenes enacted in georgia and the carolinas and also in the shenandoah with a circumstance in a great civil war of heathen antiquity plutarch relates that in a military council held by pompey and the chiefs of that party which stood for the commonwealth it was decided that under no plea should any city be sacked that was subject to the people of rome there was this difference however between the roman civil conflict and the american one the war of pompey and caesar divided the roman people promiscuously that of the north and south ran a frontier line between what for the time were distinct communities or nations in this circumstance possibly and some others may be found both the cause and the justification of some of the sweeping measures adopted  15 at this period of excitement the thought was by some passionately welcomed that the presidential successor had been raised up by heaven to wreak vengeance on the south the idea originated in the remembrance that andrew johnson by birth belonged to that class of southern whites who never cherished love for the dominant that he was a citizen of tennessee where the contest at times and in places had been close and bitter as a middleage feud the himself and family had been hardly treated by the secessionists  but the expectations build hereon if indeed ever soberly entertained happily for the country have not been verified  likely the feeling which would have held the entire south chargeable with the crime of one exceptional assassin this too has died away with the natural excitement of the hour  16 the incident on which this piece is based is narrated in a newspaper account of the battle to be found in the rebellion record during the disaster to the national forces on the first day a brigade on the extreme left found itself isolated the perils it encountered are given in detail among others the following sentences occur  under cover of the fire from the bluffs the rebels rushed down crossed the ford and in a moment were seen forming this side the creek in open fields and within close musketrange their colorbearers stepped defiantly to the front as the engagement opened furiously the rebels pouring in sharp quick volleys of musketry and their batteries above continuing to support them with a destructive fire our sharpshooters wanted to pick off the audacious rebel colorbearers but colonel stuart interposed no no theyre too brave fellows to be killed  17 according to a report of the secretary of war there were on the first day of march 1865 965000 men on the army payrolls of these some 200000artillery cavalry and infantrymade up from the larger portion of the veterans of grant and sherman marched by the president the total number of union troops enlisted during the war was 2668000  18 for a month or two after the completion of peace some thousands of released captives from the military prisons of the north natives of all parts of the south passed through the city of new york sometimes waiting farther transportation for days during which interval they wandered penniless about the streets or lay in their worn and patched gray uniforms under the trees of battery near the barracks where they were lodged and fed they were transported and provided for at the charge of government  19 shortly prior to the evacuation of petersburg the enemy with a view to ultimate repossession interred some of his heavy guns in the same field with his dead and with every circumstance calculated to deceive subsequently the negroes exposed exposed the stratagem  20 the records of northern colleges attest what numbers of our noblest youth went from them to the battlefield southern members of the same classes arrayed themselves on the side of secession while southern seminaries contributed large quotas of all these what numbers marched who never returned except on the shield  21 written prior to the founding of the national cemetery at andersonville where 15000 of the reinterred captives now sleep each beneath his personal headboard inscribed from records found in the prisonhospital some hundreds rest apart and without name a glance at the published pamphlet containing the list of the buried at andersonville conveys a feeling mournfully impressive seventyfour large doublecolumned page in fine print looking through them is like getting lost among the old turbaned headstones and cypresses in the interminable black forest of scutari over against constantinople  22 in one of kilpatricks earlier cavalry fights near aldie a colonel who being under arrest had been temporarily deprived of his sword nevertheless unarmed insisted upon charging at the head of his men which he did and the onset proved victorious  23 certain of mosbys followers on the charge of being unlicensed foragers or fighters being hung by order of a union cavalry commander the partisan promptly retaliated in the woods in turn this also was retaliated it is said to what extent such deplorable proceedings were carried it is not easy to learn  south of the potamac in virginia and within a gallop of the long bridge at washington is the confine of a country in some places wild which throughout the war it was unsafe for a union man to traverse except with an armed escort this was the chase of mosby the scene of many of his exploits or those of his men in the heart of this region at least one fortified camp was maintained by our cavalry and from time to time expeditions ended disastrously such results were helped by the exceeding cunning of the enemy born of his woodcraft and in some instances by undue confidence on the part of our men a body of cavalry starting from camp with the view of breaking up a nest of rangers and absent say three days would return with a number of their own forces killed and wounded ambushed without being able to retaliate farther than by foraging on the country destroying a house or two reported to be haunts of the guerrillas or capturing noncombatants accused of being secretly active in their behalf  in the verse the name of mosby is invested with some of those associations with which the popular mind is familiar but facts do not warrant the belief that every clandestine attack of men who passed for mosbys was made under his eye or even by his knowledge  in partisan warfare he proved himself shrewd able and enterprising and always a wary fighter he stood well in the confidence of his superior officers and was empoyed by them at times in furtherance of important movements to our wounded on more than one occasion he showed considerate kindness officers and civilians captured by forces under his immediate command were so long as remaining under his orders treated with civility these things are well known to those personally familiar with the irregular fighting in virginia  24 among those summoned during the spring just passed to appear before the reconstruction committee of congress was robert e lee his testimony is deeply interesting both in itself and as coming from him after various questions had been put and briefly answered these words were addressed to him  if there be any other matter about which you wish to speak on this occasions do so freely waiving this invitation he responded by a short personal explanation of some point in a previous answer and after a few more brief questions and replies the interview closed  in the verse a poetical liberty has been ventured lee is not only represented as responding to the invitation but also as at last renouncing his cold reserve doubtless the cloak to feelings more or less poignant if for such freedom warrant be necessary the speeches in ancient histories not to speak of those in shakespeares historic plays may not unfitly perhaps be cited  the character of the original measures proposed about time in the national legislature for the treatment of the as yet congressionally excluded south and the spirit in which those measures were advocatedthese are circumstances which it is fairly supposable would have deeply influenced the thoughts whether spoken or withheld of a southerner placed in the position of lee before the reconstruction committee     supplement   were i fastidiously anxious for the symmetry of this book it would close with the notes but the times are such that patriotismnot free from solicitudeurges a claim overriding all literary scruples  it is more than a year since the memorable surrender but events have not yet rounded themselves into completion not justly can we complain of this there has been an upheavel affecting the basis of things to altered circumstances complicated adaptations are to be made there are difficulties great and novel but is reason still waiting for passion to spend itself we have sung of the soldiers and sailors but who shall hymn the politicians  in view of the infinite desirableness of reestablishment and considering that so far as feeling is concerned it depends not mainly on the temper in which the south regards the north but rather conversely one who never was a blind adherent feels constrained to submit some thoughts counting on the indulgence of his countrymen  and first it may be said that if among the feelings and opinions growing immediately out of a great civil convulsion there are any which time shall modify or do away they are presumably those of a less temperate and charitable cast  there seems no reason why patriotism and narrowness should go together or why intellectual impartiality should be confounded with political trimming or why serviceable truth should keep cloistered be a cause not partisan yet the work of reconstruction if admitted to be feasible at all demands little but common sense and christian charity little but these these are much  some of us are concerned because as yet the south shows no penitence but what exactly do we mean by this since down to the close of the war she never confessed any for braving it the only penitence now left her is that which springs solely from the sense of discomfiture and since this evidently would be a contrition hypocritical it would be unworthy in us to demand it certain it is that penitence in the sense of voluntary humiliation will never be displayed nor does this afford just ground for unreserved condemnation it is enough for all practical purposes if the south have been taught by the terrors of civil war to feel that secession like slavery is against destiny that both now lie buried in one grave that her fate is linked with ours and that together we comprise the nation  the clouds of heroes who battled for the union it is needless to eulogize here but how of the soldiers on the other side and when of a free community we name the soldiers we thereby name the people it was in subserviency to the slaveinterest that secession was plotted but it was under the plea plausibly urged that certain inestimable rights guaranteed by the constitution were directly menaced that the people of the south were cajoled into revolution through the arts of the conspirators and the perversity of fortune the most sensitive love of liberty was entrapped into the support of a war whose implied end was the erecting in our advanced century of an angloamerican empire based upon the systematic degradation of man  spite this clinging reproach however signal military virtues and achievements have conferred upon the confederate arms historic fame and upon certain of the commanders a renown extending beyond the seaa renown which we of the north could not suppress even if we would in personal character also not a few of the military leaders of the south enforce forbearance the memory of others the north refrains from disparaging and some with more or less of reluctance she can respect posterity sympathizing with our convictions but removed from our passions may perhaps go farther here if george iv could out of the graceful instinct of a gentleman raise an honorable monument in the great fane of christendom over the remains of the enemy of his dynasty charles edward the invader of england and victor in the rout at preston pansupon whose head the kings ancestor but one reign removed has set a priceis it probable that the grandchildren of general grant will pursue with rancor or slur by sour neglect the memory of stonewall jackson  but the south herself is not wanting in recent histories and biographies which record the deeds of her chieftainswritings freely published at the north by loyal houses widely read here and with a deep though saddened interest by students of the war such works are hailed as welcome accessories and tending to the completeness of the record  supposing a happy issue out of present perplexities then in the generation next to come southerners there will be yielding allegiance to the union feeling all their interests bound up in it and yet cherishing unrebuked that kind of feeling for the memory of the soldiers of the fallen confederacy that burns scott and the ettrick shepherd felt for the memory of the gallant clansmen ruined through their fidelity to the stuartsa feeling whose passion was tempered by the poetry imbuing it and which in no wise affected their loyalty to the georges and which it may be added indirectly contributed excellent things to literature but setting this view aside dishonorable would it be in the south were she willing to abandon to shame the memory of brave men who with signal personal disinterestedness warred in her behalf though from motives as we believe so deplorably astray  patriotism is not baseness neither is it inhumanity the mourners who this summer bear flowers to the mounds of the virginian and georgian dead are in their domestic bereavement and proud affection as sacred in the eye of heaven as are those who go with similar offerings of tender grief and love into the cemeteries of our northern martyrs and yet in one aspect how needless to point the contrast  cherishing such sentiments it will hardly occasion surprise that in looking over the battlepieces in the foregoing collection i have been tempted to withdraw or modify some of them fearful lest in presenting though but dramatically and by way of a poetic record the passions and epithets of civil war i might be contributing to a bitterness which every sensible american must wish at an end so too with the emotion of victory as reproduced on some pages and particularly toward the close it should not be construed into an exultation misappliedan exultation as ungenerous as unwise and made to minister however indirectly to that kind of censoriousness too apt to be produced in certain natures by success after trying reverses zeal is not of necessity religion neither is it always of the same essence with poetry or patriotism  there were excesses which marked the conflict most of which are perhaps inseparable from a civil strife so intense and prolonged and involving warfare in some border countries new and imperfectly civilized barbarities also there were for which the southern people collectively can hardly be held responsible though perpetrated by ruffians in their name but surely other qualitiesexalted onescourage and fortitude matchless were likewise displayed and largely and justly may these be held the characteristic traits and not the former  in this view what northern writer however patriotic but must revolt from acting on paper a part any way akin to that of the live dog to the dead lion and yet it is right to rejoice for our triumph so far as it may justly imply an advance for our whole country and for humanity  let it be held no reproach to any one that he pleads for reasonable consideration for our late enemies now stricken down and unavoidably debarred for the time from speaking through authorized agencies for themselves nothing has been urged here in the foolish hope of conciliating those menfew in number we trustwho have resolved never to be reconciled to the union on such hearts every thing is thrown away except it be religious commiseration and the sincerest yet let them call to mind that unhappy secessionist not a military man who with impious alacrity fired the first shot of the civil war at sumter and a little more than four years afterward fired the last one into his own heart at richmond  noble was the gesture into which patriotic passion surprised the people in a utilitarian time and country yet the glory of the war falls short of its pathosa pathos which now at last ought to disarm all animosity  how many and earnest thoughts still rise and how hard to repress them we feel what past years have been and years unretarded years shall come may we all have moderation may we all show candor though perhaps nothing could ultimately have averted the strife and though to treat of human actions is to deal wholly with second causes nevertheless let us not cover up or try to extenuate what humanly speaking is the truthnamely that those unfraternal denunciations continued through years and which at last inflamed to deeds that ended in bloodshed were reciprocal and that had the preponderating strength and the prospect of its unlimited increase lain on the other side on ours might have lain those actions which now in our late opponents we stigmatize under the name of rebellion as frankly let us ownwhat it would be unbecoming to parade were foreigners concernedthat our triumph was won not more by skill and bravery than by superior resources and crushing numbers that it was a triumph too over a people for years politically misled by designing men and also by some honestlyerring men who from their position could not have been otherwise than broadly influential a people who though indeed they sought to perpetuate the curse of slavery and even extend it were not the authors of it but less fortunate not less righteous than we were the fated inheritors a people who having a like origin with ourselves share essentially in whatever worthy qualities we may possess no one can add to the lasting reproach which hopeless defeat has now cast upon secession by withholding the recognition of these verities  surely we ought to take it to heart that that kind of pacification based upon principles operating equally all over the land which lovers of their country yearn for and which our arms though signally triumphant did not bring about and which lawmaking however anxious or energetic or repressive never by itself can achieve may yet be largely aided by generosity of sentiment public and private some revisionary legislation and adaptive is indispensable but with this should harmoniously work another kind of prudence not unallied with entire magnanimity benevolence and policychristianity and machiavellidissuade from penal severities toward the subdued abstinence here is as obligatory as considerate care for our unfortunate fellowmen late in bonds and if observed would equally prove to be wise forecast the great qualities of the south those attested in the war we can perilously alienate or we may make them nationally available at need  the blacks in their infant pupilage to freedom appeal to the sympathies of every humane mind the paternal guardianship which for the interval government exercises over them was prompted equally by duty and benevolence yet such kindliness should not be allowed to exclude kindliness to communities who stand nearer to us in nature for the future of the freed slaves we may well be concerned but the future of the whole country involving the future of the blacks urges a paramount claim upon our anxiety effective benignity like the nile is not narrow in its bounty and true policy is always broad to be sure it is vain to seek to glide with moulded words over the difficulties of the situation and for them who are neither partisans nor enthusiasts nor theorists nor cynics there are some doubts not readily to be solved and there are fears why is not the cessation of war now at length attended with the settled calm of peace wherefore in a clear sky do we still turn our eyes toward the south as the neapolitan months after the eruption turns his toward vesuvius do we dread lest the repose may be deceptive in the recent convulsion has the crater but shifted let us revere that sacred uncertainty which forever impends over men and nations those of us who always abhorred slavery as an atheistical iniquity gladly we join in the exulting chorus of humanity over its downfall but we should remember that emancipation was accomplished not by deliberate legislation only through agonized violence could so mighty a result be effected in our natural solicitude to confirm the benefit of liberty to the blacks let us forbear from measures of dubious constitutional rightfulness toward our white countrymen measures of a nature to provoke among other of the last evils exterminating hatred of race toward race in imagination let us place ourselves in the unprecedented position of the southernerstheir position as regards the millions of ignorant manumitted slaves in their midst for whom some of us now claim the suffrage let us be christians toward our fellowwhites as well as philanthropists toward the blacks our fellowmen in all things and toward all we are enjoined to do as we would be done by nor should we forget that benevolent desires after passing a certain point can not undertake their own fulfillment without incurring the risk of evils beyond those sought to be remedied something may well be left to the graduated care of future legislation and to heaven in one point of view the coexistence of the two races in the southwhether the negro be bond or freeseems even as it did to abraham lincoln a grave evil emancipation has ridded the country of the reproach but not wholly of the calamity especially in the present transition period for both races in the south more or less of trouble may not unreasonably be anticipated but let us not hereafter be too swift to charge the blame exclusively in any one quarter with certain evils men must be more or less patient our institutions have a potent digestion and may in time convert and assimilate to good all elements thrown in however originally alien  but so far as immediate measures looking toward permanent reestablishment are concerned no consideration should tempt us to pervert the national victory into oppression for the vanquished should plausible promise of eventual good or a deceptive or spurious sense of duty lead us to essay this count we must on serious consequences not the least of which would be divisions among the northern adherents of the union assuredly if any honest catos there be who thus far have gone with us no longer will they do so but oppose us and as resolutely as hitherto they have supported but this path of thought leads toward those waters of bitterness from which one can only turn aside and be silent  but supposing reestablishment so far advanced that the southern seats in congress are occupied and by men qualified in accordance with those cardinal principles of representative government which hitherto have prevailed in the landwhat then why the congressman elected by the people of the south willrepresent the people of the south this may seem a flat conclusion but in view of the last five years may there not be latent significance in it what will be the temper of those southern members and confronted by them what will be the mood of our own representatives in private life true reconciliation seldom follows a violent quarrel but if subsequent intercourse be unavoidable nice observances and mutual are indispensable to the prevention of a new rupture amity itelf can only be maintained by reciprocal respect and true friends are punctilious equals on the floor of congress north and south are to come together after a passionate duel in which the south though proving her valor has been made to bite the dust upon differences in debate shall acrimonious recriminations be exchanged shall censorious superiority assumed by one section provoke defiant selfassertion on the other shall manassas and chickamauga be retorted for chattanooga and richmond under the supposition that the full congress will be composed of gentlemen all this is impossible yet if otherwise it needs no prophet of israel to foretell the end the maintenance of congressional decency in the future will rest mainly with the north rightly will more forbearance be required from the north than the south for the north is victor  but some there are who may deem these latter thoughts inapplicable and for this reason since the testoath opertively excludes from congress all who in any way participated in secession therefore none but southerners wholly in harmony with the north are eligible to seats this is true for the time being but the oath is alterable and in the wonted fluctuations of parties not improbably it will undergo alteration assuming such a form perhaps as not to bar the admission into the national legislature of men who represent the populations lately in revolt such a result would involve no violation of the principles of democratic government not readily can one perceive how the political existence of the millions of late secessionists can permanently be ignored by this republic the years of the war tried our devotion to the union the time of peace may test the sincerity of our faith in democracy  in no spirit of opposition not by way of challenge is any thing here thrown out these thoughts are sincere ones they seem natural inevitable here and there they must have suggested themselves to many thoughtful patriots and if they be just thoughts ere long they must have that weight with the public which already they have had with individuals  for that heroic bandthose children of the furnace who in regions like texas and tennessee maintained their fidelity through terrible trialswe of the north felt for them and profoundly we honor them yet passionate sympathy with resentments so close as to be almost domestic in their bitterness would hardly in the present juncture tend to discreet legislation were the unionists and secessionists but as guelphs and ghibellines if not then far be it from a great nation now to act in the spirit that animated a triumphant townfaction in the middle ages but crowding thoughts must at last be checked and in times like the present one who desires to be impartially just in the expression of his views moves as among swordpoints presented on every side  let us pray that the terrible historic tragedy of our time may not have been enacted without instructing our whole beloved country through terror and pity and may fulfillment verify in the end those expectations which kindle the bards of progress and humanity
