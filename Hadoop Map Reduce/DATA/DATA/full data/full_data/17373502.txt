second profession     fitzboodles confessions     preface  george fitzboodle esquire to oliver yorke esquire   omnium club may 20 1842   dear siri have always been considered the thirdbest whistplayer in europe and though never betting more than five pounds have for many years past added considerably to my yearly income by my skill in the game until the commencement of the present season when a french gentleman monsieur lalouette was admitted to the club where i usually play his skill and reputation were so great that no men of the club were inclined to play against us two of a side and the consequence has been that we have been in a manner pitted against one another by a strange turn of luck for i cannot admit the idea of his superiority fortune since the frenchmans arrival has been almost constantly against me and i have lost twoandthirty nights in the course of a couple of score of nights play        the fitzboodle papers first appeared in frasers      magazine for the year 1842  everybody knows that i am a poor man and so much has lalouettes luck drained my finances that only last week i was obliged to give him that famous gray cob on which you have seen me riding in the park i cant afford a thoroughbred and hate a cocktaili was i say forced to give him up my cob in exchange for four ponies which i owed him thus as i never walk being a heavy man whom nobody cares to mount my time hangs heavily on my hands and as i hate home or that apology for ita bachelors lodgingsand as i have nothing earthly to do now until i can afford to purchase another horse i spend my time in sauntering from one club to another passing many rather listless hours in them before the men come in  you will say why not take to backgammon or ecarte or amuse yourself with a book sir putting out of the question the fact that i do not play upon credit i make a point never to play before candles are lighted and as for books i must candidly confess to you i am not a reading man  twas but the other day that some one recommended me to your magazine after dinner saying it contained an exceedingly witty article uponi forget what i give you my honor sir that i took up the work at six meaning to amuse myself till seven when lord trumpingtons dinner was to come off and egad in two minutes i fell asleep and never woke till midnight nobody ever thought of looking for me in the library where nobody ever goes and so ravenously hungry was i that i was obliged to walk off to crockfords for supper  what is it that makes you literary persons so stupid i have met various individuals in society who i was told were writers of books and that sort of thing and expecting rather to be amused by their conversation have invariably found them dull to a degree and as for information without a particle of it sir i actually asked one of these fellows what was the nick to seven and he stared in my face and said he didnt know he was hugely overdressed in satin rings chains and so forth and at the beginning of dinner was disposed to be rather talkative and pert but my little sally silenced him i promise you and got up a good laugh at his expense too leave george alone said little lord cinqbars i warrant hell be a match for any of you literary fellows cinqbars is no great wiseacre but indeed it requires no great wiseacre to know that  what is the simple deduction to be drawn from this truth why thisthat a man to be amusing and wellinformed has no need of books at all and had much better go to the world and to men for his knowledge there was ulysses now the greek fellow engaged in the trojan war as i dare say you know well he was the cleverest man possible and how from having seen men and cities their manners noted and their realms surveyed to be sure so have i i have been in every capital and can order a dinner in every language in europe  my notion then is this i have a great deal of spare time on my hands and as i am told you pay a handsome sum to persons writing for you i will furnish you occasionally with some of my views upon men and things occasional histories of my acquaintance which i think may amuse you personal narratives of my own essays and what not i am told that i do not spell correctly this of course i dont know but you will remember that richelieu and marlborough could not spell and egad i am an honest man and desire to be no better than they i know that it is the matter and not the manner which is of importance have the goodness then to let one of your understrappers correct the spelling and the grammar of my papers and you can give him a few shillings in my name for his trouble  begging you to accept the assurance of my high consideration i am sir  your obedient servant  george savage fitzboodle  psby the way i have said in my letter that i found all literary persons vulgar and dull permit me to contradict this with regard to yourself i met you once at blackwall i think it was and really did not remark anything offensive in your accent or appearance   before commencing the series of moral disquisitions c which i intend the reader may as well know who i am and what my past course of life has been to say that i am a fitzboodle is to say at once that i am a gentleman our family has held the estate of boodle ever since the reign of henry ii and it is out of no ill will to my elder brother or unnatural desire for his death but only because the estate is a very good one that i wish heartily it was mine i would say as much of chatsworth or eaton hall  i am not in the first place what is called a ladies man having contracted an irrepressible habit of smoking after dinner which has obliged me to give up a great deal of the dear creatures society nor can i go much to countryhouses for the same reason say what they will ladies do not like you to smoke in their bedrooms their silly little noses scent out the odor upon the chintz weeks after you have left them sir john has been caught coming to bed particularly merry and redolent of cigarsmoke young george from eton was absolutely found in the little greenhouse puffing an havana and when discovered they both lay the blame upon fitzboodle it was mr fitzboodle mamma says george who offered me the cigar and i did not like to refuse him that rascal fitz seduced us my dear says sir john and kept us laughing until past midnight her ladyship instantly sets me down as a person to be avoided george whispers she to her boy promise me on your honor when you go to town not to know that man and when she enters the breakfastroom for prayers the first greeting is a peculiar expression of countenance and inhaling of breath by which my lady indicates the presence of some exceedingly disagreeable odor in the room she makes you the faintest of curtsies and regards you if not with a flashing eye as in the novels at least with a distended nostril during the whole of the service her heart is filled with the blackest gall towards you and she is thinking about the best means of getting you out of the house  what is this smoking that it should be considered a crime i believe in my heart that women are jealous of it as of a rival they speak of it as of some secret awful vice that seizes upon a man and makes him a pariah from genteel society i would lay a guinea that many a lady who has just been kind enough to rend the above lines lays down the book after this confession of mine that i am a smoker and says oh the vulgar wretch and passes on to something else  the fact is that the cigar is a rival to the ladies and their conqueror too in the chief pipesmoking nations they are kept in subjection while the chief little white belt smokes the women are silent in his wigwam while mahomet ben jawbrahim causes volumes of odorous incense of latakia to play round his beard the women of the harem do not disturb his meditations but only add to the delight of them by tinkling on a dulcimer and dancing before him when professor strumpff of gottingen takes down no 13 from the wall with a picture of beatrice cenci upon it and which holds a pound of canaster the frau professorin knows that for two hours hermann is engaged and takes up her stockings and knits in quiet the constitution of french society has been quite changed within the last twelve years an ancient and respectable dynasty has been overthrown an aristocracy which napoleon could never master has disappeared and from what cause i do not hesitate to sayfrom the habit of smoking ask any man whether five years before the revolution of july if you wanted a cigar at paris they did not bring you a roll of tobacco with a straw in it now the whole city smokes society is changed and be sure of this ladies a similar combat is going on in this country at present between cigarsmoking and you do you suppose you will conquer look over the wide world and see that your adversary has overcome it germany has been puffing for threescore years france smokes to a man do you think you can keep the enemy out of england psha look at his progress ask the clubhouses have they smokingrooms or not are they not obliged to yield to the general want of the age in spite of the resistance of the old women on the committees i for my part do not despair to see a bishop lolling out of the athenaeum with a cheroot in his mouth or at any rate a pipe stuck in his shovelhat  but as in all great causes and in promulgating new and illustrious theories their first propounders and exponents are generally the victims of their enthusiasm of course the first preachers of smoking have been martyrs too and george fitzboodle is one the first gasman was ruined the inventor of steamengine printing became a pauper i began to smoke in days when the task was one of some danger and paid the penalty of my crime i was flogged most fiercely for my first cigar for being asked to dine one sunday evening with a halfpay colonel of dragoons the gallant simple humorous shortcutheaven bless himi have had many a guinea from him who had so few he insisted upon my smoking in his room at the salopian and the consequence was that i became so violently ill as to be reported intoxicated upon my return to slaughterhouse school where i was a boarder and i was whipped the next morning for my peccadillo at christ church one of our tutors was the celebrated lamented otto rose who would have been a bishop under the present government had not an immoderate indulgence in watergruel cut short his elegant and useful career he was a good man a pretty scholar and poet the episode upon the discovery of eaudecologne in his prizepoem on the rhine was considered a masterpiece of art though i am not much of a judge myself upon such matters and he was as remarkable for his fondness for a tuft as for his nervous antipathy to tobacco as illluck would have it my rooms in tom quad were exactly under his and i was grown by this time to be a confirmed smoker i was a baronets son we are of james the firsts creation and i do believe our tutor could have pardoned any crime in the world but this he had seen me in a tandem and at that moment was seized with a violent fit of sneezingsternutatory paroxysm he called itat the conclusion of which i was a mile down the woodstock road he had seen me in pink as we used to call it swaggering in the open sunshine across a grassplat in the court but spied out opportunely a servitor one todhunter by name who was going to morning chapel with his shoestring untied and forthwith sprung towards that unfortunate person to set him an imposition everything in fact but tobacco he could forgive why did cursed fortune bring him into the rooms over mine the odor of the cigars made his gentle spirit quite furious and one luckless morning when i was standing before my oak and chanced to puff a great bouffee of varinas into his face he forgot his respect for my family altogether i was the second son and my brother a sickly creature thenhe is now sixteen stone in weight and has a halfscore of children gave me a severe lecture to which i replied rather hotly as was my wont and then came demand for an apology refusal on my part appeal to the dean convocation and rustication of george savage fitzboodle  my father had taken a second wife of the noble house of flintskinner and lady fitzboodle detested smoking as a woman of her high principles should she had an entire mastery over the worthy old gentleman and thought i was a sort of demon of wickedness the old man went to his grave with some similar notionheaven help him and left me but the wretched twelve thousand pounds secured to me on my poor mothers property  in the army my luck was much the same i joined the th lancers lieutcol lord martingale in the year 1817 i only did duty with the regiment for three months we were quartered at cork where i found the irish doodheen and tobacco the pleasantest smoking possible and was found by his lordship one day upon stable duty smoking the shortest dearest little dumpy claypipe in the world  cornet fitzboodle said my lord in a towering passion from what blackguard did you get that pipe  i omit the oaths which garnished invariably his lordships conversation  i got it my lord said i from one terence mullins a jingledriver with a packet of his peculiar tobacco you sometimes smoke turkish i believe do try this isnt it good and in the simplest way in the world i puffed a volume into his face i see you like it said i so coolly that the menand i do believe the horsesburst out laughing  he started backchoking almost and recovered himself only to vent such a storm of oaths and curses that i was compelled to request capt rawdon the captain on duty to take note of his lordships words and unluckily could not help adding a question which settled my business you were good enough i said to ask me my lord from what blackguard i got my pipe might i ask from what blackguard you learned your language  this was quite enough had i said from what gentleman did your lordship learn your language the point would have been quite as good and my lord martingale would have suffered in my place as it was i was so strongly recommended to sell out by his royal highness the commanderinchief that being of a goodnatured disposition never knowing how to refuse a friend i at once threw up my hopes of military distinction and retired into civil life  my lord was kind enough to meet me afterwards in a field in the glanmire road where he put a ball into my leg this i returned to him some years later with about twentythree othersblack oneswhen he came to be balloted for at a club of which i have the honor to be a member  thus by the indulgence of a simple and harmless propensityof a propensity which can inflict an injury upon no person or thing except the coat and the person of him who indulges in itof a custom honored and observed in almost all the nations of the worldof a custom which far from leading a man into any wickedness or dissipation to which youth is subject on the contrary begets only benevolent silence and thoughtful goodhumored observationi found at the age of twenty all my prospects in life destroyed i cared not for woman in those days the calm smoker has a sweet companion in his pipe i did not drink immoderately of wine for though a friend to trifling potations to excessively strong drinks tobacco is abhorrent i never thought of gambling for the lover of the pipe has no need of such excitement but i was considered a monster of dissipation in my family and bade fair to come to ruin  look at george my motherinlaw said to the genteel and correct young flintskinners he entered the world with every prospect in life and see in what an abyss of degradation his fatal habits have plunged him at school he was flogged and disgraced he was disgraced and rusticated at the university he was disgraced and expelled from the army he might have had the living of boodle her ladyship gave it to one of her nephews but he would not take his degree his papa would have purchased him a troopnay a lieutenantcolonelcy some day but for his fatal excesses and now as long as my dear husband will listen to the voice of a wife who adores himnever never shall he spend a shilling upon so worthless a young man he has a small income from his mother i cannot but think that the first lady fitzboodle was a weak and misguided person let him live upon his mean pittance as he can and i heartily pray we may not hear of him in gaol  my brother after he came to the estate married the ninth daughter of our neighbor sir john spreadeagle and boodle hall has seen a new little fitzboodle with every succeeding spring the dowager retired to scotland with a large jointure and a wondrous heap of savings lady fitz is a good creature but she thinks me something diabolical trembles when she sees me and gathers all her children about her rushes into the nursery whenever i pay that little seminary a visit and actually slapped poor little franks ears one day when i was teaching him to ride upon the back of a newfoundland dog  george said my brother to me the last time i paid him a visit at the old hall dont be angry my dear fellow but maria is in ahumin a delicate situation expecting herhumthe eleventhand do you know you frighten her it was but yesterday you met her in the rookeryyou were smoking that enormous german pipeand when she came in she had an hysterical seizure and drench says that in her situation its dangerous and i say george if you go to town youll find a couple of hundred at your bankers and with this the poor fellow shook me by the hand and called for a fresh bottle of claret  afterwards he told me with many hesitations that my room at boodle hall had been made into a second nursery i see my sisterinlaw in london twice or thrice in the season and the little people who have almost forgotten to call me uncle george  its hard too for i am a lonely man after all and my heart yearns to them the other day i smuggled a couple of them into my chambers and had a little feast of cream and strawberries to welcome them but it had like to have cost the nurserymaid a swiss girl that fitzboodle hired somewhere in his travels her place my stepmamma who happened to be in town came flying down in her chariot pounced upon the poor thing and the children in the midst of the entertainment and when i asked her with rather a bad grace to be sure to take a chair and a share of the feastmr fitzboodle said she i am not accustomed to sit down in a place that smells of tobacco like an alehousean alehouse inhabited by a serpent sir a serpentdo you understand mewho carries his poison into his brothers own house and purshues his eenfamous designs before his brothers own children put on miss marias bonnet this instant mamsell ontondyvoo metty le bonny a mamsell and i shall take care mamsell that you return to switzerland tomorrow ive no doubt you are a relation of courvoisieroui oui courvoisier vous comprennyand you shall certainly be sent back to your friends  with this speech and with the children and their maid sobbing before her my lady retired but for once my sisterinlaw was on my side not liking the meddlement of the elder lady  i know then that from indulging in that simple habit of smoking i have gained among the ladies a dreadful reputation i see that they look coolly upon me and darkly at their husbands when they arrive at home in my company men i observe in consequence ask me to dine much oftener at the club or the star and garter at richmond or at lovegroves than in their own houses and with this sort of arrangement i am fain to acquiesce for as i said before i am of an easy temper and can at any rate take my cigarcase out after dinner at blackwall when my lady or the duchess is not by i know of course the best men in town and as for ladies society not having it for i will have none of your pseudoladies such as sometimes honor bachelors partiesactresses couturieres operadancers and so forthas for ladies society i say i cry pish tis not worth the trouble of the complimenting and the bother of pumps and black silk stockings  let any man remember what ladies society was when he had an opportunity of seeing them among themselves as whatdyecallim does in the thesmophoriai beg pardon i was on the verge of a classical allusion which i abominatei mean at that period of his life when the intellect is pretty acute though the body is smallnamely when a young gentleman is about eleven years of age dining at his fathers table during the holidays and is requested by his papa to quit the dinnertable when the ladies retire from it  corbleu i recollect their whole talk as well as if it had been whispered but yesterday and can see after a long dinner the yellow summer sun throwing long shadows over the lawn before the diningroom windows and my poor mother and her company of ladies sailing away to the musicroom in old boodle hall the countess dawdley was the great lady in our county a portly lady who used to love crimson satin in those days and birdsofparadise she was flaxenhaired and the regent once said she resembled one of king charless beauties  when sir john todcaster used to begin his famous story of the exciseman i shall not tell it here for very good reasons my poor mother used to turn to lady dawdley and give that mystic signal at which all females rise from their chairs tufthunt the curate would spring from his seat and be sure to be the first to open the door for the retreating ladies and my brother tom and i though remaining stoutly in our places were speedily ejected from them by the governors invariable remark tom and george if you have had quite enough of wine you had better go and join your mamma yonder she marches heaven bless her through the old oak hall how long the shadows of the antlers are on the wainscot and the armor of rollo fitzboodle looks in the sunset as if it were emblazoned with rubiesyonder she marches stately and tall in her invariable pearlcolored tabbinet followed by lady dawdley blazing like a flamingo next comes lady emily tufthunt she was lady emily flintskinner who will not for all the world take precedence of rich vulgar kind goodhumored mrs colonel grogwater as she would be called with a yellow little husband from madras who first taught me to drink sangaree he was a new arrival in our county but paid nobly to the hounds and occupied hospitably a house which was always famous for its hospitalitysievely hall poor bob cullender ran through seven thousand a year before he was thirty years old once when i was a lad colonel grogwater gave me two gold mohurs out of his desk for whistmarkers and im sorry to say i ran up from eton and sold them both for seventythree shillings at a shop in cornhill but to return to the ladies who are all this while kept waiting in the hall and to their usual conversation after dinner  can any man forget how miserably flat it was five matrons sit on sofas and talk in a subdued voicefirst lady mysteriouslymy dear lady dawdley do tell me about poor susan tuckett  second ladyall three children are perfectly well and i assure you as fine babies as i ever saw in my life i made her give them daffys elixir the first day and it was the greatest mercy that i had some of fredericks babyclothes by me for you know i had provided susan with sets for one only and really  third ladyof course one couldnt and for my part i think your ladyship is a great deal too kind to these people a little gardeners boy dressed in lord dawdleys frocks indeed i recollect that one at his christening had the sweetest lace in the world  fourth ladywhat do you think of this maamlady emily i mean i have just had it from howell and jamesguipure they call it isnt it an odd name for lace and they charge me upon my conscience four guineas a yard  third ladymy mother when she came to flintskinner had lace upon her robe that cost sixty guineas a yard maam twas sent from malines direct by our relation the count daraignay  fourth lady asidei thought she would not let the evening pass without talking of her malines lace and her count daraignay odious people they dont spare their backs but they pinch their  here tom upsets a coffeecup over his white jean trousers and another young gentleman bursts into a laugh saying by jove thats a good un  george my dear says mamma had not you and your young friend better go into the garden but mind no fruit or dr glauber must be called in again immediately and we all go and in ten minutes i and my brother are fighting in the stables  if instead of listening to the matrons and their discourse we had taken the opportunity of attending to the conversation of the misses we should have heard matter not a whit more interesting  first missthey were all three in blue crape you never saw anything so odious and i know for a certainty that they wore those dresses at muddlebury at the archeryball and i dare say they had them in town  second missdont you think jemima decidedly crooked and those fair complexions they freckle so that really miss blanche ought to be called miss brown  third misshe he he  fourth missdont you think blanche is a pretty name  first missla do you think so dear why its my second name  second missthen im sure captain travers thinks it a beautiful name  third misshe he he  fourth misswhat was he telling you at dinner that seemed to interest you so  first misso law nothingthat is yes charlesthat iscaptain travers is a sweet poet and was reciting to me some lines that he had composed upon a faded violet            the odor from the flower is gone           that like thy  like thy something i forget what it was but his lines are sweet and so original too i wish that horrid sir john todcaster had not begun his story of the exciseman for lady fitzboodle always quits the table when he begins  third missdo you like those tufts that gentlemen wear sometimes on their chins  second missnonsense mary  third misswell i only asked jane frank thinks you know that he shall very soon have one and puts bearsgrease on his chin every night  second missmary nonsense  third misswell only ask him you know he came to our dressingroom last night and took the pomatum away and he says that when boys go to oxford they always  first misso heavens have you heard the news about the lancers charlesthat is captain travers told it me  second misslaw they wont go away before the ball i hope  first missno but on the 15th they are to shave their moustaches he says that lord tufto is in a perfect fury about it  second missand poor george beardmore too c  here tom upsets the coffee over his trousers and the conversations end i can recollect a dozen such and ask any man of sense whether such talk amuses him  try again to speak to a young lady while you are dancingwhat we call in this countrya quadrille what nonsense do you invariably give and receive in return no i am a womanscorner and dont care to own it i hate young ladies have i not been in love with several and has any one of them ever treated me decently i hate married women do they not hate me and simply because i smoke try to draw their husbands away from my society i hate dowagers have i not cause does not every dowager in london point to george fitzboodle as to a dissolute wretch whom young and old should avoid  and yet do not imagine that i have not loved i have and madly many many times i am but eightandthirty not past the age of passion and may very likely end by running off with an heiressor a cookmaid for who knows what strange freaks love may choose to play in his own particular person and i hold a man to be a mean creature who calculates about checking any such sacred impulse as lawful lovei say though despising the sex in general for their conduct to me i know of particular persons belonging to it who are worthy of all respect and esteem and as such i beg leave to point out the particular young lady who is perusing these lines do not dear madam then imagine that if i knew you i should be disposed to sneer at you ah no fitzboodles bosom has tenderer sentiments than from his way of life you would fancy and stern by rule is only too soft by practice shall i whisper to you the story of one or two of my attachments all terminating fatally not in death but in disappointment which as it occurred i used to imagine a thousand times more bitter than death but from which one recovers somehow more readily than from the othernamed complaintall i say terminating wretchedly to myself as if some fatality pursued my desire to become a domestic character        he is fiveandforty if he is a day oldo y  my first loveno let us pass that over sweet one thy name shall profane no hireling page sweet sweet memory ah ladies those delicate hearts of yours have too felt the throb and between the last ob in the word throb and the words now written i have passed a delicious period of perhaps an hour perhaps a minute i know not how long thinking of that holy first love and of her who inspired it how clearly every single incident of the passion is remembered by me and yet twas long long since i was but a child thena child at schooland if the truth must be told lra rggls i would not write her whole name to be made one of the marquess of hertfords executors was a woman full thirteen years older than myself at the period of which i write she must have been at least fiveandtwenty she and her mother used to sell tarts hardbake lollipops and other such simple comestibles on wednesdays and saturdays halfholidays at a private school where i received the first rudiments of a classical education i used to go and sit before her tray for hours but i do not think the poor girl ever supposed any motive led me so constantly to her little stall beyond a vulgar longing for her tarts and her gingerbeer yes even at that early period my actions were misrepresented and the fatality which has oppressed my whole life began to show itselfthe purest passion was misinterpreted by her and my schoolfellows and they thought i was actuated by simple gluttony they nicknamed me alicompayne  well be it so laugh at early passion ye who will a highborn boy madly in love with a lowly gingerbeer girl she married afterwards took the name of latter and now keeps with her old husband a turnpike through which i often ride but i can recollect her bright and rosy of a sunny summer afternoon her red cheeks shaded by a battered straw bonnet her tarts and gingerbeer upon a neat white cloth before her mending blue worsted stockings until the young gentlemen should interrupt her by coming to buy  many persons will call this description low i do not envy them their gentility and have always observed through life as to be sure every other gentleman has observed as well as myself that it is your parvenu who stickles most for what he calls the genteel and has the most squeamish abhorrence for what is frank and natural let us pass at once however as all the world must be pleased to a recital of an affair which occurred in the very best circles of society as they are called viz my next unfortunate attachment  it did not occur for several years after that simple and platonic passion just described for though they may talk of youth as the season of romance it has always appeared to me that there are no beings in the world so entirely unromantic and selfish as certain young english gentlemen from the age of fifteen to twenty the oldest lovelace about town is scarcely more hardhearted and scornful than they they ape all sorts of selfishness and rouerie they aim at excelling at cricket at billiards at rowing and drinking and set more store by a red coat and a neat pair of topboots than by any other glory a young fellow staggers into college chapel of a morning and communicates to all his friends that he was so cut last night with the greatest possible pride he makes a joke of having sisters and a kind mother at home who loves him and if he speaks of his father it is with a knowing sneer to say that he has a tailors and a horsedealers bill that will surprise the old governor he would be ashamed of being in love i in common with my kind had these affectations and my perpetual custom of smoking added not a little to my reputation as an accomplished roue what came of this custom in the army and at college the reader has already heard alas in life it went no better with me and many pretty chances i had went off in that accursed smoke  after quitting the army in the abrupt manner stated i passed some short time at home and was tolerated by my motherinlaw because i had formed an attachment to a young lady of good connections and with a considerable fortune which was really very nearly becoming mine mary malister was the only daughter of colonel malister late of the blues and lady susan his wife her ladyship was no more and indeed of no family compared to ours which has refused a peerage any time these two hundred years but being an earls daughter and a scotchwoman lady emily fitzboodle did not fail to consider her highly lady susan was daughter of the late admiral earl of marlingspike and baron plumduff the colonel miss malisters father had a good estate of which his daughter was the heiress and as i fished her out of the water upon a pleasureparty and swam with her to shore we became naturally intimate and colonel malister forgot on account of the service rendered to him the dreadful reputation for profligacy which i enjoyed in the county  well to cut a long story short which is told here merely for the moral at the end of it i should have been fitzboodle malister at this minute most probably and master of four thousand a year but for the fatal cigarbox i bear mary no malice in saying that she was a highspirited little girl loving before all things her own way nay perhaps i do not from long habit and indulgence in tobaccosmoking appreciate the delicacy of female organizations which were oftentimes most painfully affected by it she was a keensighted little person and soon found that the world had belied poor george fitzboodle who instead of being the cunning monster people supposed him to be was a simple reckless goodhumored honest fellow marvellously addicted to smoking idleness and telling the truth she called me orson and i was happy enough on the 14th february in the year 18 its of no consequence to send her such a pretty little copy of verses about orson and valentine in which the rude habits of the savage man were shown to be overcome by the polished graces of his kind and brilliant conqueror that she was fairly overcome and said to me george fitzboodle if you give up smoking for a year i will marry you  i swore i would of course and went home and flung four pounds of hudsons cigars two meerschaum pipes that had cost me ten guineas at the establishment of mr gattie at oxford a tobaccobag that lady fitzboodle had given me before her marriage with my father it was the only present that i ever had from her or any member of the flintskinner family and some choice packets of varinas and syrian into the lake in boodle park the weapon amongst them all which i most regretted waswill it be believedthe little black doodheen which had been the cause of the quarrel between lord martingale and me however it went along with the others i would not allow my groom to have so much as a cigar lest i should be tempted hereafter and the consequence was that a few days after many fat carps and tenches in the lake i must confess twas no bigger than a pond nibbled at the tobacco and came floating on their backs on the top of the water quite intoxicated my conversion made some noise in the county being emphasized as it were by this fact of the fish i cant tell you with what pangs i kept my resolution but keep it i did for some time  with so much beauty and wealth mary malister had of course many suitors and among them was the young lord dawdley whose mamma has previously been described in her gown of red satin as i used to thrash dawdley at school i thrashed him in afterlife in love he put up with his disappointment pretty well and came after a while and shook hands with me telling me of the bets that there were in the county where the whole story was known for and against me for the fact is as i must own that mary malister the queerest frankest of women made no secret of the agreement or the cause of it  i did not care a penny for orson she said but he would go on writing me such dear pretty verses that at last i couldnt help saying yes but if he breaks his promise to me i declare upon my honor ill break mine and nobodys heart will be broken either  this was the perfect fact as i must confess and i declare that it was only because she amused me and delighted me and provoked me and made me laugh very much and because no doubt she was very rich that i had any attachment for her  for heavens sake george my father said to me as i quitted home to follow my beloved to london remember that you are a younger brother and have a lovely girl and four thousand a year within a years reach of you smoke as much as you like my boy after marriage added the old gentleman knowingly as if he honest soul after his second marriage dared drink an extra pint of wine without my ladys permission but eschew the tobaccoshops till then  i went to london resolving to act upon the paternal advice and oh how i longed for the day when i should be married vowing in my secret soul that i would light a cigar as i walked out of st georges hanover square  well i came to london and so carefully avoided smoking that i would not even go into hudsons shop to pay his bill and as smoking was not the fashion then among young men as thank heaven it is now i had not many temptations from my friends examples in my clubs or elsewhere only little dawdley began to smoke as if to spite me he had never done so before but confessedthe rascalthat he enjoyed a cigar now if it were but to mortify me but i took to other and more dangerous excitements and upon the nights when not in attendance upon mary malister might be found in very dangerous proximity to a polished mahogany table round which claretbottles circulated a great deal too often or worse still to a table covered with green cloth and ornamented with a couple of waxcandles and a couple of packs of cards and four gentlemen playing the enticing game of whist likewise i came to carry a snuffbox and to consume in secret huge quantities of rappee  for ladies society i was even then disinclined hating and despising smalltalk and dancing and hot routs and vulgar scrambles for suppers i never could understand the pleasure of acting the part of lackey to a dowager and standing behind her chair or bustling through the crowd for her carriage i always found an opera too long by two acts and have repeatedly fallen asleep in the presence of mary malister herself sitting at the back of the box shaded by the huge beret of her old aunt lady betty plumduff and many a time has dawdley with miss malister on his arm wakened me up at the close of the entertainment in time to offer my hand to lady betty and lead the ladies to their carriage if i attended her occasionally to any ball or party of pleasure i went it must be confessed with clumsy illdisguised illhumor good heavens have i often and often thought in the midst of a song or the very thick of a ballroom can people prefer this to a book and a sofa and a dear dear cigarbox from thy stores o charming mariana woodville deprived of my favorite plant i grew sick in mind and body moody sarcastic and discontented  such a state of things could not long continue nor could miss malister continue to have much attachment for such a sullen illconditioned creature as i then was she used to make me wild with her wit and her sarcasm nor have i ever possessed the readiness to parry or reply to those fine points of womans wit and she treated me the more mercilessly as she saw that i could not resist her  well the polite reader must remember a great fete that was given at b house some years back in honor of his highness the hereditary prince of kalbsbratenpumpernickel who was then in london on a visit to his illustrious relatives it was a fancy ball and the poems of scott being at that time all the fashion mary was to appear in the character of the lady of the lake old malister making a very tall and severelooking harper dawdley a most insignificant fitzjames and your humble servant a stalwart manly roderick dhu we were to meet at b house at twelve oclock and as i had no fancy to drive through the town in my cab dressed in a kilt and philibeg i agreed to take a seat in dawdleys carriage and to dress at his house in may fair at eleven i left a very pleasant bachelors party growling to quit them and the honest jovial claretbottle in order to scrape and cut capers like a harlequin from the theatre when i arrived at dawdleys i mounted to a dressingroom and began to array myself in my cursed costume  the art of costuming was by no means so well understood in those days as it has been since and mine was out of all correctness i was made to sport an enormous plume of black ostrichfeathers such as never was worn by any highland chief and had a huge tigerskin sporran to dangle like an apron before innumerable yards of plaid petticoat the tartan cloak was outrageously hot and voluminous it was the dogdays and all these things i was condemned to wear in the midst of a crowd of a thousand people  dawdley sent up word as i was dressing that his dress had not arrived and he took my cab and drove off in a rage to his tailor  there was no hurry i thought to make a fool of myself so having put on a pair of plaid trews and very neat pumps with shoebuckles my courage failed me as to the rest of the dress and taking down one of his dressinggowns i went down stairs to the study to wait until he should arrive  the windows of the pretty room were open and a snug sofa with innumerable cushions drawn towards one of them a great tranquil moon was staring into the chamber in which stood amidst books and all sorts of bachelors lumber a silver tray with a couple of tall venice glasses and a bottle of maraschino bound with straw i can see now the twinkle of the liquor in the moonshine as i poured it into the glass and i swallowed two or three little cups of it for my spirits were downcast close to the tray of maraschino stoodmust i say ita box a mere box of cedar bound rudely together with pink paper branded with the name of hudson on the side and bearing on the cover the arms of spain i thought i would just take up the box and look in it  ah heaven there they werea hundred and fifty of them in calm comfortable rows lovingly side by side they lay with the great moon shining down upon themthin at the tip full in the waist elegantly round and full a little spot here and there shining upon thembeautyspots upon the cheek of sylvia the house was quite quiet dawdley always smoked in his roomi had not smoked for four months and eleven days    when lord dawdley came into the study he did not make any remarks and oh how easy my heart felt he was dressed in his green and boots after westalls picture correctly  its time to be off george said he they told me you were dressed long ago come up my man and get ready  i rushed up into the dressingroom and madly dashed my head and arms into a pool of eaudecologne i drank i believe a tumberful of it i called for my clothes and strange to say they were gone my servant brought them however saying that he had put them awaymaking some stupid excuse i put them on not heeding them much for i was half tipsy with the excitement of the ci of the smo of what had taken place in dawdleys study and with the maraschino and the eaudecologue i had drunk  what a fine odor of lavenderwater said dawdley as we rode in the carriage  i put my head out of the window and shrieked out a laugh but made no other reply  whats the joke george said dawdley did i say anything witty  no cried i yelling still more wildly nothing more witty than usual  dont be severe george said he with a mortified air and we drove on to b house    there must have been something strange and wild in my appearance and those awful black plumes as i passed through the crowd for i observed people looking and making a strange nasal noise it is called sniffing and i have no other more delicate term for it and making way as i pushed on but i moved forward very fiercely for the wine the maraschino the eaudecologne and thethe excitement had rendered me almost wild and at length i arrived at the place where my lovely lady of the lake and her harper stood how beautiful she lookedall eyes were upon her as she stood blushing when she saw me however her countenance assumed an appearance of alarm good heavens george she said stretching her hand to me what makes you look so wild and pale i advanced and was going to take her hand when she dropped it with a scream  ahahah she said mr fitzboodle youve been smoking  there was an immense laugh from four hundred people round about us and the scoundrelly dawdley joined in the yell i rushed furiously out and as i passed hurtled over the fat hereditary prince of kalbsbratenpumpernickel  es riecht hier ungeheuer stark von tabak i heard his highness say as i madly flung myself through the aidesdecamp  the next day mary malister in a note full of the most odious good sense and sarcasm reminded me of our agreement said that she was quite convinced that we were not by any means fitted for one another and begged me to consider myself henceforth quite free the little wretch had the impertinence to send me a dozen boxes of cigars which she said would console me for my lost love as she was perfectly certain that i was not mercenary and that i loved tobacco better than any woman in the world  i believe she was right though i have never to this day been able to pardon the scoundrelly stratagem by which dawdley robbed me of a wife and won one himself as i was lying on his sofa looking at the moon and lost in a thousand happy contemplations lord dawdley returning from the tailors saw me smoking at my leisure on entering his dressingroom a horrible treacherous thought struck him i must not betray my friend said he but in love all is fair and he shall betray himself there were my tartans my cursed feathers my tigerskin sporran upon the sofa  he called up my groom he made the rascal put on all my clothes and giving him a guinea and four cigars bade him lock himself into the little pantry and smoke them without taking the clothes off john did so and was very ill in consequence and so when i came to b house my clothes were redolent of tobacco and i lost lovely mary malister  i am godfather to one of lady dawdleys boys and hers is the only house where i am allowed to smoke unmolested but i have never been able to admire dawdley a sly sournois spiritless lilylivered fellow that took his name off all his clubs the year he married     dorothea   beyond sparring and cricket i do not recollect i learned anything useful at slaughterhouse school where i was educated according to an old family tradition which sends particular generations of gentlemen to particular schools in the kingdom and such is the force of habit that though i hate the place i shall send my own son thither too should i marry any day i say i learned little that was useful at slaughter house and nothing that was ornamental i would as soon have thought of learning to dance as of learning to climb chimneys up to the age of seventeen as i have shown i had a great contempt for the female race and when age brought with it warmer and juster sentiments where was ii could no more dance nor prattle to a young girl than a young bear could i have seen the ugliest little lowbred wretches carrying off young and lovely creatures twirling with them in waltzes whispering between their glossy curls in quadrilles simpering with perfect equanimity and cutting pas in that abominable cavalier seul until my soul grew sick with fury in a word i determined to learn to dance  but such things are hard to be acquired late in life when the bones and the habits of a man are formed look at a man in a huntingfield who has not been taught to ride as a boy all the pluck and courage in the world will not make the man of him that i am or as any man who has had the advantages of early education in the field  in the same way with dancing though i went to work with immense energy both in brewer street golden square with an advertising fellow and afterwards with old coulon at paris i never was able to be easy in dancing and though little coulon instructed me in a smile it was a cursed forced one that looked like the grin of a person in extreme agony i once caught sight of it in a glass and have hardly ever smiled since  most young men about london have gone through that strange secret ordeal of the dancingschool i am given to understand that young snobs from attorneys offices banks shops and the like make not the least mystery of their proceedings in the saltatory line but trip gayly with pumps in hand to some dancingplace about soho waltz and quadrille it with miss greengrocer or miss butcher and fancy they have had rather a pleasant evening there is one house in dover street where behind a dirty curtain such figures may be seen hopping every night to a perpetual fiddling and i have stood sometimes wondering in the street with about six blackguard boys wondering too at the strange contortions of the figures jumping up and down to the mysterious squeaking of the kit have they no shame ces gens are such degrading initiations to be held in public no the snob may but the man of refined mind never can submit to show himself in public laboring at the apprenticeship of this most absurd art it is owing perhaps to this modesty and the fact that i had no sisters at home that i have never thoroughly been able to dance for though i always arrive at the end of a quadrille and thank heaven for it too and though i believe i make no mistake in particular yet i solemnly confess i have never been able thoroughly to comprehend the mysteries of it or what i have been about from the beginning to the end of the dance i always look at the lady opposite and do as she does if she did not know how to dance par hasard it would be all up but if they cant do anything else women can dance let us give them that praise at least  in london then for a considerable time i used to get up at eight oclock in the morning and pass an hour alone with mr wilkinson of the theatres royal in golden squarean hour alone it was one two three one two threenow jumpright foot more out mr smith and if you could try and look a little more cheerful your partner sir would like you hall the better wilkinson called me smith for the fact is i did not tell him my real name nor thank heaven does he know it to this day  i never breathed a word of my doings to any soul among my friends once a pack of them met me in the strange neighborhood when i am ashamed to say i muttered something about a little french milliner and walked off looking as knowing as i could  in paris two cambridgemen and myself who happened to be staying at a boardinghouse together agreed to go to coulon a little creature of four feet high with a pigtail his room was hung round with glasses he made us take off our coats and dance each before a mirror once he was standing before us playing on his kit the sight of the little master and the pupil was so supremely ridiculous that i burst into a yell of laughter which so offended the old man that he walked away abruptly and begged me not to repeat my visits nor did i i was just getting into waltzing then but determined to drop waltzing and content myself with quadrilling for the rest of my days  this was all very well in france and england but in germany what was i to do what did hercules do when omphale captivated him what did rinaldo do when armida fixed upon him her twinkling eyes nay to cut all historical instances short by going at once to the earliest what did adam do when eve tempted him he yielded and became her slave and so i do heartily trust every honest man will yield until the end of the worldhe has no heart who will not when i was in germany i say i began to learn to waltz the reader from this will no doubt expect that some new loveadventures befell menor will his gentle heart be disappointed two deep and tremendous incidents occurred which shall be notified on the present occasion  the reader perhaps remembers the brief appearance of his highness the duke of kalbsbratenpumpernickel at b house in the first part of my memoirs at that unlucky period of my life when the duke was led to remark the odor about my clothes which lost me the hand of mary malister i somehow found myself in his highnesss territories of which anybody may read a description in the almanach de gotha his highnesss father as is well known married emilia kunegunda thomasina charleria emanuela louisa georgina princess of saxepumpernickel and a cousin of his highness the duke thus the two principalities were united under one happy sovereign in the person of philibert sigismund emanuel maria the reigning duke who has received from his country on account of the celebrated pump which he erected in the marketplace of kalbsbraten the wellmerited appellation of the magnificent the allegory which the statues round about the pump represent is of a very mysterious and complicated sort minerva is observed leading up ceres to a rivergod who has his arms round the neck of pomona while mars in a fullbottomed wig is driven away by peace under whose mantle two lovely children representing the dukes two provinces repose the celebrated speck is as need scarcely be said the author of this piece and of other magnificent edifices in the residenz such as the guardroom the skittlehall grossherzoglich kalbsbratenpumpernickelisch schkittelspielsaal c and the superb sentryboxes before the grandducal palace he is knight grand cross of the ancient kartoffel order as indeed is almost every one else in his highnesss dominions  the town of kalbsbraten contains a population of two thousand inhabitants and a palace which would accommodate about six times that number the principality sends three and a half men to the german confederation who are commanded by a general excellency two majorgenerals and sixtyfour officers of lower grades all noble all knights of the order and almost all chamberlains to his highness the grand duke an excellent band of eighty performers is the admiration of the surrounding country and leads the grandducal troops to battle in time of war only three of the contingent of soldiers returned from the battle of waterloo where they won much honor the remainder was cut to pieces on that glorious day  there is a chamber of representatives which however nothing can induce to sit home and foreign ministers residents from neighboring courts law presidents town councils c all the adjuncts of a big or little government the court has its chamberlains and marshals the grand duchess her noble ladies in waiting and blushing maids of honor thou wert one dorothea dost remember the poor young englander we parted in anger but i thinki think thou hast not forgotten him  the way in which i have dorothea von speck present to my mind is this not as i first saw her in the gardenfor her hair was in bandeaux then and a large leghorn hat with a deep ribbon covered half her fair facenot in a morningdress which by the way was none of the newest nor the best madebut as i saw her afterwards at a ball at the pleasant splendid little court where she moved the most beautiful of the beauties of kalbsbraten the grand saloon of the palace is lightedthe grand duke and his officers the duchess and her ladies have passed through i in my uniform of the th and a number of young fellows who are evidently admiring my legs and envying my distingue appearance are waiting round the entrancedoor where a huge heyduke is standing and announcing the titles of the guests as they arrive  herr oberhof und bauinspektor von speck shouts the heyduke and the little inspector comes in his lady is on his arm huge in towering plumes and her favorite costume of light blue fair women always dress in light blue or light green and frau von speck is very fair and stout  but who comes behind her lieber himmel it is dorothea did earth among all the flowers which have sprung from its bosom produce ever one more beautiful she was none of your heavenly beauties i tell you she had nothing ethereal about her no sir she was of the earth earthy and must have weighed ten stone four or five if she weighed an ounce she had none of your chinese feet nor waspy unhealthy waists which those may admire who will no doras foot was a good stout one you could see her ankle if her robe was short enough without the aid of a microscope and that envious little sour skinny amalia von mangelwurzel used to hold up her four fingers and say the two girls were most intimate friends of course dear dorotheas vaist is so much dicker as dis and so i have no doubt it was  but what then goethe sings in one of his divine epigrams  epicures vaunting their taste entitle me vulgar and savage give them their brusselssprouts but i am contented with cabbage   i hate your little womenthat is when i am in love with a tall one and who would not have loved dorothea  fancy her then if you please about five feet four inches highfancy her in the family color of light blue a little scarf covering the most brilliant shoulders in the world and a pair of gloves clinging close round an arm that may perhaps be somewhat too large now but that juno might have envied then after the fashion of young ladies on the continent she wears no jewels or gimcracks her only ornament is a wreath of vineleaves in her hair with little clusters of artificial grapes down on her shoulders falls the brown hair in rich liberal clusters all that health and goodhumor and beauty can do for her face kind nature has done for hers her eyes are frank sparkling and kind as for her cheeks what paintbox or dictionary contains pigments or words to describe their red they say she opens her mouth and smiles always to show the dimples in her cheeks psha she smiles because she is happy and kind and goodhumored and not because her teeth are little pearls  all the young fellows crowd up to ask her to dance and taking from her waist a little motherofpearl remembrancer she notes them down old schnabel for the polonaise klingenspohr first waltz haarbart second waltz count hornpieper the danish envoy third and so on i have said why i could not ask her to waltz and i turned away with a pang and played ecarte with colonel trumpenpack all night  in thus introducing this lovely creature in her ballcostume i have been somewhat premature and had best go back to the beginning of the history of my acquaintance with her  dorothea then was the daughter of the celebrated speck before mentioned it is one of the oldest names in germany where her fathers and mothers houses those of speck and eyer are loved wherever they are known unlike his warlike progenitor lorenzo von speck dorotheas father had early shown himself a passionate admirer of art had quitted home to study architecture in italy and had become celebrated throughout europe and been appointed oberhofarchitect and kunst und bauinspektor of the united principalities they are but four miles wide and his genius has consequently but little room to play what art can do however he does the palace is frequently whitewashed under his eyes the theatre painted occasionally the noble public buildings erected of which i have already made mention  i had come to kalbsbraten scarce knowing whither i went and having in about ten minutes seen the curiosities of the place i did not care to see the kings palace for chairs and tables have no great charm for me i had ordered horses and wanted to get on i cared not whither when fate threw dorothea in my way i was yawning back to the hotel through the palacegarden a valetdeplace at my side when i saw a young lady seated under a tree reading a novel her mamma on the same bench a fat woman in light blue knitting a stocking and two officers choked in their stays with various orders on their spinachcolored coats standing by in first attitudes the one was caressing the fatladyinblues little dog the other was twirling his own moustache which was already as nearly as possible curled into his own eye  i dont know how it is but i hate to see men evidently intimate with nicelooking women and on good terms with themselves theres something annoying in their cursed complacencytheir evident sunshiny happiness ive no woman to make sunshine for me and yet my heart tells me that not one but several such suns would do good to my system  who are those pertlooking officers says i peevishly to the guide who are talking to those vulgarlooking women  the big one with the epaulets is major von schnabel the little one with the pale face is stiefel von klingenspohr  and the big blue woman  the grandducal pumpernickeliancourtarchitectress and upperpalaceandbuildinginspectress von speck born v eyer replied the guide your wellborn honor has seen the pump in the marketplace that is the work of the great von speck  and yonder young person  mr courtarchitects daughter the fraulein dorothea    dorothea looked up from her novel here and turned her face towards the stranger who was passing and then blushing turned it down again schnabel looked at me with a scowl klingenspohr with a simper the dog with a yelp the fat lady in blue just gave one glance and seemed i thought rather well pleased silence lischen said she to the dog go on darling dorothea she added to her daughter who continued her novel  her voice was a little tremulous but very low and rich for some reason or other on getting back to the inn i countermanded the horses and said i would stay for the night  i not only stayed that night but many many afterwards and as for the manner in which i became acquainted with the speck family why it was a good joke against me at the time and i did not like then to have it known but now it may as well come out at once speck as everybody knows lives in the marketplace opposite his grand work of art the town pump or fountain i bought a large sheet of paper and having a knack at drawing sat down with the greatest gravity before the pump and sketched it for several hours i knew it would bring out old speck to see at first he contented himself by flattening his nose against the windowglasses of his study and looking what the englander was about then he put on his gray cap with the huge green shade and sauntered to the door then he walked round me and formed one of a band of streetidlers who were looking on then at last he could restrain himself no more but pulling off his cap with a low bow began to discourse upon arts and architecture in particular  it is curious says he that you have taken the same view of which a print has been engraved  that is extraordinary says i though it wasnt for i had traced my drawing at a window off the very print in question i added that i was like all the world immensely struck with the beauty of the edifice heard of it at rome where it was considered to be superior to any of the celebrated fountains of that capital of the fine arts finally that unless perhaps the celebrated fountain of aldgate in london might compare with it kalbsbraten building except in that case was incomparable  this speech i addressed in french of which the worthy hofarchitect understood somewhat and continuing to reply in german our conversation grew pretty close it is singular that i can talk to a man and pay him compliments with the utmost gravity whereas to a woman i at once lose all selfpossession and have never said a pretty thing in my life  my operations on old speck were so conducted that in a quarter of an hour i had elicited from him an invitation to go over the town with him and see its architectural beauties so we walked through the huge halffurnished chambers of the palace we panted up the copper pinnacle of the churchtower we went to see the museum and gymnasium and coming back into the marketplace again what could the hofarchitect do but offer me a glass of wine and a seat in his house he introduced me to his gattinn his leocadia the fat woman in blue as a young worldobserver and worthy artfriend a young scion of british adel who had come to refresh himself at the urquellen of his race and see his brethren of the great family of hermann  i saw instantly that the old fellow was of a romantic turn from this rodomontade to his lady nor was she a whit less so nor was dorothea less sentimental than her mamma she knew everything regarding the literature of albion as she was pleased to call it and asked me news of all the famous writers there i told her that miss edgeworth was one of the loveliest young beauties at our court i described to her lady morgan herself as beautiful as the wild irish girl she drew i promised to give her a signature of mrs hemans which i wrote for her that very evening and described a foxhunt at which i had seen thomas moore and samuel rogers esquires and a boxingmatch in which the athletic author of pelham was pitched against the hardy mountain bard wordsworth you see my education was not neglected for though i have never read the works of the abovenamed ladies and gentlemen yet i knew their names well enough  time passed away i perhaps was never so brilliant in conversation as when excited by the asmanshauser and the brilliant eyes of dorothea that day she and her parents had dined at their usual heathen hour but i was i dont care to own it so smitten that for the first time in my life i did not even miss the meal and talked on until six oclock when tea was served madame speck said they always drank it and so placing a teaspoonful of bohea in a cauldron of water she placidly handed out this decoction which we took with cakes and tartines i leave you to imagine how disgusted klingenspohr and schnabel looked when they stepped in as usual that evening to make their party of whist with the speck family down they were obliged to sit and the lovely dorothea for that night declined to play altogether andsat on the sofa by me  what we talked about who shall tell i would not for my part break the secret of one of those delicious conversations of which i and every man in his time have held so many you begin very probably about the weathertis a common subject but what sentiments the genius of love can fling into it i have often for my part said to the girl of my heart for the time being its a fine day or its a rainy morning in a way that has brought tears to her eyes something beats in your heart and twangle a corresponding string thrills and echoes in hers you offer her anythingher knittingneedles a slice of breadandbutterwhat causes the grateful blush with which she accepts the one or the other why she sees your heart handed over to her upon the needles and the breadandbutter is to her a sandwich with love inside it if you say to your grandmother maam its a fine day or what not she would find in the words no other meaning than their outward and visible one but say so to the girl you love and she understands a thousand mystic meanings in them thus in a word though dorothea and i did not probably on the first night of our meeting talk of anything more than the weather or trumps or some subjects which to such listeners as schnabel and klingenspohr and others might appear quite ordinary yet to us they had a different signification of which love alone held the key  without further ado then after the occurrences of that evening i determined on staying at kalbsbraten and presenting my card the next day to the hofmarshal requesting to have the honor of being presented to his highness the prince at one of whose courtballs my dorothea appeared as i have described her  it was summer when i first arrived at kalbsbraten the little court was removed to siegmundslust his highnesss countryseat no balls were taking place and in consequence i held my own with dorothea pretty well i treated her admirer lieutenant klingenspohr with perfect scorn had a manifest advantage over major schnabel and used somehow to meet the fair one every day walking in company with her mamma in the palace garden or sitting under the acacias with belotte in her mothers lap and the favorite romance beside her dear dear dorothea what a number of novels she must have read in her time she confesses to me that she had been in love with uncas with saint preux with ivanhoe and with hosts of german heroes of romance and when i asked her if she whose heart was so tender towards imaginary youths had never had a preference for any one of her living adorers she only looked and blushed and sighed and said nothing  you see i had got on as well as man could do until the confounded court season and the balls began and thenwhy then came my usual luck  waltzing is a part of a german girls life with the best will in the worldwhich i doubt not she entertains for me for i never put the matter of marriage directly to herdorothea could not go to balls and not waltz it was madness to me to see her whirling round the room with officers attaches prim little chamberlains with gold keys and embroidered coats her hair floating in the wind her hand reposing upon the abominable little dancers epaulet her goodhumored face lighted up with still greater satisfaction i saw that i must learn to waltz too and took my measures accordingly  the leader of the ballet at the kalbsbraten theatre in my time was springbock from vienna he had been a regular zephyr once twas said in his younger days and though he is now fifteen stone weight i can helas recommend him conscientiously as a master and i determined to take some lessons from him in the art which i had neglected so foolishly in early life  it may be said without vanity that i was an apt pupil and in the course of half a dozen lessons i had arrived at very considerable agility in the waltzing line and could twirl round the room with him at such a pace as made the old gentleman pant again and hardly left him breath enough to puff out a compliment to his pupil i may say that in a single week i became an expert waltzer but as i wished when i came out publicly in that character to be quite sure of myself and as i had hitherto practised not with a lady but with a very fat old man it was agreed that he should bring a lady of his acquaintance to perfect me and accordingly at my eighth lesson madame springbock herself came to the dancingroom and the old zephyr performed on the violin  if any man ventures the least sneer with regard to this lady or dares to insinuate anything disrespectful to her or myself i say at once that he is an impudent calumniator madame springbock is old enough to be my grandmother and as ugly a woman as i ever saw but though old she was passionnee pour la danse and not having on account doubtless of her age and unprepossessing appearance many opportunities of indulging in her favorite pastime made up for lost time by immense activity whenever she could get a partner in vain at the end of the hour would springbock exclaim amalia my souls blessing the time is up play on dear alphonso would the old lady exclaim whisking me round and though i had not the least pleasure in such a homely partner yet for the sake of perfecting myself i waltzed and waltzed with her until we were both half dead with fatigue  at the end of three weeks i could waltz as well as any man in germany  at the end of four weeks there was a grand ball at court in honor of h h the prince of dummerland and his princess and then i determined i would come out in public i dressed myself with unusual care and splendor my hair was curled and my moustache dyed to a nicety and of the four hundred gentlemen present if the girls of kalbsbraten did select one who wore an english hussar uniform why should i disguise the fact in spite of my silence the news had somehow got abroad as news will in such small townsherr von fitzboodle was coming out in a waltz that evening his highness the duke even made an allusion to the circumstance when on this eventful night i went as usual and made him my bow in the presentation vous monsieur said hevous qui etes si jeune devez aimer la danse i blushed as red as my trousers and bowing went away  i stepped up to dorothea heavens how beautiful she looked and how archly she smiled as with a thumping heart i asked her hand for a waltz she took out her little motherofpearl dancingbook she wrote down my name with her pencil we were engaged for the fourth waltz and till then i left her to other partners  who says that his first waltz is not a nervous moment i vow i was more excited than by any duel i ever fought i would not dance any contredanse or galop i repeatedly went to the buffet and got glasses of punch dear simple germany tis with rumpunch and eggflip thy children strengthen themselves for the dance i went into the ballroom and lookedthe couples bounded before me the music clashed and rung in my earsall was fiery feverish indistinct the gleaming white columns the polished oaken floors in which the innumerable tapers were reflectedall together swam before my eyes and i was in a pitch of madness almost when the fourth waltz at length came will you dance with your sword on said the sweetest voice in the world i blushed and stammered and trembled as i laid down that weapon and my cap and hark the music began  oh how my hand trembled as i placed it round the waist of dorothea with my left hand i took her rightdid she squeeze it i think she didto this day i think she did away we went we tripped over the polished oak floor like two young fairies courage monsieur said she with her sweet smile then it was tres bien monsieur then i heard the voices humming and buzzing about il danse bien langlais ma foi oui says another on we went twirling and twisting and turning and whirling couple after couple dropped panting off little klingenspohr himself was obliged to give in all eyes were upon uswe were going round alone dorothea was almost exhausted when        i have been sitting for two hours since i marked the asterisks thinkingthinking i have committed crimes in my lifewho hasnt but talk of remorse what remorse is there like that which rushes up in a flood to my brain sometimes when i am alone and causes me to blush when im abed in the dark  i fell sir on that infernal slippery floor down we came like shot we rolled over and over in the midst of the ballroom the music going ten miles an hour 800 pairs of eyes fixed upon us a cursed shriek of laughter bursting out from all sides heavens how clear i heard it as we went on rolling and rolling my child my dorothea shrieked out madame speck rushing forward and as soon as she had breath to do so dorothea of course screamed too then she fainted then she was disentangled from out my spurs and borne off by a bevy of tittering women clumsy brute said madame speck turning her fat back upon me i remained upon my seant wild ghastly looking about it was all up with mei knew it was i wished i could have died there and i wish so still  klingenspohr married her that is the long and short but before that event i placed a sabrecut across the young scoundrels nose which destroyed his beauty for ever  o dorothea you cant forgive meyou oughtnt to forgive me but i love you madly still  my next flame was ottilia but let us keep her for another number my feelings overpower me at present     ottilia   chapter i  the albumthe mediterranean heath   travelling some little time back in a wild part of connemara where i had been for fishing and sealshooting i had the good luck to get admission to the chateau of a hospitable irish gentleman and to procure some news of my once dear ottilia  yes of no other than ottilia v schlippenschlopp the muse of kalbsbratenpumpernickel the friendly little town far away in sachsenlandwhere old speck built the town pump where klingenspohr was slashed across the nosewhere dorothea rolled over and over in that horrible waltz with fitzboopshaaway with the recollection but wasnt it strange to get news of ottilia in the wildest corner of ireland where i never should have thought to hear her gentle name walking on that very urrisbeg mountain under whose shadow i heard ottilias name mackay the learned author of the flora patlandica discovered the mediterranean heathsuch a flower as i have often plucked on the sides of vesuvius and as proserpine no doubt amused herself in gathering as she strayed in the fields of enna here it isthe selfsame flower peering out at the atlantic from roundstone bay here too in this wild lonely place nestles the fragrant memory of my ottilia  in a word after a day on ballylynch lake where with a brown fly and a single hair i killed fourteen salmon the smallest twentynine pounds weight the largest somewhere about five stone ten my young friend blake bodkin lynch browne a fine lad who has made his continental tour and i adjourned after dinner to the young gentlemans private room for the purpose of smoking a certain cigar which is never more pleasant than after a hard days sport or a day spent indoors or after a good dinner or a bad one or at night when you are tired or in the morning when you are fresh or of a cold winters day or of a scorching summers afternoon or at any other moment you choose to fix upon  what should i see in blakes room but a rack of pipes such as are to be found in almost all the bachelors rooms in germany and amongst them was a porcelain pipehead bearing the image of the kalbsbraten pump there it was the old spout the old familiar allegory of mars bacchus apollo virorum and the rest that i had so often looked at from hofarchitect specks window as i sat there by the side of dorothea the old gentleman had given me one of these very pipes for he had hundreds of them painted wherewith he used to gratify almost every stranger who came into his native town  any old place with which i have once been familiar as perhaps i have before stated in these confessionsbut never mind that is in some sort dear to me and were i lord shootingcastle or colonel popland i think after a residence of six months there i should love the fleet prison as i saw the old familiar pipe i took it down and crammed it with cavendish tobacco and lay down on a sofa and puffed away for an hour wellnigh thinking of old old times  youre very entertaining tonight fitz says young blake who had made several tumblers of punch for me which i had gulped down without saying a word dont ye think yed be more easy in bed than snorting and sighing there on my sofa and groaning fit to make me go hang myself  i am thinking blake says i about pumpernickel where old speck gave you this pipe  deed he did replies the young man and did ye know the old barn  i did said i my friend i have been by the banks of the bendemeer tell me are the nightingales still singing there and do the roses still bloom  the hwhat cries blake what the divvle fitz are you growling about bendemeer lakes in westmoreland as i preshume and as for roses and nightingales i give ye my word its greek yere talking to me and greek it very possibly was for my young friend though as good across country as any man in his county has not the fine feeling and tender perception of beauty which may be found elsewhere dear madam  tell me about speck blake and kalbsbraten and dorothea and klingenspohr her husband  he with the cut across the nose is it cries blake i know him well and his old wife  his old what sir cries fitzboodle jumping up from his seat klingenspohrs wife oldis he married againis dorothea then dddead  deadno more dead than you are only i take her to be fiveandthirty and when a woman has had nine children you know she looks none the younger and i can tell ye that when she trod on my corruns at a ball at the grand jukes i felt something heavier than a feather on my foot  madame de klingenspohr then replied i hesitating somewhat has grown ratherrather ststout i could hardly get out the out and trembled i dont know why as i asked the question  stout begadshe weighs fourteen stone saddle and bridle thats right down goes my pipe flop crash falls the tumbler into the fender break away my boy and remember whoever breaks a glass here pays a dozen  the fact was that the announcement of dorotheas changed condition caused no small disturbance within me and i expressed it in the abrupt manner mentioned by young blake  roused thus from my reverie i questioned the young fellow about his residence at kalbsbraten which has been always since the war a favorite place for our young gentry and heard with some satisfaction that potzdorff was married to the behrenstein haabart had left the dragoons the crown prince had broken with the  but mum of what interest are all these details to the reader who has never been at friendly little kalbsbraten  presently lynch reaches me down one of the three books that formed his library the racing calendar and a book of fishingflies making up the remainder of the set and theres my album says he youll find plenty of hands in it that youll recognize as you are an old pumpernickelaner and so i did in truth it was a little book after the fashion of german albums in which good simple little ledger every friend or acquaintance of the owner inscribes a poem or stanza from some favorite poet or philosopher with the transcribers own name as thus  to the true housefriend and beloved irelandish youth  sera nunquam est ad bonos mores via  wackerbart professor at the grandducal kalbsbratenpumpernickelisch gymnasium   another writes  wander on roses and forget me not  amalia v nachtmutze  geb v shalafrock   with a flourish and the picture mayhap of a rose let the reader imagine some hundreds of these interesting inscriptions and he will have an idea of the book  turning over the leaves i came presently on dorotheas hand there it was the little neat pretty handwriting the dear old upanddown strokes that i had not looked at for many a long yearthe mediterranean heath which grew on the sunniest banks of fitzboodles existence and here found dear dear little sprig in rude galwagian boglands  look at the other side of the page says lynch rather sarcastically for i dont care to confess that i kissed the name of dorothea v klingenspohr born v speck written under an extremely feeble passage of verse look at the other side of the paper  i did and what do you think i saw  i saw the writing of five of the little klingenspohrs who have all sprung up since my time    ha ha haw screamed the impertinent young irishman and the story was all over connemara and joyces country in a day after     chapter ii  ottilia in particular   some kind critic who peruses these writings will doubtless have the goodness to point out that the simile of the mediterranean heath is applied to two personages in this chapterto ottilia and dorothea and say psha the fellow is but a poor unimaginative creature not to be able to find a simile apiece at least for the girls how much better would we have done the business  well it is a very pretty simile the girls were rivals were beautiful i loved them bothwhich should have the sprig of heath mr cruikshank who has taken to serious painting is getting ready for the exhibition a fine piece representing fitzboodle on the urrisbeg mountain county galway ireland with a sprig of heath in his hand hesitating like paris on which of the beauties he should bestow it in the background is a certain animal between two bundles of hay but that i take to represent the critic puzzled to which of my young beauties to assign the choice  if dorothea had been as rich as miss coutts and had come to me the next day after the accident at the ball and said george will you marry me it must not be supposed i would have done any such thing that dream had vanished for ever rage and pride took the place of love and the only chance i had of recovering from my dreadful discomfiture was by bearing it bravely and trying if possible to awaken a little compassion in my favor i limped home arranging my scheme with great presence of mind as i actually sat spinning there on the groundi limped home sent for pflastersticken the courtsurgeon and addressed him to the following effect pflastersticken says i there has been an accident at court of which you will hear you will send in leeches pills and the deuce knows what and you will say that i have dislocated my leg for some days you will state that i am in considerable danger you are a good fellow and a man of courage i know for which very reason you can appreciate those qualities in another so mind if you breathe a word of my secret either you or i must lose a life  away went the surgeon and the next day all kalbsbraten knew that i was on the point of death i had been delirious all night had had eighty leeches besides i dont know how much medicine but the kalbsbrateners knew to a scruple whenever anybody was ill this little kind society knew what medicines were prescribed everybody in the town knew what everybody had for dinner if madame rumpel had her satin dyed ever so quietly the whole society was on the qui vive if countess pultuski sent to berlin for a new set of teeth not a person in kalbsbraten but what was ready to compliment her as she put them on if potzdorff paid his tailors bill or muffinstein bought a piece of black wax for his moustaches it was the talk of the little city and so of course was my accident in their sorrow for my misfortune dorotheas was quite forgotten and those eighty leeches saved me i became interesting i had cards left at my door and i kept my room for a fortnight during which time i read every one of m kotzebues plays  at the end of that period i was convalescent though still a little lame i called at old specks house and apologized for my clumsiness with the most admirable coolness i appeared at court and stated calmly that i did not intend to dance any more and when klingenspohr grinned i told that young gentleman such a piece of my mind as led to his wearing a large stickingplaster patch on his nose which was split as neatly down the middle as you would split an orange at dessert in a word what man could do to repair my defeat i did  there is but one thing now of which i am ashamedof those killing epigrams which i wrote mon dieu must i own itbut even the fury of my anger proves the extent of my love against the speck family they were handed about in confidence at court and made a frightful sensation                     is it possible            there happened at schloss pmprnckel            a strange mishap our sides to tickle              and set the people in a roar            a strange caprice of fortune fickle            i never thought at pumpernickel              to see a speck upon the floor          la perfide albion or a caution to waltzers            come to the dance the briton said            and forward drtha led              fair fresh and threeandtwenty            ah girls beware of britons red            what wonder that it turned her head              sat verbum sapienti             reasons for not marrying            the lovely miss s            will surely say yes            youve only to ask and try            that subject well quit            says georgy the wit            ive a much better spec in my eye  this last epigram especially was voted so killing that it flew like wildfire and i know for a fact that our chargedaffaires at kalbsbraten sent a courier express with it to the foreign office in england whence through our amiable foreign secretary lord plmrston it made its way into every fashionable circle nay i have reason to believe caused a smile on the cheek of rylty itself now that time has taken away the sting of these epigrams there can be no harm in giving them and twas well enough then to endeavor to hide under the lash of wit the bitter pangs of humiliation but my heart bleeds now to think that i should have ever brought a tear on the gentle cheek of dorothea  not content with thiswith humiliating her by satire and with wounding her accepted lover across the nosei determined to carry my revenge still farther and to fall in love with somebody else this person was ottilia v schlippenschlopp  otho sigismund freyherr von schlippenschlopp knight grand cross of the ducal order of the twonecked swan of pumpernickel of the porcetsiflet of kalbsbraten commander of the george and blueboar of dummerland excellency and high chancellor of the united duchies lived in the second floor of a house in the schwapsgasse where with his private income and his revenues as chancellor amounting together to some 300l per annum he maintained such a state as very few other officers of the grandducal crown could exhibit the baron is married to marie antoinette a countess of the house of kartoffelstadt branches of which have taken root all over germany he has no sons and but one daughter the fraulein ottilia  the chancellor is a worthy old gentleman too fat and wheezy to preside at the privy council fond of his pipe his ease and his rubber his lady is a very tall and pale romannosed countess who looks as gentle as mrs robert roy where in the novel she is for putting baillie nicol jarvie into the lake and who keeps the honest chancellor in the greatest order the fraulein ottilia had not arrived at kalbsbraten when the little affair between me and dorothea was going on or rather had only just come in for the conclusion of it being presented for the first time that year at the ball where iwhere i met with my accident  at the time when the countess was young it was not the fashion in her country to educate the young ladies so highly as since they have been educated and provided they could waltz sew and make puddings they were thought to be decently bred being seldom called upon for algebra or sanscrit in the discharge of the honest duties of their lives but fraulein ottilia was of the modern school in this respect and came back from the pension at strasburg speaking all the languages dabbling in all the sciences an historian a poeta blue of the ultramarinest sort in a word what a difference there was for instance between poor simple dorotheas love of novel reading and the profound encyclopaedic learning of ottilia  before the latter arrived from strasburg where she had been under the care of her aunt the canoness countess ottilia of kartoffeldstadt to whom i here beg to offer my humblest respects dorothea had passed for a bel esprit in the little court circle and her little simple stock of accomplishments had amused us all very well she used to sing herz mein herz and ten souvienstu in a decent manner once before heaven i thought her singing better than grisis and then she had a little album in which she drew flowers and used to embroider slippers wonderfully and was very merry at a game of loto or forfeits and had a hundred small agremens de societe which rendered her an acceptable member of it  but when ottilia arrived poor dollys reputation was crushed in a month the former wrote poems both in french and german she painted landscapes and portraits in real oil and she twanged off a rattling piece of listz or kalkbrenner in such a brilliant way that dora scarcely dared to touch the instrument after her or ventured after ottilia had trilled and gurgled through una voce or di piacer rossini was in fashion then to lift up her little modest pipe in a ballad what was the use of the poor thing going to sit in the park where so many of the young officers used ever to gather round her whir ottilia went by galloping on a chestnut mare with a groom after her and presently all the young fellows who could buy or hire horseflesh were prancing in her train  when they met ottilia would bounce towards her souls darling and put her hands round her waist and call her by a thousand affectionate names and then talk of her as only ladies or authors can talk of one another how tenderly she would hint at doras little imperfections of educationhow cleverly she would insinuate that the poor girl had no wit and thank god no more she had the fact is that do what i will i see im in love with her still and would be if she had fifty children but my passion blinded me then and every arrow that fiery ottilia discharged i marked with savage joy dolly thank heaven didnt mind the wit much she was too simple for that but still the recurrence of it would leave in her heart a vague indefinite feeling of pain and somehow she began to understand that her empire was passing away and that her dear friend hated her like poison and so she married klingenspohr i have written myself almost into a reconciliation with the silly fellow for the truth is he has been a good honest husband to her and she has children and makes puddings and is happy  ottilia was pale and delicate she wore her glistening black hair in bands and dressed in vapory white muslin she sang her own words to her harp and they commonly insinuated that she was alone in the worldthat she suffered some inexpressible and mysterious heartpangs the lot of all finer geniusesthat though she lived and moved in the world she was not of it that she was of a consumptive tendency and might look for a premature interment she even had fixed on the spot where she should lie the violets grew there she said the river went moaning by the gray willow whispered sadly over her head and her heart pined to be at rest mother she would say turning to her parent promise mepromise me to lay me in that spot when the parting hour has come at which madame de schlippenschlopp would shriek and grasp her in her arms and at which i confess i would myself blubber like a child she had six darling friends at school and every courier from kalbsbraten carried off whole reams of her letterpaper  in kalbsbraten as in every other german town there are a vast number of literary characters of whom our young friend quickly became the chief they set up a literary journal which appeared once a week upon lightblue or primrose paper and which in compliment to the lovely ottilias maternal name was called the kartoffelnkranz here are a couple of her ballads extracted from the kranz and by far the most cheerful specimen of her style for in her songs she never would willingly let off the heroines without a suicide or a consumption she never would hear of such a thing as a happy marriage and had an appetite for grief quite amazing in so young a person as for her dying and desiring to be buried under the willowtree of which the first ballad is the subject though i believed the story then i have at present some doubts about it for since the publication of my memoirs i have been thrown much into the society of literary persons who admire my style hugely and egad though some of them are dismal enough in their works i find them in their persons the least sentimental class that ever a gentleman fell in with       the willowtree        know ye the willowtree        whose gray leaves quiver      whispering gloomily        to yon pale river      lady at eventide        wander not near it      they say its branches hide        a sad lost spirit       once to the willowtree        a maid came fearful      pale seemed her cheek to be        her blue eye tearful      soon as she saw the tree        her step moved fleeter      no one was thereah me        no one to meet her       quick beat her heart to hear        the far bells chime      toll from the chapeltower        the trysting time      but the red sun went down        in golden flame      and though she looked round        yet no one came       presently came the night        sadly to greet her      moon in her silver light        stars in their glitter      then sank the moon away        under the billow      still wept the maid alone        there by the willow       through the long darkness        by the stream rolling      hour after hour went on        tolling and tolling      long was the darkness        lonely and stilly      shrill came the nightwind        piercing and chilly       shrill blew the morning breeze        biting and cold      bleak peers the gray dawn        over the wold      bleak over moor and stream        looks the grey dawn      gray with dishevelled hair      still stands the willow there         the maid is gone       domine domine        sing we a litany       sing for poor maidenhearts broken and           weary        domine domine      sing we a litany        wail we and weep we a wild miserere  one of the chief beauties of this ballad for the translation of which i received some wellmerited compliments is the delicate way in which the suicide of the poor young woman under the willowtree is hinted at for that she threw herself into the water and became one among the lilies of the stream is as clear as a pikestaff her suicide is committed some time in the darkness when the slow hours move on tolling and tolling and is hinted at darkly as befits the time and the deed  but that unromantic brute van cutsem the dutch chargedaffaires sent to the kartoffelnkranz of the week after a conclusion of the ballad which shows what a poor creature he must be his pretext for writing it was he said because he could not bear such melancholy endings to poems and young women and therefore he submitted the following lines       i       long by the willowtrees        vainly they sought her      wild rang the mothers screams        oer the gray water      where is my lovely one

patience with the individual who can turn the finest sentiments of our nature into ridicule and make everything sacred a subject of scorn the next ballad is less gloomy than that of the willowtree and in it the lovely writer expresses her longing for what has charmed us all and as it were squeezes the whole spirit of the fairy tale into a few stanzas       fairy days       beside the old hallfireupon my nurses knee      of happy fairy dayswhat tales were told to me      i thought the world was onceall peopled with princesses      and my heart would beat to heartheir loves and their distresses      and many a quiet nightin slumber sweet and deep      the pretty fairy peoplewould visit me in sleep       i saw them in my dreamscome flying east and west      with wondrous fairy

golden robe and crown      ive seen her in my dreamsriding up and down      and heard the ogre laughas she fell into his snare      at the little tender creaturewho wept and tore her hair       but ever when it seemedher need was at the sorest      a prince in shining mailcomes prancing through the forest      a waving ostrichplumea buckler burnished bright      ive seen him in my dreamsgood sooth a gallant knight      his lips are coral redbeneath a dark moustache      see how he waves his handand how his blue eyes flash       come forth thou paynim knighthe shouts in accents clear

happy childish talesof knight and faerie      i waken from my dreamsbut theres neer a knight for me      i waken from my dreamsand wish that i could be      a child by the old hallfireupon my nurses knee  indeed ottilia looked like a fairy herself pale small slim and airy you could not see her face as it were for her eyes which were so wild and so tender and shone so that they would have dazzled an eagle much more a poor goose of a fitzboodle in the theatre when she sat on the opposite side of the house those big eyes used to pursue me as i sat pretending to listen to the zauberflote or to don carlos or egmont and at the tender passages especially they would have such a winning weeping imploring look with them as flesh and blood could not bear  shall i tell how i became a poet for the dear girls sake tis surely unnecessary after the reader has perused the above versions of her poems shall i tell what wild follies i committed in prose as well as in verse how i used to watch under her window of icy evenings and with chilblainy fingers sing serenades to her on the guitar shall i tell how in a sledgingparty i had the happiness to drive her and of the delightful privilege which is on these occasions accorded to the driver  any reader who has spent a winter in germany perhaps knows it a large party of a score or more of sledges is formed away they go to some pleasurehouse that has been previously fixed upon where a ball and collation are prepared and where each man as his partner descends has the delicious privilege of saluting her o heavens and earth i may grow to be a thousand years old but i can never forget the rapture of that salute  the keen air has given me an appetite said the dear angel as we entered the supperroom and to say the truth fairy as she was she made a remarkably good mealconsuming a couple of basins of white soup several kinds of german sausages some westphalia ham some white puddings an anchovysalad made with cornichons and onions sweets innumerable and a considerable quantity of old steinwein and rumpunch afterwards then she got up and danced as brisk as a fairy in which operation i of course did not follow her but had the honor at the close of the evenings amusement once more to have her by my side in the sledge as we swept in the moonlight over the snow  kalbsbraten is a very hospitable place as far as teaparties are concerned but i never was in one where dinners were so scarce at the palace they occurred twice or thrice in a month but on these occasions spinsters were not invited and i seldom had the opportunity of seeing my ottilia except at eveningparties  nor are these if the truth must be told very much to my taste dancing i have forsworn whist is too severe a study for me and i do not like to play ecarte with old ladies who are sure to cheat you in the course of an evenings play  but to have an occasional glance at ottilia was enough and many and many a napoleon did i lose to her mamma madame de schlippenschlopp for the blest privilege of looking at her daughter many is the teaparty i went to shivering into cold clothes after dinner which is my abomination in order to have one little look at the lady of my soul  at these parties there were generally refreshments of a nature more substantial than mere tea punch both milk and rum hot wine consomme and a peculiar and exceedingly disagreeable sandwich made of a mixture of cold white puddings and garlic of which i have forgotten the name and always detested the savor  gradually a conviction came upon me that ottilia ate a great deal  i do not dislike to see a woman eat comfortably i even think that an agreeable woman ought to be friande and should love certain little dishes and knickknacks i know that though at dinner they commonly take nothing they have had roastmutton with the children at two and laugh at their pretensions to starvation  no a woman who eats a grain of rice like amina in the arabian nights is absurd and unnatural but there is a modus in rebus there is no reason why she should be a ghoul a monster an ogress a horrid gormandizeressfaugh  it was then with a rage amounting almost to agony that i found ottilia ate too much at every meal she was always eating and always eating too much if i went there in the morning there was the horrid familiar odor of those oniony sandwiches if in the afternoon dinner had been just removed and i was choked by reeking reminiscences of roastmeat tea we have spoken of she gobbled up more cakes than any six people present then came the supper and the sandwiches again and the eggflip and the horrible rumpunch  she was as thin as everpaler if possible than everbut by heavens her nose began to grow red  mon dieu how i used to watch and watch it some days it was purple some days had more of the vermilioni could take an affidavit that after a heavy nights supper it was more swollen more red than before  i recollect one night when we were playing a round game i had been looking at her nose very eagerly and sadly for some time she of herself brought up the conversation about eating and confessed that she had five meals a day  that accounts for it says i flinging down the cards and springing up and rushing like a madman out of the room i rushed away into the night and wrestled with my passion what marry said i a woman who eats meat twentyone times in a week besides breakfast and tea marry a sarcophagus a cannibal a butchers shopaway i strove and strove i drank i groaned i wrestled and fought with my lovebut it overcame me one look of those eyes brought me to her feet again i yielded myself up like a slave i fawned and whined for her i thought her nose was not so very red  things came to this pitch that i sounded his highnesss minister to know whether he would give me service in the duchy i thought of purchasing an estate there i was given to understand that i should get a chamberlains key and some post of honor did i choose to remain and i even wrote home to my brother tom in england hinting a change in my condition  at this juncture the town of hamburg sent his highness the grand duke apropos of a commercial union which was pending between the two states a singular present no less than a certain number of barrels of oysters which are considered extreme luxuries in germany especially in the inland parts of the country where they are almost unknown  in honor of the oysters and the new commercial treaty which arrived in fourgons despatched for the purpose his highness announced a grand supper and ball and invited all the quality of all the principalities round about it was a splendid affair the grand saloon brilliant with hundreds of uniforms and brilliant toilettesnot the least beautiful among them i need not say was ottilia  at midnight the supperrooms were thrown open and we formed into little parties of six each having a table nobly served with plate a lackey in attendance and a gratifying icepail or two of champagne to egayer the supper it was no small cost to serve five hundred people on silver and the repast was certainly a princely and magnificent one  i had of course arranged with mademoiselle de schlippenschlopp captains frumpel and fridelberger of the dukes guard mesdames de butterbrod and bopp formed our little party  the first course of course consisted of the oysters ottilias eyes gleamed with double brilliancy as the lackey opened them there were nine apiece for ushow well i recollect the number  i never was much of an oystereater nor can i relish them in naturalibus as some do but require a quantity of sauces lemons cayenne peppers bread and butter and so forth to render them palatable  by the time i had made my preparations ottilia the captains and the two ladies had wellnigh finished theirs indeed ottilia had gobbled up all hers and there were only my nine in the dish  i took oneit was bad the scent of it was enoughthey were all bad ottilia had eaten nine bad oysters  i put down the horrid shell her eyes glistened more and more she could not take them off the tray  dear herr george she said will you give me your oysters    she had them all downbeforei could sayjackrobinson  i left kalbsbraten that night and have never been there since      fitzboodles professions  being appeals to the unemployed younger sons of the nobility     first profession   the fair and honest proposition in which i offered to communicate privately with parents and guardians relative to two new and lucrative professions which i had discovered has i find from the publisher elicited not one single inquiry from those personages who i cant but think are very little careful of their childrens welfare to allow such a chance to be thrown away it is not for myself i speak as my conscience proudly tells me for though i actually gave up ascot in order to be in the way should any father of a family be inclined to treat with me regarding my discoveries yet i am grieved not on my own account but on theirs and for the wretched pennywise policy that has held them back  that they must feel an interest in my announcement is unquestionable look at the way in which the public prints of all parties have noticed my appearance in the character of a literary man putting aside my personal narrative look at the offer i made to the nationa choice of no less than two new professions suppose i had invented as many new kinds of butchers meat does any one pretend that the world tired as it is of the perpetual recurrence of beef mutton veal cold beef cold veal cold mutton hashed ditto would not have jumped eagerly at the delightful intelligence that their old stale stupid meals were about to be varied at last  of course people would have come forward i should have had deputations from mr gibletts and the fashionable butchers of this world petitions would have poured in from whitechapel salesmen the speculators panting to know the discovery the cautious with stock in hand eager to bribe me to silence and prevent the certain depreciation of the goods which they already possessed i should have dealt with them not greedily or rapaciously but on honest principles of fair barter gentlemen i should have said or rather gentswhich affectionate diminutive is i am given to understand at present much in use among commercial personsgents my researches my genius or my good fortune have brought me to the valuable discovery about which you are come to treat will you purchase it outright or will you give the discoverer an honest share of the profits resulting from your speculation my position in the world puts me out of the power of executing the vast plan i have formed but twill be a certain fortune to him who engages in it and why should not i too participate in that fortune  such would have been my manner of dealing with the world too with regard to my discovery of the new professions does not the world want new professions are there not thousands of welleducated men panting struggling pushing starving in the old ones grim tenants of chambers looking out for attorneys who never comewretched physicians practising the stale joke of being called out of church until people no longer think fit even to laugh or to pity are there not hoaryheaded midshipmen antique ensigns growing mouldy upon fifty years halfpay nay are there not men who would pay anything to be employed rather than remain idle but such is the glut of professionals the horrible cutthroat competition among them that there is no chance for one in a thousand be he ever so willing or brave or clever in the great ocean of life he makes a few strokes and puffs and sputters and sinks and the innumerable waves overwhelm him and he is heard of no more  walking to my bankers tother dayand i pledge my sacred honor this story is truei met a young fellow whom i had known attache to an embassy abroad a young man of tolerable parts unwearied patience with some fortune too and moreover allied to a noble whig family whose interest had procured him his appointment to the legation at krahwinkel where i knew him he remained for ten years a diplomatic character he was the workingman of the legation he sent over the most diffuse translations of the german papers for the use of the foreign secretary he signed passports with most astonishing ardor he exiled himself for ten long years in a wretched german town dancing attendance at courtballs and paying no end of money for uniforms and what for at the end of the ten yearsduring which period of labor he never received a single shilling from the government which employed him rascally spendthrift of a government vahe was offered the paid attacheship to the court of h m the king of the mosquito islands and refused that appointment a week before the whig ministry retired then he knew that there was no further chance for him and incontinently quitted the diplomatic service for ever and i have no doubt will sell his uniform a bargain the government had him a bargain certainly nor is he by any means the first person who has been sold at that price  well my worthy friend met me in the street and informed me of these facts with a smiling countenancewhich i thought a masterpiece of diplomacy fortune had been belaboring and kicking him for ten whole years and here he was grinning in my face could monsieur de talleyrand have acted better i have given up diplomacy said protocol quite simply and goodhumoredly for between you and me my good fellow its a very slow profession sure perhaps but slow but though i gained no actual pecuniary remuneration in the service i have learned all the languages in europe which will be invaluable to me in my new professionthe mercantile onein which directly i looked out for a post i found one  what and a good pay said i  why no thats absurd you know no young men strangers to business are paid much to speak of besides i dont look to a paltry clerks pay some day when thoroughly acquainted with the business i shall learn it in about seven years i shall go into a good house with my capital and become junior partner  and meanwhile  meanwhile i conduct the foreign correspondence of the eminent house of jam ram and johnson and very heavy it is i can tell you from nine till six every day except foreign post days and then from nine till eleven dirty dark court to sit in snobs to talk togreat change as you may fancy  and you do all this for nothing  i do it to learn the business and so saying protocol gave me a knowing nod and went his way  good heavens i thought and is this a true story are there hundreds of young men in a similar situation at the present day giving away the best years of their youth for the sake of a mere windy hope of something in old age and dying before they come to the goal in seven years he hopes to have a business and then to have the pleasure of risking his money he will be admitted into some great house as a particular favor and three months after the house will fail has it not happened to a thousand of our acquaintance i thought i would run after him and tell him about the new professions that i have invented  oh ay those you wrote about in frasers magazine egad george necessity makes strange fellows of us all who would ever have thought of you spelling much more writing  never mind that will you if i tell you of a new profession that with a little cleverness and instruction from me you may bring to a most successful endwill you i say make me a fair return  my dear creature replied young protocol what nonsense you talk i saw that very humbug in the magazine you say you have made a great discoveryvery good you puff your discoveryvery right you ask money for itnothing can be more reasonable and then you say that you intend to make your discovery public in the next number of the magazine do you think i will be such a fool as to give you money for a thing which i can have next month for nothing goodby george my boy the next discovery you make ill tell you how to get a better price for it and with this the fellow walked off looking supremely knowing and clever  this tale of the person i have called protocol is not told without a purpose you may be sure in the first place it shows what are the reasons that nobody has made application to me concerning the new professions namely because i have passed my word to make them known in this magazine which persons may have for the purchasing stealing borrowing or hiring and therefore they will never think of applying personally to me and secondly his story proves also my assertion viz that all professions are most cruelly crowded at present and that men will make the most absurd outlay and sacrifices for the smallest chance of success at some future period well then i will be a benefactor to my race if i cannot be to one single member of it whom i love better than most men what i have discovered i will make known there shall be no shillyshallying work here no circumlocution no bottleconjuring business but oh i wish for all our sakes that i had had an opportunity to impart the secret to one or two persons only for after all but one or two can live in the manner i would suggest and when the discovery is made known i am sure ten thousand will try the rascals i can see their brassplates gleaming over scores of doors competition will ruin my professions as it has all others  it must be premised that the two professions are intended for gentlemen and gentlemen onlymen of birth and education no others could support the parts which they will be called upon to play  and likewise it must be honestly confessed that these professions have to a certain degree been exercised before do not cry out at this and say it is no discovery i say it is a discovery it is a discovery if i show youa gentlemana profession which you may exercise without derogation or loss of standing with certain profit nay possibly with honor and of which until the reading of this present page you never thought but as of a calling beneath your rank and quite below your reach sir i do not mean to say that i create a profession i cannot create gold but if when discovered i find the means of putting it in your pocket do i or do i not deserve credit  i see you sneer contemptuously when i mention to you the word auctioneer is this all you say that this fellow brags and prates about an auctioneer forsooth he might as well have invented chimneysweeping  no such thing a little boy of seven be he ever so low of birth can do this as well as you do you suppose that little stolen master montague made a better sweeper than the lowestbred chummy that yearly commemorates his release no sir and he might have been ever so much a genius or gentleman and not have been able to make his trade respectable  but all such trades as can be rendered decent the aristocracy has adopted one by one at first they followed the profession of arms flouting all others as unworthy and thinking it ungentlemanlike to know how to read or write they did not go into the church in very early days till the money to be got from the church was strong enough to tempt them it is but of later years that they have condescended to go to the bar and since the same time only that we see some of them following trades i know an english lords son who is or was a winemerchant he may have been a bankrupt for what i know as for bankers several partners in bankinghouses have four balls to their coronets and i have no doubt that another sort of banking viz that practised by gentlemen who lend small sums of money upon deposited securities will be one day followed by the noble order so that they may have four balls on their coronets and carriages and three in front of their shops  yes the nobles come peoplewards as the people on the other hand rise and mingle with the nobles with the plebs of course fitzboodle in whose veins flows the blood of a thousand kings can have nothing to do but watching the progress of the world tis impossible to deny that the good old days of our race are passed away we want money still as much as ever we did but we cannot go down from our castles with horse and sword and waylay fat merchantsno no confounded new policemen and the assizecourts prevent that younger brothers cannot be pages to noble houses as of old they were serving gentle dames without disgrace handing my lords rosewater to wash or holding his stirrup as he mounted for the chase a page forsooth a pretty figure would george fitzboodle or any other man of fashion cut in a jacket covered with sugarloafed buttons and handing in pennypost notes on a silver tray the plebs have robbed us of that trade among others nor i confess do i much grudge them their trouvaille neither can we collect together a few scores of free lances like honest hugh calverly in the black princes time or brave harry butler of wallensteins dragoons and serve this or that prince peter the cruel or henry of trastamare gustavus or the emperor at our leisure or in default of service fight and rob on our own gallant account as the good gentlemen of old did alas no in south america or texas perhaps a man might have a chance that way but in the ancient world no man can fight except in the kings service and a mighty bad service that is too and the lowest european sovereign were it baldomero espartero himself would think nothing of seizing the bestborn condottiere that ever drew sword and shooting him down like the vulgarest deserter  what then is to be done we must discover fresh fields of enterpriseof peaceable and commercial enterprise in a peaceful and commercial age i say then that the auctioneers pulpit has never yet been ascended by a scion of the aristocracy and am prepared to prove that they might scale it and do so with dignity and profit  for the auctioneers pulpit is just the peculiar place where a man of social refinement of elegant wit of polite perceptions can bring his wit his eloquence his taste and his experience of life most delightfully into play it is not like the bar where the better and higher qualities of a man of fashion find no room for exercise in defending john jorrocks in an action of trespass for cutting down a stick in sam snookss field what powers of mind do you requirepowers of mind that is which mr serjeant snorter a butchers son with a great loud voice a sizar at cambridge a wrangler and so forth does not possess as well as yourself snorter has never been in decent society in his life he thinks the barmess the most fashionable assemblage in europe and the jokes of grand day the ne plus ultra of wit snorter lives near russell square eats beef and yorkshirepudding is a judge of portwine is in all social respects your inferior well it is ten to one but in the case of snooks v jorrocks before mentioned he will be a better advocate than you he knows the law of the case entirely and better probably than you he can speak long loud to the point grammaticallymore grammatically than you no doubt will condescend to do in the case of snooks v jorrocks he is all that can be desired and so about dry disputes respecting real property he knows the law and beyond this has no more need to be a gentleman than my bodyservant haswho by the way from constant intercourse with the best society is almost a gentleman but this is apart from the question  now in the matter of auctioneering this i apprehend is not the case and i assert that a highbred gentleman with good powers of mind and speech must in such a profession make a fortune i do not mean in all auctioneering matters i do not mean that such a person should be called upon to sell the goodwill of a publichouse or discourse about the value of the beerbarrels or bars with pewter fittings or the beauty of a trade doing a stroke of so many hogsheads a week i do not ask a gentleman to go down and sell pigs ploughs and carthorses at stoke pogis or to enlarge at the auctionrooms wapping upon the beauty of the lively sally schooner these articles of commerce or use can be better appreciated by persons in a different rank of life to his  but there are a thousand cases in which a gentleman only can do justice to the sale of objects which the necessity or convenience of the genteel world may require to change hands all articles properly called of taste should be put under his charge pictureshe is a travelled man has seen and judged the best galleries of europe and can speak of them as a common person cannot for mark you you must have the confidence of your society you must be able to be familiar with them to plant a happy mot in a graceful manner to appeal to my lord or the duchess in such a modest easy pleasant way as that her grace should not be hurt by your allusion to hernay amused like the rest of the company by the manner in which it was done  what is more disgusting than the familiarity of a snob what more loathsome than the swaggering quackery of some present holders of the hammer there was a late sale for instance which made some noise in the world i mean the late lord gimcracks at dilberry hill ah what an opportunity was lost there i declare solemnly that i believe but for the absurd quackery and braggadocio of the advertisements much more money would have been bid people were kept away by the vulgar trumpeting of the auctioneer and could not help thinking the things were worthless that were so outrageously lauded  they say that sort of bartholomewfair advocacy in which people are invited to an entertainment by the medium of a hoarse yelling beefeater twentyfour drums and a jackpudding turning head over heels is absolutely necessary to excite the public attention what an error i say that the refined individual so accosted is more likely to close his ears and shuddering run away from the booth poor horace waddlepoodle to think that thy gentle accumulation of bricabrac should have passed away in such a manner by means of a man who brings down a butterfly with a blunderbuss and talks of a pins head through a speakingtrumpet why the auctioneers very voice was enough to crack the sevres porcelain and blow the lace into annihilation let it be remembered that i speak of the gentleman in his public character merely meaning to insinuate nothing more than i would by stating that lord brougham speaks with a northern accent or that the voice of mr shell is sometimes unpleasantly shrill  now the character i have formed to myself of a great auctioneer is this i fancy him a man of firstrate and irreproachable birth and fashion i fancy his person so agreeable that it must be a pleasure for ladies to behold and tailors to dress it as a private man he must move in the very best society which will flock round his pulpit when he mounts it in his public calling it will be a privilege for vulgar people to attend the hall where he lectures and they will consider it an honor to be allowed to pay their money for articles the value of which is stamped by his high recommendation nor can such a person be a mere fribble nor can any loose hangeron of fashion imagine he may assume the character the gentleman auctioneer must be an artist above all adoring his profession and adoring it what must he not know he must have a good knowledge of the history and language of all nations not the knowledge of the mere critical scholar but of the lively and elegant man of the world he will not commit the gross blunders of pronunciation that untravelled englishmen perpetrate he will not degrade his subject by coarse eulogy or sicken his audience with vulgar banter he will know where to apply praise and wit properly he will have the tact only acquired in good society and know where a joke is in place and how far a compliment may go he will not outrageously and indiscriminately laud all objects committed to his charge for he knows the value of praise that diamonds could we have them by the bushel would be used as coals that above all he has a character of sincerity to support that he is not merely the advocate of the person who employs him but that the public is his client too who honors him and confides in him ask him to sell a copy of raffaelle for an original a trumpery modern brussels counterfeit for real old mechlin some common french forged crockery for the old delightful delicate dresden china and he will quit you with scorn or order his servant to show you the door of his study  study by the wayno study is a vulgar word every word is vulgar which a man uses to give the world an exaggerated notion of himself or his condition when the wretched bagman brought up to give evidence before judge coltman was asked what his trade was and replied that he represented the house of dobson and hobson he showed himself to be a vulgar meansouled wretch and was most properly reprimanded by his lordship to be a bagman is to be humble but not of necessity vulgar pomposity is vulgar to ape a higher rank than your own is vulgar for an ensign of militia to call himself captain is vulgar or for a bagman to style himself the representative of dobson and hobson the honest auctioneer then will not call his room his study but his private room or his office or whatever may be the phrase commonly used among auctioneers  he will not for the same reason call himself as once in a momentary feeling of pride and enthusiasm for the profession i thought he shouldhe will not call himself an advocate but an auctioneer there is no need to attempt to awe people by big titles let each man bear his own name without shame and a very gentlemanlike and agreeable though exceptional position for it is clear that there cannot be more than two of the class may the auctioneer occupy  he must not sacrifice his honesty then either for his own sake or his clients in any way nor tell fibs about himself or them he is by no means called upon to draw the long bow in their behalf all that his office obliges him to doand let us hope his disposition will lead him to do it alsois to take a favorable kindly philanthropic view of the world to say what can fairly be said by a goodnatured and ingenious man in praise of any article for which he is desirous to awaken public sympathy and how readily and pleasantly may this be done i will take upon myself for instance to write an eulogium upon soandsos last novel which shall be every word of it true and which work though to some discontented spirits it might appear dull may be shown to be really amusing and instructivenay is amusing and instructiveto those who have the art of discovering where those precious qualities lie  an auctioneer should have the organ of truth large of imagination and comparison considerable of wit great of benevolence excessively large  and how happy might such a man be and cause others to be he should go through the world laughing merry observant kindhearted he should love everything in the world because his profession regards everything with books of lighter literature for i do not recommend the genteel auctioneer to meddle with heavy antiquarian and philological works he should be elegantly conversant being able to give a neat history of the author a pretty sparkling kind criticism of the work and an appropriate eulogium upon the binding which would make those people read who never read before or buy at least which is his first consideration of pictures we have already spoken of china of jewelry of goldheaded canes valuable arms picturesque antiquities with what eloquent entrainement might he not speak he feels every one of these things in his heart he has all the tastes of the fashionable world dr meyrick cannot be more enthusiastic about an old suit of armor than he sir harris nicolas not more eloquent regarding the gallant times in which it was worn and the brave histories connected with it he takes up a pearl necklace with as much delight as any beauty who was sighing to wear it round her own snowy throat and hugs a china monster with as much joy as the oldest duchess could do nor must he affect these things he must feel them he is a glass in which all the tastes of fashion are reflected he must be every one of the characters to whom he addresses himselfa genteel goethe or shakspeare a fashionable worldspirit  how can a man be all this and not be a gentleman and not have had an education in the midst of the best companyan insight into the most delicate feelings and wants and usages the pulpit oratory of such a man would be invaluable people would flock to listen to him from far and near he might out of a single teacup cause streams of worldphilosophy to flow which would be drunk in by grateful thousands and draw out of an old pincushion points of wit morals and experience that would make a nation wise  look round examine the annals of auctions as mr robins remarks and with every respect for him and his brethren say is there in the profession such a man do we want such a man is such a man likely or not likely to make an immense fortune can we get such a man except out of the very best society and among the most favored there  everybody answers no i knew you would answer no and now gentlemen who have laughed at my pretension to discover a profession say have i not i have laid my finger upon the spot where the social deficit exists i have shown that we labor under a want and when the world wants do we not know that a man will step forth to fill the vacant space that fate has left for him pass we now to the     second profession   this profession too is a great lofty and exceptional one and discovered by me considering these things and deeply musing upon the necessities of society nor let honorable gentlemen imagine that i am enabled to offer them in this profession more than any other a promise of what is called future glory deathless fame and so forth all that i say is that i can put young men in the way of making a comfortable livelihood and leaving behind them not a name but what is better a decent maintenance to their children fitzboodle is as good a name as any in england general fitzboodle who in marlboroughs time and in conjunction with the famous van slaap beat the french in the famous action of vischzouchee near mardyk in holland on the 14th of february 1709 is promised an immortality upon his tomb in westminster abbey but he died of apoplexy deucedly in debt two years afterwards and what after that is the use of a name  no no the age of chivalry is past take the twentyfour first men who come into the club and ask who they are and how they made their money theres woolseysackville his father was lord chancellor and sat on the woolsack whence he took his title his grandfather dealt in coalsacks and not in woolsackssmall coalsacks dribbling out little supplies of black diamonds to the poor yonder comes frank leveson in a huge broadbrimmed hat his shirtcuffs turned up to his elbows leveson is as gentlemanly a fellow as the world contains and if he has a fault is perhaps too finikin well you fancy him related to the sutherland family nor indeed does honest frank deny it but entre nous my good sir his father was an attorney and his grandfather a bailiff in chancery lane bearing a name still older than that of leveson namely levy so it is that this confounded equality grows and grows and has laid the good old nobility by the heels look at that venerable sir charles kitely of kitely park he is interested about the ashantees and is just come from exeter hall kitely discounted bills in the city in the year 1787 and gained his baronetcy by a loan to the french princes all these points of history are perfectly well known and do you fancy the world cares psha profession is no disgrace to a man be what you like provided you succeed if mr fauntleroy could come to life with a million of money you and i would dine with him you know we would for why should we be better than our neighbors  put then out of your head the idea that this or that profession is unworthy of you take any that may bring you profit and thank him that puts you in the way of being rich  the profession i would urge upon a person duly qualified to undertake it has i confess at the first glance something ridiculous about it and will not appear to young ladies so romantic as the calling of a gallant soldier blazing with glory gold lace and vermilion coats or a dear delightful clergyman with a sweet blue eye and a pockethandkerchief scented charmingly with lavenderwater the profession i allude to will i own be to young women disagreeable to sober men trivial to great stupid moralists unworthy  but mark my words for it that in the religious world i have once or twice by mistake no doubt had the honor of dining in serious houses and can vouch for the fact that the dinners there are of excellent qualityin the serious world in the great mercantile world among the legal community notorious feeders in every house in town except some halfdozen which can afford to do without such aid the man i propose might speedily render himself indispensable  does the reader now begin to take have i hinted enough for him that he may see with eagle glance the immense beauty of the profession i am about to unfold to him we have all seen gunter and chevet fregoso on the puerta del sol a relation of the exminister calomarde is a good purveyor enough for the benighted ollaeaters of madrid nor have i any fault to find with guimard a frenchman who has lately set up in the toledo at naples where he furnishes people with decent food it has given me pleasure too in walking about londonin the strand in oxford street and elsewhere to see fournisseurs and comestiblemerchants newly set up messrs morel have excellent articles in their warehouses fortnum and mason are known to most of my readers  but what is not known what is wanted what is languished for in england is a dinnermastera gentleman who is not a provider of meat or wine like the parties before named who can have no earthly interest in the price of truffled turkeys or dry champagne beyond that legitimate interest which he may feel for his client and which leads him to see that the latter is not cheated by his tradesmen for the dinnergiver is almost naturally an ignorant man how in mercys name can mr serjeant snorter who is all day at westminster or in chambers know possibly the mysteries the delicacy of dinnergiving how can alderman pogson know anything beyond the fact that venison is good with currant jelly and that he likes lots of green fat with his turtle snorter knows law pogson is acquainted with the state of the tallowmarket but what should he know of eating like you and me who have given up our time to it i say me only familiarly for i have only reached so far in the science as to know that i know nothing but men there are gifted individuals who have spent years of deep thoughtnot merely intervals of labor but hours of study every dayover the gormandizing sciencewho like alchemists have let their fortunes go guinea by guinea into the alldevouring potwho ruined as they sometimes are never get a guinea by chance but they will have a plate of pease in may with it or a little feast of ortolans or a piece of gloster salmon or one more flask from their favorite claretbin  it is not the ruined gastronomist that i would advise a person to select as his tablemaster for the opportunities of peculation would be too great in a position of such confidencesuch complete abandonment of one man to another a ruined man would be making bargains with the tradesmen they would offer to cash bills for him or send him opportune presents of wine which he could convert into money or bribe him in one way or another let this be done and the profession of tablemaster is ruined snorter and pogson may almost as well order their own dinners as be at the mercy of a gastronomic agent whose faith is not beyond all question  a vulgar mind in reply to these remarks regarding the gastronomic ignorance of snorter and pogson might say true these gentlemen know nothing of household economy being occupied with other more important business elsewhere but what are their wives about lady pogson in harley street has nothing earthly to do but to mind her poodle and her mantuamakers and housekeepers bills mrs snorter in belford place when she has taken her drive in the park with the young ladies may surely have time to attend to her husbands guests and preside over the preparations of his kitchen as she does worthily at his hospitable mahogany to this i answer that a man who expects a woman to understand the philosophy of dinnergiving shows the strongest evidence of a low mind he is unjust towards that lovely and delicate creature woman to suppose that she heartily understands and cares for what she eats and drinks no taken as a rule women have no real appetites they are children in the gormandizing way loving sugar sops tarts trifles apricotcreams and such gewgaws they would take a sip of malmsey and would drink currantwine just as happily if that accursed liquor were presented to them by the butler did you ever know a woman who could lay her fair hand upon her gentle heart and say on her conscience that she preferred dry sillery to sparkling champagne such a phenomenon does not exist they are not made for eating and drinking or if they make a pretence to it become downright odious nor can they i am sure witness the preparations of a really great repast without a certain jealousy they grudge spending money ask guards coachmen innwaiters whether this be not the case they will give their all heaven bless them to serve a son a grandson or a dear relative but they have not the heart to pay for small things magnificently they are jealous of good dinners and no wonder i have shown in a former discourse how they are jealous of smoking and other personal enjoyments of the male i say then that lady pogson or mrs snorter can never conduct their husbands table properly fancy either of them consenting to allow a calf to be stewed down into gravy for one dish or a dozen hares to be sacrificed to a single puree of game or the best madeira to be used for a sauce or half a dozen of champagne to boil a ham in they will be for bringing a bottle of marsala in place of the old particular or for having the ham cooked in water but of these mattersof kitchen philosophyi have no practical or theoretic knowledge and must beg pardon if only understanding the goodness of a dish when cooked i may have unconsciously made some blunder regarding the preparation  let it then be set down as an axiom without further trouble of demonstration that a woman is a bad dinnercaterer either too great and simple for it or too meani dont know which it is and gentlemen according as they admire or contemn the sex may settle that matter their own way in brief the mental constitution of lovely woman is such that she cannot give a great dinner it must be done by a man it cant be done by an ordinary man because he does not understand it vain fool and he sends off to the pastrycook in great russell street or baker street he lays on a couple of extra waiters greengrocers in the neighborhood he makes a great pother with his butler in the cellar and fancies he has done the business  bon dieu who has not been at those dinnersthose monstrous exhibitions of the pastrycooks art who does not know those made dishes with the universal sauce to each fricandeaux sweetbreads damp dumpy cutlets c seasoned with the compound of grease onions bad portwine cayenne pepper currypowder warrens blacking for what i know but the taste is always the samethere they lie in the old corner dishes the poor wiry moselle and sparkling burgundy in the icecoolers and the old story of white and brown soup turbot little smelts boiled turkey saddleofmutton and so forth try a little of that fricandeau says mrs snorter with a kind smile youll find it i think very nice be sure it has come in a green tray from great russell street mr fitzboodle you have been in germany cries snorter knowingly taste the hock and tell me what you think of that  how should he know better poor benighted creature or she dear good soul that she is if they would have a legofmutton and an applepudding and a glass of sherry and port or simple brandyandwater called by its own name after dinner all would be very well but they must shine they must dine as their neighbors there is no difference in the style of dinners in london people with five hundred a year treat you exactly as those of five thousand they will have their moselle or hock their fatal sidedishes brought in the green trays from the pastrycooks  well there is no harm done not as regards the dinnergivers at least though the dinnereaters may have to suffer somewhat it only shows that the former are hospitably inclined and wish to do the very best in their powergood honest fellows if they do wrong how can they help it they know no better  and now is it not as clear as the sun at noonday that a want exists in london for a superintendent of the tablea gastronomic agenta dinnermaster as i have called him before a man of such a profession would be a metropolitan benefit hundreds of thousands of people of the respectable sort people in white waistcoats would thank him daily calculate how many dinners are given in the city of london and calculate the numbers of benedictions that the agency might win  and as no doubt the observant man of the world has remarked that the freeborn englishman of the respectable class is of all others the most slavish and truckling to a lord that there is no flyblown peer but he is pleased to have him at his table proud beyond measure to call him by his surname without the lordly prefix and that those lords whom he does not know he yet the freeborn englishman takes care to have their pedigrees and ages by heart from his worldbible the peerage as this is an indisputable fact and as it is in this particular class of britons that our agent must look to find clients i need not say it is necessary that the agent should be as highborn as possible and that he should be able to tack if possible an honorable or some other handle to his respectable name he must have it on his professional card             the honorable george gormand gobbleton                 apician chambers pall mall        or               sir augustus carver cramley cramley           amphitryonic council office swallow street  or in some such neat way gothic letters on a large handsome crockeryware card with possibly a gilt coatofarms and supporters or the bloodred hand of baronetcy duly displayed depend on it plenty of guineas will fall in it and that gobbletons supporters will support him comfortably enough  for this profession is not like that of the auctioneer which i take to be a far more noble one because more varied and more truthful but in the agency case a little humbug at least is necessary a man cannot be a successful agent by the mere force of his simple merit or genius in eating and drinking he must of necessity impose upon the vulgar to a certain degree he must be of that rank which will lead them naturally to respect him otherwise they might be led to jeer at his profession but let a noble exercise it and bless your soul all the court guide is dumb  he will then give out in a manly and somewhat pompous address what has before been mentioned namely that he has seen the fatal way in which the hospitality of england has been perverted hitherto accapared by a few cooks with green trays he must use a good deal of french in his language for that is considered very gentlemanlike by vulgar people he will take a set of chambers in canton gardens which will be richly though severely furnished and the door of which will be opened by a french valet he must be a frenchman remember who will say on letting mr snorter or sir benjamin pogson in that milor is at home pogson will then be shown into a library furnished with massive bookcases containing all the works on cookery and wines the titles of them in all the known languages in the world any books of course will do as you will have them handsomely bound and keep them under plateglass on a sidetable will be little samplebottles of wine a few truffles on a white porcelain saucer a prodigious strawberry or two perhaps at the time when such fruit costs much money on the library will be busts marked ude careme bechamel in marble never mind what heads of course and perhaps on the clock should be a figure of the prince of condes cook killing himself because the fish had not arrived in time there may be a wreath of immortelles on the figure to give it a more decidedly frenchified air the walls will be of a dark rich paper hung round with neat gilt frames containing plans of menus of various great dinners those of cambaceres napoleon louis xiv louis xviii heliogabalus if you like each signed by the respective cook  after the stranger has looked about him at these things which he does not understand in the least especially the truffles which look like dirty potatoes you will make your appearance dressed in a dark dress with one handsome enormous gold chain and one large diamond ring a gold snuffbox of course which you will thrust into the visitors paw before saying a word you will be yourself a portly grave man with your hair a little bald and gray in fact in this as in all other professions you had best try to look as like canning as you can  when pogson has done sneezing with the snuff you will say to him take a fauteuil i have the honor of addressing sir benjamin pogson i believe and then you will explain to him your system  this of course must vary with every person you address but let us lay down a few of the heads of a plan which may be useful or may be modified infinitely or may be cast aside altogether just as circumstances dictate after all i am not going to turn gastronomic agent and speak only for the benefit perhaps of the very person who is reading this  synopsis of the gastronomic agency of the honorable george gobbleton  the gastronomic agent having traversed europe and dined with the best society of the world has been led naturally as a patriot to turn his thoughts homeward and cannot but deplore the lamentable ignorance regarding gastronomy displayed in a country for which nature has done almost everything  but it is ever singularly thus inherent ignorance belongs to man and the agent in his continental travels has always remarked that the countries most fertile in themselves were invariably worse tilled than those more barren the italians and the spaniards leave their fields to nature as we leave our vegetables fish and meat and heavens what richness do we fling away what dormant qualities in our dishes do we disregardwhat glorious gastronomic crops if the agent may be permitted the expressionwhat glorious gastronomic crops do we sacrifice allowing our goodly meats and fishes to lie fallow chance it is said by an ingenious historian who having been long a secretary in the east india house must certainly have had access to the best information upon eastern matterschance it is said by mr charles lamb which burnt down a chinamans house with a litter of suckingpigs that were unable to escape from the interior discovered to the world the excellence of roastpig gunpowder we know was invented by a similar fortuity the reader will observe that my style in the supposed character of a gastronomic agent is purposely pompous and loud so tis said was printingso glasswe should have drunk our wine poisoned with the villanous odor of the borachio had not some eastern merchants lighting their fires in the desert marked the strange composition which now glitters on our sideboards and holds the costly produce of our vines  we have spoken of the natural riches of a country let the reader think but for one moment of the gastronomic wealth of our country of england and he will be lost in thankful amazement as he watches the astonishing riches poured out upon us from natures bounteous cornucopia look at our fisheriesthe trout and salmon tossing in our brawling streams the white and fullbreasted turbot struggling in the mariners net the purple lobster lured by hopes of greed into his basketprison which he quits only for the red ordeal of the pot look at whitebait great heavenslook at whitebait and a thousand frisking glittering silvery things besides which the nymphs of our native streams bear kindly to the deities of our kitchensour kitchens such as they are  and though it may be said that other countries produce the frecklebacked salmon and the dark broadshouldered turbot though trout frequent many a stream besides those of england and lobsters sprawl on other sands than ours yet let it be remembered that our native country possesses these altogether while other lands only know them separately that above all whitebait is peculiarly our countrysour citys own blessings and eternal praises be on it and of course on brown bread and butter and the briton should further remember with honest pride and thankfulness the situation of his capital of london the lordly turtle floats from the sea into the stream and from the stream to the city the rapid fleets of all the world se donnent rendezvous in the docks of our silvery thames the produce of our coasts and provincial cities east and west is borne to us on the swift lines of lightning railroads in a wordand no man but one who like the agent has travelled europe over can appreciate the giftthere is no city on earths surface so well supplied with fish as london  with respect to our meats all praise is supererogatory ask the wretched hunter of chevreuil the poor devourer of rehbraten what they think of the noble english haunch that after bounding in the park of knole or windsor exposes its magnificent flank upon some broad silver platter at our tables it is enough to say of foreign venison that they are obliged to lard it away ours is the palm of roast whether of the crisp mutton that crops the thymy herbage of our downs or the noble ox who revels on lush althorpian oilcakes what game is like to ours mans excels us in poultry tis true but tis only in merry england that the partridge has a flavor that the turkey can almost se passer de truffes that the jolly juicy goose can be eaten as he deserves  our vegetables moreover surpass all comment art by the means of glass has wrung fruit out of the bosom of nature such as she grants to no other clime and if we have no vineyards on our hills we have gold to purchase their best produce nature and enterprise that masters nature have done everything for our land  but with all these prodigious riches in our power is it not painful to reflect how absurdly we employ them can we say that we are in the habit of dining well alas no and the agent roaming oer foreign lands and seeing how with small means and great ingenuity and perseverance great ends were effected comes back sadly to his own country whose wealth he sees absurdly wasted whose energies are misdirected and whose vast capabilities are allowed to lie idle    here should follow what i have only hinted at previously a vivid and terrible picture of the degradation of our table    oh for a master spirit to give an impetus to the land to see its great power directed in the right way and its wealth not squandered or hidden but nobly put out to interest and spent  the agent dares not hope to win that proud stationto be the destroyer of a barbarous system wallowing in abusive prodigalityto become a dietetic reformerthe luther of the table  but convinced of the wrongs which exist he will do his humble endeavor to set them right and to those who know that they are ignorant and this is a vast step to knowledge he offers his counsels his active cooperation his frank and kindly sympathy the agents qualifications are these 1 he is of one of the best families in england and has in himself or through his ancestors been accustomed to good living for centuries in the reign of henry v his maternal greatgreatgrandfather roger de gobylton the name may be varied of course or the kings reign or the dish invented was the first who discovered the method of roasting a peacock whole with his tailfeathers displayed and the dish was served to the two kings at rouen sir walter cramley in elizabeths reign produced before her majesty when at killingworth castle mackerel with the famous gooseberry sauce c  2 he has through life devoted himself to no other study than that of the table and has visited to that end the courts of all the monarchs of europe taking the receipts of the cooks with whom he lives on terms of intimate friendship often at enormous expense to himself  3 he has the same acquaintance with all the vintages of the continent having passed the autumn of 1811 the comet year on the great weinberg of johannisberg being employed similarly at bordeaux in 1834 at oporto in 1820 and at xeres de la frontera with his excellent friends duff gordon and co the year after he travelled to india and back in company with fourteen pipes of madeira on board of the samuel snob east indiaman captain scuttler and spent the vintage season in the island with unlimited powers of observation granted to him by the great houses there  4 he has attended mr groves of charing cross and mr giblett of bond street in a course of purchases of fish and meat and is able at a glance to recognize the age of mutton the primeness of beef the firmness and freshness of fish of all kinds  5 he has visited the parks the grousemanors and the principal gardens of england in a similar professional point of view   the agent then through his subordinates engages to provide gentlemen who are about to give dinnerparties1 with cooks to dress the dinners a list of which gentlemen he has by him and will recommend none who are not worthy of the strictest confidence  2 with a menu for the table according to the price which the amphitryon chooses to incur  3 he will through correspondence with the various fournisseurs of the metropolis provide them with viands fruit wine c sending to paris if need be where he has a regular correspondence with messrs chevet  4 he has a list of dexterous tablewaiters all answering to the name of john for fear of mistakes the butlers name to be settled according to pleasure and would strongly recommend that the servants of the house should be locked in the backkitchen or servants hall during the time the dinner takes place  5 he will receive and examine all the accounts of the fournisseursof course pledging his honor as a gentleman not to receive one shilling of paltry gratification from the tradesmen he employs but to see that the bills are more moderate and their goods of better quality than they would provide to any person of less experience than himself  6 his fee for superintending a dinner will be five guineas and the agent entreats his clients to trust entirely to him and his subordinates for the arrangement of the repastnot to think of inserting dishes of their own invention or producing wine from their own cellars as he engages to have it brought in the best order and fit for immediate drinking should the amphitryon however desire some particular dish or wine he must consult the agent in the first case by writing in the second by sending a sample to the agents chambers for it is manifest that the whole complexion of a dinner may be altered by the insertion of a single dish and therefore parties will do well to mention their wishes on the first interview with the agent he cannot be called upon to recompose his bill of fare except at great risk to the ensemble of the dinner and enormous inconvenience to himself  7 the agent will be at home for consultation from ten oclock until two earlier if gentlemen who are engaged at early hours in the city desire to have an interview and be it remembered that a personal interview is always the best for it is greatly necessary to know not only the number but the character of the guests whom the amphitryon proposes to entertainwhether they are fond of any particular wine or dish what is their state of health rank style profession c  8 at two oclock he will commence his rounds for as the metropolis is wide it is clear that he must be early in the field in some districts from 2 to 3 he will be in russell square and the neighborhood 3 to 3 34 harley street portland place cavendish square and the environs 3 34 to 4 14 portman square gloucester place baker street c 4 14 to 5 the new district about hyde park terrace 5 to 5 34 st johns wood and the regents park he will be in grosvenor square by 6 and in belgrave square pimlico and its vicinity by 7 parties there are requested not to dine until 8 oclock and the agent once for all peremptorily announces that he will not go to the palace where it is utterly impossible to serve a good dinner  to tradesmen  every monday evening during the season the gastronomic agent proposes to give a series of trialdinners to which the principal gormands of the metropolis and a few of the agents most respectable clients will be invited covers will be laid for ten at nine oclock precisely and as the agent does not propose to exact a single shilling of profit from their bills and as his recommendation will be of infinite value to them the tradesmen he employs will furnish the weekly dinner gratis cooks will attend who have acknowledged characters upon the same terms to save trouble a book will be kept where butchers poulterers fishmongers c may inscribe their names in order taking it by turns to supply the trialtable winemerchants will naturally compete every week promiscuously sending what they consider their best samples and leaving with the hallporter tickets of the prices confectionery to be done out of the house fruiterers marketmen as butchers and poulterers the agents maitredhotel will give a receipt to each individual for the articles he produces and let all remember that the agent is a very keen judge and woe betide those who serve him or his clients ill  george gormand gobbleton  carlton gardens june 10 1842   here i have sketched out the heads of such an address as i conceive a gastronomic agent might put forth and appeal pretty confidently to the british public regarding its merits and my own discovery if this be not a professiona new onea feasible onea lucrative onei dont know what is say that a man attends but fifteen dinners daily that is seventyfive guineas or five hundred and fifty pounds weekly or fourteen thousand three hundred pounds for a season of six months and how many of our younger sons have such a capital even let then some unemployed gentleman with the requisite qualifications come forward it will not be necessary that he should have done all that is stated in the prospectus but at any rate let him say he has there cant be much harm in an innocent fib of that sort for the gastronomic agent must be a sort of dinnerpope whose opinions cannot be supposed to err  and as he really will be an excellent judge of eating and drinking and will bring his whole mind to bear upon the question and will speedily acquire an experience which no person out of the profession can possibly have and as moreover he will be an honorable man not practising upon his client in any way or demanding sixpence beyond his just fee the world will gain vastly by the coming forward of such a persongain in good dinners and absolutely save money for what is five guineas for a dinner of sixteen the sum may be gaspille by a cookwench or by one of those abominable beforenamed pastrycooks with their green trays  if any man take up the business he will invite me of course to the monday dinners or does ingratitude go so far as that a man should forget the author of his good fortune i believe it does turn we away from the sickening theme   and now having concluded my professions how shall i express my obligations to the discriminating press of this country for the unanimous applause which hailed my first appearance it is the more wonderful as i pledge my sacred word i never wrote a document before much longer than a laundresss bill or the acceptance of an invitation to dinner but enough of this egotism thanks for praise conferred sound like vanity gratitude is hard to speak of and at present it swells the full heart of  george savage fitzboodle
