80843902	the shadowline  a confession  by joseph conrad    worthy of my undying regard    to borys and all others who like himself have crossed in early youth the shadowline of their generation with love      part one   dautre fois calme plat grand miroir de mon desespoir baudelaire   i  only the young have such moments i dont mean the very young no the very young have properly speaking no moments it is the privilege of early youth to live in advance of its days in all the beautiful continuity of hope which knows no pauses and no introspection  one closes behind one the little gate of mere boyishnessand enters an enchanted garden its very shades glow with promise every turn of the path has its seduction and it isnt because it is an undiscovered country one knows well enough that all mankind had streamed that way it is the charm of universal experience from which one expects an uncommon or personal sensationa bit of ones own  one goes on recognizing the landmarks of the predecessors excited amused taking the hard luck and the good luck togetherthe kicks and the halfpence as the saying isthe picturesque common lot that holds so many possibilities for the deserving or perhaps for the lucky yes one goes on and the time too goes ontill one perceives ahead a shadowline warning one that the region of early youth too must be left behind  this is the period of life in which such moments of which i have spoken are likely to come what moments why the moments of boredom of weariness of dissatisfaction rash moments i mean moments when the still young are inclined to commit rash actions such as getting married suddenly or else throwing up a job for no reason  this is not a marriage story it wasnt so bad as that with me my action rash as it was had more the character of divorcealmost of desertion for no reason on which a sensible person could put a finger i threw up my jobchucked my berthleft the ship of which the worst that could be said was that she was a steamship and therefore perhaps not entitled to that blind loyalty which    however its no use trying to put a gloss on what even at the time i myself half suspected to be a caprice  it was in an eastern port she was an eastern ship inasmuch as then she belonged to that port she traded among dark islands on a blue reefscarred sea with the red ensign over the taffrail and at her masthead a houseflag also red but with a green border and with a white crescent in it for an arab owned her and a syed at that hence the green border on the flag he was the head of a great house of straits arabs but as loyal a subject of the complex british empire as you could find east of the suez canal world politics did not trouble him at all but he had a great occult power amongst his own people  it was all one to us who owned the ship he had to employ white men in the shipping part of his business and many of those he so employed had never set eyes on him from the first to the last day i myself saw him but once quite accidentally on a wharfan old dark little man blind in one eye in a snowy robe and yellow slippers he was having his hand severely kissed by a crowd of malay pilgrims to whom he had done some favour in the way of food and money his almsgiving i have heard was most extensive covering almost the whole archipelago for isnt it said that the charitable man is the friend of allah  excellent and picturesque arab owner about whom one needed not to trouble ones head a most excellent scottish shipfor she was that from the keep upexcellent seaboat easy to keep clean most handy in every way and if it had not been for her internal propulsion worthy of any mans love i cherish to this day a profound respect for her memory as to the kind of trade she was engaged in and the character of my shipmates i could not have been happier if i had had the life and the men made to my order by a benevolent enchanter  and suddenly i left all this i left it in that to us inconsequential manner in which a bird flies away from a comfortable branch it was as though all unknowing i had heard a whisper or seen something wellperhaps one day i was perfectly right and the next everything was goneglamour flavour interest contentmenteverything it was one of these moments you know the green sickness of late youth descended on me and carried me off carried me off that ship i mean  we were only four white men on board with a large crew of kalashes and two malay petty officers the captain stared hard as if wondering what ailed me but he was a sailor and he too had been young at one time presently a smile came to lurk under his thick irongray moustache and he observed that of course if i felt i must go he couldnt keep me by main force and it was arranged that i should be paid off the next morning as i was going out of his cabin he added suddenly in a peculiar wistful tone that he hoped i would find what i was so anxious to go and look for a soft cryptic utterance which seemed to reach deeper than any diamondhard tool could have done i do believe he understood my case  but the second engineer attacked me differently he was a sturdy young scot with a smooth face and light eyes his honest red countenance emerged out of the engineroom companion and then the whole robust man with shirt sleeves turned up wiping slowly the massive forearms with a lump of cottonwaste and his light eyes expressed bitter distaste as though our friendship had turned to ashes he said weightily oh aye ive been thinking it was about time for you to run away home and get married to some silly girl  it was tacitly understood in the port that john nieven was a fierce misogynist and the absurd character of the sally convinced me that he meant to be nastyvery nastyhad meant to say the most crushing thing he could think of my laugh sounded deprecatory nobody but a friend could be so angry as that i became a little crestfallen our chief engineer also took a characteristic view of my action but in a kindlier spirit  he was young too but very thin and with a mist of fluffy brown beard all round his haggard face all day long at sea or in harbour he could be seen walking hastily up and down the afterdeck wearing an intense spiritually rapt expression which was caused by a perpetual consciousness of unpleasant physical sensations in his internal economy for he was a confirmed dyspeptic his view of my case was very simple he said it was nothing but deranged liver of course he suggested i should stay for another trip and meantime dose myself with a certain patent medicine in which his own belief was absolute ill tell you what ill do ill buy you two bottles out of my own pocket there i cant say fairer than that can i  i believe he would have perpetrated the atrocity or generosity at the merest sign of weakening on my part by that time however i was more discontented disgusted and dogged than ever the past eighteen months so full of new and varied experience appeared a dreary prosaic waste of days i felthow shall i express itthat there was no truth to be got out of them  what truth i should have been hard put to it to explain probably if pressed i would have burst into tears simply i was young enough for that  next day the captain and i transacted our business in the harbour office it was a lofty big cool white room where the screened light of day glowed serenely everybody in itthe officials the publicwere in white only the heavy polished desks gleamed darkly in a central avenue and some papers lying on them were blue enormous punkahs sent from on high a gentle draught through that immaculate interior and upon our perspiring heads  the official behind the desk we approached grinned amiably and kept it up till in answer to his perfunctory question sign off and on again my captain answered no signing off for good and then his grin vanished in sudden solemnity he did not look at me again till he handed me my papers with a sorrowful expression as if they had been my passports for hades  while i was putting them away he murmured some question to the captain and i heard the latter answer goodhumouredly  no he leaves us to go home  oh the other exclaimed nodding mournfully over my sad condition  i didnt know him outside the official building but he leaned forward the desk to shake hands with me compassionately as one would with some poor devil going out to be hanged and i am afraid i performed my part ungraciously in the hardened manner of an impenitent criminal  no homewardbound mailboat was due for three or four days being now a man without a ship and having for a time broken my connection with the seabecome in fact a mere potential passengerit would have been more appropriate perhaps if i had gone to stay at an hotel there it was too within a stones throw of the harbour office low but somehow palatial displaying its white pillared pavilions surrounded by trim grass plots i would have felt a passenger indeed in there i gave it a hostile glance and directed my steps toward the officers sailors home  i walked in the sunshine disregarding it and in the shade of the big trees on the esplanade without enjoying it the heat of the tropical east descended through the leafy boughs enveloping my thinlyclad body clinging to my rebellious discontent as if to rob it of its freedom  the officers home was a large bungalow with a wide verandah and a curiously suburbanlooking little garden of bushes and a few trees between it and the street that institution partook somewhat of the character of a residential club but with a slightly governmental flavour about it because it was administered by the harbour office its manager was officially styled chief steward he was an unhappy wizened little man who if put into a jockeys rig would have looked the part to perfection but it was obvious that at some time or other in his life in some capacity or other he had been connected with the sea possibly in the comprehensive capacity of a failure  i should have thought his employment a very easy one but he used to affirm for some reason or other that his job would be the death of him some day it was rather mysterious perhaps everything naturally was too much trouble for him he certainly seemed to hate having people in the house  on entering it i thought he must be feeling pleased it was as still as a tomb i could see no one in the living rooms and the verandah too was empty except for a man at the far end dozing prone in a long chair at the noise of my footsteps he opened one horribly fishlike eye he was a stranger to me i retreated from there and crossing the dining rooma very bare apartment with a motionless punkah hanging over the centre tablei knocked at a door labelled in black letters chief steward  the answer to my knock being a vexed and doleful plaint oh dear oh dear what is it now i went in at once  it was a strange room to find in the tropics twilight and stuffiness reigned in there the fellow had hung enormously ample dusty cheap lace curtains over his windows which were shut piles of cardboard boxes such as milliners and dressmakers use in europe cumbered the corners and by some means he had procured for himself the sort of furniture that might have come out of a respectable parlour in the east end of londona horsehair sofa armchairs of the same i glimpsed grimy antimacassars scattered over that horrid upholstery which was aweinspiring insomuch that one could not guess what mysterious accident need or fancy had collected it there its owner had taken off his tunic and in white trousers and a thin shortsleeved singlet prowled behind the chairbacks nursing his meagre elbows  an exclamation of dismay escaped him when he heard that i had come for a stay but he could not deny that there were plenty of vacant rooms  very well can you give me the one i had before  he emitted a faint moan from behind a pile of cardboard boxes on the table which might have contained gloves or handkerchiefs or neckties i wonder what the fellow did keep in them there was a smell of decaying coral or oriental dust of zoological speciments in that den of his i could only see the top of his head and his unhappy eyes levelled at me over the barrier  its only for a couple of days i said intending to cheer him up  perhaps you would like to pay in advance he suggested eagerly  certainly not i burst out directly i could speak never heard of such a thing this is the most infernal cheek     he had seized his head in both handsa gesture of despair which checked my indignation  oh dear oh dear dont fly out like this i am asking everybody  i dont believe it i said bluntly  well i am going to and if you gentlemen all agreed to pay in advance i could make hamilton pay up too hes always turning up ashore dead broke and even when he has some money he wont settle his bills i dont know what to do with him he swears at me and tells me i cant chuck a white man out into the street here so if you only would     i was amazed incredulous too i suspected the fellow of gratuitous impertinence i told him with marked emphasis that i would see him and hamilton hanged first and requested him to conduct me to my room with no more of his nonsense he produced then a key from somewhere and led the way out of his lair giving me a vicious sidelong look in passing  any one i know staying here i asked him before he left my room  he had recovered his usual pained impatient tone and said that captain giles was there back from a solo sea trip two other guests were staying also he paused and of course hamilton he added  oh yes hamilton i said and the miserable creature took himself off with a final groan  his impudence still rankled when i came into the dining room at tiffin time he was there on duty overlooking the chinamen servants the tiffin was laid on one end only of the long table and the punkah was stirring the hot air lazilymostly above a barren waste of polished wood  we were four around the cloth the dozing stranger from the chair was one both his eyes were partly opened now but they did not seem to see anything he was supine the dignified person next him with short side whiskers and a carefully scraped chin was of course hamilton i have never seen any one so full of dignity for the station in life providence had been pleased to place him in i had been told that he regarded me as a rank outsider he raised not only his eyes but his eyebrows as well at the sound i made pulling back my chair  captain giles was at the head of the table i exchanged a few words of greeting with him and sat down on his left stout and pale with a great shiny dome of a bald forehead and prominent brown eyes he might have been anything but a seaman you would not have been surprised to learn that he was an architect to me i know how absurd it is to me he looked like a churchwarden he had the appearance of a man from whom you would expect sound advice moral sentiments with perhaps a platitude or two thrown in on occasion not from a desire to dazzle but from honest conviction  though very well known and appreciated in the shipping world he had no regular employment he did not want it he had his own peculiar position he was an expert an expert inhow shall i say itin intricate navigation he was supposed to know more about remote and imperfectly charted parts of the archipelago than any man living his brain must have been a perfect warehouse of reefs positions bearings images of headlands shapes of obscure coasts aspects of innumerable islands desert and otherwise any ship for instance bound on a trip to palawan or somewhere that way would have captain giles on board either in temporary command or to assist the master it was said that he had a retaining fee from a wealthy firm of chinese steamship owners in view of such services besides he was always ready to relieve any man who wished to take a spell ashore for a time no owner was ever known to object to an arrangement of that sort for it seemed to be the established opinion at the port that captain giles was as good as the best if not a little better but in hamiltons view he was an outsider i believe that for hamilton the generalisation outsider covered the whole lot of us though i suppose that he made some distinctions in his mind  i didnt try to make conversation with captain giles whom i had not seen more than twice in my life but of course he knew who i was after a while inclining his big shiny head my way he addressed me first in his friendly fashion he presumed from seeing me there he said that i had come ashore for a couple of days leave  he was a lowvoiced man i spoke a little louder saying that noi had left the ship for good  a free man for a bit was his comment  i suppose i may call myself thatsince eleven oclock i said  hamilton had stopped eating at the sound of our voices he laid down his knife and fork gently got up and muttering something about this infernal heat cutting ones appetite went out of the room almost immediately we heard him leave the house down the verandah steps  on this captain giles remarked easily that the fellow had no doubt gone off to look after my old job the chief steward who had been leaning against the wall brought his face of an unhappy goat nearer to the table and addressed us dolefully his object was to unburden himself of his eternal grievance against hamilton the man kept him in hot water with the harbour office as to the state of his accounts he wished to goodness he would get my job though in truth what would it be temporary relief at best  i said you neednt worry he wont get my job my successor is on board already  he was surprised and i believe his face fell a little at the news captain giles gave a soft laugh we got up and went out on the verandah leaving the supine stranger to be dealt with by the chinamen the last thing i saw they had put a plate with a slice of pineapple on it before him and stood back to watch what would happen but the experiment seemed a failure he sat insensible  it was imparted to me in a low voice by captain giles that this was an officer of some rajahs yacht which had come into our port to be drydocked must have been seeing life last night he added wrinkling his nose in an intimate confidential way which pleased me vastly for captain giles had prestige he was credited with wonderful adventures and with some mysterious tragedy in his life and no man had a word to say against him he continued  i remember him first coming ashore here some years ago seems only the other day he was a nice boy oh these nice boys  i could not help laughing aloud he looked startled then joined in the laugh no no i didnt mean that he cried what i meant is that some of them do go soft mighty quick out here  jocularly i suggested the beastly heat as the first cause but captain giles disclosed himself possessed of a deeper philosophy things out east were made easy for white men that was all right the difficulty was to go on keeping white and some of these nice boys did not know how he gave me a searching look and in a benevolent heavyuncle manner asked point blank  why did you throw up your berth  i became angry all of a sudden for you can understand how exasperating such a question was to a man who didnt know i said to myself that i ought to shut up that moralist and to him aloud i said with challenging politeness  why     do you disapprove  he was too disconcerted to do more than mutter confusedly i    in a general way   and then gave me up but he retired in good order under the cover of a heavily humorous remark that he too was getting soft and that this was his time for taking his little siestawhen he was on shore very bad habit very bad habit  there was a simplicity in the man which would have disarmed a touchiness even more youthful than mine so when next day at tiffin he bent his head toward me and said that he had met my late captain last evening adding in an undertone hes very sorry you left he had never had a mate that suited him so well i answered him earnestly without any affectation that i certainly hadnt been so comfortable in any ship or with any commander in all my seagoing days  wellthen he murmured  havent you heard captain giles that i intend to go home  yes he said benevolently i have heard that sort of thing so often before  what of that i cried i thought he was the most dull unimaginative man i had ever met i dont know what more i would have said but the muchbelated hamilton came in just then and took his usual seat so i dropped into a mumble  anyhow you shall see it done this time  hamilton beautifully shaved gave captain giles a curt nod but didnt even condescend to raise his eyebrows at me and when he spoke it was only to tell the chief steward that the food on his plate wasnt fit to be set before a gentleman the individual addressed seemed much too unhappy to groan he cast his eyes up to the punkah and that was all  captain giles and i got up from the table and the stranger next to hamilton followed our example manoeuvring himself to his feet with difficulty he poor fellow not because he was hungry but i verily believe only to recover his selfrespect had tried to put some of that unworthy food into his mouth but after dropping his fork twice and generally making a failure of it he had sat still with an air of intense mortification combined with a ghastly glazed stare both giles and i had avoided looking his way at table  on the verandah he stopped short on purpose to address to us anxiously a long remark which i failed to understand completely it sounded like some horrible unknown language but when captain giles after only an instant for reflection assured him with homely friendliness aye to be sure you are right there he appeared very much gratified indeed and went away pretty straight too to seek a distant long chair  what was he trying to say i asked with disgust  i dont know mustnt be down too much on a fellow hes feeling pretty wretched you may be sure and tomorrow hell feel worse yet  judging by the mans appearance it seemed impossible i wondered what sort of complicated debauch had reduced him to that unspeakable condition captain giles benevolence was spoiled by a curious air of complacency which i disliked i said with a little laugh  well he will have you to look after him he made a deprecatory gesture sat down and took up a paper i did the same the papers were old and uninteresting filled up mostly with dreary stereotyped descriptions of queen victorias first jubilee celebrations probably we should have quickly fallen into a tropical afternoon doze if it had not been for hamiltons voice raised in the dining room he was finishing his tiffin there the big double doors stood wide open permanently and he could not have had any idea how near to the doorway our chairs were placed he was heard in a loud supercilious tone answering some statement ventured by the chief steward  i am not going to be rushed into anything they will be glad enough to get a gentleman i imagine there is no hurry  a loud whispering from the steward succeeded and then again hamilton was heard with even intenser scorn  what that young ass who fancies himself for having been chief mate with kent so long    preposterous  giles and i looked at each other kent being the name of my late commander captain giles whisper hes talking of you seemed to me sheer waste of breath the chief steward must have stuck to his point whatever it was because hamilton was heard again more supercilious if possible and also very emphatic  rubbish my good man one doesnt compete with a rank outsider like that theres plenty of time  then there were pushing of chairs footsteps in the next room and plaintive expostulations from the steward who was pursuing hamilton even out of doors through the main entrance  thats a very insulting sort of man remarked captain gilessuperfluously i thought very insulting you havent offended him in some way have you  never spoke to him in my life i said grumpily cant imagine what he means by competing he has been trying for my job after i leftand didnt get it but that isnt exactly competition  captain giles balanced his big benevolent head thoughtfully he didnt get it he repeated very slowly no not likely either with kent kent is no end sorry you left him he gives you the name of a good seaman too  i flung away the paper i was still holding i sat up i slapped the table with my open palm i wanted to know why he would keep harping on that my absolutely private affair it was exasperating really  captain giles silenced me by the perfect equanimity of his gaze nothing to be annoyed about he murmured reasonably with an evident desire to soothe the childish irritation he had aroused and he was really a man of an appearance so inoffensive that i tried to explain myself as much as i could i told him that i did not want to hear any more about what was past and gone it had been very nice while it lasted but now it was done with i preferred not to talk about it or even think about it i had made up my mind to go home  he listened to the whole tirade in a particular lendingtheear attitude as if trying to detect a false note in it somewhere then straightened himself up and appeared to ponder sagaciously over the matter  yes you told me you meant to go home anything in view there  instead of telling him that it was none of his business i said sullenly  nothing that i know of  i had indeed considered that rather blank side of the situation i had created for myself by leaving suddenly my very satisfactory employment and i was not very pleased with it i had it on the tip of my tongue to say that common sense had nothing to do with my action and that therefore it didnt deserve the interest captain giles seemed to be taking in it but he was puffing at a short wooden pipe now and looked so guileless dense and commonplace that it seemed hardly worth while to puzzle him either with truth or sarcasm  he blew a cloud of smoke then surprised me by a very abrupt paid your passage money yet  overcome by the shameless pertinacity of a man to whom it was rather difficult to be rude i replied with exaggerated meekness that i had not done so yet i thought there would be plenty of time to do that tomorrow  and i was about to turn away withdrawing my privacy from his fatuous objectless attempts to test what sort of stuff it was made of when he laid down his pipe in an extremely significant manner you know as if a critical moment had come and leaned sideways over the table between us  oh you havent yet he dropped his voice mysteriously well then i think you ought to know that theres something going on here  i had never in my life felt more detached from all earthly goings on freed from the sea for a time i preserved the sailors consciousness of complete independence from all land affairs how could they concern me i gazed at captain giles animation with scorn rather than with curiosity  to his obviously preparatory question whether our steward had spoken to me that day i said he hadnt and whats more he would have had precious little encouragement if he had tried to i didnt want the fellow to speak to me at all  unrebuked by my petulance captain giles with an air of immense sagacity began to tell me a minute tale about a harbour office peon it was absolutely pointless a peon was seen walking that morning on the verandah with a letter in his hand it was in an official envelope as the habit of these fellows is he had shown it to the first white man he came across that man was our friend in the armchair he as i knew was not in a state to interest himself in any sublunary matters he could only wave the peon away the peon then wandered on along the verandah and came upon captain giles who was there by an extraordinary chance     at this point he stopped with a profound look the letter he continued was addressed to the chief steward now what could captain ellis the master attendant want to write to the steward for the fellow went every morning anyhow to the harbour office with his report for orders or what not he hadnt been back more than an hour before there was an office peon chasing him with a note now what was that for  and he began to speculate it was not for thisand it could not be for that as to that other thing it was unthinkable  the fatuousness of all this made me stare if the man had not been somehow a sympathetic personality i would have resented it like an insult as it was i felt only sorry for him something remarkably earnest in his gaze prevented me from laughing in his face neither did i yawn at him i just stared  his tone became a shade more mysterious directly the fellow meaning the steward got that note he rushed for his hat and bolted out of the house but it wasnt because the note called him to the harbour office he didnt go there he was not absent long enough for that he came darting back in no time flung his hat away and raced about the dining room moaning and slapping his forehead all these exciting facts and manifestations had been observed by captain giles he had it seems been meditating upon them ever since  i began to pity him profoundly and in a tone which i tried to make as little sarcastic as possible i said that i was glad he had found something to occupy his morning hours  with his disarming simplicity he made me observe as if it were a matter of some consequence how strange it was that he should have spent the morning indoors at all he generally was out before tiffin visiting various offices seeing his friends in the harbour and so on he had felt out of sorts somewhat on rising nothing much just enough to make him feel lazy  all this with a sustained holding stare which in conjunction with the general inanity of the discourse conveyed the impression of mild dreary lunacy and when he hitched his chair a little and dropped his voice to the low note of mystery it flashed upon me that high professional reputation was not necessarily a guarantee of sound mind  it never occurred to me then that i didnt know in what soundness of mind exactly consisted and what a delicate and upon the whole unimportant matter it was with some idea of not hurting his feelings i blinked at him in an interested manner but when he proceeded to ask me mysteriously whether i remembered what had passed just now between that steward of ours and that man hamilton i only grunted sourly assent and turned away my head  aye but do you remember every word he insisted tactfully  i dont know its none of my business i snapped out consigning moreover the steward and hamilton aloud to eternal perdition  i meant to be very energetic and final but captain giles continued to gaze at me thoughtfully nothing could stop him he went on to point out that my personality was involved in that conversation when i tried to preserve the semblance of unconcern he became positively cruel i heard what the man had said yes what did i think of it thenhe wanted to know  captain giles appearance excluding the suspicion of mere sly malice i came to the conclusion that he was simply the most tactless idiot on earth i almost despised myself for the weakness of attempting to enlighten his common understanding i started to explain that i did not think anything whatever hamilton was not worth a thought what such an offensive loafer    aye that he is interjected captain giles    thought or said was below any decent mans contempt and i did not propose to take the slightest notice of it  this attitude seemed to me so simple and obvious that i was really astonished at giles giving no sign of assent such perfect stupidity was almost interesting  what would you like me to do i asked laughing i cant start a row with him because of the opinion he has formed of me of course ive heard of the contemptuous way he alludes to me but he doesnt intrude his contempt on my notice he has never expressed it in my hearing for even just now he didnt know we could hear him i should only make myself ridiculous  that hopeless giles went on puffing at his pipe moodily all at once his face cleared and he spoke  you missed my point  have i i am very glad to hear it i said  with increasing animation he stated again that i had missed his point entirely and in a tone of growing selfconscious complacency he told me that few things escaped his attention and he was rather used to think them out and generally from his experience of life and men arrived at the right conclusion  this bit of selfpraise of course fitted excellently the laborious inanity of the whole conversation the whole thing strengthened in me that obscure feeling of life being but a waste of days which halfunconsciously had driven me out of a comfortable berth away from men i liked to flee from the menace of emptiness    and to find inanity at the first turn here was a man of recognized character and achievement disclosed as an absurd and dreary chatterer and it was probably like this everywherefrom east to west from the bottom to the top of the social scale  a great discouragement fell on me a spiritual drowsiness giles voice was going on complacently the very voice of the universal hollow conceit and i was no longer angry with it there was nothing original nothing new startling informing to expect from the world no opportunities to find out something about oneself no wisdom to acquire no fun to enjoy everything was stupid and overrated even as captain giles was so be it  the name of hamilton suddenly caught my ear and roused me up  i thought we had done with him i said with the greatest possible distaste  yes but considering what we happened to hear just now i think you ought to do it  ought to do it i sat up bewildered do what  captain giles confronted me very much surprised  why do what i have been advising you to try you go and ask the steward what was there in that letter from the harbour office ask him straight out  i remained speechless for a time here was something unexpected and original enough to be altogether incomprehensible i murmured astounded  but i thought it was hamilton that you     exactly dont you let him you do what i tell you you tackle that steward youll make him jump i bet insisted captain giles waving his smouldering pipe impressively at me then he took three rapid puffs at it  his aspect of triumphant acuteness was indescribable yet the man remained a strangely sympathetic creature benevolence radiated from him ridiculously mildly impressively it was irritating too but i pointed out coldly as one who deals with the incomprehensible that i didnt see any reason to expose myself to a snub from the fellow he was a very unsatisfactory steward and a miserable wretch besides but i would just as soon think of tweaking his nose  tweaking his nose said captain giles in a scandalized tone much use it would be to you  that remark was so irrelevant that one could make no answer to it but the sense of the absurdity was beginning at last to exercise its wellknown fascination i felt i must not let the man talk to me any more i got up observing curtly that he was too much for methat i couldnt make him out  before i had time to move away he spoke again in a changed tone of obstinacy and puffing nervously at his pipe  wellhes ano account cussanyhow you justask him thats all  that new manner impressed meor rather made me pause but sanity asserting its sway at once i left the verandah after giving him a mirthless smile in a few strides i found myself in the dining room now cleared and empty but during that short time various thoughts occurred to me such as that giles had been making fun of me expecting some amusement at my expense that i probably looked silly and gullible that i knew very little of life     the door facing me across the dining room flew open to my extreme surprise it was the door inscribed with the word steward and the man himself ran out of his stuffy philistinish lair in his absurd huntedanimal manner making for the garden door  to this day i dont know what made me call after him i say wait a minute perhaps it was the sidelong glance he gave me or possibly i was yet under the influence of captain giles mysterious earnestness well it was an impulse of some sort an effect of that force somewhere within our lives which shapes them this way or that for if these words had not escaped from my lips my will had nothing to do with that my existence would to be sure have been still a seamans existence but directed on now to me utterly inconceivable lines  no my will had nothing to do with it indeed no sooner had i made that fateful noise than i became extremely sorry for it had the man stopped and faced me i would have had to retire in disorder for i had no notion to carry out captain giles idiotic joke either at my own expense or at the expense of the steward  but here the old human instinct of the chase came into play he pretended to be deaf and i without thinking a second about it dashed along my own side of the dining table and cut him off at the very door  why cant you answer when you are spoken to i asked roughly  he leaned against the lintel of the door he looked extremely wretched human nature is i fear not very nice right through there are ugly spots in it i found myself growing angry and that i believe only because my quarry looked so woebegone miserable beggar  i went for him without more ado i understand there was an official communication to the home from the harbour office this morning is that so  instead of telling me to mind my own business as he might have done he began to whine with an undertone of impudence he couldnt see me anywhere this morning he couldnt be expected to run all over the town after me  who wants you to i cried and then my eyes became opened to the inwardness of things and speeches the triviality of which had been so baffling and tiresome  i told him i wanted to know what was in that letter my sternness of tone and behaviour was only half assumed curiosity can be a very fierce sentimentat times  he took refuge in a silly muttering sulkiness it was nothing to me he mumbled i had told him i was going home and since i was going home he didnt see why he should     that was the line of his argument and it was irrelevant enough to be almost insulting insulting to ones intelligence i mean  in that twilight region between youth and maturity in which i had my being then one is peculiarly sensitive to that kind of insult i am afraid my behaviour to the steward became very rough indeed but it wasnt in him to face out anything or anybody drug habit or solitary tippling perhaps and when i forgot myself so far as to swear at him he broke down and began to shriek  i dont mean to say that he made a great outcry it was a cynical shrieking confession only faintpiteously faint it wasnt very coherent either but sufficiently so to strike me dumb at first i turned my eyes from him in righteous indignation and perceived captain giles in the verandah doorway surveying quietly the scene his own handiwork if i may express it in that way his smouldering black pipe was very noticeable in his big paternal fist so too was the glitter of his heavy gold watchchain across the breast of his white tunic he exhaled an atmosphere of virtuous sagacity serene enough for any innocent soul to fly to confidently i flew to him  you would never believe it i cried it was a notification that a master is wanted for some ship theres a command apparently going about and this fellow puts the thing in his pocket  the steward screamed out in accents of loud despair you will be the death of me  the mighty slap he gave his wretched forehead was very loud too but when i turned to look at him he was no longer there he had rushed away somewhere out of sight this sudden disappearance made me laugh  this was the end of the incidentfor me captain giles however staring at the place where the steward had been began to haul at his gorgeous gold chain till at last the watch came up from the deep pocket like solid truth from a well solemnly he lowered it down again and only then said  just three oclock you will be in timeif you dont lose any that is  in time for what i asked  good lord for the harbour office this must be looked into  strictly speaking he was right but ive never had much taste for investigation for showing people up and all that no doubt ethically meritorious kind of work and my view of the episode was purely ethical if any one had to be the death of the steward i didnt see why it shouldnt be captain giles himself a man of age and standing and a permanent resident whereas i in comparison felt myself a mere bird of passage in that port in fact it might have been said that i had already broken off my connection i muttered that i didnt thinkit was nothing to me     nothing repeated captain giles giving some signs of quiet deliberate indignation kent warned me you were a peculiar young fellow you will tell me next that a command is nothing to youand after all the trouble ive taken too  the trouble i murmured uncomprehending what trouble all i could remember was being mystified and bored by his conversation for a solid hour after tiffin and he called that taking a lot of trouble  he was looking at me with a selfcomplacency which would have been odious in any other man all at once as if a page of a book had been turned over disclosing a word which made plain all that had gone before i perceived that this matter had also another than an ethical aspect  and still i did not move captain giles lost his patience a little with an angry puff at his pipe he turned his back on my hesitation  but it was not hesitation on my part i had been if i may express myself so put out of gear mentally but as soon as i had convinced myself that this stale unprofitable world of my discontent contained such a thing as a command to be seized i recovered my powers of locomotion  its a good step from the officers home to the harbour office but with the magic word command in my head i found myself suddenly on the quay as if transported there in the twinkling of an eye before a portal of dressed white stone above a flight of shallow white steps  all this seemed to glide toward me swiftly the whole great roadstead to the right was just a mere flicker of blue and the dim cool hall swallowed me up out of the heat and glare of which i had not been aware till the very moment i passed in from it  the broad inner staircase insinuated itself under my feet somehow command is a strong magic the first human beings i perceived distinctly since i had parted with the indignant back of captain giles were the crew of the harbour steamlaunch lounging on the spacious landing about the curtained archway of the shipping office  it was there that my buoyancy abandoned me the atmosphere of officialdom would kill anything that breathes the air of human endeavour would extinguish hope and fear alike in the supremacy of paper and ink i passed heavily under the curtain which the malay coxswain of the harbour launch raised for me there was nobody in the office except the clerks writing in two industrious rows but the head shippingmaster hopped down from his elevation and hurried along on the thick mats to meet me in the broad central passage  he had a scottish name but his complexion was of a rich olive hue his short beard was jet black and his eyes also black had a languishing expression he asked confidentially  you want to see him  all lightness of spirit and body having departed from me at the touch of officialdom i looked at the scribe without animation and asked in my turn wearily  what do you think is it any use  my goodness he has asked for you twice today  this emphatic he was the supreme authority the marine superintendent the harbourmastera very great person in the eyes of every single quilldriver in the room but that was nothing to the opinion he had of his own greatness  captain ellis looked upon himself as a sort of divine pagan emanation the deputyneptune for the circumambient seas if he did not actually rule the waves he pretended to rule the fate of the mortals whose lives were cast upon the waters  this uplifting illusion made him inquisitorial and peremptory and as his temperament was choleric there were fellows who were actually afraid of him he was redoubtable not in virtue of his office but because of his unwarrantable assumptions i had never had anything to do with him before  i said oh he has asked for me twice then perhaps i had better go in  you must you must  the shippingmaster led the way with a mincing gait around the whole system of desks to a tall and importantlooking door which he opened with a deferential action of the arm  he stepped right in but without letting go of the handle and after gazing reverently down the room for a while beckoned me in by a silent jerk of the head then he slipped out at once and shut the door after me most delicately  three lofty windows gave on the harbour there was nothing in them but the darkblue sparkling sea and the paler luminous blue of the sky my eye caught in the depths and distances of these blue tones the white speck of some big ship just arrived and about to anchor in the outer roadstead a ship from homeafter perhaps ninety days at sea there is something touching about a ship coming in from sea and folding her white wings for a rest  the next thing i saw was the topknot of silver hair surmounting captain ellis smooth red face which would have been apoplectic if it hadnt had such a fresh appearance  our deputyneptune had no beard on his chin and there was no trident to be seen standing in a corner anywhere like an umbrella but his hand was holding a penthe official pen far mightier than the sword in making or marring the fortune of simple toiling men he was looking over his shoulder at my advance  when i had come well within range he saluted me by a nerveshattering where have you been all this time  as it was no concern of his i did not take the slightest notice of the shot i said simply that i had heard there was a master needed for some vessel and being a sailingship man i thought i would apply     he interrupted me why hang it you are the right man for that jobif there had been twenty others after it but no fear of that they are all afraid to catch hold thats whats the matter  he was very irritated i said innocently are they sir i wonder why  why he fumed afraid of the sails afraid of a white crew too much trouble too much work too long out here easy life and deckchairs more their mark here i sit with the consulgenerals cable before me and the only man fit for the job not to be found anywhere i began to think you were funking it too     i havent been long getting to the office i remarked calmly  you have a good name out here though he growled savagely without looking at me  i am very glad to hear it from you sir i said  yes but you are not on the spot when you are wanted you know you werent that steward of yours wouldnt dare to neglect a message from this office where the devil did you hide yourself for the best part of the day  i only smiled kindly down on him and he seemed to recollect himself and asked me to take a seat he explained that the master of a british ship having died in bangkok the consulgeneral had cabled to him a request for a competent man to be sent out to take command  apparently in his mind i was the man from the first though for the looks of the thing the notification addressed to the sailors home was general an agreement had already been prepared he gave it to me to read and when i handed it back to him with the remark that i accepted its terms the deputyneptune signed it stamped it with his own exalted hand folded it in four it was a sheet of blue foolscap and presented it to mea gift of extraordinary potency for as i put it in my pocket my head swam a little  this is your appointment to the command he said with a certain gravity an official appointment binding the owners to conditions which you have accepted nowwhen will you be ready to go  i said i would be ready that very day if necessary he caught me at my word with great alacrity the steamer melita was leaving for bangkok that evening about seven he would request her captain officially to give me a passage and wait for me till ten oclock  then he rose from his office chair and i got up too my head swam there was no doubt about it and i felt a certain heaviness of limbs as if they had grown bigger since i had sat down on that chair i made my bow  a subtle change in captain ellis manner became perceptible as though he had laid aside the trident of deputyneptune in reality it was only his official pen that he had dropped on getting up     ii  he shook hands with me well there you are on your own appointed officially under my responsibility  he was actually walking with me to the door what a distance off it seemed i moved like a man in bonds but we reached it at last i opened it with the sensation of dealing with mere dreamstuff and then at the last moment the fellowship of seamen asserted itself stronger than the difference of age and station it asserted itself in captain ellis voice  goodbyeand good luck to you he said so heartily that i could only give him a grateful glance then i turned and went out never to see him again in my life i had not made three steps into the outer office when i heard behind my back a gruff loud authoritative voice the voice of our deputyneptune  it was addressing the head shippingmaster who having let me in had apparently remained hovering in the middle distance ever since mr r let the harbour launch have steam up to take the captain here on board the melita at halfpast nine tonight  i was amazed at the startled alacrity of rs yes sir he ran before me out on the landing my new dignity sat yet so lightly on me that i was not aware that it was i the captain the object of this last graciousness it seemed as if all of a sudden a pair of wings had grown on my shoulders i merely skimmed along the polished floor  but r was impressed  i say he exclaimed on the landing while the malay crew of the steamlaunch standing by looked stonily at the man for whom they were going to be kept on duty so late away from their gambling from their girls or their pure domestic joys i say his own launch what have you done to him  his stare was full of respectful curiosity i was quite confounded  was it for me i hadnt the slightest notion i stammered out  he nodded many times yes and the last person who had it before you was a duke so there  i think he expected me to faint on the spot but i was in too much of a hurry for emotional displays my feelings were already in such a whirl that this staggering information did not seem to make the slightest difference it merely fell into the seething cauldron of my brain and i carried it off with me after a short but effusive passage of leavetaking with r  the favour of the great throws an aureole round the fortunate object of its selection that excellent man enquired whether he could do anything for me he had known me only by sight and he was well aware he would never see me again i was in common with the other seamen of the port merely a subject for official writing filling up of forms with all the artificial superiority of a man of pen and ink to the men who grapple with realities outside the consecrated walls of official buildings what ghosts we must have been to him mere symbols to juggle with in books and heavy registers without brains and muscles and perplexities something hardly useful and decidedly inferior  and hethe office hours being overwanted to know if he could be of any use to me  i oughtproperly speakingi ought to have been moved to tears but i did not even think of it it was merely another miraculous manifestation of that day of miracles i parted from him as if he were a mere symbol i floated down the staircase i floated out of the official and imposing portal i went on floating along  i use that word rather than the word flew because i have a distinct impression that though uplifted by my aroused youth my movements were deliberate enough to that mixed white brown and yellow portion of mankind out abroad on their own affairs i presented the appearance of a man walking rather sedately and nothing in the way of abstraction could have equalled my deep detachment from the forms and colours of this world it was as it were final  and yet suddenly i recognized hamilton i recognized him without effort without a shock without a start there he was strolling toward the harbour office with his stiff arrogant dignity his red face made him noticeable at a distance it flamed over there on the shady side of the street  he had perceived me too something unconscious exuberance of spirits perhaps moved me to wave my hand to him elaborately this lapse from good taste happened before i was aware that i was capable of it  the impact of my impudence stopped him short much as a bullet might have done i verily believe he staggered though as far as i could see he didnt actually fall i had gone past in a moment and did not turn my head i had forgotten his existence  the next ten minutes might have been ten seconds or ten centuries for all my consciousness had to do with it people might have been falling dead around me houses crumbling guns firing i wouldnt have known i was thinking by jove i have got it it being the command it had come about in a way utterly unforeseen in my modest daydreams  i perceived that my imagination had been running in conventional channels and that my hopes had always been drab stuff i had envisaged a command as a result of a slow course of promotion in the employ of some highly respectable firm the reward of faithful service well faithful service was all right one would naturally give that for ones own sake for the sake of the ship for the love of the life of ones choice not for the sake of the reward  there is something distasteful in the notion of a reward  and now here i had my command absolutely in my pocket in a way undeniable indeed but most unexpected beyond my imaginings outside all reasonable expectations and even notwithstanding the existence of some sort of obscure intrigue to keep it away from me it is true that the intrigue was feeble but it helped the feeling of wonderas if i had been specially destined for that ship i did not know by some power higher than the prosaic agencies of the commercial world  a strange sense of exultation began to creep into me if i had worked for that command ten years or more there would have been nothing of the kind i was a little frightened  let us be calm i said to myself  outside the door of the officers home the wretched steward seemed to be waiting for me there was a broad flight of a few steps and he ran to and fro on the top of it as if chained there a distressed cur he looked as though his throat were too dry for him to bark  i regret to say i stopped before going in there had been a revolution in my moral nature he waited openmouthed breathless while i looked at him for half a minute  and you thought you could keep me out of it i said scathingly  you said you were going home he squeaked miserably you said so you said so  i wonder what captain ellis will have to say to that excuse i uttered slowly with a sinister meaning  his lower jaw had been trembling all the time and his voice was like the bleating of a sick goat you have given me away you have done for me  neither his distress nor yet the sheer absurdity of it was able to disarm me it was the first instance of harm being attempted to be done to meat any rate the first i had ever found out and i was still young enough still too much on this side of the shadow line not to be surprised and indignant at such things  i gazed at him inflexibly let the beggar suffer he slapped his forehead and i passed in pursued into the dining room by his screech i always said youd be the death of me  this clamour not only overtook me but went ahead as it were on to the verandah and brought out captain giles  he stood before me in the doorway in all the commonplace solidity of his wisdom the gold chain glittered on his breast he clutched a smouldering pipe  i extended my hand to him warmly and he seemed surprised but did respond heartily enough in the end with a faint smile of superior knowledge which cut my thanks short as if with a knife i dont think that more than one word came out and even for that one judging by the temperature of my face i had blushed as if for a bad action assuming a detached tone i wondered how on earth he had managed to spot the little underhand game that had been going on  he murmured complacently that there were but few things done in the town that he could not see the inside of and as to this house he had been using it off and on for nearly ten years nothing that went on in it could escape his great experience it had been no trouble to him no trouble at all  then in his quiet thick tone he wanted to know if i had complained formally of the stewards action  i said that i hadntthough indeed it was not for want of opportunity captain ellis had gone for me baldheaded in a most ridiculous fashion for being out of the way when wanted  funny old gentleman interjected captain giles what did you say to that  i said simply that i came along the very moment i heard of his message nothing more i didnt want to hurt the steward i would scorn to harm such an object no i made no complaint but i believe he thinks ive done so let him think hes got a fright he wont forget in a hurry for captain ellis would kick him out into the middle of asia     wait a moment said captain giles leaving me suddenly i sat down feeling very tired mostly in my head before i could start a train of thought he stood again before me murmuring the excuse that he had to go and put the fellows mind at ease  i looked up with surprise but in reality i was indifferent he explained that he had found the steward lying face downward on the horsehair sofa he was all right now  he would not have died of fright i said contemptuously  no but he might have taken an overdose out of one of them little bottles he keeps in his room captain giles argued seriously the confounded fool has tried to poison himself oncea few years ago  really i said without emotion he doesnt seem very fit to live anyhow  as to that it may be said of a good many  dont exaggerate like this i protested laughing irritably but i wonder what this part of the world would do if you were to leave off looking after it captain giles here you have got me a command and saved the stewards life in one afternoon though why you should have taken all that interest in either of us is more than i can understand  captain giles remained silent for a minute then gravely  hes not a bad steward really he can find a good cook at any rate and whats more he can keep him when found i remember the cooks we had here before his time     i must have made a movement of impatience because he interrupted himself with an apology for keeping me yarning there while no doubt i needed all my time to get ready  what i really needed was to be alone for a bit i seized this opening hastily my bedroom was a quiet refuge in an apparently uninhabited wing of the building having absolutely nothing to do for i had not unpacked my things i sat down on the bed and abandoned myself to the influences of the hour to the unexpected influences     and first i wondered at my state of mind why was i not more surprised why here i was invested with a command in the twinkling of an eye not in the common course of human affairs but more as if by enchantment i ought to have been lost in astonishment but i wasnt i was very much like people in fairy tales nothing ever astonishes them when a fully appointed gala coach is produced out of a pumpkin to take her to a ball cinderella does not exclaim she gets in quietly and drives away to her high fortune  captain ellis a fierce sort of fairy had produced a command out of a drawer almost as unexpectedly as in a fairy tale but a command is an abstract idea and it seemed a sort of lesser marvel till it flashed upon me that it involved the concrete existence of a ship  a ship my ship she was mine more absolutely mine for possession and care than anything in the world an object of responsibility and devotion she was there waiting for me spellbound unable to move to live to get out into the world till i came like an enchanted princess her call had come to me as if from the clouds i had never suspected her existence i didnt know how she looked i had barely heard her name and yet we were indissolubly united for a certain portion of our future to sink or swim together  a sudden passion of anxious impatience rushed through my veins gave me such a sense of the intensity of existence as i have never felt before or since i discovered how much of a seaman i was in heart in mind and as it were physicallya man exclusively of sea and ships the sea the only world that counted and the ships the test of manliness of temperament of courage and fidelityand of love  i had an exquisite moment it was unique also jumping up from my seat i paced up and down my room for a long time but when i came downstairs i behaved with sufficient composure only i couldnt eat anything at dinner  having declared my intention not to drive but to walk down to the quay i must render the wretched steward justice that he bestirred himself to find me some coolies for the luggage they departed carrying all my worldly possessions except a little money i had in my pocket slung from a long pole captain giles volunteered to walk down with me  we followed the sombre shaded alley across the esplanade it was moderately cool there under the trees captain giles remarked with a sudden laugh i know whos jolly thankful at having seen the last of you  i guessed that he meant the steward the fellow had borne himself to me in a sulkily frightened manner at the last i expressed my wonder that he should have tried to do me a bad turn for no reason at all  dont you see that what he wanted was to get rid of our friend hamilton by dodging him in front of you for that job that would have removed him for good see  heavens i exclaimed feeling humiliated somehow can it be possible what a fool he must be that overbearing impudent loafer why he couldnt    and yet hes nearly done it i believe for the harbour office was bound to send somebody  aye a fool like our steward can be dangerous sometimes declared captain giles sententiously just because he is a fool he added imparting further instruction in his complacent low tones for he continued in the manner of a set demonstration no sensible person would risk being kicked out of the only berth between himself and starvation just to get rid of a simple annoyancea small worry would he now  well no i conceded restraining a desire to laugh at that something mysteriously earnest in delivering the conclusions of his wisdom as though it were the product of prohibited operations but that fellow looks as if he were rather crazy he must be  as to that i believe everybody in the world is a little mad he announced quietly  you make no exceptions i inquired just to hear his manner  why kent says that even of you  does he i retorted extremely embittered all at once against my former captain theres nothing of that in the written character from him which ive got in my pocket has he given you any instances of my lunacy  captain giles explained in a conciliating tone that it had been only a friendly remark in reference to my abrupt leaving the ship for no apparent reason  i muttered grumpily oh leaving his ship and mended my pace he kept up by my side in the deep gloom of the avenue as if it were his conscientious duty to see me out of the colony as an undesirable character he panted a little which was rather pathetic in a way but i was not moved on the contrary his discomfort gave me a sort of malicious pleasure  presently i relented slowed down and said  what i really wanted was to get a fresh grip i felt it was time is that so very mad  he made no answer we were issuing from the avenue on the bridge over the canal a dark irresolute figure seemed to be awaiting something or somebody  it was a malay policeman barefooted in his blue uniform the silver band on his little round cap shone dimly in the light of the street lamp he peered in our direction timidly  before we could come up to him he turned about and walked in front of us in the direction of the jetty the distance was some hundred yards and then i found my coolies squatting on their heels they had kept the pole on their shoulders and all my worldly goods still tied to the pole were resting on the ground between them as far as the eye could reach along the quay there was not another soul abroad except the police peon who saluted us  it seems he had detained the coolies as suspicious characters and had forbidden them the jetty but at a sign from me he took off the embargo with alacrity the two patient fellows rising together with a faint grunt trotted off along the planks and i prepared to take my leave of captain giles who stood there with an air as though his mission were drawing to a close it could not be denied that he had done it all and while i hesitated about an appropriate sentence he made himself heard  i expect youll have your hands pretty full of tangledup business  i asked him what made him think so and he answered that it was his general experience of the world ship a long time away from her port owners inaccessible by cable and the only man who could explain matters dead and buried  and you yourself new to the business in a way he concluded in a sort of unanswerable tone  dont insist i said i know it only too well i only wish you could impart to me some small portion of your experience before i go as it cant be done in ten minutes i had better not begin to ask you theres that harbour launch waiting for me too but i wont feel really at peace till i have that ship of mine out in the indian ocean  he remarked casually that from bangkok to the indian ocean was a pretty long step and this murmur like a dim flash from a dark lantern showed me for a moment the broad belt of islands and reefs between that unknown ship which was mine and the freedom of the great waters of the globe  but i felt no apprehension i was familiar enough with the archipelago by that time extreme patience and extreme care would see me through the region of broken land of faint airs and of dead water to where i would feel at last my command swing on the great swell and list over to the great breath of regular winds that would give her the feeling of a large more intense life the road would be long all roads are long that lead toward ones hearts desire but this road my minds eye could see on a chart professionally with all its complications and difficulties yet simple enough in a way one is a seaman or one is not and i had no doubt of being one  the only part i was a stranger to was the gulf of siam and i mentioned this to captain giles not that i was concerned very much it belonged to the same region the nature of which i knew into whose very soul i seemed to have looked during the last months of that existence with which i had broken now suddenly as one parts with some enchanting company  the gulf    ay a funny piece of waterthat said captain giles  funny in this connection was a vague word the whole thing sounded like an opinion uttered by a cautious person mindful of actions for slander  i didnt inquire as to the nature of that funniness there was really no time but at the very last he volunteered a warning  whatever you do keep to the east side of it the west side is dangerous at this time of the year dont let anything tempt you over youll find nothing but trouble there  though i could hardly imagine what could tempt me to involve my ship amongst the currents and reefs of the malay shore i thanked him for the advice  he gripped my extended arm warmly and the end of our acquaintance came suddenly in the words goodnight  that was all he said goodnight nothing more i dont know what i intended to say but surprise made me swallow it whatever it was i choked slightly and then exclaimed with a sort of nervous haste oh goodnight captain giles goodnight  his movements were always deliberate but his back had receded some distance along the deserted quay before i collected myself enough to follow his example and made a half turn in the direction of the jetty  only my movements were not deliberate i hurried down to the steps and leaped into the launch before i had fairly landed in her sternsheets the slim little craft darted away from the jetty with a sudden swirl of her propeller and the hard rapid puffing of the exhaust in her vaguely gleaming brass funnel amidships  the misty churning at her stern was the only sound in the world the shore lay plunged in the silence of the deeper slumber i watched the town recede still and soundless in the hot night till the abrupt hail steamlaunch ahoy made me spin round face forward we were close to a white ghostly steamer lights shone on her decks in her portholes and the same voice shouted from her  is that our passenger  it is i yelled  her crew had been obviously on the jump i could hear them running about the modern spirit of haste was loudly vocal in the orders to heave away on the cableto lower the sideladder and in urgent requests to me to come along sir we have been delayed three hours for you    our time is seven oclock you know  i stepped on the deck i said no i dont know the spirit of modern hurry was embodied in a thin longarmed longlegged man with a closely clipped gray beard his meagre hand was hot and dry he declared feverishly  i am hanged if i would have waited another five minutes harbourmaster or no harbourmaster  thats your own business i said i didnt ask you to wait for me  i hope you dont expect any supper he burst out this isnt a boardinghouse afloat you are the first passenger i ever had in my life and i hope to goodness you will be the last  i made no answer to this hospitable communication and indeed he didnt wait for any bolting away on to his bridge to get his ship under way  the three days he had me on board he did not depart from that halfhostile attitude his ship having been delayed three hours on my account he couldnt forgive me for not being a more distinguished person he was not exactly outspoken about it but that feeling of annoyed wonder was peeping out perpetually in his talk  he was absurd  he was also a man of much experience which he liked to trot out but no greater contrast with captain giles could have been imagined he would have amused me if i had wanted to be amused but i did not want to be amused i was like a lover looking forward to a meeting human hostility was nothing to me i thought of my unknown ship it was amusement enough torment enough occupation enough  he perceived my state for his wits were sufficiently sharp for that and he poked sly fun at my preoccupation in the manner some nasty cynical old men assume toward the dreams and illusions of youth i on my side refrained from questioning him as to the appearance of my ship though i knew that being in bangkok every fortnight or so he must have known her by sight i was not going to expose the ship my ship to some slighting reference  he was the first really unsympathetic man i had ever come in contact with my education was far from being finished though i didnt know it no i didnt know it  all i knew was that he disliked me and had some contempt for my person why apparently because his ship had been delayed three hours on my account who was i to have such a thing done for me such a thing had never been done for him it was a sort of jealous indignation  my expectation mingled with fear was wrought to its highest pitch how slow had been the days of the passage and how soon they were over one morning early we crossed the bar and while the sun was rising splendidly over the flat spaces of the land we steamed up the innumerable bends passed under the shadow of the great gilt pagoda and reached the outskirts of the town  there it was spread largely on both banks the oriental capital which had as yet suffered no white conqueror an expanse of brown houses of bamboo of mats of leaves of a vegetablematter style of architecture sprung out of the brown soil on the banks of the muddy river it was amazing to think that in those miles of human habitations there was not probably half a dozen pounds of nails some of those houses of sticks and grass like the nests of an aquatic race clung to the low shores others seemed to grow out of the water others again floated in long anchored rows in the very middle of the stream here and there in the distance above the crowded mob of low brown roof ridges towered great piles of masonry kings palace temples gorgeous and dilapidated crumbling under the vertical sunlight tremendous overpowering almost palpable which seemed to enter ones breast with the breath of ones nostrils and soak into ones limbs through every pore of ones skin  the ridiculous victim of jealousy had for some reason or other to stop his engines just then the steamer drifted slowly up with the tide oblivious of my new surroundings i walked the deck in anxious deadened abstraction a commingling of romantic reverie with a very practical survey of my qualifications for the time was approaching for me to behold my command and to prove my worth in the ultimate test of my profession  suddenly i heard myself called by that imbecile he was beckoning me to come up on his bridge  i didnt care very much for that but as it seemed that he had something particular to say i went up the ladder  he laid his hand on my shoulder and gave me a slight turn pointing with his other arm at the same time  there thats your ship captain he said  i felt a thump in my breastonly one as if my heart had then ceased to beat there were ten or more ships moored along the bank and the one he meant was partly hidden away from my sight by her next astern he said well drift abreast her in a moment  what was his tone mocking threatening or only indifferent i could not tell i suspected some malice in this unexpected manifestation of interest  he left me and i leaned over the rail of the bridge looking over the side i dared not raise my eyes yet it had to be doneand indeed i could not have helped myself i believe i trembled  but directly my eyes had rested on my ship all my fear vanished it went off swiftly like a bad dream only that a dream leaves no shame behind it and that i felt a momentary shame at my unworthy suspicions  yes there she was her hull her rigging filled my eye with a great content that feeling of lifeemptiness which had made me so restless for the last few months lost its bitter plausibility its evil influence dissolved in a flow of joyous emotion  at first glance i saw that she was a highclass vessel a harmonious creature in the lines of her fine body in the proportioned tallness of her spars whatever her age and her history she had preserved the stamp of her origin she was one of those craft that in virtue of their design and complete finish will never look old amongst her companions moored to the bank and all bigger than herself she looked like a creature of high breedan arab steed in a string of carthorses  a voice behind me said in a nasty equivocal tone i hope you are satisfied with her captain i did not even turn my head it was the master of the steamer and whatever he meant whatever he thought of her i knew that like some rare women she was one of those creatures whose mere existence is enough to awaken an unselfish delight one feels that it is good to be in the world in which she has her being  that illusion of life and character which charms one in mens finest handiwork radiated from her an enormous bulk of teakwood timber swung over her hatchway lifeless matter looking heavier and bigger than anything aboard of her when they started lowering it the surge of the tackle sent a quiver through her from waterline to the trucks up the fine nerves of her rigging as though she had shuddered at the weight it seemed cruel to load her so     half an hour later putting my foot on her deck for the first time i received the feeling of deep physical satisfaction nothing could equal the fullness of that moment the ideal completeness of that emotional experience which had come to me without the preliminary toil and disenchantments of an obscure career  my rapid glance ran over her enveloped appropriated the form concreting the abstract sentiment of my command a lot of details perceptible to a seaman struck my eye vividly in that instant for the rest i saw her disengaged from the material conditions of her being the shore to which she was moored was as if it did not exist what were to me all the countries of the globe in all the parts of the world washed by navigable waters our relation to each other would be the sameand more intimate than there are words to express in the language apart from that every scene and episode would be a mere passing show the very gang of yellow coolies busy about the main hatch was less substantial than the stuff dreams are made of for who on earth would dream of chinamen     i went aft ascended the poop where under the awning gleamed the brasses of the yachtlike fittings the polished surfaces of the rails the glass of the skylights right aft two seamen busy cleaning the steering gear with the reflected ripples of light running playfully up their bent backs went on with their work unaware of me and of the almost affectionate glance i threw at them in passing toward the companionway of the cabin  the doors stood wide open the slide was pushed right back the halfturn of the staircase cut off the view of the lobby a low humming ascended from below but it stopped abruptly at the sound of my descending footsteps     iii  the first thing i saw down there was the upper part of a mans body projecting backward as it were from one of the doors at the foot of the stairs his eyes looked at me very wide and still in one hand he held a dinner plate in the other a cloth  i am your new captain i said quietly  in a moment in the twinkling of an eye he had got rid of the plate and the cloth and jumped to open the cabin door as soon as i passed into the saloon he vanished but only to reappear instantly buttoning up a jacket he had put on with the swiftness of a quickchange artist  wheres the chief mate i asked  in the hold i think sir i saw him go down the afterhatch ten minutes ago  tell him i am on board  the mahogany table under the skylight shone in the twilight like a dark pool of water the sideboard surmounted by a wide lookingglass in an ormulu frame had a marble top it bore a pair of silverplated lamps and some other piecesobviously a harbour display the saloon itself was panelled in two kinds of wood in the excellent simple taste prevailing when the ship was built  i sat down in the armchair at the head of the tablethe captains chair with a small telltale compass swung above ita mute reminder of unremitting vigilance  a succession of men had sat in that chair i became aware of that thought suddenly vividly as though each had left a little of himself between the four walls of these ornate bulkheads as if a sort of composite soul the soul of command had whispered suddenly to mine of long days at sea and of anxious moments  you too it seemed to say you too shall taste of that peace and that unrest in a searching intimacy with your own selfobscure as we were and as supreme in the face of all the winds and all the seas in an immensity that receives no impress preserves no memories and keeps no reckoning of lives  deep within the tarnished ormulu frame in the hot halflight sifted through the awning i saw my own face propped between my hands and i stared back at myself with the perfect detachment of distance rather with curiosity than with any other feeling except of some sympathy for this latest representative of what for all intents and purposes was a dynasty continuous not in blood indeed but in its experience in its training in its conception of duty and in the blessed simplicity of its traditional point of view on life  it struck me that this quietly staring man whom i was watching both as if he were myself and somebody else was not exactly a lonely figure he had his place in a line of men whom he did not know of whom he had never heard but who were fashioned by the same influences whose souls in relation to their humble lifes work had no secrets for him  suddenly i perceived that there was another man in the saloon standing a little on one side and looking intently at me the chief mate his long red moustache determined the character of his physiognomy which struck me as pugnacious in strange to say a ghastly sort of way  how long had he been there looking at me appraising me in my unguarded daydreaming state i would have been more disconcerted if having the clock set in the top of the mirrorframe right in front of me i had not noticed that its long hand had hardly moved at all  i could not have been in that cabin more than two minutes altogether say three    so he could not have been watching me more than a mere fraction of a minute luckily still i regretted the occurrence  but i showed nothing of it as i rose leisurely it had to be leisurely and greeted him with perfect friendliness  there was something reluctant and at the same time attentive in his bearing his name was burns we left the cabin and went round the ship together his face in the full light of day appeared very pale meagre even haggard somehow i had a delicacy as to looking too often at him his eyes on the contrary remained fairly glued on my face they were greenish and had an expectant expression  he answered all my questions readily enough but my ear seemed to catch a tone of unwillingness the second officer with three or four hands was busy forward the mate mentioned his name and i nodded to him in passing he was very young he struck me as rather a cub  when we returned below i sat down on one end of a deep semicircular or rather semioval settee upholstered in red plush it extended right across the whole afterend of the cabin mr burns motioned to sit down dropped into one of the swivelchairs round the table and kept his eyes on me as persistently as ever and with that strange air as if all this were makebelieve and he expected me to get up burst into a laugh slap him on the back and vanish from the cabin  there was an odd stress in the situation which began to make me uncomfortable i tried to react against this vague feeling  its only my inexperience i thought  in the face of that man several years i judged older than myself i became aware of what i had left already behind memy youth and that was indeed poor comfort youth is a fine thing a mighty poweras long as one does not think of it i felt i was becoming selfconscious almost against my will i assumed a moody gravity i said i see you have kept her in very good order mr burns  directly i had uttered these words i asked myself angrily why the deuce did i want to say that mr burns in answer had only blinked at me what on earth did he mean  i fell back on a question which had been in my thoughts for a long timethe most natural question on the lips of any seaman whatever joining a ship i voiced it confound this selfconsciousness in a degaged cheerful tone i suppose she can travelwhat  now a question like this might have been answered normally either in accents of apologetic sorrow or with a visibly suppressed pride in a i dont want to boast but you shall see sort of tone there are sailors too who would have been roughly outspoken lazy brute or openly delighted shes a flyer two ways if four manners  but mr burns found another way a way of his own which had at all events the merit of saving his breath if no other  again he did not say anything he only frowned and it was an angry frown i waited nothing more came  whats the matter    cant you tell after being nearly two years in the ship i addressed him sharply  he looked as startled for a moment as though he had discovered my presence only that very moment but this passed off almost at once he put on an air of indifference but i suppose he thought it better to say something he said that a ship needed just like a man the chance to show the best she could do and that this ship had never had a chance since he had been on board of her not that he could remember the last captain    he paused  has he been so very unlucky i asked with frank incredulity mr burns turned his eyes away from me no the late captain was not an unlucky man one couldnt say that but he had not seemed to want to make use of his luck  mr burnsman of enigmatic moodsmade this statement with an inanimate face and staring wilfully at the rudder casing the statement itself was obscurely suggestive i asked quietly  where did he die  in this saloon just where you are sitting now answered mr burns  i repressed a silly impulse to jump up but upon the whole i was relieved to hear that he had not died in the bed which was now to be mine i pointed out to the chief mate that what i really wanted to know was where he had buried his late captain  mr burns said that it was at the entrance to the gulf a roomy grave a sufficient answer but the mate overcoming visibly something within himsomething like a curious reluctance to believe in my advent as an irrevocable fact at any rate did not stop at thatthough indeed he may have wished to do so  as a compromise with his feelings i believe he addressed himself persistently to the ruddercasing so that to me he had the appearance of a man talking in solitude a little unconsciously however  his tale was that at seven bells in the forenoon watch he had all hands mustered on the quarterdeck and told them they had better go down to say goodbye to the captain  those words as if grudged to an intruding personage were enough for me to evoke vividly that strange ceremony the barefooted bareheaded seamen crowding shyly into that cabin a small mob pressed against that sideboard uncomfortable rather than moved shirts open on sunburnt chests weatherbeaten faces and all staring at the dying man with the same grave and expectant expression  was he conscious i asked  he didnt speak but he moved his eyes to look at them said the mate  after waiting a moment mr burns motioned the crew to leave the cabin but he detained the two eldest men to stay with the captain while he went on deck with his sextant to take the sun it was getting toward noon and he was anxious to obtain a good observation for latitude when he returned below to put his sextant away he found that the two men had retreated out into the lobby through the open door he had a view of the captain lying easy against the pillows he had passed away while mr burns was taking this observation as near noon as possible he had hardly changed his position  mr burns sighed glanced at me inquisitively as much as to say arent you going yet and then turned his thoughts from his new captain back to the old who being dead had no authority was not in anybodys way and was much easier to deal with  mr burns dealt with him at some length he was a peculiar manof sixtyfive aboutiron gray hardfaced obstinate and uncommunicative he used to keep the ship loafing at sea for inscrutable reasons would come on deck at night sometimes take some sail off her god only knows why or wherefore then go below shut himself up in his cabin and play on the violin for hourstill daybreak perhaps in fact he spent most of his time day or night playing the violin that was when the fit took him very loud too  it came to this that mr burns mustered his courage one day and remonstrated earnestly with the captain neither he nor the second mate could get a wink of sleep in their watches below for the noise    and how could they be expected to keep awake while on duty he pleaded the answer of that stern man was that if he and the second mate didnt like the noise they were welcome to pack up their traps and walk over the side when this alternative was offered the ship happened to be 600 miles from the nearest land  mr burns at this point looked at me with an air of curiosity i began to think that my predecessor was a remarkably peculiar old man  but i had to hear stranger things yet it came out that this stern grim windtanned rough seasalted taciturn sailor of sixtyfive was not only an artist but a lover as well in haiphong when they got there after a course of most unprofitable peregrinations during which the ship was nearly lost twice he got himself in mr burns own words mixed up with some woman mr burns had had no personal knowledge of that affair but positive evidence of it existed in the shape of a photograph taken in haiphong mr burns found it in one of the drawers in the captains room  in due course i too saw that amazing human document i even threw it overboard later there he sat with his hands reposing on his knees bald squat gray bristly recalling a wild boar somehow and by his side towered an awful mature white female with rapacious nostrils and a cheaply illomened stare in her enormous eyes she was disguised in some semioriental vulgar fancy costume she resembled a lowclass medium or one of those women who tell fortunes by cards for half a crown and yet she was striking a professional sorceress from the slums it was incomprehensible there was something awful in the thought that she was the last reflection of the world of passion for the fierce soul which seemed to look at one out of the sardonically savage face of that old seaman however i noticed that she was holding some musical instrumentguitar or mandolinein her hand perhaps that was the secret of her sortilege  for mr burns that photograph explained why the unloaded ship had kept sweltering at anchor for three weeks in a pestilential hot harbour without air they lay there and gasped the captain appearing now and then on short visits mumbled to mr burns unlikely tales about some letters he was waiting for  suddenly after vanishing for a week he came on board in the middle of the night and took the ship out to sea with the first break of dawn daylight showed him looking wild and ill the mere getting clear of the land took two days and somehow or other they bumped slightly on a reef however no leak developed and the captain growling no matter informed mr burns that he had made up his mind to take the ship to hongkong and drydock her there  at this mr burns was plunged into despair for indeed to beat up to hongkong against a fierce monsoon with a ship not sufficiently ballasted and with her supply of water not completed was an insane project  but the captain growled peremptorily stick her at it and mr burns dismayed and enraged stuck her at it and kept her at it blowing away sails straining the spars exhausting the crewnearly maddened by the absolute conviction that the attempt was impossible and was bound to end in some catastrophe  meantime the captain shut up in his cabin and wedged in a corner of his settee against the crazy bounding of the ship played the violinor at any rate made continuous noise on it  when he appeared on deck he would not speak and not always answer when spoken to it was obvious that he was ill in some mysterious manner and beginning to break up  as the days went by the sounds of the violin became less and less loud till at last only a feeble scratching would meet mr burns ear as he stood in the saloon listening outside the door of the captains stateroom  one afternoon in perfect desperation he burst into that room and made such a scene tearing his hair and shouting such horrid imprecations that he cowed the contemptuous spirit of the sick man the watertanks were low they had not gained fifty miles in a fortnight she would never reach hongkong  it was like fighting desperately toward destruction for the ship and the men this was evident without argument mr burns losing all restraint put his face close to his captains and fairly yelled you sir are going out of the world but i cant wait till you are dead before i put the helm up you must do it yourself you must do it now  the man on the couch snarled in contempt so i am going out of the worldam i  yes siryou havent many days left in it said mr burns calming down one can see it by your face  my face eh    well put up the helm and be damned to you  burns flew on deck got the ship before the wind then came down again composed but resolute  ive shaped a course for pulo condor sir he said when we make it if you are still with us youll tell me into what port you wish me to take the ship and ill do it  the old man gave him a look of savage spite and said those atrocious words in deadly slow tones  if i had my wish neither the ship nor any of you would ever reach a port and i hope you wont  mr burns was profoundly shocked i believe he was positively frightened at the time it seems however that he managed to produce such an effective laugh that it was the old mans turn to be frightened he shrank within himself and turned his back on him  and his head was not gone then mr burns assured me excitedly he meant every word of it  such was practically the late captains last speech no connected sentence passed his lips afterward that night he used the last of his strength to throw his fiddle over the side no one had actually seen him in the act but after his death mr burns couldnt find the thing anywhere the empty case was very much in evidence but the fiddle was clearly not in the ship and where else could it have gone to but overboard  threw his violin overboard i exclaimed  he did cried mr burns excitedly and its my belief he would have tried to take the ship down with him if it had been in human power he never meant her to see home again he wouldnt write to his owners he never wrote to his old wife eitherhe wasnt going to he had made up his mind to cut adrift from everything thats what it was he didnt care for business or freights or for making a passageor anything he meant to have gone wandering about the world till he lost her with all hands  mr burns looked like a man who had escaped great danger for a little he would have exclaimed if it hadnt been for me and the transparent innocence of his indignant eyes was underlined quaintly by the arrogant pair of moustaches which he proceeded to twist and as if extend horizontally  i might have smiled if i had not been busy with my own sensations which were not those of mr burns i was already the man in command my sensations could not be like those of any other man on board in that community i stood like a king in his country in a class all by myself i mean an hereditary king not a mere elected head of a state i was brought there to rule by an agency as remote from the people and as inscrutable almost to them as the grace of god  and like a member of a dynasty feeling a semimystical bond with the dead i was profoundly shocked by my immediate predecessor  that man had been in all essentials but his age just such another man as myself yet the end of his life was a complete act of treason the betrayal of a tradition which seemed to me as imperative as any guide on earth could be it appeared that even at sea a man could become the victim of evil spirits i felt on my face the breath of unknown powers that shape our destinies  not to let the silence last too long i asked mr burns if he had written to his captains wife he shook his head he had written to nobody  in a moment he became sombre he never thought of writing it took him all his time to watch incessantly the loading of the ship by a rascally chinese stevedore in this mr burns gave me the first glimpse of the real chief mates soul which dwelt uneasily in his body  he mused then hastened on with gloomy force  yes the captain died as near noon as possible i looked through his papers in the afternoon i read the service over him at sunset and then i stuck the ships head north and brought her in here ibroughtherin  he struck the table with his fist  she would hardly have come in by herself i observed but why didnt you make for singapore instead  his eyes wavered the nearest port he muttered sullenly  i had framed the question in perfect innocence but his answer the difference in distance was insignificant and his manner offered me a clue to the simple truth he took the ship to a port where he expected to be confirmed in his temporary command from lack of a qualified master to put over his head whereas singapore he surmised justly would be full of qualified men but his naive reasoning forgot to take into account the telegraph cable reposing on the bottom of the very gulf up which he had turned that ship which he imagined himself to have saved from destruction hence the bitter flavour of our interview i tasted it more and more distinctlyand it was less and less to my taste  look here mr burns i began very firmly you may as well understand that i did not run after this command it was pushed in my way ive accepted it i am here to take the ship home first of all and you may be sure that i shall see to it that every one of you on board here does his duty to that end this is all i have to sayfor the present  he was on his feet by this time but instead of taking his dismissal he remained with trembling indignant lips and looking at me hard as though really after this there was nothing for me to do in common decency but to vanish from his outraged sight like all very simple emotional states this was moving i felt sorry for himalmost sympathetic till seeing that i did not vanish he spoke in a tone of forced restraint  if i hadnt a wife and a child at home you may be sure sir i would have asked you to let me go the very minute you came on board  i answered him with a matterofcourse calmness as though some remote third person were in question  and i mr burns would not have let you go you have signed the ships articles as chief officer and till they are terminated at the final port of discharge i shall expect you to attend to your duty and give me the benefit of your experience to the best of your ability  stony incredulity lingered in his eyes but it broke down before my friendly attitude with a slight upward toss of his arms i got to know that gesture well afterward he bolted out of the cabin  we might have saved ourselves that little passage of harmless sparring before many days had elapsed it was mr burns who was pleading with me anxiously not to leave him behind while i could only return him but doubtful answers the whole thing took on a somewhat tragic complexion  and this horrible problem was only an extraneous episode a mere complication in the general problem of how to get that shipwhich was mine with her appurtenances and her men with her body and her spirit now slumbering in that pestilential riverhow to get her out to sea  mr burns while still acting captain had hastened to sign a charterparty which in an ideal world without guile would have been an excellent document directly i ran my eye over it i foresaw trouble ahead unless the people of the other part were quite exceptionally fairminded and open to argument  mr burns to whom i imparted my fears chose to take great umbrage at them he looked at me with that usual incredulous stare and said bitterly  i suppose sir you want to make out ive acted like a fool  i told him with my systematic kindliness which always seemed to augment his surprise that i did not want to make out anything i would leave that to the future  and sure enough the future brought in a lot of trouble there were days when i used to remember captain giles with nothing short of abhorrence his confounded acuteness had let me in for this job while his prophecy that i would have my hands full coming true made it appear as if done on purpose to play an evil joke on my young innocence  yes i had my hands full of complications which were most valuable as experience people have a great opinion of the advantages of experience but in this connection experience means always something disagreeable as opposed to the charm and innocence of illusions  i must say i was losing mine rapidly but on these instructive complications i must not enlarge more than to say that they could all be resumed in the one word delay  a mankind which has invented the proverb time is money will understand my vexation the word delay entered the secret chamber of my brain resounded there like a tolling bell which maddens the ear affected all my senses took on a black colouring a bitter taste a deadly meaning  i am really sorry to see you worried like this indeed i am     it was the only humane speech i used to hear at that time and it came from a doctor appropriately enough  a doctor is humane by definition but that man was so in reality his speech was not professional i was not ill but other people were and that was the reason of his visiting the ship  he was the doctor of our legation and of course of the consulate too he looked after the ships health which generally was poor and trembling as it were on the verge of a breakup yes the men ailed and thus time was not only money but life as well  i had never seen such a steady ships company as the doctor remarked to me you seem to have a most respectable lot of seamen not only were they consistently sober but they did not even want to go ashore care was taken to expose them as little as possible to the sun they were employed on light work under the awnings and the humane doctor commended me  your arrangements appear to me to be very judicious my dear captain  it is difficult to express how much that pronouncement comforted me the doctors round full face framed in a lightcoloured whisker was the perfection of a dignified amenity he was the only human being in the world who seemed to take the slightest interest in me he would generally sit in the cabin for half an hour or so at every visit  i said to him one day  i suppose the only thing now is to take care of them as you are doing till i can get the ship to sea  he inclined his head shutting his eyes under the large spectacles and murmured  the sea    undoubtedly  the first member of the crew fairly knocked over was the stewardthe first man to whom i had spoken on board he was taken ashore with choleric symptoms and died there at the end of a week then while i was still under the startling impression of this first homethrust of the climate mr burns gave up and went to bed in a raging fever without saying a word to anybody  i believe he had partly fretted himself into that illness the climate did the rest with the swiftness of an invisible monster ambushed in the air in the water in the mud of the riverbank mr burns was a predestined victim  i discovered him lying on his back glaring sullenly and radiating heat on one like a small furnace he would hardly answer my questions and only grumbled couldnt a man take an afternoon off duty with a bad headachefor once  that evening as i sat in the saloon after dinner i could hear him muttering continuously in his room ransome who was clearing the table said to me  i am afraid sir i wont be able to give the mate all the attention hes likely to need i will have to be forward in the galley a great part of my time  ransome was the cook the mate had pointed him out to me the first day standing on the deck his arms crossed on his broad chest gazing on the river  even at a distance his wellproportioned figure something thoroughly sailorlike in his poise made him noticeable on nearer view the intelligent quiet eyes a wellbred face the disciplined independence of his manner made up an attractive personality when in addition mr burns told me that he was the best seaman in the ship i expressed my surprise that in his earliest prime and of such appearance he should sign on as cook on board a ship  its his heart mr burns had said theres something wrong with it he mustnt exert himself too much or he may drop dead suddenly  and he was the only one the climate had not touchedperhaps because carrying a deadly enemy in his breast he had schooled himself into a systematic control of feelings and movements when one was in the secret this was apparent in his manner after the poor steward died and as he could not be replaced by a white man in this oriental port ransome had volunteered to do the double work  i can do it all right sir as long as i go about it quietly he had assured me  but obviously he couldnt be expected to take up sicknursing in addition moreover the doctor peremptorily ordered mr burns ashore  with a seaman on each side holding him up under the arms the mate went over the gangway more sullen than ever we built him up with pillows in the gharry and he made an effort to say brokenly  nowyouve gotwhat you wantedgot me out ofthe ship  you were never more mistaken in your life mr burns i said quietly duly smiling at him and the trap drove off to a sort of sanatorium a pavilion of bricks which the doctor had in the grounds of his residence  i visited mr burns regularly after the first few days when he didnt know anybody he received me as if i had come either to gloat over an enemy or else to curry favour with a deeply wronged person it was either one or the other just as it happened according to his fantastic sickroom moods whichever it was he managed to convey it to me even during the period when he appeared almost too weak to talk i treated him to my invariable kindliness  then one day suddenly a surge of downright panic burst through all this craziness  if i left him behind in this deadly place he would die he felt it he was certain of it but i wouldnt have the heart to leave him ashore he had a wife and child in sydney  he produced his wasted forearms from under the sheet which covered him and clasped his fleshless claws he would die he would die here     he absolutely managed to sit up but only for a moment and when he fell back i really thought that he would die there and then i called to the bengali dispenser and hastened away from the room  next day he upset me thoroughly by renewing his entreaties i returned an evasive answer and left him the picture of ghastly despair the day after i went in with reluctance and he attacked me at once in a much stronger voice and with an abundance of argument which was quite startling he presented his case with a sort of crazy vigour and asked me finally how would i like to have a mans death on my conscience he wanted me to promise that i would not sail without him  i said that i really must consult the doctor first he cried out at that the doctor never that would be a death sentence  the effort had exhausted him he closed his eyes but went on rambling in a low voice i had hated him from the start the late captain had hated him too had wished him dead had wished all hands dead     what do you want to stand in with that wicked corpse for sir hell have you too he ended blinking his glazed eyes vacantly  mr burns i cried very much discomposed what on earth are you talking about  he seemed to come to himself though he was too weak to start  i dont know he said languidly but dont ask that doctor sir you and i are sailors dont ask him sir some day perhaps you will have a wife and child yourself  and again he pleaded for the promise that i would not leave him behind i had the firmness of mind not to give it to him afterward this sternness seemed criminal for my mind was made up that prostrated man with hardly strength enough to breathe and ravaged by a passion of fear was irresistible and besides he had happened to hit on the right words he and i were sailors that was a claim for i had no other family as to the wife and child some day argument it had no force it sounded merely bizarre  i could imagine no claim that would be stronger and more absorbing than the claim of that ship of these men snared in the river by silly commercial complications as if in some poisonous trap  however i had nearly fought my way out out to sea the seawhich was pure safe and friendly three days more  that thought sustained and carried me on my way back to the ship in the saloon the doctors voice greeted me and his large form followed his voice issuing out of the starboard spare cabin where the ships medicine chest was kept securely lashed in the bedplace  finding that i was not on board he had gone in there he said to inspect the supply of drugs bandages and so on everything was completed and in order  i thanked him i had just been thinking of asking him to do that very thing as in a couple of days as he knew we were going to sea where all our troubles of every sort would be over at last  he listened gravely and made no answer but when i opened to him my mind as to mr burns he sat down by my side and laying his hand on my knee amicably begged me to think what it was i was exposing myself to  the man was just strong enough to bear being moved and no more but he couldnt stand a return of the fever i had before me a passage of sixty days perhaps beginning with intricate navigation and ending probably with a lot of bad weather could i run the risk of having to go through it singlehanded with no chief officer and with a second quite a youth     he might have added that it was my first command too he did probably think of that fact for he checked himself it was very present to my mind  he advised me earnestly to cable to singapore for a chief officer even if i had to delay my sailing for a week  never i said the very thought gave me the shivers the hands seemed fairly fit all of them and this was the time to get them away once at sea i was not afraid of facing anything the sea was now the only remedy for all my troubles  the doctors glasses were directed at me like two lamps searching the genuineness of my resolution he opened his lips as if to argue further but shut them again without saying anything i had a vision so vivid of poor burns in his exhaustion helplessness and anguish that it moved me more than the reality i had come away from only an hour before it was purged from the drawbacks of his personality and i could not resist it  look here i said unless you tell me officially that the man must not be moved ill make arrangements to have him brought on board tomorrow and shall take the ship out of the river next morning even if i have to anchor outside the bar for a couple of days to get her ready for sea  oh ill make all the arrangements myself said the doctor at once i spoke as i did only as a friendas a wellwisher and that sort of thing  he rose in his dignified simplicity and gave me a warm handshake rather solemnly i thought but he was as good as his word when mr burns appeared at the gangway carried on a stretcher the doctor himself walked by its side the programme had been altered in so far that this transportation had been left to the last moment on the very morning of our departure  it was barely an hour after sunrise the doctor waved his big arm to me from the shore and walked back at once to his trap which had followed him empty to the riverside mr burns carried across the quarterdeck had the appearance of being absolutely lifeless ransome went down to settle him in his cabin i had to remain on deck to look after the ship for the tug had got hold of our towrope already  the splash of our shorefasts falling in the water produced a complete change of feeling in me it was like the imperfect relief of awakening from a nightmare but when the ships head swung down the river away from that town oriental and squalid i missed the expected elation of that strivenfor moment what there was undoubtedly was a relaxation of tension which translated itself into a sense of weariness after an inglorious fight  about midday we anchored a mile outside the bar the afternoon was busy for all hands watching the work from the poop where i remained all the time i detected in it some of the languor of the six weeks spent in the steaming heat of the river the first breeze would blow that away now the calm was complete i judged that the second officera callow youth with an unpromising facewas not to put it mildly of that invaluable stuff from which a commanders right hand is made but i was glad to catch along the main deck a few smiles on those seamens faces at which i had hardly had time to have a good look as yet having thrown off the mortal coil of shore affairs i felt myself familiar with them and yet a little strange like a longlost wanderer among his kin  ransome flitted continually to and fro between the galley and the cabin it was a pleasure to look at him the man positively had grace he alone of all the crew had not had a days illness in port but with the knowledge of that uneasy heart within his breast i could detect the restraint he put on the natural sailorlike agility of his movements it was as though he had something very fragile or very explosive to carry about his person and was all the time aware of it  i had occasion to address him once or twice he answered me in his pleasant quiet voice and with a faint slightly wistful smile mr burns appeared to be resting he seemed fairly comfortable  after sunset i came out on deck again to meet only a still void the thin featureless crust of the coast could not be distinguished the darkness had risen around the ship like a mysterious emanation from the dumb and lonely waters i leaned on the rail and turned my ear to the shadows of the night not a sound my command might have been a planet flying vertiginously on its appointed path in a space of infinite silence i clung to the rail as if my sense of balance were leaving me for good how absurd i failed nervously  on deck there  the immediate answer yes sir broke the spell the anchorwatch man ran up the poop ladder smartly i told him to report at once the slightest sign of a breeze coming  going below i looked in on mr burns in fact i could not avoid seeing him for his door stood open the man was so wasted that in this white cabin under a white sheet and with his diminished head sunk in the white pillow his red moustaches captured their eyes exclusively like something artificiala pair of moustaches from a shop exhibited there in the harsh light of the bulkheadlamp without a shade  while i stared with a sort of wonder he asserted himself by opening his eyes and even moving them in my direction a minute stir  dead calm mr burns i said resignedly  in an unexpectedly distinct voice mr burns began a rambling speech its tone was very strange not as if affected by his illness but as if of a different nature it sounded unearthly as to the matter i seemed to make out that it was the fault of the old manthe late captainambushed down there under the sea with some evil intention it was a weird story  i listened to the end then stepping into the cabin i laid my hand on the mates forehead it was cool he was lightheaded only from extreme weakness suddenly he seemed to become aware of me and in his own voiceof course very feeblehe asked regretfully  is there no chance at all to get under way sir  whats the good of letting go our hold of the ground only to drift mr burns i answered  he sighed and i left him to his immobility his hold on life was as slender as his hold on sanity i was oppressed by my lonely responsibilities i went into my cabin to seek relief in a few hours sleep but almost before i closed my eyes the man on deck came down reporting a light breeze enough to get under way with he said  and it was no more than just enough i ordered the windlass manned the sails loosed and the topsails set but by the time i had cast the ship i could hardly feel any breath of wind nevertheless i trimmed the yards and put everything on her i was not going to give up the attempt      part two   iv  with her anchor at the bow and clothed in canvas to her very trucks my command seemed to stand as motionless as a model ship set on the gleams and shadows of polished marble it was impossible to distinguish land from water in the enigmatical tranquillity of the immense forces of the world a sudden impatience possessed me  wont she answer the helm at all i said irritably to the man whose strong brown hands grasping the spokes of the wheel stood out lighted on the darkness like a symbol of mankinds claim to the direction of its own fate  he answered me  yes sir shes comingto slowly  let her head come up to south  aye aye sir  i paced the poop there was not a sound but that of my footsteps till the man spoke again  she is at south now sir  i felt a slight tightness of the chest before i gave out the first course of my first command to the silent night heavy with dew and sparkling with stars there was a finality in the act committing me to the endless vigilance of my lonely task  steady her head at that i said at last the course is south  south sir echoed the man  i sent below the second mate and his watch and remained in charge walking the deck through the chill somnolent hours that precede the dawn  slight puffs came and went and whenever they were strong enough to wake up the black water the murmur alongside ran through my very heart in a delicate crescendo of delight and died away swiftly i was bitterly tired the very stars seemed weary of waiting for daybreak it came at last with a motherofpearl sheen at the zenith such as i had never seen before in the tropics unglowing almost gray with a strange reminder of high latitudes  the voice of the lookout man hailed from forward  land on the port bow sir  all right  leaning on the rail i never even raised my eyes  the motion of the ship was imperceptible presently ransome brought me the cup of morning coffee after i had drunk it i looked ahead and in the still streak of very bright pale orange light i saw the land profiled flatly as if cut out of black paper and seeming to float on the water as light as cork but the rising sun turned it into mere dark vapour a doubtful massive shadow trembling in the hot glare  the watch finished washing decks i went below and stopped at mr burns door he could not bear to have it shut but hesitated to speak to him till he moved his eyes i gave him the news  sighted cape liant at daylight about fifteen miles  he moved his lips then but i heard no sound till i put my ear down and caught the peevish comment this is crawling    no luck  better luck than standing still anyhow i pointed out resignedly and left him to whatever thoughts or fancies haunted his awful immobility  later that morning when relieved by my second officer i threw myself on my couch and for some three hours or so i really found oblivion it was so perfect that on waking up i wondered where i was then came the immense relief of the thought on board my ship at sea at sea  through the portholes i beheld an unruffled sunsmitten horizon the horizon of a windless day but its spaciousness alone was enough to give me a sense of a fortunate escape a momentary exultation of freedom  i stepped out into the saloon with my heart lighter than it had been for days ransome was at the sideboard preparing to lay the table for the first sea dinner of the passage he turned his head and something in his eyes checked my modest elation  instinctively i asked what is it now not expecting in the least the answer i got it was given with that sort of contained serenity which was characteristic of the man  i am afraid we havent left all sickness behind us sir  we havent whats the matter  he told me then that two of our men had been taken bad with fever in the night one of them was burning and the other was shivering but he thought that it was pretty much the same thing i thought so too i felt shocked by the news one burning the other shivering you say no we havent left the sickness behind do they look very ill  middling bad sir ransomes eyes gazed steadily into mine we exchanged smiles ransomes a little wistful as usual mine no doubt grim enough to correspond with my secret exasperation  i asked  was there any wind at all this morning  can hardly say that sir weve moved all the time though the land ahead seems a little nearer  that was it a little nearer whereas if we had only had a little more wind only a very little more we might we should have been abreast of liant by this time and increasing our distance from that contaminated shore and it was not only the distance it seemed to me that a stronger breeze would have blown away the contamination which clung to the ship it obviously did cling to the ship two men one burning one shivering i felt a distinct reluctance to go and look at them what was the good poison is poison tropical fever is tropical fever but that it should have stretched its claw after us over the sea seemed to me an extraordinary and unfair license i could hardly believe that it could be anything worse than the last desperate pluck of the evil from which we were escaping into the clean breath of the sea if only that breath had been a little stronger however there was the quinine against the fever i went into the spare cabin where the medicine chest was kept to prepare two doses i opened it full of faith as a man opens a miraculous shrine the upper part was inhabited by a collection of bottles all squareshouldered and as like each other as peas under that orderly array there were two drawers stuffed as full of things as one could imaginepaper packages bandages cardboard boxes officially labelled the lower of the two in one of its compartments contained our provision of quinine  there were five bottles all round and all of a size one was about a third full the other four remained still wrapped up in paper and sealed but i did not expect to see an envelope lying on top of them a square envelope belonging in fact to the ships stationery  it lay so that i could see it was not closed down and on picking it up and turning it over i perceived that it was addressed to myself it contained a halfsheet of notepaper which i unfolded with a queer sense of dealing with the uncanny but without any excitement as people meet and do extraordinary things in a dream  my dear captain it began but i ran to the signature the writer was the doctor the date was that of the day on which returning from my visit to mr burns in the hospital i had found the excellent doctor waiting for me in the cabin and when he told me that he had been putting in time inspecting the medicine chest for me how bizarre while expecting me to come in at any moment he had been amusing himself by writing me a letter and then as i came in had hastened to stuff it into the medicinechest drawer a rather incredible proceeding i turned to the text in wonder  in a large hurried but legible hand the good sympathetic man for some reason either of kindness or more likely impelled by the irresistible desire to express his opinion with which he didnt want to damp my hopes before was warning me not to put my trust in the beneficial effects of a change from land to sea i didnt want to add to your worries by discouraging your hopes he wrote i am afraid that medically speaking the end of your troubles is not yet in short he expected me to have to fight a probable return of tropical illness fortunately i had a good provision of quinine i should put my trust in that and administer it steadily when the ships health would certainly improve  i crumpled up the letter and rammed it into my pocket ransome carried off two big doses to the men forward as to myself i did not go on deck as yet i went instead to the door of mr burns room and gave him that news too  it was impossible to say the effect it had on him at first i thought that he was speechless his head lay sunk in the pillow he moved his lips enough however to assure me that he was getting much stronger a statement shockingly untrue on the face of it  that afternoon i took my watch as a matter of course a great overheated stillness enveloped the ship and seemed to hold her motionless in a flaming ambience composed in two shades of blue faint hot puffs eddied nervelessly from her sails and yet she moved she must have for as the sun was setting we had drawn abreast of cape liant and dropped it behind us an ominous retreating shadow in the last gleams of twilight  in the evening under the crude glare of his lamp mr burns seemed to have come more to the surface of his bedding it was as if a depressing hand had been lifted off him he answered my few words by a comparatively long connected speech he asserted himself strongly if he escaped being smothered by this stagnant heat he said he was confident that in a very few days he would be able to come up on deck and help me  while he was speaking i trembled lest this effort of energy should leave him lifeless before my eyes but i cannot deny that there was something comforting in his willingness i made a suitable reply but pointed out to him that the only thing that could really help us was winda fair wind  he rolled his head impatiently on the pillow and it was not comforting in the least to hear him begin to mutter crazily about the late captain that old man buried in latitude 8 d 20 right in our wayambushed at the entrance of the gulf  are you still thinking of your late captain mr burns i said i imagine the dead feel no animosity against the living they care nothing for them  you dont know that one he breathed out feebly  no i didnt know him and he didnt know me and so he cant have any grievance against me anyway  yes but theres all the rest of us on board he insisted  i felt the inexpugnable strength of common sense being insidiously menaced by this gruesome by this insane delusion and i said  you mustnt talk so much you will tire yourself  and there is the ship herself he persisted in a whisper  now not a word more i said stepping in and laying my hand on his cool forehead it proved to me that this atrocious absurdity was rooted in the man himself and not in the disease which apparently had emptied him of every power mental and physical except that one fixed idea  i avoided giving mr burns any opening for conversation for the next few days i merely used to throw him a hasty cheery word when passing his door i believe that if he had had the strength he would have called out after me more than once but he hadnt the strength ransome however observed to me one afternoon that the mate seemed to be picking up wonderfully  did he talk any nonsense to you of late i asked casually  no sir ransome was startled by the direct question but after a pause he added equably he told me this morning sir that he was sorry he had to bury our late captain right in the ships way as one may say out of the gulf  isnt this nonsense enough for you i asked looking confidently at the intelligent quiet face on which the secret uneasiness in the mans breast had thrown a transparent veil of care  ransome didnt know he had not given a thought to the matter and with a faint smile he flitted away from me on his neverending duties with his usual guarded activity  two more days passed we had advanced a little waya very little wayinto the larger space of the gulf of siam seizing eagerly upon the elation of the first command thrown into my lap by the agency of captain giles i had yet an uneasy feeling that such luck as this has got perhaps to be paid for in some way i had held professionally a review of my chances i was competent enough for that at least i thought so i had a general sense of my preparedness which only a man pursuing a calling he loves can know that feeling seemed to me the most natural thing in the world as natural as breathing i imagined i could not have lived without it  i dont know what i expected perhaps nothing else than that special intensity of existence which is the quintessence of youthful aspirations whatever i expected i did not expect to be beset by hurricanes i knew better than that in the gulf of siam there are no hurricanes but neither did i expect to find myself bound hand and foot to the hopeless extent which was revealed to me as the days went on  not that the evil spell held us always motionless mysterious currents drifted us here and there with a stealthy power made manifest only by the changing vistas of the islands fringing the east shore of the gulf and there were winds too fitful and deceitful they raised hopes only to dash them into the bitterest disappointment promises of advance ending in lost ground expiring in sighs dying into dumb stillness in which the currents had it all their own waytheir own inimical way  the island of kohring a great black upheaved ridge amongst a lot of tiny islets lying upon the glassy water like a triton amongst minnows seemed to be the centre of the fatal circle it seemed impossible to get away from it day after day it remained in sight more than once in a favourable breeze i would take its bearings in the fastebbing twilight thinking that it was for the last time vain hope a night of fitful airs would undo the gains of temporary favour and the rising sun would throw out the black relief of kohring looking more barren inhospitable and grim than ever  its like being bewitched upon my word i said once to mr burns from my usual position in the doorway  he was sitting up in his bedplace he was progressing toward the world of living men if he could hardly have been said to have rejoined it yet he nodded to me his frail and bony head in a wisely mysterious assent  oh yes i know what you mean i said but you cannot expect me to believe that a dead man has the power to put out of joint the meteorology of this part of the world though indeed it seems to have gone utterly wrong the land and sea breezes have got broken up into small pieces we cannot depend upon them for five minutes together  it wont be very long now before i can come up on deck muttered mr burns and then we shall see  whether he meant this for a promise to grapple with supernatural evil i couldnt tell at any rate it wasnt the kind of assistance i needed on the other hand i had been living on deck practically night and day so as to take advantage of every chance to get my ship a little more to the southward the mate i could see was extremely weak yet and not quite rid of his delusion which to me appeared but a symptom of his disease at all events the hopefulness of an invalid was not to be discouraged i said  you will be most welcome there i am sure mr burns if you go on improving at this rate youll be presently one of the healthiest men in the ship  this pleased him but his extreme emaciation converted his selfsatisfied smile into a ghastly exhibition of long teeth under the red moustache  arent the fellows improving sir he asked soberly with an extremely sensible expression of anxiety on his face  i answered him only with a vague gesture and went away from the door the fact was that disease played with us capriciously very much as the winds did it would go from one man to another with a lighter or heavier touch which always left its mark behind staggering some knocking others over for a time leaving this one returning to another so that all of them had now an invalidish aspect and a hunted apprehensive look in their eyes while ransome and i the only two completely untouched went amongst them assiduously distributing quinine it was a double fight the adverse weather held us in front and the disease pressed on our rear i must say that the men were very good the constant toil of trimming yards they faced willingly but all spring was out of their limbs and as i looked at them from the poop i could not keep from my mind the dreadful impression that they were moving in poisoned air  down below in his cabin mr burns had advanced so far as not only to be able to sit up but even to draw up his legs clasping them with bony arms like an animated skeleton he emitted deep impatient sighs  the great thing to do sir he would tell me on every occasion when i gave him the chance the great thing is to get the ship past 8 d 20 of latitude once shes past that were all right  at first i used only to smile at him though god knows i had not much heart left for smiles but at last i lost my patience  oh yes the latitude 8 d 20 thats where you buried your late captain isnt it then with severity dont you think mr burns its about time you dropped all that nonsense  he rolled at me his deepsunken eyes in a glance of invincible obstinacy but for the rest he only muttered just loud enough for me to hear something about not surprised    find    play us some beastly trick yet     such passages as this were not exactly wholesome for my resolution the stress of adversity was beginning to tell on me at the same time i felt a contempt for that obscure weakness of my soul i said to myself disdainfully that it should take much more than that to affect in the smallest degree my fortitude  i didnt know then how soon and from what unexpected direction it would be attacked  it was the very next day the sun had risen clear of the southern shoulder of kohring which still hung like an evil attendant on our port quarter it was intensely hateful to my sight during the night we had been heading all round the compass trimming the yards again and again to what i fear must have been for the most part imaginary puffs of air then just about sunrise we got for an hour an inexplicable steady breeze right in our teeth there was no sense in it it fitted neither with the season of the year nor with the secular experience of seamen as recorded in books nor with the aspect of the sky only purposeful malevolence could account for it it sent us travelling at a great pace away from our proper course and if we had been out on pleasure sailing bent it would have been a delightful breeze with the awakened sparkle of the sea with the sense of motion and a feeling of unwonted freshness then all at once as if disdaining to carry farther the sorry jest it dropped and died out completely in less than five minutes the ships head swung where it listed the stilled sea took on the polish of a steel plate in the calm  i went below not because i meant to take some rest but simply because i couldnt bear to look at it just then the indefatigable ransome was busy in the saloon it had become a regular practice with him to give me an informal health report in the morning he turned away from the sideboard with his usual pleasant quiet gaze no shadow rested on his intelligent forehead  there are a good many of them middling bad this morning sir he said in a calm tone  what all knocked out  only two actually in their bunks sir but  its the last night that has done for them we have had to pull and haul all the blessed time  i heard sir i had a mind to come out and help only you know     certainly not you mustnt    the fellows lie at night about the decks too it isnt good for them  ransome assented but men couldnt be looked after like children moreover one could hardly blame them for trying for such coolness and such air as there was to be found on deck he himself of course knew better  he was indeed a reasonable man yet it would have been hard to say that the others were not the last few days had been for us like the ordeal of the fiery furnace one really couldnt quarrel with their common imprudent humanity making the best of the moments of relief when the night brought in the illusion of coolness and the starlight twinkled through the heavy dewladen air moreover most of them were so weakened that hardly anything could be done without everybody that could totter mustering on the braces no it was no use remonstrating with them but i fully believed that quinine was of very great use indeed  i believed in it i pinned my faith to it it would save the men the ship break the spell by its medicinal virtue make time of no account the weather but a passing worry and like a magic powder working against mysterious malefices secure the first passage of my first command against the evil powers of calms and pestilence i looked upon it as more precious than gold and unlike gold of which there ever hardly seems to be enough anywhere the ship had a sufficient store of it i went in to get it with the purpose of weighing out doses i stretched my hand with the feeling of a man reaching for an unfailing panacea took up a fresh bottle and unrolled the wrapper noticing as i did so that the ends both top and bottom had come unsealed     but why record all the swift steps of the appalling discovery you have guessed the truth already there was the wrapper the bottle and the white powder inside some sort of powder but it wasnt quinine one look at it was quite enough i remember that at the very moment of picking up the bottle before i even dealt with the wrapper the weight of the object i had in my hand gave me an instant premonition quinine is as light as feathers and my nerves must have been exasperated into an extraordinary sensibility i let the bottle smash itself on the floor the stuff whatever it was felt gritty under the sole of my shoe i snatched up the next bottle and then the next the weight alone told the tale one after another they fell breaking at my feet not because i threw them down in my dismay but slipping through my fingers as if this disclosure were too much for my strength  it is a fact that the very greatness of a mental shock helps one to bear up against it by producing a sort of temporary insensibility i came out of the stateroom stunned as if something heavy had dropped on my head from the other side of the saloon across the table ransome with a duster in his hand stared openmouthed i dont think that i looked wild it is quite possible that i appeared to be in a hurry because i was instinctively hastening up on deck an example this of training become instinct the difficulties the dangers the problems of a ship at sea must be met on deck  to this fact as it were of nature i responded instinctively which may be taken as a proof that for a moment i must have been robbed of my reason  i was certainly off my balance a prey to impulse for at the bottom of the stairs i turned and flung myself at the doorway of mr burns cabin the wildness of his aspect checked my mental disorder he was sitting up in his bunk his body looking immensely long his head drooping a little sideways with affected complacency he flourished in his trembling hand on the end of a forearm no thicker than a walkingstick a shining pair of scissors which he tried before my very eyes to jab at his throat  i was to a certain extent horrified but it was rather a secondary sort of effect not really strong enough to make me yell at him in some such manner as stop    heavens    what are you doing  in reality he was simply overtaxing his returning strength in a shaky attempt to clip off the thick growth of his red beard a large towel was spread over his lap and a shower of stiff hairs like bits of copper wire was descending on it at every snip of the scissors  he turned to me his face grotesque beyond the fantasies of mad dreams one cheek all bushy as if with a swollen flame the other denuded and sunken with the untouched long moustache on that side asserting itself lonely and fierce and while he stared thunderstruck with the gaping scissors on his fingers i shouted my discovery at him fiendishly in six words without comment     v  i heard the clatter of the scissors escaping from his hand noted the perilous heave of his whole person over the edge of the bunk after them and then returning to my first purpose pursued my course on the deck the sparkle of the sea filled my eyes it was gorgeous and barren monotonous and without hope under the empty curve of the sky the sails hung motionless and slack the very folds of their sagging surfaces moved no more than carved granite the impetuosity of my advent made the man at the helm start slightly a block aloft squeaked incomprehensibly for what on earth could have made it do so it was a whistling note like a birds for a long long time i faced an empty world steeped in an infinity of silence through which the sunshine poured and flowed for some mysterious purpose then i heard ransomes voice at my elbow  i have put mr burns back to bed sir  you have  well sir he got out all of a sudden but when he let go the edge of his bunk he fell down he isnt lightheaded though it seems to me  no i said dully without looking at ransome he waited for a moment then cautiously as if not to give offence i dont think we need lose much of that stuff sir he said i can sweep it up every bit of it almost and then we could sift the glass out i will go about it at once it will not make the breakfast late not ten minutes  oh yes i said bitterly let the breakfast wait sweep up every bit of it and then throw the damned lot overboard  the profound silence returned and when i looked over my shoulder ransomethe intelligent serene ransomehad vanished from my side the intense loneliness of the sea acted like poison on my brain when i turned my eyes to the ship i had a morbid vision of her as a floating grave who hasnt heard of ships found floating haphazard with their crews all dead i looked at the seaman at the helm i had an impulse to speak to him and indeed his face took on an expectant cast as if he had guessed my intention but in the end i went below thinking i would be alone with the greatness of my trouble for a little while but through his open door mr burns saw me come down and addressed me grumpily well sir  i went in it isnt well at all i said  mr burns reestablished in his bedplace was concealing his hirsute cheek in the palm of his hand  that confounded fellow has taken away the scissors from me were the next words he said  the tension i was suffering from was so great that it was perhaps just as well that mr burns had started on his grievance he seemed very sore about it and grumbled does he think i am mad or what  i dont think so mr burns i said i looked upon him at that moment as a model of selfpossession i even conceived on that account a sort of admiration for that man who had apart from the intense materiality of what was left of his beard come as near to being a disembodied spirit as any man can do and live i noticed the preternatural sharpness of the ridge of his nose the deep cavities of his temples and i envied him he was so reduced that he would probably die very soon enviable man so near extinctionwhile i had to bear within me a tumult of suffering vitality doubt confusion selfreproach and an indefinite reluctance to meet the horrid logic of the situation i could not help muttering i feel as if i were going mad myself  mr burns glared spectrally but otherwise was wonderfully composed  i always thought he would play us some deadly trick he said with a peculiar emphasis on the he  it gave me a mental shock but i had neither the mind nor the heart nor the spirit to argue with him my form of sickness was indifference the creeping paralysis of a hopeless outlook so i only gazed at him mr burns broke into further speech  eh what no you wont believe it well how do you account for this how do you think it could have happened  happened i repeated dully why yes how in the name of the infernal powers did this thing happen  indeed on thinking it out it seemed incomprehensible that it should just be like this the bottles emptied refilled rewrapped and replaced a sort of plot a sinister attempt to deceive a thing resembling sly vengeance but for what or else a fiendish joke but mr burns was in possession of a theory it was simple and he uttered it solemnly in a hollow voice  i suppose they have given him about fifteen pounds in haiphong for that little lot  mr burns i cried  he nodded grotesquely over his raised legs like two broomsticks in the pyjamas with enormous bare feet at the end  why not the stuff is pretty expensive in this part of the world and they were very short of it in tonkin and what did he care you have not known him i have and i have defied him he feared neither god nor devil nor man nor wind nor sea nor his own conscience and i believe he hated everybody and everything but i think he was afraid to die i believe i am the only man who ever stood up to him i faced him in that cabin where you live now when he was sick and i cowed him then he thought i was going to twist his neck for him if he had had his way we would have been beating up against the nordeast monsoon as long as he lived and afterward too for ages and ages acting the flying dutchman in the china sea ha ha  but why should he replace the bottles like this    i began  why shouldnt he why should he want to throw the bottles away they fit the drawer they belong to the medicine chest  and they were wrapped up i cried  well the wrappers were there did it from habit i suppose and as to refilling there is always a lot of stuff they send in paper parcels that burst after a time and then who can tell i suppose you didnt taste it sir but of course you are sure     no i said i didnt taste it it is all overboard now  behind me a soft cultivated voice said i have tasted it it seemed a mixture of all sorts sweetish saltish very horrible  ransome stepping out of the pantry had been listening for some time as it was very excusable in him to do  a dirty trick said mr burns i always said he would  the magnitude of my indignation was unbounded and the kind sympathetic doctor too the only sympathetic man i ever knew    instead of writing that warning letter the very refinement of sympathy why didnt the man make a proper inspection but as a matter of fact it was hardly fair to blame the doctor the fittings were in order and the medicine chest is an officially arranged affair there was nothing really to arouse the slightest suspicion the person i could never forgive was myself nothing should ever be taken for granted the seed of everlasting remorse was sown in my breast  i feel its all my fault i exclaimed mine and nobody elses thats how i feel i shall never forgive myself  thats very foolish sir said mr burns fiercely  and after this effort he fell back exhausted on his bed he closed his eyes he panted this affair this abominable surprise had shaken him up too as i turned away i perceived ransome looking at me blankly he appreciated what it meant but managed to produce his pleasant wistful smile then he stepped back into his pantry and i rushed up on deck again to see whether there was any wind any breath under the sky any stir of the air any sign of hope the deadly stillness met me again nothing was changed except that there was a different man at the wheel he looked ill his whole figure drooped and he seemed rather to cling to the spokes than hold them with a controlling grip i said to him  you are not fit to be here  i can manage sir he said feebly  as a matter of fact there was nothing for him to do the ship had no steerage way she lay with her head to the westward the everlasting kohring visible over the stern with a few small islets black spots in the great blaze swimming before my troubled eyes and but for those bits of land there was no speck on the sky no speck on the water no shape of vapour no wisp of smoke no sail no boat no stir of humanity no sign of life nothing  the first question was what to do what could one do the first thing to do obviously was to tell the men i did it that very day i wasnt going to let the knowledge simply get about i would face them they were assembled on the quarterdeck for the purpose just before i stepped out to speak to them i discovered that life could hold terrible moments no confessed criminal had ever been so oppressed by his sense of guilt this is why perhaps my face was set hard and my voice curt and unemotional while i made my declaration that i could do nothing more for the sick in the way of drugs as to such care as could be given them they knew they had had it  i would have held them justified in tearing me limb from limb the silence which followed upon my words was almost harder to bear than the angriest uproar i was crushed by the infinite depth of its reproach but as a matter of fact i was mistaken in a voice which i had great difficulty in keeping firm i went on i suppose men you have understood what i said and you know what it means  a voice or two were heard yes sir    we understand  they had kept silent simply because they thought that they were not called to say anything and when i told them that i intended to run into singapore and that the best chance for the ship and the men was in the efforts all of us sick and well must make to get her along out of this i received the encouragement of a low assenting murmur and of a louder voice exclaiming surely there is a way out of this blamed hole    here is an extract from the notes i wrote at the time  we have lost kohring at last for many days now i dont think i have been two hours below altogether i remain on deck of course night and day and the nights and the days wheel over us in succession whether long or short who can say all sense of time is lost in the monotony of expectation of hope and of desirewhich is only one get the ship to the southward get the ship to the southward the effect is curiously mechanical the sun climbs and descends the night swings over our heads as if somebody below the horizon were turning a crank it is the prettiest the most aimless    and all through that miserable performance i go on tramping tramping the deck how many miles have i walked on the poop of that ship a stubborn pilgrimage of sheer restlessness diversified by short excursions below to look upon mr burns i dont know whether it is an illusion but he seems to become more substantial from day to day he doesnt say much for indeed the situation doesnt lend itself to idle remarks i notice this even with the men as i watch them moving or sitting about the decks they dont talk to each other it strikes me that if there exists an invisible ear catching the whispers of the earth it will find this ship the most silent spot on it     no mr burns has not much to say to me he sits in his bunk with his beard gone his moustaches flaming and with an air of silent determination on his chalky physiognomy ransome tells me he devours all the food that is given him to the last scrap but that apparently he sleeps very little even at night when i go below to fill my pipe i notice that though dozing flat on his back he still looks very determined from the side glance he gives me when awake it seems as though he were annoyed at being interrupted in some arduous mental operation and as i emerge on deck the ordered arrangement of the stars meets my eye unclouded infinitely wearisome there they are stars sun sea light darkness space great waters the formidable work of the seven days into which mankind seems to have blundered unbidden or else decoyed even as i have been decoyed into this awful this deathhaunted command       the only spot of light in the ship at night was that of the compasslamps lighting up the faces of the succeeding helmsmen for the rest we were lost in the darkness i walking the poop and the men lying about the decks they were all so reduced by sickness that no watches could be kept those who were able to walk remained all the time on duty lying about in the shadows of the main deck till my voice raised for an order would bring them to their enfeebled feet a tottering little group moving patiently about the ship with hardly a murmur a whisper amongst them all and every time i had to raise my voice it was with a pang of remorse and pity  then about four oclock in the morning a light would gleam forward in the galley the unfailing ransome with the uneasy heart immune serene and active was getting ready for the early coffee for the men presently he would bring me a cup up on the poop and it was then that i allowed myself to drop into my deck chair for a couple of hours of real sleep no doubt i must have been snatching short dozes when leaning against the rail for a moment in sheer exhaustion but honestly i was not aware of them except in the painful form of convulsive starts that seemed to come on me even while i walked from about five however until after seven i would sleep openly under the fading stars  i would say to the helmsman call me at need and drop into that chair and close my eyes feeling that there was no more sleep for me on earth and then i would know nothing till some time between seven and eight i would feel a touch on my shoulder and look up at ransomes face with its faint wistful smile and friendly gray eyes as though he were tenderly amused at my slumbers occasionally the second mate would come up and relieve me at early coffee time but it didnt really matter generally it was a dead calm or else faint airs so changing and fugitive that it really wasnt worth while to touch a brace for them if the air steadied at all the seaman at the helm could be trusted for a warning shout ships all aback sir which like a trumpetcall would make me spring a foot above the deck those were the words which it seemed to me would have made me spring up from eternal sleep but this was not often i have never met since such breathless sunrises and if the second mate happened to be there he had generally one day in three free of fever i would find him sitting on the skylight half senseless as it were and with an idiotic gaze fastened on some object near bya rope a cleat a belaying pin a ringbolt  that young man was rather troublesome he remained cubbish in his sufferings he seemed to have become completely imbecile and when the return of fever drove him to his cabin below the next thing would be that we would miss him from there the first time it happened ransome and i were very much alarmed we started a quiet search and ultimately ransome discovered him curled up in the saillocker which opened into the lobby by a sliding door when remonstrated with he muttered sulkily its cool in there that wasnt true it was only dark there  the fundamental defects of his face were not improved by its uniform livid hue the disease disclosed its low type in a startling way it was not so with many of the men the wastage of illhealth seemed to idealise the general character of the features bringing out the unsuspected nobility of some the strength of others and in one case revealing an essentially comic aspect he was a short gingery active man with a nose and chin of the punch type and whom his shipmates called frenchy i dont know why he may have been a frenchman but i have never heard him utter a single word in french  to see him coming aft to the wheel comforted one the blue dungaree trousers turned up the calf one leg a little higher than the other the clean check shirt the white canvas cap evidently made by himself made up a whole of peculiar smartness and the persistent jauntiness of his gait even poor fellow when he couldnt help tottering told of his invincible spirit there was also a man called gambril he was the only grizzled person in the ship his face was of an austere type but if i remember all their faces wasting tragically before my eyes most of their names have vanished from my memory  the words that passed between us were few and puerile in regard of the situation i had to force myself to look them in the face i expected to meet reproachful glances there were none the expression of suffering in their eyes was indeed hard enough to bear but that they couldnt help for the rest i ask myself whether it was the temper of their souls or the sympathy of their imagination that made them so wonderful so worthy of my undying regard  for myself neither my soul was highly tempered nor my imagination properly under control there were moments when i felt not only that i would go mad but that i had gone mad already so that i dared not open my lips for fear of betraying myself by some insane shriek luckily i had only orders to give and an order has a steadying influence upon him who has to give it moreover the seaman the officer of the watch in me was sufficiently sane i was like a mad carpenter making a box were he ever so convinced that he was king of jerusalem the box he would make would be a sane box what i feared was a shrill note escaping me involuntarily and upsetting my balance luckily again there was no necessity to raise ones voice the brooding stillness of the world seemed sensitive to the slightest sound like a whispering gallery the conversational tone would almost carry a word from one end of the ship to the other the terrible thing was that the only voice that i ever heard was my own at night especially it reverberated very lonely amongst the planes of the unstirring sails  mr burns still keeping to his bed with that air of secret determination was moved to grumble at many things our interviews were short fiveminute affairs but fairly frequent i was everlastingly diving down below to get a light though i did not consume much tobacco at that time the pipe was always going out for in truth my mind was not composed enough to enable me to get a decent smoke likewise for most of the time during the twentyfour hours i could have struck matches on deck and held them aloft till the flame burnt my fingers but i always used to run below it was a change it was the only break in the incessant strain and of course mr burns through the open door could see me come in and go out every time  with his knees gathered up under his chin and staring with his greenish eyes over them he was a weird figure and with my knowledge of the crazy notion in his head not a very attractive one for me still i had to speak to him now and then and one day he complained that the ship was very silent for hours and hours he said he was lying there not hearing a sound till he did not know what to do with himself  when ransome happens to be forward in his galley everythings so still that one might think everybody in the ship was dead he grumbled the only voice i do hear sometimes is yours sir and that isnt enough to cheer me up whats the matter with the men isnt there one left that can sing out at the ropes  not one mr burns i said there is no breath to spare on board this ship for that are you aware that there are times when i cant muster more than three hands to do anything  he asked swiftly but fearfully  nobody dead yet sir  no  it wouldnt do mr burns declared forcibly mustnt let him if he gets hold of one he will get them all  i cried out angrily at this i believe i even swore at the disturbing effect of these words they attacked all the selfpossession that was left to me in my endless vigil in the face of the enemy i had been haunted by gruesome images enough i had had visions of a ship drifting in calms and swinging in light airs with all her crew dying slowly about her decks such things had been known to happen  mr burns met my outburst by a mysterious silence  look here i said you dont believe yourself what you say you cant its impossible it isnt the sort of thing i have a right to expect from you my positions bad enough without being worried with your silly fancies  he remained unmoved on account of the way in which the light fell on his head i could not be sure whether he had smiled faintly or not i changed my tone  listen i said its getting so desperate that i had thought for a moment since we cant make our way south whether i wouldnt try to steer west and make an attempt to reach the mailboat track we could always get some quinine from her at least what do you think  he cried out no no no dont do that sir you mustnt for a moment give up facing that old ruffian if you do he will get the upper hand of us  i left him he was impossible it was like a case of possession his protest however was essentially quite sound as a matter of fact my notion of heading out west on the chance of sighting a problematical steamer could not bear calm examination on the side where we were we had enough wind at least from time to time to struggle on toward the south enough at least to keep hope alive but suppose that i had used those capricious gusts of wind to sail away to the westward into some region where there was not a breath of air for days on end what then perhaps my appalling vision of a ship floating with a dead crew would become a reality for the discovery weeks afterward by some horrorstricken mariners  that afternoon ransome brought me up a cup of tea and while waiting there tray in hand he remarked in the exactly right tone of sympathy  you are holding out well sir  yes i said you and i seem to have been forgotten  forgotten sir  yes by the feverdevil who has got on board this ship i said  ransome gave me one of his attractive intelligent quick glances and went away with the tray it occurred to me that i had been talking somewhat in mr burns manner it annoyed me yet often in darker moments i forgot myself into an attitude toward our troubles more fit for a contest against a living enemy  yes the feverdevil had not laid his hand yet either on ransome or on me but he might at any time it was one of those thoughts one had to fight down keep at arms length at any cost it was unbearable to contemplate the possibility of ransome the housekeeper of the ship being laid low and what would happen to my command if i got knocked over with mr burns too weak to stand without holding on to his bedplace and the second mate reduced to a state of permanent imbecility it was impossible to imagine or rather it was only too easy to imagine  i was alone on the poop the ship having no steerage way i had sent the helmsman away to sit down or lie down somewhere in the shade the mens strength was so reduced that all unnecessary calls on it had to be avoided it was the austere gambril with the grizzly beard he went away readily enough but he was so weakened by repeated bouts of fever poor fellow that in order to get down the poop ladder he had to turn sideways and hang on with both hands to the brass rail it was just simply heartbreaking to watch yet he was neither very much worse nor much better than most of the halfdozen miserable victims i could muster up on deck  it was a terribly lifeless afternoon for several days in succession low clouds had appeared in the distance white masses with dark convolutions resting on the water motionless almost solid and yet all the time changing their aspects subtly toward evening they vanished as a rule but this day they awaited the setting sun which glowed and smouldered sulkily amongst them before it sank down the punctual and wearisome stars reappeared over our mastheads but the air remained stagnant and oppressive  the unfailing ransome lighted the binnaclelamps and glided all shadowy up to me  will you go down and try to eat something sir he suggested  his low voice startled me i had been standing looking out over the rail saying nothing feeling nothing not even the weariness of my limbs overcome by the evil spell  ransome i asked abruptly how long have i been on deck i am losing the notion of time  twelve days sir he said and its just a fortnight since we left the anchorage  his equable voice sounded mournful somehow he waited a bit then added its the first time that it looks as if we were to have some rain  i noticed then the broad shadow on the horizon extinguishing the low stars completely while those overhead when i looked up seemed to shine down on us through a veil of smoke  how it got there how it had crept up so high i couldnt say it had an ominous appearance the air did not stir at a renewed invitation from ransome i did go down into the cabin toin his own wordstry and eat something i dont know that the trial was very successful i suppose at that period i did exist on food in the usual way but the memory is now that in those days life was sustained on invincible anguish as a sort of infernal stimulant exciting and consuming at the same time  its the only period of my life in which i attempted to keep a diary no not the only one years later in conditions of moral isolation i did put down on paper the thoughts and events of a score of days but this was the first time i dont remember how it came about or how the pocketbook and the pencil came into my hands its inconceivable that i should have looked for them on purpose i suppose they saved me from the crazy trick of talking to myself  strangely enough in both cases i took to that sort of thing in circumstances in which i did not expect in colloquial phrase to come out of it neither could i expect the record to outlast me this shows that it was purely a personal need for intimate relief and not a call of egotism  here i must give another sample of it a few detached lines now looking very ghostly to my own eyes out of the part scribbled that very evening    there is something going on in the sky like a decomposition like a corruption of the air which remains as still as ever after all mere clouds which may or may not hold wind or rain strange that it should trouble me so i feel as if all my sins had found me out but i suppose the trouble is that the ship is still lying motionless not under command and that i have nothing to do to keep my imagination from running wild amongst the disastrous images of the worst that may befall us whats going to happen probably nothing or anything it may be a furious squall coming butt end foremost and on deck there are five men with the vitality and the strength of say two we may have all our sails blown away every stitch of canvas has been on her since we broke ground at the mouth of the meinam fifteen days ago    or fifteen centuries it seems to me that all my life before that momentous day is infinitely remote a fading memory of lighthearted youth something on the other side of a shadow yes sails may very well be blown away and that would be like a death sentence on the men we havent strength enough on board to bend another suit incredible thought but it is true or we may even get dismasted ships have been dismasted in squalls simply because they werent handled quick enough and we have no power to whirl the yards around its like being bound hand and foot preparatory to having ones throat cut and what appals me most of all is that i shrink from going on deck to face it its due to the ship its due to the men who are there on decksome of them ready to put out the last remnant of their strength at a word from me and i am shrinking from it from the mere vision my first command now i understand that strange sense of insecurity in my past i always suspected that i might be no good and here is proof positive i am shirking it i am no good    at that moment or perhaps the moment after i became aware of ransome standing in the cabin something in his expression startled me it had a meaning which i could not make out i exclaimed somebodys dead  it was his turn then to look startled  dead not that i know of sir i have been in the forecastle only ten minutes ago and there was no dead man there then  you did give me a scare i said  his voice was extremely pleasant to listen to he explained that he had come down below to close mr burns port in case it should come on to rain he did not know that i was in the cabin he added  how does it look outside i asked him  very black indeed sir there is something in it for certain  in what quarter  all round sir  i repeated idly all round for certain with my elbows on the table  ransome lingered in the cabin as if he had something to do there but hesitated about doing it i said suddenly  you think i ought to be on deck  he answered at once but without any particular emphasis or accent i do sir  i got to my feet briskly and he made way for me to go out as i passed through the lobby i heard mr burns voice saying  shut the door of my room will you steward and ransomes rather surprised certainly sir  i thought that all my feelings had been dulled into complete indifference but i found it as trying as ever to be on deck the impenetrable blackness beset the ship so close that it seemed that by thrusting ones hand over the side one could touch some unearthly substance there was in it an effect of inconceivable terror and of inexpressible mystery the few stars overhead shed a dim light upon the ship alone with no gleams of any kind upon the water in detached shafts piercing an atmosphere which had turned to soot it was something i had never seen before giving no hint of the direction from which any change would come the closing in of a menace from all sides  there was still no man at the helm the immobility of all things was perfect if the air had turned black the sea for all i knew might have turned solid it was no good looking in any direction watching for any sign speculating upon the nearness of the moment when the time came the blackness would overwhelm silently the bit of starlight falling upon the ship and the end of all things would come without a sigh stir or murmur of any kind and all our hearts would cease to beat like rundown clocks  it was impossible to shake off that sense of finality the quietness that came over me was like a foretaste of annihilation it gave me a sort of comfort as though my soul had become suddenly reconciled to an eternity of blind stillness  the seamans instinct alone survived whole in my moral dissolution i descended the ladder to the quarterdeck the starlight seemed to die out before reaching that spot but when i asked quietly are you there men my eyes made out shadow forms starting up around me very few very indistinct and a voice spoke all here sir another amended anxiously  all that are any good for anything sir  both voices were very quiet and unringing without any special character of readiness or discouragement very matteroffact voices  we must try to haul this mainsail close up i said  the shadows swayed away from me without a word those men were the ghosts of themselves and their weight on a rope could be no more than the weight of a bunch of ghosts indeed if ever a sail was hauled up by sheer spiritual strength it must have been that sail for properly speaking there was not muscle enough for the task in the whole ship let alone the miserable lot of us on deck of course i took the lead in the work myself they wandered feebly after me from rope to rope stumbling and panting they toiled like titans we were halfanhour at it at least and all the time the black universe made no sound when the last leechline was made fast my eyes accustomed to the darkness made out the shapes of exhausted men drooping over the rails collapsed on hatches one hung over the aftercapstan sobbing for breath and i stood amongst them like a tower of strength impervious to disease and feeling only the sickness of my soul i waited for some time fighting against the weight of my sins against my sense of unworthiness and then i said  now men well go aft and square the mainyard thats about all we can do for the ship and for the rest she must take her chance     vi  as we all went up it occurred to me that there ought to be a man at the helm i raised my voice not much above a whisper and noiselessly an uncomplaining spirit in a feverwasted body appeared in the light aft the head with hollow eyes illuminated against the blackness which had swallowed up our worldand the universe the bared forearm extended over the upper spokes seemed to shine with a light of its own  i murmured to that luminous appearance  keep the helm right amidships  it answered in a tone of patient suffering  right amidships sir  then i descended to the quarterdeck it was impossible to tell whence the blow would come to look round the ship was to look into a bottomless black pit the eye lost itself in inconceivable depths  i wanted to ascertain whether the ropes had been picked up off the deck one could only do that by feeling with ones feet in my cautious progress i came against a man in whom i recognized ransome he possessed an unimpaired physical solidity which was manifest to me at the contact he was leaning against the quarterdeck capstan and kept silent it was like a revelation he was the collapsed figure sobbing for breath i had noticed before we went on the poop  you have been helping with the mainsail i exclaimed in a low tone  yes sir sounded his quiet voice  man what were you thinking of you mustnt do that sort of thing  after a pause he assented i suppose i mustnt then after another short silence he added i am all right now quickly between the telltale gasps  i could neither hear nor see anybody else but when i spoke up answering sad murmurs filled the quarterdeck and its shadows seemed to shift here and there i ordered all the halyards laid down on deck clear for running  ill see to that sir volunteered ransome in his natural pleasant tone which comforted one and aroused ones compassion too somehow  that man ought to have been in his bed resting and my plain duty was to send him there but perhaps he would not have obeyed me i had not the strength of mind to try all i said was  go about it quietly ransome  returning on the poop i approached gambril his face set with hollow shadows in the light looked awful finally silenced i asked him how he felt but hardly expected an answer therefore i was astonished at his comparative loquacity  them shakes leaves me as weak as a kitten sir he said preserving finely that air of unconsciousness as to anything but his business a helmsman should never lose and before i can pick up my strength that there hot fit comes along and knocks me over again  he sighed there was no reproach in his tone but the bare words were enough to give me a horrible pang of selfreproach it held me dumb for a time when the tormenting sensation had passed off i asked  do you feel strong enough to prevent the rudder taking charge if she gets sternway on her it wouldnt do to get something smashed about the steeringgear now weve enough difficulties to cope with as it is  he answered with just a shade of weariness that he was strong enough to hang on he could promise me that she shouldnt take the wheel out of his hands more he couldnt say  at that moment ransome appeared quite close to me stepping out of the darkness into visibility suddenly as if just created with his composed face and pleasant voice  every rope on deck he said was laid down clear for running as far as one could make certain by feeling it was impossible to see anything frenchy had stationed himself forward he said he had a jump or two left in him yet  here a faint smile altered for an instant the clear firm design of ransomes lips with his serious clear gray eyes his serene temperamenthe was a priceless man altogether soul as firm as the muscles of his body  he was the only man on board except me but i had to preserve my liberty of movement who had a sufficiency of muscular strength to trust to for a moment i thought i had better ask him to take the wheel but the dreadful knowledge of the enemy he had to carry about him made me hesitate in my ignorance of physiology it occurred to me that he might die suddenly from excitement at a critical moment  while this gruesome fear restrained the ready words on the tip of my tongue ransome stepped back two paces and vanished from my sight  at once an uneasiness possessed me as if some support had been withdrawn i moved forward too outside the circle of light into the darkness that stood in front of me like a wall in one stride i penetrated it such must have been the darkness before creation it had closed behind me i knew i was invisible to the man at the helm neither could i see anything he was alone i was alone every man was alone where he stood and every form was gone too spar sail fittings rails everything was blotted out in the dreadful smoothness of that absolute night  a flash of lightning would have been a reliefi mean physically i would have prayed for it if it hadnt been for my shrinking apprehension of the thunder in the tension of silence i was suffering from it seemed to me that the first crash must turn me into dust  and thunder was most likely what would happen next stiff all over and hardly breathing i waited with a horribly strained expectation nothing happened it was maddening but a dull growing ache in the lower part of my face made me aware that i had been grinding my teeth madly enough for god knows how long  its extraordinary i should not have heard myself doing it but i hadnt by an effort which absorbed all my faculties i managed to keep my jaw still it required much attention and while thus engaged i became bothered by curious irregular sounds of faint tapping on the deck they could be heard single in pairs in groups while i wondered at this mysterious devilry i received a slight blow under the left eye and felt an enormous tear run down my cheek raindrops enormous forerunners of something tap tap tap     i turned about and addressing gambrel earnestly entreated him to hang on to the wheel but i could hardly speak from emotion the fatal moment had come i held my breath the tapping had stopped as unexpectedly as it had begun and there was a renewed moment of intolerable suspense something like an additional turn of the racking screw i dont suppose i would have ever screamed but i remember my conviction that there was nothing else for it but to scream  suddenlyhow am i to convey it well suddenly the darkness turned into water this is the only suitable figure a heavy shower a downpour comes along making a noise you hear its approach on the sea in the air too i verily believe but this was different with no preliminary whisper or rustle without a splash and even without the ghost of impact i became instantaneously soaked to the skin not a very difficult matter since i was wearing only my sleeping suit my hair got full of water in an instant water streamed on my skin it filled my nose my ears my eyes in a fraction of a second i swallowed quite a lot of it  as to gambril he was fairly choked he coughed pitifully the broken cough of a sick man and i beheld him as one sees a fish in an aquarium by the light of an electric bulb an elusive phosphorescent shape only he did not glide away but something else happened both binnaclelamps went out i suppose the water forced itself into them though i wouldnt have thought that possible for they fitted into the cowl perfectly  the last gleam of light in the universe had gone pursued by a low exclamation of dismay from gambril i groped for him and seized his arm how startlingly wasted it was  never mind i said you dont want the light all you need to do is to keep the wind when it comes at the back of your head you understand  aye aye sir    but i should like to have a light he added nervously  all that time the ship lay as steady as a rock the noise of the water pouring off the sails and spars flowing over the break of the poop had stopped short the poop scuppers gurgled and sobbed for a little while longer and then perfect silence joined to perfect immobility proclaimed the yet unbroken spell of our helplessness poised on the edge of some violent issue lurking in the dark  i started forward restlessly i did not need my sight to pace the poop of my illstarred first command with perfect assurance every square foot of her decks was impressed indelibly on my brain to the very grain and knots of the planks yet all of a sudden i fell clean over something landing full length on my hands and face  it was something big and alive not a dogmore like a sheep rather but there were no animals in the ship how could an animal    it was an added and fantastic horror which i could not resist the hair of my head stirred even as i picked myself up awfully scared not as a man is scared while his judgment his reason still try to resist but completely boundlessly and as it were innocently scaredlike a little child  i could see itthat thing the darkness of which so much had just turned into water had thinned down a little there it was but i did not hit upon the notion of mr burns issuing out of the companion on all fours till he attempted to stand up and even then the idea of a bear crossed my mind first  he growled like one when i seized him round the body he had buttoned himself up into an enormous winter overcoat of some woolly material the weight of which was too much for his reduced state i could hardly feel the incredibly thin lath of his body lost within the thick stuff but his growl had depth and substance confounded dump ship with a craven tiptoeing crowd why couldnt they stamp and go with a brace wasnt there one godforsaken lubber in the lot fit to raise a yell on a rope  skulkings no good sir he attacked me directly you cant slink past the old murderous ruffian it isnt the way you must go for him boldlyas i did boldness is what you want show him that you dont care for any of his damned tricks kick up a jolly old row  good god mr burns i said angrily what on earth are you up to what do you mean by coming up on deck in this state  just that boldness the only way to scare the old bullying rascal  i pushed him still growling against the rail hold on to it i said roughly i did not know what to do with him i left him in a hurry to go to gambril who had called faintly that he believed there was some wind aloft indeed my own ears had caught a feeble flutter of wet canvas high up overhead the jingle of a slack chain sheet     these were eerie disturbing alarming sounds in the dead stillness of the air around me all the instances i had heard of topmasts being whipped out of a ship while there was not wind enough on her deck to blow out a match rushed into my memory  i cant see the upper sails sir declared gambril shakily  dont move the helm youll be all right i said confidently  the poor mans nerves were gone mine were not in much better case it was the moment of breaking strain and was relieved by the abrupt sensation of the ship moving forward as if of herself under my feet i heard plainly the soughing of the wind aloft the low cracks of the upper spars taking the strain long before i could feel the least draught on my face turned aft anxious and sightless like the face of a blind man  suddenly a loudersounding note filled our ears the darkness started streaming against our bodies chilling them exceedingly both of us gambril and i shivered violently in our clinging soaked garments of thin cotton i said to him  you are all right now my man all youve got to do is to keep the wind at the back of your head surely you are up to that a child could steer this ship in smooth water  he muttered aye a healthy child and i felt ashamed of having been passed over by the fever which had been preying on every mans strength but mine in order that my remorse might be the more bitter the feeling of unworthiness more poignant and the sense of responsibility heavier to bear  the ship had gathered great way on her almost at once on the calm water i felt her slipping through it with no other noise but a mysterious rustle alongside otherwise she had no motion at all neither lift nor roll it was a disheartening steadiness which had lasted for eighteen days now for never never had we had wind enough in that time to raise the slightest run of the sea the breeze freshened suddenly i thought it was high time to get mr burns off the deck he worried me i looked upon him as a lunatic who would be very likely to start roaming over the ship and break a limb or fall overboard  i was truly glad to find he had remained holding on where i had left him sensibly enough he was however muttering to himself ominously  this was discouraging i remarked in a matteroffact tone  we have never had so much wind as this since we left the roads  theres some heart in it too he growled judiciously it was a remark of a perfectly sane seaman but he added immediately it was about time i should come on deck ive been nursing my strength for thisjust for this do you see it sir  i said i did and proceeded to hint that it would be advisable for him to go below now and take a rest  his answer was an indignant go below not if i know it sir  very cheerful he was a horrible nuisance and all at once he started to argue i could feel his crazy excitement in the dark  you dont know how to go about it sir how could you all this whispering and tiptoeing is no good you cant hope to slink past a cunning wideawake evil brute like he was you never heard him talk enough to make your hair stand on end no no he wasnt mad he was no more mad than i am he was just downright wicked wicked so as to frighten most people i will tell you what he was he was nothing less than a thief and a murderer at heart and do you think hes any different now because hes dead not he his carcass lies a hundred fathom under but hes just the same    in latitude 8 d 20 north  he snorted defiantly i noted with weary resignation that the breeze had got lighter while he raved he was at it again  i ought to have thrown the beggar out of the ship over the rail like a dog it was only on account of the men    fancy having to read the burial service over a brute like that    our departed brother    i could have laughed that was what he couldnt bear i suppose i am the only man that ever stood up to laugh at him when he got sick it used to scare that    brother    brother    departed    sooner call a shark brother  the breeze had let go so suddenly that the way of the ship brought the wet sails heavily against the mast the spell of deadly stillness had caught us up again there seemed to be no escape  hallo exclaimed mr burns in a startled voice calm again  i addressed him as though he had been sane  this is the sort of thing weve been having for seventeen days mr burns i said with intense bitterness a puff then a calm and in a moment youll see shell be swinging on her heel with her head away from her course to the devil somewhere  he caught at the word the old dodging devil he screamed piercingly and burst into such a loud laugh as i had never heard before it was a provoking mocking peal with a hairraising screeching overnote of defiance i stepped back utterly confounded  instantly there was a stir on the quarterdeck murmurs of dismay a distressed voice cried out in the dark below us whos that gone crazy now  perhaps they thought it was their captain rush is not the word that could be applied to the utmost speed the poor fellows were up to but in an amazing short time every man in the ship able to walk upright had found his way on to that poop  i shouted to them its the mate lay hold of him a couple of you     i expected this performance to end in a ghastly sort of fight but mr burns cut his derisive screeching dead short and turned upon them fiercely yelling  aha doggone ye youve found your tongueshave ye i thought you were dumb well thenlaugh laughi tell you now thenall together one two threelaugh  a moment of silence ensued of silence so profound that you could have heard a pin drop on the deck then ransomes unperturbed voice uttered pleasantly the words  i think he has fainted sir the little motionless knot of men stirred with low murmurs of relief ive got him under the arms get hold of his legs some one  yes it was a relief he was silenced for a timefor a time i could not have stood another peal of that insane screeching i was sure of it and just then gambril the austere gambril treated us to another vocal performance he began to sing out for relief his voice wailed pitifully in the darkness come aft somebody i cant stand this here shell be off again directly and i cant     i dashed aft myself meeting on my way a hard gust of wind whose approach gambrils ear had detected from afar and which filled the sails on the main in a series of muffled reports mingled with the low plaint of the spars i was just in time to seize the wheel while frenchy who had followed me caught up the collapsing gambril he hauled him out of the way admonished him to lie still where he was and then stepped up to relieve me asking calmly  how am i to steer her sir  dead before it for the present ill get you a light in a moment  but going forward i met ransome bringing up the spare binnacle lamp that man noticed everything attended to everything shed comfort around him as he moved as he passed me he remarked in a soothing tone that the stars were coming out they were the breeze was sweeping clear the sooty sky breaking through the indolent silence of the sea  the barrier of awful stillness which had encompassed us for so many days as though we had been accursed was broken i felt that i let myself fall on to the skylight seat a faint white ridge of foam thin very thin broke alongside the first for agesfor ages i could have cheered if it hadnt been for the sense of guilt which clung to all my thoughts secretly ransome stood before me  what about the mate i asked anxiously still unconscious  well sirits funny ransome was evidently puzzled he hasnt spoken a word and his eyes are shut but it looks to me more like sound sleep than anything else  i accepted this view as the least troublesome of any or at any rate least disturbing dead faint or deep slumber mr burns had to be left to himself for the present ransome remarked suddenly  i believe you want a coat sir  i believe i do i sighed out  but i did not move what i felt i wanted were new limbs my arms and legs seemed utterly useless fairly worn out they didnt even ache but i stood up all the same to put on the coat when ransome brought it up and when he suggested that he had better now take gambril forward i said  all right ill help you to get him down on the main deck  i found that i was quite able to help too we raised gambril up between us he tried to help himself along like a man but all the time he was inquiring piteously  you wont let me go when we come to the ladder you wont let me go when we come to the ladder   the breeze kept on freshening and blew true true to a hair at daylight by careful manipulation of the helm we got the foreyards to run square by themselves the water keeping smooth and then went about hauling the ropes tight of the four men i had with me at night i could see now only two i didnt inquire as to the others they had given in for a time only i hoped  our various tasks forward occupied us for hours the two men with me moved so slow and had to rest so often one of them remarked that every blamed thing in the ship felt about a hundred times heavier than its proper weight this was the only complaint uttered i dont know what we should have done without ransome he worked with us silent too with a little smile frozen on his lips from time to time i murmured to him go steadytake it easy ransomeand received a quick glance in reply  when we had done all we could do to make things safe he disappeared into his galley some time afterward going forward for a look round i caught sight of him through the open door he sat upright on the locker in front of the stove with his head leaning back against the bulkhead his eyes were closed his capable hands held open the front of his thin cotton shirt baring tragically his powerful chest which heaved in painful and laboured gasps he didnt hear me  i retreated quietly and went straight on to the poop to relieve frenchy who by that time was beginning to look very sick he gave me the course with great formality and tried to go off with a jaunty step but reeled widely twice before getting out of my sight  and then i remained all alone aft steering my ship which ran before the wind with a buoyant lift now and then and even rolling a little presently ransome appeared before me with a tray the sight of food made me ravenous all at once he took the wheel while i sat down of the after grating to eat my breakfast  this breeze seems to have done for our crowd he murmured it just laid them lowall hands  yes i said i suppose you and i are the only two fit men in the ship  frenchy says theres still a jump left in him i dont know it cant be much continued ransome with his wistful smile good little man that but suppose sir that this wind flies round when we are close to the landwhat are we going to do with her  if the wind shifts round heavily after we close in with the land she will either run ashore or get dismasted or both we wont be able to do anything with her shes running away with us now all we can do is to steer her shes a ship without a crew  yes all laid low repeated ransome quietly i do give them a lookin forward every now and then but its precious little i can do for them  i and the ship and every one on board of her are very much indebted to you ransome i said warmly  he made as though he had not heard me and steered in silence till i was ready to relieve him he surrendered the wheel picked up the tray and for a parting shot informed me that mr burns was awake and seemed to have a mind to come up on deck  i dont know how to prevent him sir i cant very well stop down below all the time  it was clear that he couldnt and sure enough mr burns came on deck dragging himself painfully aft in his enormous overcoat i beheld him with a natural dread to have him around and raving about the wiles of a dead man while i had to steer a wildly rushing ship full of dying men was a rather dreadful prospect  but his first remarks were quite sensible in meaning and tone apparently he had no recollection of the night scene and if he had he didnt betray himself once neither did he talk very much he sat on the skylight looking desperately ill at first but that strong breeze before which the last remnant of my crew had wilted down seemed to blow a fresh stock of vigour into his frame with every gust one could almost see the process  by way of sanity test i alluded on purpose to the late captain i was delighted to find that mr burns did not display undue interest in the subject he ran over the old tale of that savage ruffians iniquities with a certain vindictive gusto and then concluded unexpectedly  i do believe sir that his brain began to go a year or more before he died  a wonderful recovery i could hardly spare it as much admiration as it deserved for i had to give all my mind to the steering  in comparison with the hopeless languour of the preceding days this was dizzy speed two ridges of foam streamed from the ships bows the wind sang in a strenuous note which under other circumstances would have expressed to me all the joy of life whenever the hauledup mainsail started trying to slat and bang itself to pieces in its gear mr burns would look at me apprehensively  what would you have me to do mr burns we can neither furl it nor set it i only wish the old thing would thrash itself to pieces and be done with it that beastly racket confuses me  mr burns wrung his hands and cried out suddenly  how will you get the ship into harbour sir without men to handle her  and i couldnt tell him  wellit did get done about forty hours afterward by the exorcising virtue of mr burns awful laugh the malicious spectre had been laid the evil spell broken the curse removed we were now in the hands of a kind and energetic providence it was rushing us on     i shall never forget the last night dark windy and starry i steered mr burns after having obtained from me a solemn promise to give him a kick if anything happened went frankly to sleep on the deck close to the binnacle convalescents need sleep ransome his back propped against the mizzenmast and a blanket over his legs remained perfectly still but i dont suppose he closed his eyes for a moment that embodiment of jauntiness frenchy still under the delusion that there was a jump left in him had insisted on joining us but mindful of discipline had laid himself down as far on the forepart of the poop as he could get alongside the bucketrack  and i steered too tired for anxiety too tired for connected thought i had moments of grim exultation and then my heart would sink awfully at the thought of that forecastle at the other end of the dark deck full of feverstricken mensome of them dying by my fault but never mind remorse must wait i had to steer  in the small hours the breeze weakened then failed altogether about five it returned gentle enough enabling us to head for the roadstead daybreak found mr burns sitting wedged up with coils of rope on the sterngrating and from the depths of his overcoat steering the ship with very white bony hands while ransome and i rushed along the decks letting go all the sheets and halliards by the run we dashed next up on to the forecastle head the perspiration of labour and sheer nervousness simply poured off our heads as we toiled to get the anchors cockbilled i dared not look at ransome as we worked side by side we exchanged curt words i could hear him panting close to me and i avoided turning my eyes his way for fear of seeing him fall down and expire in the act of putting forth his strengthfor what indeed for some distinct ideal  the consummate seaman in him was aroused he needed no directions he knew what to do every effort every movement was an act of consistent heroism it was not for me to look at a man thus inspired  at last all was ready and i heard him say  hadnt i better go down and open the compressors now sir  yes do i said  and even then i did not glance his way after a time his voice came up from the main deck  when you like sir all clear on the windlass here  i made a sign to mr burns to put the helm down and let both anchors go one after another leaving the ship to take as much cable as she wanted she took the best part of them both before she brought up the loose sails coming aback ceased their maddening racket above my head a perfect stillness reigned in the ship and while i stood forward feeling a little giddy in that sudden peace i caught faintly a moan or two and the incoherent mutterings of the sick in the forecastle  as we had a signal for medical assistance flying on the mizzen it is a fact that before the ship was fairly at rest three steam launches from various menofwar were alongside and at least five naval surgeons had clambered on board they stood in a knot gazing up and down the empty main deck then looked aloftwhere not a man could be seen either  i went toward thema solitary figure in a blue and gray striped sleeping suit and a pipeclayed cork helmet on its head their disgust was extreme they had expected surgical cases each one had brought his carving tools with him but they soon got over their little disappointment in less than five minutes one of the steam launches was rushing shoreward to order a big boat and some hospital people for the removal of the crew the big steam pinnace went off to her ship to bring over a few bluejackets to furl my sails for me  one of the surgeons had remained on board he came out of the forecastle looking impenetrable and noticed my inquiring gaze  theres nobody dead in there if thats what you want to know he said deliberately then added in a tone of wonder the whole crew  and very bad  and very bad he repeated his eyes were roaming all over the ship heavens whats that  that i said glancing aft is mr burns my chief officer  mr burns with his moribund head nodding on the stalk of his lean neck was a sight for any one to exclaim at the surgeon asked  is he going to the hospital too  oh no i said jocosely mr burns cant go on shore till the mainmast goes i am very proud of him hes my only convalescent  you look began the doctor staring at me but i interrupted him angrily  i am not ill  no    you look queer  well you see i have been seventeen days on deck  seventeen    but you must have slept  i suppose i must have i dont know but im certain that i didnt sleep for the last forty hours  phew    you will be going ashore presently i suppose  as soon as ever i can theres no end of business waiting for me there  the surgeon released my hand which he had taken while we talked pulled out his pocketbook wrote in it rapidly tore out the page and offered it to me  i strongly advise you to get this prescription made up for yourself ashore unless i am much mistaken you will need it this evening  what is it then i asked with suspicion  sleeping draught answered the surgeon curtly and moving with an air of interest toward mr burns he engaged him in conversation  as i went below to dress to go ashore ransome followed me he begged my pardon he wished too to be sent ashore and paid off  i looked at him in surprise he was waiting for my answer with an air of anxiety  you dont mean to leave the ship i cried out  i do really sir i want to go and be quiet somewhere anywhere the hospital will do  but ransome i said i hate the idea of parting with you  i must go he broke in i have a right    he gasped and a look of almost savage determination passed over his face for an instant he was another being and i saw under the worth and the comeliness of the man the humble reality of things life was a boon to himthis precarious hard life and he was thoroughly alarmed about himself  of course i shall pay you off if you wish it i hastened to say only i must ask you to remain on board till this afternoon i cant leave mr burns absolutely by himself in the ship for hours  he softened at once and assured me with a smile and in his natural pleasant voice that he understood that very well  when i returned on deck everything was ready for the removal of the men it was the last ordeal of that episode which had been maturing and tempering my characterthough i did not know it  it was awful they passed under my eyes one after anothereach of them an embodied reproach of the bitterest kind till i felt a sort of revolt wake up in me poor frenchy had gone suddenly under he was carried past me insensible his comic face horribly flushed and as if swollen breathing stertorously he looked more like mr punch than ever a disgracefully intoxicated mr punch  the austere gambril on the contrary had improved temporarily he insisted on walking on his own feet to the railof course with assistance on each side of him but he gave way to a sudden panic at the moment of being swung over the side and began to wail pitifully  dont let them drop me sir dont let them drop me sir while i kept on shouting to him in most soothing accents all right gambril they wont they wont  it was no doubt very ridiculous the bluejackets on our deck were grinning quietly while even ransome himself much to the fore in lending a hand had to enlarge his wistful smile for a fleeting moment  i left for the shore in the steam pinnace and on looking back beheld mr burns actually standing up by the taffrail still in his enormous woolly overcoat the bright sunlight brought out his weirdness amazingly he looked like a frightful and elaborate scarecrow set up on the poop of a deathstricken ship set up to keep the seabirds from the corpses  our story had got about already in town and everybody on shore was most kind the marine office let me off the port dues and as there happened to be a shipwrecked crew staying in the home i had no difficulty in obtaining as many men as i wanted but when i inquired if i could see captain ellis for a moment i was told in accents of pity for my ignorance that our deputyneptune had retired and gone home on a pension about three weeks after i left the port so i suppose that my appointment was the last act outside the daily routine of his official life  it is strange how on coming ashore i was struck by the springy step the lively eyes the strong vitality of every one i met it impressed me enormously and amongst those i met there was captain giles of course it would have been very extraordinary if i had not met him a prolonged stroll in the business part of the town was the regular employment of all his mornings when he was ashore  i caught the glitter of the gold watchchain across his chest ever so far away he radiated benevolence  what is it i hear he queried with a kind uncle smile after shaking hands twentyone days from bangkok  is this all youve heard i said you must come to tiffin with me i want you to know exactly what you have let me in for  he hesitated for almost a minute  welli will he said condescendingly at last  we turned into the hotel i found to my surprise that i could eat quite a lot then over the cleared tablecloth i unfolded to captain giles the history of these twenty days in all its professional and emotional aspects while he smoked patiently the big cigar i had given him  then he observed sagely  you must feel jolly well tired by this time  no i said not tired but ill tell you captain giles how i feel i feel old and i must be all of you on shore look to me just a lot of skittish youngsters that have never known a care in the world  he didnt smile he looked insufferably exemplary he declared  that will pass but you do look olderits a fact  aha i said  no no the truth is that one must not make too much of anything in life good or bad  live at halfspeed i murmured perversely not everybody can do that  youll be glad enough presently if you can keep going even at that rate he retorted with his air of conscious virtue and theres another thing a man should stand up to his bad luck to his mistakes to his conscience and all that sort of thing whywhat else would you have to fight against  i kept silent i dont know what he saw in my face but he asked abruptly  whyyou arent fainthearted  god only knows captain giles was my sincere answer  thats all right he said calmly you will learn soon how not to be fainthearted a man has got to learn everythingand thats what so many of them youngsters dont understand  well i am no longer a youngster  no he conceded are you leaving soon  i am going on board directly i said i shall pick up one of my anchors and heave in to halfcable on the other directly my new crew comes on board and i shall be off at daylight tomorrow  you will grunted captain giles approvingly thats the way youll do  what did you think that i would want to take a week ashore for a rest i said irritated by his tone theres no rest for me till shes out in the indian ocean and not much of it even then  he puffed at his cigar moodily as if transformed  yes thats what it amounts to he said in a musing tone it was as if a ponderous curtain had rolled up disclosing an unexpected captain giles but it was only for a moment just the time to let him add precious little rest in life for anybody better not think of it  we rose left the hotel and parted from each other in the street with a warm handshake just as he began to interest me for the first time in our intercourse  the first thing i saw when i got back to the ship was ransome on the quarterdeck sitting quietly on his neatly lashed seachest  i beckoned him to follow me into the saloon where i sat down to write a letter of recommendation for him to a man i knew on shore  when finished i pushed it across the table it may be of some good to you when you leave the hospital  he took it put it in his pocket his eyes were looking away from menowhere his face was anxiously set  how are you feeling now i asked  i dont feel bad now sir he answered stiffly but i am afraid of its coming on    the wistful smile came back on his lips for a moment ii am in a blue funk about my heart sir  i approached him with extended hand his eyes not looking at me had a strained expression he was like a man listening for a warning call  wont you shake hands ransome i said gently  he exclaimed flushed up dusky red gave my hand a hard wrenchand next moment left alone in the cabin i listened to him going up the companion stairs cautiously step by step in mortal fear of starting into sudden anger our common enemy it was his hard fate to carry consciously within his faithful breast
