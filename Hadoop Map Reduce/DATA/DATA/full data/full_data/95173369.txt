     bettys bright idea    when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto meneph iv 8  some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviours birth is celebrate the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no evil spirit walks the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes no witch hath power to charm so hallowed and so gracious is the time  and this holy time so hallowed and so gracious was settling down over the great roaring rattling seething lifeworld of new york in the good year 1875 who does not feel its oncoming in the shops and streets in the festive air of trade and business in the thousand garnitures by which every store hangs out triumphal banners and solicits you to buy something for a christmas gift for it is the peculiarity of all this array of prints confectionery dry goods and manufactures of all kinds that their bravery and splendor at christmas tide is all to seduce you into generosity and importune you to give something to others it says to you the dear god gave you an unspeakable gift give you a lesser gift to your brother  do we ever think when we walk those busy bustling streets all alive with christmas shoppers and mingle with the rushing tides that throng and jostle through the stores that unseen spirits may be hastening to and fro along those same ways bearing christs christmas gifts to men gifts whose value no earthly gold or gems can represent  yet on this morning of the day before christmas were these shining ones moving to and fro with the crowd whose faces were loving and serene as the invisible stars whose robes took no defilement from the spatter and the rush of earth whose coming and going was still as the falling snowflakes they entered houses without ringing doorbells they passed through apartments without opening doors and everywhere they were bearing christs christmas presents and silently offering them to whoever would open their souls to receive like themselves their gifts were invisibleincapable of weight and measurement in gross earthly scales to mourners they carried joy to weary and perplexed hearts peace to souls stifling in luxury and selfindulgence they carried that noble discontent that rises to aspiration for higher things sometimes they took away an earthly treasure to make room for a heavenly one they took health but left resignation and cheerful faith they took the babe from the dear cradle but left in its place a heart full of pity for the suffering on earth and a fellowship with the blessed in heaven let us follow their footsteps awhile    scene i   a young girls boudoir in one of our american palaces of luxury built after the choicest fancy of the architect and furnished in all the latest devices of household decoration pictures statuettes and every form of bijouterie make the room a miracle of beauty and the little princess of all sits in an easy chair before the fire and thus revolves with herself  o dear me christmas is a bore such a rush and crush in the streets such a jam in the shops and then such a fuss thinking up presents for everybody all for nothing too for nobody wants anything im sure i dont im surfeited now with pictures and jewelry and bonbon boxes and little china dogs and catsand all these things that get so thick you cant move without upsetting some of them theres papa he dont want anything he never uses any of my christmas presents when i get them and mamma she has every earthly thing i can think of and said the other day she did hope nobodyd give her any more worsted work then aunt maria and uncle john they dont want the things i give them they have more than they know what to do with now all the boys say they dont want any more cigar cases or slippers or smoking caps oh dear  here the shining ones came and stood over the little lady and looked down on her with faces of pity which seemed blent with a serene and halfamused indulgence it was a heavenly amusement such as that with which mothers listen to the foolishwise prattle of children just learning to talk  as the grave sweet eyes rested tenderly on her the girl somehow grew graver leaned back in her chair and sighed a little  i wish i knew how to be better she said to herself i remember last sundays text it is more blessed to give than to receive that must mean something well isnt there something too in the bible about not giving to your rich neighbors that can give again but giving to the poor that cannot recompense you i dont know any poor people papa says there are very few deserving poor people well for the matter of that there arent many deserving rich people i for example how much do i deserve to have all these nice things im no better than the poor shopgirls that go trudging by in the cold at six oclock in the morning ugh it makes me shiver to think of it i know if i had to do that i shouldnt be good at all well id like to give to poor people if i knew any  at this moment the door opened and the maid entered  betty do you know any poor people i ought to get things for this christmas  poor folks is always plenty miss said betty  o yes of course beggars but i mean people that i could do something for besides just give cold victuals or money i dont know where to hunt them up and should be afraid to go if i did o dear its no use ill give it up  why miss florence that ud be too bad afther bein that good in yer heart to let the poor folks alone for fear of goin to them but ye neednt do that for now i think of it theres john morleys wife  what the gardener father turned off for drinking  the same miss poor boy hes not so bad and hes got a wife and two as pretty children as ever you see  i always liked john said the young lady but papa is so strict about some things he says he never will keep a man a day if he finds out that he drinks  she was quite silent for a minute and then broke out  i dont care its a good idea i say betty do you know where johns wife lives  yes miss ive been there often  well then this afternoon ill go with you and see if i can do anything for them  decoration    scene ii   an attic room neat and clean but poorly furnished a bed and a trundle bed a small cookingstove a shelf with a few dishes one or two chairs and stools a pale thin woman working on a vest  her face is anxious her thin hands tremble with weakness and now and then as she works quiet tears drop which she wipes quickly poor people cannot afford to shed tears it takes time and injures eyesight  this is john morleys wife this morning he has risen and gone out in a desperate mood no use to try he says didnt i go a whole year and never touch a drop and now just because i fell once im kicked out no use to try when a fellow once trips everybody gives him a kick

ill trudge up to the brooklyn navy yard and see if theyll take me on thereif they wont i might as well go to sea or to the devil and out he flings  mamma says a little voice what are we going to have for our christmas  it is a little girl with soft curly hair and bright earnest eyes that speaks  a sturdy little fellow of four presses up to the mothers knee and repeats the question shant we have a christmas mother  it overcomes the poor woman she leans forward and breaks into sobbing a tempest of sorrow long suppressed that shakes her weak frame as she thinks that her husband is out of work desperate discouraged and tempted of the devil that the rent is falling due and only the poor pay of her needle to meet it with in one of those quick flashes which concentrate through the imagination the sorrows of years she seems to see her little home broken up her husband in the gutter her children turned into the street at this moment there goes up from her heart a despairing cry such as a poor hunted tiredout creature gives when brought to the last gasp of endurance it was like the shriek of the hare when the hounds are upon it she clasps her hands and cries out o my god help me  there was no voice of any that answered there was no sound of footfall on the staircase no one entered the door and yet that agonized cry had reached the heart it was meant for the shining ones were with her they stood with faces full of tenderness beaming down upon her they brought her a christmas gift from christthe gift of trust she knew not from whence came the courage and rest that entered her soul but while her little ones stood wondering and silent she turned and drew to herself her wellworn bible hands that she did not see guided her as she turned the pages and pointed the words he shall deliver the needy when he crieth the poor also and him that hath no helper he shall spare the poor and needy and shall save the souls of the needy he shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence and precious shall their blood be in his sight  she laid down her poor wan cheek on the merciful old book as on her mothers breast and gave up all the tangled skein of life into the hands of infinite pity there seemed a consoling presence in the room and her tired heart found rest  she wiped away her tears kissed her children and smiled upon them then she rose gathered up her finished work and attired herself to go forth and carry it back to the shop  mother said the children softly they are dressing the church and the gates are open and people are going in and out maynt we play there by the church  the mother looked out on the ivygrown walls of the church with its flocks of twittering sparrows and said  yes my little birds you may play there if youll be very good and quiet  the mother had only her small close attic room for her darlings and to satisfy all their childish desire for variety and motion she had only the refuge of the streets she was a decent godly woman and the bold manners and evil words of street vagrants were terrible to her and so when the church gates were open for daily morning and evening prayers she had often begged the sexton to let her little ones come in and hear the singing and wander hand in hand around the old church walls he was a kindly old man and the children stealing round like two still brighteyed little mice had gained upon his heart and he made them welcome there it gave the mother a feeling of protection to have them play near the church as if it were a fathers house  so she put on their little hoods and tippets and led them forth and saw them into the yard and as she looked to the old gray church with its rustling ivy bowers and flocks of birds her heart swelled within her yea the sparrow hath found a house and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young even thine altars o lord of hosts my king and my god and the shining ones walking with her said fear not ye are of more value than many sparrows  decoration    scene iii   the little ones went gayly into the yard they had been scared by their mothers tears but she had smiled again and that had made all right with them the sun was shining brightly and they were on the sunny side of the old church and they laughed and chirped and chittered to each other as merrily as the little birds in the ivy boughs  the old sexton came to the side door and threw out an armful of refuse greens and then stopped a moment and nodded kindly at them  may we play with them please sir said the little elsie looking up with great reverence  oh yes to be sure these are done withthey are no good now  oh tottie cried elsie rapturously just think he says we may play with all these why heres ever and ever so much green enough to play house lets play build a house for father and mother  im going to build a big house for em when i grow up said tottie and i mean to have glass bead windows in it  tottie had once had presented to him a box of colored glass beads to string and he could think of nothing finer in the future than unlimited glass beads  meanwhile his sister began planting pine branches upright in the snow to make her house  you see we can make believe there are windows and doors and a roof she said and its just as good now lets make believe there is a bed in this corner and we will lie down to sleep  and tottie obediently couched himself in the allotted corner and shut his eyes very hard though after a moment he remarked that the snow got into his neck  you must play it isnt snowplay its feathers said elsie  but i dont like it persisted tottie it dont feel a bit like feathers  oh well then said elsie accommodating herself to circumstances lets play get up now and ill get breakfast  just now the door opened again and the sexton began sweeping the refuse out of the church there were bits of ivy and holly and ruffles of groundpine and lots of bright red berries that came flying forth into the yard and the children screamed for joy o tottie o elsie only see how many pretty thingslots and lots  the sexton stood and looked and laughed as he saw the little ones so eager for the scraps and remnants  dont you want to come in and see the church he said its all done now and a brave sight it is you may come in  they tipped in softly with large bright wondering eyes the light through the stained glass windows fell blue and crimson and yellow on the pillars all ruffled with groundpine and brightened with scarlet bitter sweet berries and there were stars and crosses and mottoes in green all through the bowery aisles while the organist hid in a thicket of verdure was practicing softly and sweet voices sung  hark the herald angels sing glory to the newborn king  the little ones wandered up and down the long aisles in a dream of awe and wonder hush tottie said elsie when he broke into an eager exclamation dont make a noise i do believe its something like heaven she said under her breath  they made the course of the church and came round by the door again where the sexton stood smiling on them  you can find lots of pretty christmas greens out there he said pointing to the door perhaps your folks would like to have some  oh thank you sir exclaimed elsie rapturously oh tottie only think lets gather a good lot and go home and dress our room for christmas oh wont mother be astonished when she comes home well make it so pretty  and forthwith the children began gathering into their little aprons wreaths of groundpine sprigs of holly and twigs of crimson bitter sweet the sexton seeing their zeal brought out to them a little cross fancifully made of red alderberries and pine  then he said a lady took that down to put up a bigger one and she gave it to me you may have it if you want it  oh how beautiful said elsie how glad i am to have this for mother when she comes back she wont know our room it will be as fine as the church  soon the little gleaners were toddling off out of the yardmoving masses of green with all that their aprons and their little hands could carry  the sexton looked after them take heed that ye despise not these little ones he said to himself for in heaven their angels  a ray of tenderness fell on the old mans head it was from the shining one who watched the children he thought it was an afternoon sunbeam his heart grew gentle and peaceful and his thoughts went far back to a distant green grove where his own little one was sleeping seems to me ive loved all little ones ever since he said thinking far back to the christmas week when his lamb was laid to rest well she shall not return to me but i shall go to her the smile of the shining one made a warm glow in his heart which followed him all the way home  the children had a merry time dressing the room they stuck good big bushes of pine in each window they put a little ruffle of groundpine round mothers bible and they fastened the beautiful red cross up over the table and they stuck sprigs of pine or holly into every crack that could be made by fair means or foul to accept it and they were immensely satisfied and delighted tottie insisted on hanging up his string of manycolored beads in the window to imitate the effect of the stained glass of the great church window  it looks pretty when the light comes through he remarked and elsie admitted that they might play they were painted windows with some show of propriety when everything had been stuck somewhere elsie swept the floor and made up a fire and put on the teakettle to have everything ready to strike mother favorably on her return  decoration    scene iv   a freezing bright cold afternoon cold as christmas say cheery voices as the crowds rush to and fro into shops and stores and come out with hands full of presents  yes cold as christmas says john morley i should think so cold enough for a fellow that cant get in anywherethat nobody wants and nobody helps i should think so  john had been trudging all day from point to point only to hear the old story times were hard work was dull nobody wanted him and he felt morose and surlyout of humor with himself and with everybody else  it is true that his misfortunes were from his own fault but that consideration never makes a man a particle more patient or goodnatured indeed it is an additional bitterness in his cup john was an englishman when he first landed in new york from the old country he had been wild and dissipated and given to drinking but by his wifes earnest entreaties he had been persuaded to sign the temperance pledge and had gone on prosperously keeping it for a year he had a good place and good wages and all went well with him till in an evil hour he met some of his former booncompanions and was induced to have a social evening with them  in the first half hour of that evening were lost the fruits of the whole years selfdenial and selfcontrol he was not only drunk that night but he went off for a fortnight and was drunk night after night and came back to find that his master had discharged him in indignation john thinks this over bitterly as he thuds about in the cold and calls himself a fool  yet if the truth must be confessed john had not much sense of sin so called he looked on himself as an unfortunate and rather illused man for had he not tried very hard to be good and gone a great while against the stream of evil inclination and now just for one yielding he was pitched out of place and everybody was turned against him he thought this was hard measure didnt everybody hit wrong sometimes didnt rich fellows have their wine and drink a little too much now and then yet nobody was down on them  its only because im poor said john poor folks sins are never pardoned theres my good wifepoor girl and johns heart felt as if it were breaking for he was an affectionate creature and loved his wife and babies and in his deepest consciousness he knew that he was the one at fault we have heard much about the sufferings of the wives and children of men who are overtaken with drink but what is not so well understood is the sufferings of the men themselves in their sober moments when they feel that they are becoming a curse to all that are dearest to them johns very soul was wrung within him to think of the misery he had brought on his wife and childrenthe greater miseries that might be in store for them he was faint of heart he was tired he had eaten nothing for hours and on ahead he saw a drinking saloon why shouldnt he go and take one good drink and then pitch off a ferryboat into the east river and so end the whole miserable muddle of life altogether  johns steps were turning that way when one of the shining ones who had watched him all day came nearer and took his hand he felt no touch but at that moment there darted into his soul a thought of his mother long dead and he stopped irresolute then turned to walk another way the hand that was guiding him led him to turn a corner and his curiosity was excited by a stream of people who seemed to be pressing into a building a distant sound of singing was heard as he drew nearer and soon he found himself passing with the multitude into a great prayermeeting the music grew more distinct as he went in a man was singing in clear penetrating tones  what means this eager anxious throng which moves with busy haste along these wondrous gatherings day by day what means this strange commotion say in accents hushed the throng reply jesus of nazareth passeth by  john had but a vague idea of religion yet something in the singing affected him and weary and footsore and heartsore as he was he sank into a seat and listened with absorbed attention  jesus tis he who once below mans pathway trod in toil and woe and burdened ones whereer he came brought out their sick and deaf and lame the blind rejoiced to hear the cry jesus of nazareth passeth by  ho all ye heavyladen come heres pardon comfort rest and home ye wanderers from a fathers face return accept his proffered grace ye tempted ones theres refuge nigh jesus of nazareth passeth by  a plain man who spoke the language of plain workingmen now arose and read from his bible the words which the angel of old spoke to the shepherds of bethlehem  fear not for behold i bring you tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day a saviour which is christ the lord  the man went on to speak of this with an intense practical earnestness that soon made john feel as if he individually were being talked to and the purport of the speech was this that god had sent to him john morley a saviour to save him from his sins to lift him above his weakness to help him overcome his bad habits that his name was called jesus because he shall save his people from their sins john listened with a strange new thrill this was what he neededa friend all powerful allpitiful who would undertake for him and help him to overcome himselffor he sorely felt how weak he was here was a friend that could have compassion on the ignorant and them that were out of the way the thought brought tears to his eyes and a glow of hope to his heart what if he would help him for deep down in johns heart worse than cold or hunger or weariness was the dreadful conviction that he was a doomed man that he should drink again as he had drunk and never come to good but fall lower and lower and drag all who loved him down with him  and was this mighty saviour given to him  yes cried the man who was speaking to you to you who have lost name and place to you that nobody cares for to you who have been down in the gutter god has sent you a saviour to take you up out of the mud and mire to wash you clean to give you strength to overcome your sins and lead you home to his blessed kingdom this is the glad tidings of great joy that the angels brought on the first christmas day christ was gods christmas gift to a poor lost world and you may have him now today he may be your own saviouryours as much as if there were no other one on earth to be saved he is looking for you today coming after you seeking you he calls you by me oh accept him now  there was a deep breathing of suppressed emotion as the speaker sat down a pause of solemn stillness  a faint strain of music was heard and the singer began singing a pathetic ballad of a lost sheep and of the shepherd going forth to seek it  there were ninety and nine that safely lay   in the shelter of the fold but one was out on the hills away   far off from the gates of gold away on the mountains wild and bare away from the tender shepherds care  lord thou hast here thy ninety and nine   are they not enough for thee but the shepherd made answer tis of mine   has wandered away from me and although the road be rough and steep i go to the desert to find my sheep  john heard with an absorbed interest all around him were eager listeners breathless leaning forward with intense attention the song went on  but none of the ransomed ever knew   how deep were the waters crossed nor how dark was the night that the lord went through   ere he found his sheep that was lost out in the desert he heard its cry sick and helpless and ready to die  there was a throbbing pathos in the intonation and the verse floated over the weeping throng when after a pause the strain was taken up triumphantly  but all through the mountains thunderriven   and up from the rocky steep there rose a cry to the gates of heaven   rejoice i have found my sheep and the angels echoed around the throne rejoice for the lord brings back his own  all day long poor john had felt so lonesome nobody cared for him nobody wanted him everything was against him and worst of all he had no faith in himself but here was this friend seeking him following him through the cold alleys and crowded streets in heaven they would be glad to hear that he had become a good man the thought broke down all his pride all his bitterness he wept like a little child and the christmas gift of christthe sense of a real present loving pitying saviourcame into his very soul  he went homeward as one in a dream he passed the drinkingsaloon without a thought or wish of drinking the expulsive force of a new emotion had for the time driven out all temptation raised above weakness he thought only of this jesus this saviour from sin who he now believed had followed him and found him and he longed to go home and tell his wife what great things the lord had done for him  decoration    scene v   meanwhile a little drama had been acting in johns humble home his wife had been to the shop that day and come home with the pittance for her work in her hands  ill pay you full price today but we cant pay such prices any longer the man had said over the counter as he paid her hard times work dullwe are cutting down all our workfolks youll have to take a third less next time  ill do my best she said meekly as she took her bundle of work and turned wearily away but the invisible arm of the shining one was round her and the words again thrilled through her that she had read that morning he shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence and precious shall their blood be in his sight she saw no earthly helper she heard none and felt none and yet her soul was sustained and she came home in peace  when she opened the door of her little room she drew back astonished at the sight that presented itself a brisk fire was roaring in the stove and the teakettle was sputtering and sending out clouds of steam a table with a white cloth on it was drawn out before the fire and a new tea set of pure white cups and saucers with teapot sugarbowl and creamer complete gave a festive air to the whole there were bread and butter and hamsandwiches and a christmas cake all frosted with little blue and red and green candles round it ready to be lighted and a bunch of hothouse flowers in a pretty little vase in the centre  a new stuffed rockingchair stood on one side of the stove and there sat miss florence de witt our young princess of scene first holding little elsie in her lap while the broad honest countenance of betty was beaming with kindness down on the delighted face of tottie both children were dressed from head to foot in complete new suits of clothes and elsie was holding with tender devotion a fine doll while tottie rejoiced in a horse and cart which he was maneuvering under bettys superintendence  the little princess had pleased herself in getting up all this tableau doing good was a novelty to her and she plunged into it with the zest of a new amusement the amazed look of the poor woman her dazed expressions of rapture and incredulous joy the shrieks and cries of confused delight with which the little ones met their mother delighted her more than any scene she had ever witnessed at the operawith this added grace unknown to her that at this scene the invisible shining ones were pleased witnesses  she had been out with betty buying here and there whatever was wanted and what was not wanted for those who had been living so long without work or money  she had their little coalbin filled and a nice pile of wood and kindlings put behind the stove she had bought a nice rockingchair for the mother to rest in she had dressed the children from head to foot at a readymade clothing store and bought them toys to their hearts desire while betty had set the table for a christmas feast  and now she said to the poor woman at last  im so sorry john lost his place at fathers he was so kind and obliging and i always liked him and ive been thinking if youd get him to sign the pledge over again from christmas eve never to touch another drop ill get papa to take him back i always do get papa to do what i want and the fact is he hasnt got anybody that suited him so well since john left so you tell john that i mean to go surety for him he certainly wont fail me tell him i trust him and miss florence pulled out a paper wherein in her best round hand she had written out again the temperance pledge and dated it christmas eve 1875  now you come with john tomorrow morning and bring this with his name to it and youll see what ill do and with a kiss to the children the little good fairy departed leaving the family to their christmas eve  what that christmas eve was when the husband and father came home with the new and softened heart that had been given him who can say there were joyful tears and solemn prayers and earnest vows and purposes of a new life heard by the shining ones in the room that night  and the angels echoed around the throne rejoice for the lord brings back his own    scene vi   now papa i want you to give me something special today because its christmas said the little princess to her father as she kissed and wished him merry christmas next morning  what is it pussyhalf of my kingdom  no no papa not so much as that its a little bit of my own way that i want  of course well what is it  well i want you to take john back again  her fathers face grew hard  now please papa dont say a word till you have heard me john was a capital gardener he kept the greenhouse looking beautiful and this mike that weve got now hes nothing but an apprentice and stupid as an owl at that hell never do in the world  all that is very true said mr de witt but john drinks and i wont have a drinking man  but papa i mean to take care of that ive written out the temperance pledge and dated it and got john to sign it and here it is and she handed the paper to her father who read it carefully and sat turning it in his hands while his daughter went on  you ought to have seen how poor how very poor they were his wife is such a nice quiet hardworking woman and has two such pretty children i went to see them and carry them christmas things yesterday but its no good doing anything if john cant get work she told me how the poor fellow had been walking the streets in the cold day after day trying everywhere and nobody would take him its a dreadful time now for a man to be out of work and it isnt fair his poor wife and children should suffer do try him again papa  john always did better with the pineapples than anybody we have tried said mrs de witt at this point he is the only one who really understands pineapples  at this moment the door opened and there was a sound of chirping voices in the hall please miss florence said betty the little folks says they wants to give you a christmas she added in a whisper they thinks much of giving you something poor little thingsplaze take it of em and little tottie at the word marched in and offered the young princess his dear beautiful beloved string of glass beads and elsie presented the cross of red berriesmost dear to her heart and fair to her eyes we wanted to give you something she said bashfully  oh you lovely dears cried florence how sweet of you i shall keep these beautiful glass beads always and put the cross up over my dressingtable i thank you ever so much  are those johns children asked mr de witt winking a tear out of his eyehe was at bottom a softhearted old gentleman  yes papa said florence caressing elsies curly hairsee how sweet they are  wellyou may tell john ill try him again and so passed florences christmas with a new warm sense of joy in her heart a feeling of something in the world to be done worth doing  how much joy one can give with a little money she said to herself as she counted over what she had spent on her christmas ah yes and how true that it is more blessed to give than to receive a shining invisible hand was laid on her head in blessing as she lay down that night and a sweet sense of a loving presence stole like music into her soul unknown to herself she had that day taken the first step out of selflife into that life of love and care for others which brought the king of glory down to share earths toils and sorrows and that precious experience was christs christmas gift to her  decoration      deacon pitkins farm    illustration the pitkin homestead     chapter i   miss diana  thanksgiving was impending in the village of mapleton on the 20th of november 1825  the governors proclamation had been duly and truly read from the pulpit the sunday before to the great consternation of miss briskett the ambulatory dressmaker who declared confidentially to deacon pitkins wife that she didnt see nothin how she was goin to get through thingsand there was saphirys gown and miss deacon trowbridges cloak and lizy janes new merino not a stroke done ont the governor ought to be ashamed of himself for hurrying matters so  it was a very rash step for miss briskett to go to the length of such a remark about the governor but the deacons wife was one of the few women who are nonconductors of indiscretion and so the governor never heard of it  this particular thanksgiving tide was marked in mapleton by exceptionally charming weather once in a great while the inclement new england skies are taken with a remorseful twinge and forget to give their usual snap of september frost which generally bites off all the pretty flowers in so heartbreaking a way and then you can have lovely times quite down through november  it was so this year at mapleton though the thanksgiving proclamation had been read and it was past the middle of november yet marigolds and fouroclocks were all ablaze in the gardens and the golden rod and purple aster were blooming over the fields as if they were expecting to keep it up all winter  it really is affecting the jolly good heart with which these bright children of the rainbow flaunt and wave and dance and go on budding and blossoming in the very teeth and snarl of oncoming winter an autumn golden rod or aster ought to be the symbol for pluck and courage and might serve a new england crest as the broom flower did the old plantagenets  the trees round mapleton were looking like gigantic tulip beds and breaking every hour into new phantasmagoria of color and the great elm that overshadowed the red pitkin farmhouse seemed like a dome of gold and sent a yellow radiance through all the doors and windows as the dreamy autumn sunshine streamed through it  the pitkin elm was noted among the great trees of new england now and then nature asserts herself and does something so astonishing and overpowering as actually to strike through the crust of human stupidity and convince mankind that a tree is something greater than they are as a general thing the human race has a stupid hatred of trees they embrace every chance to cut them down they have no idea of their fitness for anything but firewood or fruit bearing but a great cathedral elm with shadowy aisles of boughs its choir of whispering winds and chanting birds its hush and solemnity and majestic grandeur actually conquers the dull human race and asserts its leave to be in a manner to which all hearts respond and so the great elms of new england have got to be regarded with a sort of pride as among her very few crown jewels and the pitkin elm was one of these  but wasnt it a busy time in mapleton busy is no word for it oh the choppings the poundings the stoning of raisins the projections of pies and puddings the killing of turkeyswho can utter it the very chip squirrels in the stonewalls who have a family custom of making a marketbasket of their mouths were rushing about with chops incredibly distended and their tails had an extra whisk of thanksgiving alertness a squirrels thanksgiving dinner is an affair of moment mind you  in the great roomy clean kitchen of the deacons house might be seen the lithe comely form of diana pitkin presiding over the roaring great oven which was to engulf the armies of pies and cakes which were in due course of preparation on the ample tables  of course you want to know who diana pitkin was it was a general fact about this young lady that anybody who gave one look at her whether at church or at home always inquired at once with effusion who is she particularly if the inquirer was one of the masculine gender  this was to be accounted for by the fact that miss diana presented to the first view of the gazer a dazzling combination of pink and white a flashing pair of black eyes a ripple of dimples about the prettiest little rosy mouth in the world and a frequent somewhat saucy laugh which showed a set of teeth like pearls add to this a quick wit a generous though spicy temper and a nimble tongue and you will not wonder that miss diana was a marked character at mapleton and that the inquiry who she was was one of the most interesting facts of statistical information  well she was deacon pitkins second cousin and of course just in that convenient relationship to the pitkin boys which has all the advantages of cousinship and none of the disadvantages as may be plain to an ordinary observer for if miss diana wished to ride or row or dance with any of the pitkin boys why shouldnt she were they not her cousins but if any of these aforenamed young fellows advanced on the strength of these intimacies a presumptive claim to nearer relationship why then diana was astonishedof course she had regarded them as her cousins and she was sure she couldnt think what they could be dreaming ofa cousin is just like a brother you know  this was just what james pitkin did not believe in and now as he is walking over hill and dale from cambridge college to his fathers house he is gathering up a decided resolution to tell diana that he is not and will not be to her as a brotherthat she must be to him all or nothing james is the brightest the tallest and the mapleton girls said the handsomest of the pitkin boys he is a stronghearted generous resolute fellow as ever undertook to walk thirtyfive miles home to eat his thanksgiving dinner  illustration diana  we are not sure that miss diana is not thinking of him quite as much as he of her as she stands there with the long kitchen shovel in one hand and one plump white arm thrust into the oven and her little head cocked on one side her brows bent and her rosy mouth pursed up with a solemn sense of the importance of her judgment as she is testing the heat of her oven  oh di di for all you seem to have nothing on your mind but the responsibility for all those pumpkin pies and cranberry tarts we wouldnt venture a very large wager that you are not thinking about cousin james under it all at this very minute and that all this pretty bustling housewifeliness owes its spice and flavor to the thought that james is coming to the thanksgiving dinner  to be sure if any one had told di so she would have flouted the very idea besides she had privately informed almira sisson her special particular confidante that she knew jim would come home from college full of conceit and thinking that everybody must bow down to him and for her part she meant to make him know his place of course jim and she were good friends etc etc  oh di di you silly naughty girl was it for this that you stood so long at your lookingglass last night arranging how you would do your hair for the thanksgiving night dance those killing bows which you deliberately fabricated and lodged like bright butterflies among the dark waves of your hairwho were you thinking of as you made and posed them lay your hand on your heart and say who to you has ever seemed the best the truest the bravest and kindest of your friends but di doesnt trouble herself with such thoughtsshe only cuts out saucy mottoes from the flaky white paste to lay on the red cranberry tarts of which she makes a special one for each cousin for there is bill the second eldest who stays at home and helps work the farm she knows that bill worships her very shoetie and obeys all her mandates with the faithful docility of a good newfoundland dog and di says she thinks everything of billshe likes bill so she does ed who comes a year or two behind bill and is trembling out of bashful boyhood so she does rob and ike and pete and the whole healthy ramping train who fill the pitkin farm house with a racket of boots and boys so she has made every one a tart with his initial on it and a saucy motto or two just to keep them from being conceited you know  all day she keeps busy by the side of the deacons wifea delicate thin quiet little woman with great thoughtful eyes and a step like a snowflake new england had of old times and has still perhaps in her farmhouses these women who seem from year to year to develop in the spiritual sphere as the bodily form shrinks and fades while the cheek grows thin and the form spare the willpower grows daily stronger though the outer man perish the inner man is renewed day by day the worn hand that seems so weak yet holds every thread and controls every movement of the most complex family life and wonders are daily accomplished by the presence of a woman who seems little more than a spirit the new england wifemother was the one little jeweled pivot on which all the wheel work of the family moved  well havent we done a good days work cousin says diana when ninety pies of every ilkquince apple cranberry pumpkin and mince have been all safely delivered from the oven and carried up into the great vacant chamber where ranged in rows and frozen solid they are to last over new years day she adds demonstratively clasping the little woman round the neck and leaning her bright cheek against her whitening hair havent we been smart and the calm thoughtful eyes turn lovingly upon her as mary pitkin puts her arm round her and answers  yes my daughter you have done wonderfully we couldnt do without you  and diana lifts her head and laughs she likes petting and praising as a cat likes being stroked but for all that the little puss has her claws and a sly notion of using them    chapter ii   biah carter  it was in the flush and glow of a gorgeous sunset that you might have seen the dark form of the pitkin farmhouse rising on a green hill against the orange sky  the red house with its overhanging canopy of elm stood out like an old missal picture done on a gold ground  through the glimmer of the yellow twilight might be seen the stacks of dry cornstalks and heaps of golden pumpkins in the neighboring fields from which the slow oxen were bringing home a cart well laden with farm produce  it was the hour before supper time and biah carter the deacons hired man was leaning against a fence waiting for his evening meal indulging the while in a stream of conversational wisdom which seemed to flow all the more freely from having been dammed up through the labors of the day  illustration biah  biah was in those far distant times of simplicity a mute inglorious newspaper man newspapers in those days were as rare and unheard of as steam cars or the telegraph but biah had within him all the making of a thriving modern reporter and no paper to use it on he was a walking biographical and statistical dictionary of all the affairs of the good folks of mapleton he knew every piece of furniture in their houses and what they gave for it every foot of land and what it was worth every ox ass and sheep every man woman and child in town and biah could give pretty shrewd character pictures also and whoever wanted to inform himself of the status of any person or thing in mapleton would have done well to have turned the faucet of biahs stream of talk and watched it respectfully as it came for it was commonly conceded that what biah carter didnt know about mapleton was hardly worth knowing  putty piece o property this ere farm he said surveying the scene around him with the air of a connoisseur none o yer stun pastur land where the sheep cant get their noses down through the rocks without a file to sharpen em deacon pitkin did a putty fair stroke o business when he swapped off his old place for this ere that are old place was all swamp land and stun pastur want good for raisin nothin but juniper bushes and

said abner with slow wonder in his heavy face  oh he allers was sot on eddication and mis pitkin shes sot ont too in her softly way and softly women is them that ginerlly carries their pints fust or last  but theres one that aint softly biah suddenly continued as the vision of a blackhaired brighteyed girl suddenly stepped forth from the doorway and stood shading her face with her hands looking towards the sunset the evening light lit up a jaunty spray of golden rod that she had wreathed in her wavy hair and gave a glow to the rounded outlines of her handsome form theres a sparkler for you and no saint neither was biahs comment that crittur has got more prances and capers in her than any threeyearold filly i knows on hell be cunning that ever gets a bridle on her  some says shes going

jims up to college and between um she gets took round to everything that going she gives one a word over one shoulder and one over tother and if the lord above knows whats in that gals mind or what shes up to he knows more than i do or she either else i lose my bet  biah made this admission with a firmness that might have been a model to theologians or philosophers in general there was a point it appeared where he was not omniscient his universal statistical knowledge had a limit    chapter iii   the shadow  there is no moment of life however festive that does not involve the near presence of a possible tragedy when the concert of life is playing the gayest and airiest music it requires only the change of a little flat or sharp to modulate into the minor key  there seemed at first glance only the elements of joyousness and gayety in the surroundings at the pitkin farm thanksgiving was comethe family healthy rosy and noisy were all under the one rooftree there was energy youth intelligence beauty a pair of lovers on the eve of betrothaljust in that misty golden twilight that precedes the full sunrise of avowed and accepted loveand yet behind it all was walking with stealthy step the shadow of a coming sorrow  what in the world ails james said diana as she retreated from the door and surveyed him at a distance from her chamber window his face was like a landscape over which a thundercloud has drifted and he walked beside his father with a peculiar air of proud displeasure and repression  at that moment the young man was struggling with the bitterest sorrow that can befall youththe breaking up of his lifepurpose he had just come to a decision to sacrifice his hopes of education his mans ambition his love his home and family and become a wanderer on the face of the earth how this befell requires a sketch of character  deacon silas pitkin was a fair specimen of a class of men not uncommon in new englandmen too sensitive for the severe physical conditions of new england life and therefore both suffering and inflicting suffering he was a man of the finest moral traits of incorruptible probity of scrupulous honor of an exacting conscientiousness and of a sincere piety but he had begun life with nothing his whole standing in the world had been gained inch by inch by the most unremitting economy and selfdenial and he was a man of little capacity for hope of whom it was said in popular phraseology that he took things hard he was never sanguine of good always expectant of evil and seemed to view life like a sentinel forbidden to sleep and constantly under arms  for such a man to be harassed by a mortgage upon his homestead was a steady wear and drain upon his vitality there were times when a positive horror of darkness came down upon himwhen his wifes untroubled patient hopefulness seemed to him like recklessness when the smallest item of expense was an intolerable burden and the very daily bread of life was full of bitterness and when these paroxysms were upon him one of the heaviest of his burdens was the support of his son in college it was true that he was proud of his sons talents and sympathized with his love for learninghe had to the full that sense of the value of education which is the very vital force of the new england mindand in an hour when things looked brighter to him he had given his consent to the scheme of a college education freely  james was industrious frugal energetic and had engaged to pay the most of his own expenses by teaching in the long winter vacations but unfortunately this year the mapleton academy which had been promised to him for the winter term had been taken away by a little maneuver of local politics and given to another thus leaving him without resource this disappointment coming just at the time when the yearly interest upon the mortgage was due had brought upon his father one of those paroxysms of helpless gloom and discouragement in which the very world itself seemed clothed in sackcloth  from the time that he heard the academy was gone deacon silas lay awake nights in the blackness of darkness we shall all go to the poorhouse togetherthats where it will end he said as he tossed restlessly in the dark  oh no no my dear said his wife with those serene eyes that had looked through so many gloomy hours we must cast our care on god  its easy for women to talk you dont have the interest money to pay you are perfectly reckless of expense nothing would do but james must go to college and now see what its bringing us to  why father i thought you yourself were in favor of it  well i did wrong then you persuaded me into it id no business to have listened to you and jim and got all this load on my shoulders  yet mary pitkin knew in her own calm clear head that she had not been reckless of expense the yearly interest money was ever before her and her own incessant toils had wrought no small portion of what was needed to pay it her butter at the store commanded the very highest price her straw braiding sold for a little more than that of any other hand and she had calculated all the returns so exactly that she felt sure that the interest money for that year was safe she had seen her husband pass through this nervous crisis many times before and she had learned to be blamed in silence for she was a woman out of whom all selfness had long since died leaving only the tender pity of the nurse and the consoler her soul rested on her saviour the one everpresent inseparable friend and when it did no good to speak to her husband she spoke to her god for him and so was peaceful and peacegiving  even her husband himself felt her strengthening restgiving power and for this reason he bore down on her with the burden of all his tremors and his cares for while he disputed he yet believed her and rested upon her with an utter helpless trust as the good angel of his house had she for a moment given way to apprehension had her step been a thought less firm her eye less peaceful then indeed the world itself would have seemed to be sinking under his feet meanwhile she was to him that kind of relief which we derive from a person to whom we may say everything without a fear of its harming them he felt quite sure that say what he would mary would always be hopeful and courageous and he felt some secret idea that his own gloomy forebodings were of service in restricting and sobering what seemed to him her too sanguine nature he blindly reverenced without ability fully to comprehend her exalted religious fervor and the quietude of soul that it brought but he did not know through how many silent conflicts how many prayers how many tears how many hopes resigned and sorrows welcomed she had come into that last refuge of sorrowful souls that immovable peace when all lifes anguish ceases and the will of god becomes the final rest  but unhappily for this present crisis there was as there often is in family life just enough of the fathers nature in the son to bring them into collision with each other james had the same nervously anxious nature the same intense feeling of responsibility the same tendency towards morbid earnestness and on that day there had come collision  his father had poured forth upon him his fears and apprehensions in a manner which implied a censure on his son as being willing to accept a life of scholarly ease while his father and mother were as he expressed it working their lives away  but i tell you father as god is my witness i mean to pay all you shall not suffer interest and principalall that my work would bringi engage to pay back  youyoull never have anything youll be a poor man as long as you live lost the academy this fallthat tells the story  but father it wasnt my fault that i lost the academy  its no matter whose fault it wasthats neither here nor thereyou lost it and here you are with the vacation before you and nothing to do theres your mother shes working herself to death she never gets any rest i expect shell go off in a consumption one of these days  there there father thats enough please dont say any more youll see i will find something to do  there are words spoken at times in life that do not sound bitter though they come from a pitiable depth of anguish and as james turned from his father he had taken a resolution that convulsed him with pain his strong arms quivered with the repressed agony and he hastily sought a distant part of the field and began cutting and stacking cornstalks with a nervous energy  why ye work like thunder was biahs comment book larnin haint spiled ye yet your arms are good for suthin  yes my arms are good for something and ill use them for something said jim  there was raging a tempest in his soul for a young fellow of a puritan education in those days to be angry with his father was somewhat that seemed to him as awful a sacrilege as to be angry with his god and yet he felt that his father had been bitterly cruelly unjust towards him he had driven economy to the most stringent extremes he had avoided the intimacy of his class fellows lest he should be drawn into needless expenses he had borne with shabby clothing and mean fare among better dressed and richer associates and been willing to bear it he had studied faithfully unremittingly for two years but at the moment he turned from his father the throb that wrung his heart was the giving up of all he had in his pocket a letter from his townsman and schoolmate sam allen mate of an east indiaman just fitting out at salem and it said  we are going to sail with a picked crew and we want one just such a fellow as you for third mate come along and you can go right up and your college mathematics will be all the better for us come right off and your berth will be ready and away for round the world  here to be sure was immediate positionwagesemploymentfreedom from the intolerable burden of dependence but it was accepted at the sacrifice of all his lifes hopes true that in those days the experiment of a seafaring life had often even in instances which he recalled brought forth fortune and an ability to settle down in peaceful competence in after life but there was diana would she wait for him encircled on all sides with lovers would she keep faith with an adventurer gone for an indefinite quest the desponding selfdistrusting side of his nature said no why should she then to go was to give up dianato make up his mind to have her belong to some other then there was his mother an unutterable reverential pathos always to him encircled the idea of his mother her life to him seemed a hard one from the outside as he viewed it it was all selfsacrifice and renunciation yet he knew that she had set her heart on an education for him as much as it could be set on anything earthly he was her pride her hope and just now that very thought was full of bitterness there was no help for it he must not let her work herself to death for him he would make the household vessel lighter by the throwing himself into the sea to sink or swim as might happen and then perhaps he might come back with money to help them all  all this was what was surging and boiling in his mind when he came in from his work to the supper that night    chapter iv   the goodby  diana pitkin was like some of the fruits of her native hills full of juices which tend to sweetness in maturity but which when not quite ripe have a pretty decided dash of sharpness there are grapes that require a frost to ripen them and diana was somewhat akin to these  she was a mettlesome warmblooded creature full of the energy and audacity of youth to whom as yet life was only a frolic and a play spell work never tired her she ate heartily slept peacefully went to bed laughing and got up in a merry humor in the morning dianas laugh was as early a note as the song of birds such a nature is not at first sympathetic it has in it some of the unconscious cruelty which belongs to nature itself whose sunshine never pales at human trouble eyes that have never wept cannot comprehend sorrow moreover a lively girl of eighteen looking at life out of eyes which bewilder others with their brightness does not always see the world truly and is sometimes judged to be heartless when she is only immature  nothing was further from dianas thoughts than that any grave trouble was overhanging her lovers mindfor her lover she very well knew that james was and she had arranged beforehand to herself very pretty little comedies of life to be duly enacted in the long vacation in which james was to appear as the suitor and she not too soon nor with too much eagerness was at last to acknowledge to him how much he was to her but meanwhile he was not to be too presumptuous it was not set down in the cards that she should be too gracious or make his way too easy when therefore he brushed by her hastily on entering the house with a flushed cheek and frowning brow and gave no glance of admiration at the pretty toilet she had found time to make she was slightly indignant she was as ignorant of the pang which went like an arrow through his heart at the sight of her as the bobolink which whirrs and chitters and tweedles over a grave  she turned away and commenced a kittenlike frolic with bill who was always only too happy to second any of her motions and readily promised that after supper she would go with him a walk of half a mile over to a neighbors where was a cornhusking a great golden lamp of a harvest moon was already coming up in the fading flush of the evening sky and she promised herself much amusement in watching the result of her maneuver on james  hell see at any rate that i am not waiting his beck and call next time if he wants my company he can ask for it in season im not going to indulge him in sulks not i these college fellows worry over books till they hurt their digestion and then have the blues and look as if the world was coming to an end and diana went to the lookingglass and rearranged the spray of goldenrod in her hair and nodded at herself defiantly and then turned to help get on the supper  the pitkin folk that night sat down to an ample feast over which the impending thanksgiving shed its hilarity there was not only the inevitable great pewter platter scoured to silver brightness in the center of the table and piled with solid masses of boiled beef pork cabbage and all sorts of vegetables and the equally inevitable smoking loaf of rye and indian bread to accompany the pot of baked pork and beans but there were specimens of all the newlymade thanksgiving pies filling every available space on the table diana set special value on herself as a pie artist and she had taxed her ingenuity this year to invent new varieties which were received with bursts of applause by the boys these sat down to the table in democratic equalitybiah carter and abner with all the sons of the family old and young each eager hungry and noisy and over all with moonlight calmness and steadiness mary pitkin ruled and presided dispensing to each his portion in due season while diana restless and mischievous as a sprite seemed to be possessed with an elfin spirit of drollery venting itself in sundry little tricks and antics which drew ready laughs from the boys and reproving glances from the deacon for the deacon was that night in one of his severest humors as biah carter afterwards remarked of that night you could feel there was thunder in the air somewhere round the deacon had got on about his longest face and when the deacons face is about down to its wust why it would stop a robin singinthere couldnt nothin stan it  tonight the severely cut lines of his face had even more than usual of haggard sternness and the handsome features of james beside him in their fixed gravity presented that singular likeness which often comes out between father and son in seasons of mental emotion diana in vain sought to draw a laugh from her cousin in pouring his homebrewed beer she contrived to spatter him but he wiped it off without a smile and let pass in silence some arrows of raillery that she had directed at his somber face  when they rose from table however he followed her into the pantry  diana will you take a walk with me tonight he said in a voice husky with repressed feeling  tonight why i have just promised bill to go with him over to the husking at the jenkss why dont you go with us were going to have lots of fun she added with an innocent air of not perceiving his gravity  i cant he said besides i wanted to walk with you alone i had something special i wanted to say  bless me how you frighten one you look solemn as a hearse but i promised to go with bill tonight and i suspect another time will do just as well what you have to say will keep i suppose she said mischievously  he turned away quickly  i should really like to know whats the matter with you tonight she added but as she spoke he went upstairs and shut the door  hes cross tonight was dianas comment well hell have to get over his pet i shant mind it  upstairs in his room james began the work of putting up the bundle with which he was to go forth to seek his fortune there stood his books silent and dear witnesses of the world of hope and culture and refined enjoyment he had been meaning to enter he was to know them no more their mute faces seemed to look at him mournfully as parting friends he rapidly made his selection for that night he was to be off in time to reach the vessel before she sailed and he felt even glad to avoid the thanksgiving festivities for which he had so little relish dianas frolicsome gaiety seemed heartbreaking to him on the same principle that the poet sings  how can ye chant ye little birds and i sae weary fu o care  to the heart struck through with its first experiences of real suffering all nature is full of cruelty and the young and lighthearted are a large part of nature  she has no feeling he said to himself well there is one reason the more for my going she wont break her heart for me nobody loves me but mother and its for her sake i must go she mustnt work herself to death for me  and then he sat down in the window to write a note to be given to his mother after he had sailed for he could not trust himself to tell her what he was about to do he knew that she would try to persuade him to stay and he felt fainthearted when he thought of her she would sit up early and late and work for me to the last gasp he thought but father was right it is selfish of me to take it and so he sat trying to fashion his parting note into a tone of cheerfulness  my dear mother he wrote this will come to you when i have set off on a four years voyage round the world father has convinced me that its time for me to be doing something for myself and i couldnt get a school to keepand after all education is got other ways than at college its hard to go because i love home and hard because you will miss me though no one else will but father may rely upon it i will not be a burden on him another day sink or swim i shall never come back till i have enough to do for myself and you too so good bye dear mother i know you will always pray for me and wherever i am i shall try to do just as i think you would want me to do i know your prayers will follow me and i shall always be your affectionate son  psthe boys may have those chestnuts and walnuts in my roomand in my drawer there is a bit of ribbon with a locket on it i was going to give cousin diana perhaps she wont care for it though but if she does she is welcome to itit may put her in mind of old times  and this is all he said with bitterness in his heart as he leaned on the window and looked out at the great yellow moon that was shining so bright as to show the golden hues of the overhanging elm boughs and the scarlet of an adjoining maple  a light ripple of laughter came up from below and a chestnut thrown up struck him on the hand and he saw diana and bill step from out the shadowy porch  theres a chestnut for you mr owl she called gaily if you will stay moping up there come now its a splendid evening wont you come  no thank you i shant be missed was the reply  thats true enough the loss is your own good bye mr philosopher  good bye diana  something in the tone struck strangely through her heart it was the voice of what diana never had felt yetdeep sufferingand she gave a little shiver  what an awfully solemn voice james has sometimes she said and then added with a laugh it would make his fortune as a methodist minister  the sound of the light laugh and little snatches and echoes of gay talk came back like heartless elves to mock jims sorrow  so much for her he said and turned to go and look for his mother    chapter v   mother and son  he knew where he should find her there was a little low workroom adjoining the kitchen that was his mothers sanctum there stood her workbasketthere were always piles and piles of work begun or finished and there also her few books at hand to be glanced into in rare snatches of leisure in her busy life  the old times new england house mother was not a mere unreflective drudge of domestic toil she was a reader and a thinker keenly appreciative in intellectual regions the literature of that day in new england was sparse but whatever there was whether in this country or in england that was noteworthy was matter of keen interest and mrs pitkins small library was very dear to her no nun in a convent under vows of abstinence ever practiced more rigorous selfdenial than she did in the restraints and government of intellectual tastes and desires her son was dear to her as the fulfillment and expression of her unsatisfied craving for knowledge the possessor of those fair fields of thought which duty forbade her to explore  james stood and looked in at the window and saw her sorting and arranging the family mending busy over piles of stockings and shirts while on the table beside her lay her open bible and she was singing to herself in a low sweet undertone one of the favorite minorkeyed melodies of those days  o god our help in ages past   our hope for years to come our shelter from the stormy blast   and our eternal home  an indescribable feeling blended of pity and reverence swelled in his heart as he looked at her and marked the whitening hair the thin worn little hands so busy with their love work and thought of all the bearing and forbearing the waiting the watching the longsuffering that had made up her life for so many years the very look of exquisite calm and resolved strength in her patient eyes and in the gentle lines of her face had something that seemed to him sad and awfulas the purely spiritual always looks to the more animal nature with his blood bounding and tingling in his veins his strong arms pulsating with life and his heart full of a mans vigor and resolve his mothers life seemed to him to be one of weariness and drudgery of constant unceasing selfabnegation calm he knew she was always sustained never faltering but her victory was one which like the spiritual sweetness in the face of the dying had something of sadness for the living heart  he opened the door and came in sat down by her on the floor and laid his head in her lap  mother you never rest you never stop working  oh no she said gaily im just going to stop now i had only a few last things i wanted to get done  mother i cant bear to think of you your life is too hard we all have our amusements our rests our changes your work is never done you are worn out and get no time to read no time for anything but drudgery  dont say drudgery my boywork done for those we love never is drudgery im so happy to have you all around me i never feel it  but mother you are not strong and i dont see how you can hold out to do all you do  well she said simply when my strength is all gone i ask god for more and he always gives it they that wait on the lord shall renew their strength and her hand involuntarily fell on the open bible  yes i know it he said following her hand with his eyeswhile mother he said i want you to give me your bible and take mine i think yours would do me more good  there was a little bright flush and a pleased smile on his mothers face  certainly my boy i will  i see you have marked your favorite places he added it will seem like hearing you speak to read them  with all my heart she added taking up the bible and kissing his forehead as she put it into his hands  there was a struggle in his heart how to say farewell without saying it without letting her know that he was going to leave her he clasped her in his arms and kissed her again and again  mother he said if i ever get into heaven it will be through you  dont say that my sonit must be through a better friend than i am who loves you more than i do i have not died for youhe did  oh that i knew where i might find him then you i can seehim i cannot  his mother looked at him with a face full of radiance pity and hope  i feel sure you will she said you are consecrated she added in a low voice laying her hand on his head  amen said james in a reverential tone he felt that she was at that momentas she often wassilently speaking to one invisible of and for him and the sense of it stole over him like a benediction there was a pause of tender silence for many minutes  well i must not keep you up any longer mother dearits time you were resting goodnight and with a long embrace and kiss they separated he had yet fifteen miles to walk to reach the midnight stage that was to convey him to salem  as he was starting from the house with his bundle in his hand the sound of a gay laugh came through the distant shrubbery it was diana and bill returning from the husking hastily he concealed himself behind a clump of old lilac bushes till they emerged into the moonlight and passed into the house diana was in one of those paroxysms of young girl frolic which are the effervescence of young healthy blood as natural as the gyrations of a bobolink on a clover head james was thinking of dark nights and stormy seas years of exile mothers sorrows home perhaps never to be seen more and the laugh jarred on him like a terrible discord he watched her into the house turned and was gone    chapter vi   gone to sea  a little way on in his moonlight walk jamess ears were saluted by the sound of some one whistling and crackling through the bushes and soon biah carter emerged into the moonlight having been out to the same husking where diana and bill had been enjoying themselves the sight of him resolved a doubt which had been agitating jamess mind the note to his mother which was to explain his absence and the reasons for it was still in his coatpocket and he had designed sending it back by some messenger at the tavern where he took the midnight stage but here was a more trusty party it involved to be sure the necessity of taking biah into his confidence james was well aware that to tell that acute individual the least particle of a story was like starting a gimlet in a pine boardthere was no stop till it had gone through so he told him in brief that a good berth had been offered to him on the eastern star and he meant to take it to relieve his father of the pressure of his education  wal naowyou dont say so was biahs commentary wal yis tis hard sleddin for the deacondrefful hard sleddin wal naow spose youre disappintedshouldnt wonderjes so

trade and well go sheers i think considable of you and i expect youll make it go as fur as anybody  ill try my best you may believe biah said james shaking the hard hand heartily as he turned on his way towards the crossroads tavern  the whole village of maplewood on thanksgiving day morning was possessed of the fact that james pitkin had gone off to sea in the eastern star for biah had felt all the sense of importance which the possession of a startling piece of intelligence gives to one and took occasion to call at the tavern and store on his way up and make the most of his information so that by the time the bell rang for service the news might be said to be everywhere the ministers general custom on thanksgiving day was to get off a political sermon reviewing the state of new england the united states of america and europe asia and africa but it may be doubted if all the affairs of all these continents produced as much sensation among the girls in the singers seat that day as did the news that james pitkin had gone to sea on a four years voyage curious eyes were cast on diana pitkin and many were the whispers and speculations as to the part she might have had in the move and certainly she looked paler and graver than usual and some thought they could detect traces of tears on her cheeks some noticed in the tones of her voice that day as they rose in the soprano a tremor and pathos never remarked beforethe unconscious utterance of a new sense of sorrow awakened in a soul that up to this time had never known a grief  for the letter had fallen on the heads of the pitkin household like a thunderbolt biah came in to breakfast and gave it to mrs pitkin saying that james had handed him that last night on his way over to take the midnight stage to salem where he was going to sail on the eastern star todayno doubt hes off to sea by this time a confused sound of exclamations went up around the table while mrs pitkin pale and calm read the letter and then passed it to her husband without a word the bright fixed color in dianas face had meanwhile been slowly ebbing away till with cheeks and lips pale as ashes she hastily rose and left the table and went to her room a strange new terrible paina sensation like being choked or smothereda rush of mixed emotionsa fearful sense of some inexorable unalterable crisis having come of her girlish follyoverwhelmed her again she remembered the deep tones of his goodby and how she had only mocked at his emotion she sat down and leaned her head on her hands in a tearless confused sorrow  deacon pitkin was at first more shocked and overwhelmed than his wife his yesterdays talk with james had no such serious purpose it had been only the escapevalve for his hypochondriac forebodings of the future and nothing was farther from his thoughts than having it bear fruit in any such decisive movement on the part of his son in fact he secretly was proud of his talents and his scholarship and had set his heart on his going through college and had no more serious purpose in what he said the day before than the general one of making his son feel the difficulties and straits he was put to for him young men were tempted at college to be too expensive he thought and to forget what it cost their parents at home in short the whole thing had been merely the passing off of a paroxysm of hypochondria and he had already begun to be satisfied that he should raise his interest money that year without material difficulty the letter showed him too keenly the depth of the suffering he had inflicted on his son and when he had read it he cast a sort of helpless questioning look on his wife and said after an interval of silence  well mother  there was something quite pathetic in the appealing look and voice  well father she answered in subdued tones all we can do now is to leave it  leave it  those were words often in that womans mouth and they expressed that habit of her life which made her victorious over all troubles that habit of trust in the infinite will that actually could and did leave every accomplished event in his hand without murmur and without conflict  if there was any one thing in her uniformly selfdenied life that had been a personal ambition and a personal desire it had been that her son should have a college education it was the center of her earthly wishes hopes and efforts that wish had been cut off in a moment that hope had sunk under her feet and now only remained to her the task of comforting the undisciplined soul whose unguided utterances had wrought the mischief it was not the first time that wounded by a loving hand in this dark struggle of life she had suppressed the pain of her own hurt that he that had wounded her might the better forgive himself  dear father she said to him when over and over he blamed himself for his yesterdays harsh words to his son dont worry about it now you didnt mean it james is a good boy and hell see it right at last and he is in gods hands and we must leave him there he overrules all  when mrs pitkin turned from her husband she sought diana in her room  oh cousin cousin said the girl throwing herself into her arms is this true is james gone cant we do any thing cant we get him back ive been thinking it over oh if the ship wouldnt sail and id go to salem and beg him to come back on my knees oh if i had only known yesterday oh cousin cousin he wanted to talk with me and i wouldnt hear himoh if i only had i could have persuaded him out of it oh why didnt i know  there there dear child we must accept it just as it is now that it is done dont feel so we must try to look at the good  oh show me that letter said diana and mrs pitkin hoping to tranquilize her gave her jamess note he thinks i dont care for him she said reading it hastily well i dont wonder but i do care i love him better than anybody or anything under the sun and i never will forget him hes a brave noble good man and i shall love him as long as i livei dont care who knows it give me that locket cousin and write to him that i shall wear it to my grave  dear child there is no writing to him  oh dear thats the worst oh that horrid horrid sea its like deathyou dont know where they are and you cant hear from themand a four years voyage oh dear oh dear  dont dear child dont you distress me said mrs pitkin  yes thats just like me said diana wiping her eyes here i am thinking only of myself and you that have had your heart broken are trying to comfort me and trying to comfort cousin silas we have both of us scolded and flouted him away and now you who suffer the most of either of us spend your breath to comfort us its just like you but cousin ill try to be good and comfort you ill try to be a daughter to you you need somebody to think of you for you never think of yourself lets go in his room she said and taking the mother by the hand they crossed to the empty room there was his writingtable there his forsaken books his papers some of his clothes hanging in his closet mrs pitkin opening a drawer took out a locket hung upon a bit of blue ribbon where there were two locks of hair one of which diana recognized as her own and one of jamess she hastily hung it about her neck and concealed it in her bosom laying her hand hard upon it as if she would still the beatings of her heart  it seems like a death she said dont you think the ocean is like deathwide dark stormy unknown we cannot speak to or hear from them that are on it  but people can and do come back from the sea said the mother soothingly i trust in gods own time we shall see james back  but what if we never should oh cousin i cant help thinking of that there was michael davisyou knowthe ship was never heard from  well said the mother after a moments pause and a choking down of some rising emotion and turning to a table on which lay a bible she opened and read if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me  the thee in this psalm was not to her a name a shadow a cipher to designate the unknowableit stood for the inseparable heartfriendthe father seeing in secret on whose bosom all her tears of sorrow had been shed the comforter and guide forever dwelling in her soul and giving peace where the world gave only trouble  diana beheld her face as it had been the face of an angel she kissed her and turned away in silence    chapter vii   thanksgiving again  seven years had passed and once more the thanksgiving tide was in mapleton this year it had come cold and frosty chill driving autumn storms had stripped the painted glories from the trees and remorseless frosts had chased the hardy ranks of the asters and goldenrods back and back till scarce a blossom could be found in the deepest and most sequestered spots the great elm over the pitkin farmhouse had been stripped of its golden glory and now rose against the yellow evening sky with its infinite delicacies of net work and tracery in their way quite as beautiful as the full pomp of summer foliage the air without was keen and frosty and the knotted twigs of the branches knocked against the roof and rattled and ticked against the upper window panes as the chill evening wind swept through them  seven long years had passed since james sailed years of watching of waiting of cheerful patience at first and at last of resigned sorrow once they heard from james at the first port where the ship stopped it was a letter dear to his mothers heart manly resigned and christian expressing full purpose to work with god in whatever calling he should labor and cheerful hopes of the future then came a long long silence and then tidings that the eastern star had been wrecked on a reef in the indian ocean the mother had given back her treasure into the same beloved hands whence she first received him i gave him to god and god took him she said i shall have him again in gods time this was how she settled the whole matter with herself diana had mourned with all the vehement intensity of her being but out of the deep baptism of sorrow she had emerged with a new and nobler nature the vain trifling laughing undine had received a soul and was a true woman she devoted herself to jamess mother with an utter selfsacrificing devotion resolved as far as in her lay to be both son and daughter to her she read and studied and fitted herself as a teacher in a neighboring academy and persisted in claiming the right of a daughter to place all the amount of her earnings in the family purse  and this year there was special need with all his care with all his hard work and that of his family deacon silas never had been able to raise money to annihilate the debt upon the farm  there seemed to be a perfect fatality about it let them all make what exertions they might just as they were hoping for a sum that should exceed the interest and begin the work of settling the principal would come some loss that would throw them all back one year their barn was burned just as they had housed their hay on another a valuable horse died and then there were fits of sickness among the children and poor crops in the field and low prices in the market in short as biah remarked the deacons luck did seem to be a sort o streaky for do what you might theres always suthin to put him back as the younger boys grew up the deacon had ceased to hire help and biah had transferred his services to squire jones a rich landholder in the neighborhood who wanted some one to overlook his place the increased wages had enabled him to give a home to maria jane and a start in life to two or three sturdy little american citizens who played around his house door nevertheless biah never lost sight of the deacons folks in his multifarious cares and never missed an opportunity either of doing them a good turn or of picking up any stray item of domestic news as to how matters were going on in that interior he had privately broached the theory to miss briskett that arter all it was james that diany he always pronounced all names as if they ended in y was sot on and that she took it so hard his goin off that it did beat all seemed to make another gal of her he shouldnt wonder if shed come out and jine the church and diana not long after unconsciously fulfilled biahs predictions  of late biahs good offices had been in special requisition as the deacon had been for nearly a month on a sick bed with one of those interminable attacks of typhus fever which used to prevail in old times when the doctor did everything he could to make it certain that a man once brought down with sickness never should rise again  but silas pitkin had a constitution derived through an indefinite distance from a temperate hardworking godly ancestry and so withstood both death and the doctor and was alive and in a convalescent state which gave hope of his being able to carve the turkey at his thanksgiving dinner  the evening sunlight was just fading out of the little keepingroom adjoining the bedroom where the convalescent now was able to sit up most of the day a cot bed had been placed there designed for him to lie down upon in intervals of fatigue at present however he was sitting in his armchair complacently watching the blaze of the hickory fire or following placidly the motions of his wifes knittingneedles  there was an air of calmness and repose on his thin worn features that never was there in days of old the haggard anxious lines had been smoothed away and that spiritual expression which sickness and sorrow sometimes develops on the human face reigned in its place it was the clear shining after rain  wife he said read me something i cant quite remember out of the bible its in the eighth of deuteronomy the second verse  mrs pitkin opened the big family bible on the stand and read and thou shalt remember all the way in which the lord thy god hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee and to know what is in thy heart and whether thou wouldst keep his commandments or no and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live  there thats it interrupted the deacon thats what ive been thinking of as ive lain here sick and helpless ive fought hard to keep things straight and clear the farm but its pleased the lord to bring me low ive had to lie still and leave all in his hands  and where better could you leave all said his wife with a radiant smile  well just so ive been saying here i am lord do with me as seemeth to thee good and i feel a great quiet now i think its doubtful if we make up the interest this year i dont know what bill may get for the hay but i dont see much prospect of raisin ont and yet i dont worry even if its the lords will to have the place sold up and we be turned out in our old age i dont seem to worry about it his will be done  there was a sound of rattling wheels at this moment and anon there came a brush and flutter of garments and diana rushed in all breezy with the freshness of outdoor air and caught mrs pitkin in her arms and kissed her first and then the deacon with effusion  here i come for thanksgiving she said in a rich clear tone and here she added drawing a roll of bills from her bosom and putting it into the deacons hand heres the interest money for this year i got it all myself because i wanted to show you i could be good for something  thank you dear daughter said mrs pitkin i felt sure some way would be found and now i see what she added kissing diana and patting her rosy cheek a very pleasant pretty way it is too  i was afraid that uncle silas would worry and put himself back again about the interest money said diana  well daughter said the deacon its a pity we should go through all we do in this world and not learn anything by it i hope the lord has taught me not to worry but just do my best and leave myself and everything else in his hands we cant help ourselveswe cant make one hair white or black why should we wear our lives out fretting if id a known that years ago it would a been better for us all  never mind father you know it now said his wife with a face serene as a star in this last gift of quietude of soul to her husband she recognized the answer to her prayers of years  well now said diana running to the window i should like to know what biah carter is coming here about  oh biahs been very kind to us in this sickness said mrs pitkin as biahs feet resounded on the scraper  good evenin deacon said biah entering good evenin mrs pitkin sarvant maam to dianahow ye all gettin on  nicely biahwell as can be said mrs pitkin  wal you see i was up to the store with some o squire joness bell flowers sim coan he said he wanted some to sell and so i took up a couple o barrels and i see the darndest big letter there for the deacon miss briskett she was in lookin at it and so was deacon simsons wife she come in arter some cinnamon sticks wal and they all looked at it and talked it over and couldnt none o em for their lives think what its all about it was sich an almighty thick letter said biah drawing out a long legallooking envelope and putting it in the deacons hands  i hope there isnt bad news in it said silas pitkin the color flushing apprehensively in his pale cheeks as he felt for his spectacles  there was an agitated silent pause while he broke the seals and took out two documents one was the mortgage on his farm and the other a receipt in full for the money owed on it the deacon turned the papers to and fro gazed on them with a dazed uncertain air and then said  why mother do look is this so do i read it right  certainly you do said diana reading over his shoulder somebodys paid that debt uncle  thank god said mrs pitkin softly he has done it  wal i swow said biah after having turned the paper in his hands if this ere dont beat all theres old squire norcrosss name ont its the receipt full and square whats come over the old crittur he must a got religion in his old age but if grace made him do that grace has done a tough job thats all but its done anyhow and thats all you need to care about wal wal i must git along hummariar janell be wonderin where i be good night all on ye and biahs retreating wagon wheels were off in the distance rattling furiously for notwithstanding maria janes wondering biah was resolved not to let an hour slip by without declaring the wonderful tidings at the store  the pitkin family were seated at supper in the big kitchen all jubilant over the recent news the father radiant with the pleasantest excitement had for the first time come out to take his place at the family board in the seven years since the beginning of our story the pitkin boys had been growing apace and now surrounded the table quite an army of rosycheeked jolly young fellows who tonight were in a perfect tumult of animal gaiety diana twinkled and dimpled and flung her sparkles round among them and there was unbounded jollity  whos that looking in at the window called out sam aged ten who sat opposite the house door at that moment the door opened and a dark stranger bronzed with travel and dressed in foreignlooking garments entered  he stood one moment all looking curiously at him then crossing the floor he kneeled down by mrs pitkins chair and throwing off his cap looked her close in the eyes  mother dont you know me  she looked at him one moment with that still earnestness peculiar to herself and then fell into his arms o my son my son  there were a few moments of indescribable confusion during which diana retreated pale and breathless to a neighboring window and stood with her hand over the locket which she had always worn upon her heart  after a few moments he came and she felt him by her  what cousin he said no welcome from you she gave one look and he took her in his arms she felt the beating of his heart and he felt hers neither spoke yet each felt at that moment sure of the other  i say boys said james wholl help bring in my sea chest  never was sea chest more triumphantly ushered it was a contest who should get near enough to take some part in its introduction and soon it was open and james began distributing its contents  there mother said he undoing a heavy black india satin and shaking out its folds im determined you shall have a dress fit for you and heres a real india shawl to go with it get those on and youll look as much like a queen among women as you ought to  then followed something for every member of the family received with frantic demonstrations of applause and appreciation by the more juvenile  oh whats that said sam as a package done up in silk paper and tied with silver cord was disclosed  thatsohthats my wifes weddingdress said james unfolding and shaking out a rich satin and heres her shawl drawing out an embroidered box scented with sandalwood  the boys all looked at diana and diana laughed and grew pale and red all in the same breath as james folding back the silk and shawl in their boxes handed them to her  mrs pitkin laughed and kissed her and said gaily all right my daughterjust right  what an evening that was to be sure what a confusion of joy and gladness what a halftelling of a hundred things that it would take weeks to tell  james had paid the mortgage and had money to spare and how he got it all and how he was saved at sea and where he went and what befell him here and there he promised to be telling them for six months to come  well your father mustnt be kept up too late said mrs pitkin lets have prayers now and then tomorrow well be fresh to talk more  so they gathered around the wide kitchen fire and the family bible was brought out  father said james drawing out of his pocket the bible his mother had given him at parting let me read my psalm it has been my psalm ever since i left you there was a solemn thrill in the little circle as james read the verses  they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereof they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired haven oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men                                       when all had left the old kitchen james and diana sat by the yet glowing hearth and listened to the crickets and talked over all the past and the future  and now said james its seven years since i left you and tomorrow is the seventh thanksgiving and ive always set my heart on getting home to be married thanksgiving evening  but dear me jim we cant there isnt time  why notweve got all the time there is  but the weddingdress cant be made possibly  oh that can wait till the week after you are pretty enough without it  but what will they all say  who cares what they say i dont said james the fact is ive set my heart on it and you owe me something for the way you treated me the last thanksgiving i was here seven years ago now dont you  well yes i do so have it just as you will and so it was accomplished the next evening  and among the wonders of mapleton miss briskett announced it as chief that it was the first time she ever heard of a bride that was married first and had her weddingdress made the week after she never had heard of such a thing  yet strange to say for years after neither of the parties concerned found themselves a bit the worse for it      the first christmas of new england   the shores of the atlantic coast of america may well be a terror to navigators they present an inexorable wall against which forbidding and angry waves incessantly dash and around which shifting winds continually rave the approaches to safe harbors are few in number intricate and difficult requiring the skill of practiced pilots  but as if with a pitying spirit of hospitality old cape cod breaking from the iron line of the coast like a generoushearted sailor intent on helpfulness stretches an hundred miles outward and curving his sheltering arms in a protective circle gives a noble harborage of this harbor of cape cod the report of our governmental coast survey thus speaks it is one of the finest harbors for ships of war on the whole of our atlantic coast the width and freedom from obstruction of every kind at its entrance and the extent of sea room upon the bay side make it accessible to vessels of the largest class in almost all winds this advantage its capacity depth of water excellent anchorage and the complete shelter it affords from all winds render it one of the most valuable ship harbors upon our coast  we have been thus particular in our mention of this place because here in this harbor opened the first scene in the most wonderful drama of modern history  let us look into the magic mirror of the past and see this harbor of cape cod on the morning of the 11th of november in the year of our lord 1620 as described to us in the simple words of the pilgrims a pleasant bay circled round except the entrance which is about four miles over from land to land compassed about to the very sea with oaks pines junipers sassafras and other sweet weeds it is a harbor wherein a thousand sail of ship may safely ride  such are the woody shores of cape cod as we look back upon them in that distant november day and the harbor lies like a great crystal gem on the bosom of a virgin wilderness the fir trees the pine trees and the bay rejoice together in freedom for as yet the axe has spared them in the noble bay no shipping has found shelter no voice or sound of civilized man has broken the sweet calm of the forest the oak leaves now turned to crimson and maroon by the autumn frosts reflect themselves in flushes of color on the still waters the golden leaves of the sassafras yet cling to the branches though their life has passed and every brushing wind bears showers of them down to the water here and there the dark spires of the cedar and the green leaves and red berries of the holly contrast with these lighter tints the forest foliage grows down to the waters edge so that the dash of the rising and falling tide washes into the shaggy cedar boughs which here and there lean over and dip in the waves  no voice or sound from earth or sky proclaims that anything unwonted is coming or doing on these shores today the wandering indians moving their huntingcamps along the woodland paths saw no sign in the stars that morning and no different color in the sunrise from what had been in the days of their fathers panther and wildcat under their furry coats felt no thrill of coming dispossession and saw nothing through their great golden eyes but the dawning of a day just like all other dayswhen the sun ariseth and they gather themselves into their dens and lay them down and yet alike to indian panther and wildcat to every oak of the forest to every foot of land in america from the stormy atlantic to the broad pacific that day was a day of days  there had been stormy and windy weather but now dawned on the earth one of those still golden times of november full of dreamy rest and tender calm the skies above were blue and fair and the waters of the curving bay were a downward skya magical underworld wherein the crimson oaks and the dusk plumage of the pine and the red hollyberries and yellow sassafras leaves all flickered and glinted in wavering bands of color as soft winds swayed the glassy floor of waters  in a moment there is heard in the silent bay a sound of a rush and ripple different from the lap of the manytongued waves on the shore and silently as a cloud with white wings spread a little vessel glides into the harbor  a little craft is shenot larger than the fishingsmacks that ply their course along our coasts in summer but her decks are crowded with men women and children looking out with joyous curiosity on the beautiful bay where after many dangers and storms they first have found safe shelter and hopeful harbor  that small unknown ship was the mayflower those men and women who crowded her decks were that little handful of gods own wheat which had been flailed by adversity tossed and winnowed till every husk of earthly selfishness and selfwill had been beaten away from them and left only pure seed fit for the planting of a new world it was old master cotton mather who said of them the lord sifted three countries to find seed wherewith to plant america  hark now to the hearty cry of the sailors as with a plash and a cheer the anchor goes down just in the deep water inside of long point and then says their journal being now passed the vast ocean and sea of troubles before their preparation unto further proceedings as to seek out a place for habitation they fell down on their knees and blessed the lord the god of heaven who had brought them over the vast and furious ocean and delivered them from all perils and miseries thereof  let us draw nigh and mingle with this singular act of worship elder brewster with his wellworn geneva bible in hand leads the thanksgiving in words which though thousands of years old seem as if written for the occasion of that hour  praise the lord because he is good for his mercy endureth forever let them which have been redeemed of the lord show how he delivereth them from the hand of the oppressor and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west from the north and from the south when they wandered in deserts and wildernesses out of the way and found no city to dwell in both hungry and thirsty their soul failed in them then they cried unto the lord in their troubles and he delivered them in their distresses and led them forth by the right way that they might go unto a city of habitation they that go down to the sea and occupy by the great waters they see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind and it lifteth up the waves thereof they mount up to heaven and descend to the deep so that their soul melteth for trouble they are tossed to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and all their cunning is gone then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses he turneth the storm to a calm so that the waves thereof are still when they are quieted they are glad and he bringeth them unto the haven where they would be  as yet the treasures of sacred song which are the liturgy of modern christians had not arisen in the church there was no watts and no wesley in the days of the pilgrims they brought with them in each family as the most precious of household possessions a thick volume containing first the book of common prayer with the psalter appointed to be read in churches second the whole bible in the geneva translation which was the basis on which our present english translation was made and third the psalms of david in meter by sternhold and hopkins with the music notes of the tunes adapted to singing therefore it was that our little band were able to lift up their voices together in song and that the noble tones of old hundred for the first time floated over the silent bay and mingled with the sound of winds and waters consecrating our american shores  all people that on earth do dwell   sing to the lord with cheerful voice him serve with fear his praise forthtell   come ye before him and rejoice  the lord ye know is god indeed   without our aid he did us make we are his flock he doth us feed   and for his sheep he doth us take  o enter then his gates with praise   approach with joy his courts unto praise laud and bless his name always   for it is seemly so to do  for why the lord our god is good   his mercy is forever sure his truth at all times firmly stood   and shall from age to age endure  this grand hymn rose and swelled and vibrated in the still november air while in between the pauses came the warble of birds the scream of the jay the hoarse call of hawk and eagle going on with their forest ways all unmindful of the new era which had been ushered in with those solemn sounds    chapter ii   the first day on shore  the sound of prayer and psalmsinging died away on the shore and the little band rising from their knees saluted each other in that genial humor which always possesses a ships company when they have weathered the ocean and come to land together  well master jones here we are said elder brewster cheerily to the shipmaster  aye aye sir here we be sure enough but ive had many a shrewd doubt of this upshot i tell you sirs when that beam amidships sprung and cracked master coppin here said we must give overhands couldnt bring her through thou rememberest master coppin  that i do replied master coppin the first mate a stocky cheery sailor with a face red and shining as a glazed bun i said then that praying might save her perhaps but nothing else would  praying wouldnt have saved her said master brown the carpenter if i had not put in that screw and worked the beam to her place again  aye aye master carpenter said elder brewster the lord hath abundance of the needful ever to his hand when he wills to answer prayer there will be found both carpenter and screws in their season i trow  well deb said master coppin pinching the ear of a great mastiff bitch who sat by him what sayest thou give us thy mind on it old girl say wilt thou go deerhunting with us yonder  the dog who was full of the excitement of all around wagged her tail and gave three tremendous barks whereat a little spaniel with curly ears that stood by rose standish barked aloud  well done said captain miles standish why here is a salute of ordnance old deb is in the spirit of the thing and opens out like a cannon the old girl is spoiling for a chase in those woods  father may i go ashore i want to see the country said wrestling brewster a bright sturdy boy creeping up to elder brewster and touching his fathers elbow  thereat there was a crying to the different mothers of girls and boys tired of being cooped upoh mother mother ask that we may all go ashore  for my part said old margery the servingmaid to elder brewster i want to go ashore to wash and be decent for there isnt a soul of us hath anything fit for christians there be springs of water i trow  never doubt it my woman said elder brewster but all things in their order how say you mr carver you are our governor what order shall we take  we must have up the shallop said carver and send a picked company to see what entertainment there may be for us on shore  and i counsel that all go well armed quoth captain miles standish for these men of the forest are sharper than a thornhedge what what he said looking over to the eager group of girls and boys ye would go ashore would ye why the lions and bears will make one mouthful of ye  im not afraid of lions said young wrestling brewster in an aside to little love winslow a goldenhaired palecheeked child of a tender and spiritual beauty of face id like to meet a lion he added and serve him as samson did id get honey out of him i promise  oh there you are young master boastful said old margery mind the old saying brag is a good dog but holdfast is better  dear husband said rose standish wilt thou go ashore in this company  why aye sweetheart what else am i come forand who should go if not i  thou art so very venturesome miles  even so my rose of the wilderness why else am i come on this quest not being good enough to be in your church nor one of the saints i come for an arm of flesh to them and so here goes on my armor  and as he spoke he buried his frank goodnatured countenance in an iron headpiece and rose hastened to help him adjust his corselet  the clang of armor the bustle and motion of men and children the barking of dogs and the cheery heaveo of the sailors marked the setting off of the party which comprised some of the gravest and wisest as well as the youngest and most ablebodied of the ships company the impatient children ran in a group and clustered on the side of the ship to see them go old deb with her two halfgrown pups barked and yelped after her master in the boat running up and down the vessels deck with piteous cries of impatience  come hither dear old deb said little love winslow running up and throwing her arms round the dogs rough neck thou must not take on so thy master will be back again so be a good dog now and lie down  and the great rough mastiff quieted down under her caresses and sitting down by her she patted and played with her with her little thin hands  see the darling said rose standish what away that baby hath in all the roughness and the terrors of the sea she hath been like a little sunbeam to usyet she is so frail  she hath been marked in the womb by the troubles her mother bore said old margery shaking her head she never had the ways of other babies but hath ever that wistful lookand her eyes are brighter than they should be mistress winslow will never raise that childnow mark me  take care said rose let not her mother hear you  why look at her beside of wrestling brewster or faith carver they are flesh and blood and she looks as if she had been made out of sunshine tis a sweet babe as ever was but fitter for the kingdom of heaven than our rough lifedeary me a hard time we have had of it i suppose its all best but i dont know  oh never talk that way margery said rose standish we must all keep up heart our own and one anothers  ah well a dayi suppose so but then i look at my good master brewster and remember how when i was a girl he was at our good queen elizabeths court ruffling it with the best and everybody said that there wasnt a young man that had good fortune to equal his why master davidson the queens secretary of state thought all the world of him and when he went to holland on the queens business he must take him along and when he took the keys of the cities there it was my master that he trusted them to who used to sleep with them under his pillow i remember when he came home to the queens court wearing the great gold chain that the states had given him ah me i little thought he would ever come to a poor mans coat then  well good margery said rose it isnt the coat but the heart under itthats the thing thou hast more cause of pride in thy masters poverty than in his riches  maybe soi dont know said margery but he hath had many a sore trouble in worldly thingsdriven and hunted from place to place in england clapt into prison and all he had eaten up with fines and charges and costs  all that is because he chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season said rose he shall have his reward by and by  well there be good men and godly in old england that get to heaven in better coats and with easy carriages and fine houses and servants and i would my master had been of such but if he must come to the wilderness i will come with him gracious me what noise is that she exclaimed as a sudden report of firearms from below struck her ear i do believe there is that frank billington at the gunpowder that boy will never leave i do believe till he hath blown up the ships company  in fact it appeared that young master frank impatient of the absence of his father had toled wrestling brewster and two other of the boys down into the cabin to show them his skill in managing his fathers fowling piece had burst the gun scattering the pieces about the cabin  margery soon appeared dragging the culprit after her look here now master malapert see what youll get when your father comes home lord a mercy here was half a keg of powder standing open enough to have blown us all up here master clarke master clarke come and keep this boy with you till his father come back or we be all sent sky high before we know                                at even tide the boat came back laden to the waters edge with the first gettings and givings from the new soil of america there is a richness and sweetness gleaming through the brief records of these men in their journals which shows how the new land was seen through a fond and tender medium half poetic and its new products lend a savor to them of somewhat foreign and rare  of this days expedition the record is thus  that day so soon as we could we set ashore some fifteen or sixteen men well armed with some to fetch wood for we had none left as also to see what the land was and what inhabitants they could meet with they found it to be a small neck of land on this side where we lay in the bay and on the further side the sea the ground or earth sandhills much like the downs in holland but much better the crust of the earth a spits depth of excellent black earth all wooded with oaks pines sassafras juniper birch holly vines some ash and walnut the wood for the most part open and without underwood fit either to walk or to ride in at night our people returned and found not any people or inhabitants and laded their boat with juniper which smelled very sweet and strong and of which we burned for the most part while we were there  see there said little love winslow what fine red berries captain miles standish hath brought  yea my little maid there is a brave lot of holly berries for thee to dress the cabin withal we shall not want for christmas greens here though the houses and churches are yet to come  yea brother miles said elder brewster the trees of the lord are full of sap in this land even the cedars of lebanon which he hath planted it hath the look to me of a land which the lord our god hath blessed  there is a most excellent depth of black rich earth said carver and a great tangle of grapevines whereon the leaves in many places yet hung and we picked up stores of walnuts under a treenot so big as our english onesbut sweet and wellflavored  know ye brethren what in this land smelleth sweetest to me said elder brewster it is the smell of liberty the soil is freeno man hath claim thereon in old england a poor man may starve right on his mothers bosom there may be stores of fish in the river and bird and fowl flying and deer running by and yet though a mans children be crying for bread an he catch a fish or snare a bird he shall be snatched up and hanged this is a sore evil in old england but we will make a country here for the poor to dwell in where the wild fruits and fish and fowl shall be the inheritance of whosoever will have them and every man shall have his portion of our good mother earth with no lords and no bishops to harry and distrain and worry with taxes and tythes  amen brother said miles standish and thereto i give my best endeavors with sword and buckler    chapter iii   christmas tide in plymouth harbor  for the rest of that month of november the mayflower lay at anchor in cape cod harbor and formed a floating home for the women and children while the men were out exploring the country with a careful and steady shrewdness and good sense to determine where should be the site of the future colony the record of their adventures is given in their journals with that sweet homeliness of phrase which hangs about the old english of that period like the smell of rosemary in an ancient cabinet  we are told of a sort of picnic day when our women went on shore to wash and all to refresh themselves and fancy the times there must have been among the little company while the mothers sorted and washed and dried the linen and the children under the keeping of the old mastiffs and with many cautions against the wolves and wild cubs once more had liberty to play in the green wood for it appears in these journals how in one case the little spaniel of john goodman was chased by two wolves and was fain to take refuge between his masters legs for shelter goodman had nothing in hand says the journal but took up a stick and threw at one of them and hit him and they presently ran away but came again he got a paleboard in his hand but they both sat on their tails a good while grinning at him and then went their way and left him  such little touches show what the care of families must have been in the woodland picnics and why the ship was on the whole the safest refuge for the women and children  we are told moreover how the party who had struck off into the wilderness having marched through boughs and bushes and under hills and valleys which tore our very armor in pieces yet could meet with no inhabitants nor find any fresh water which we greatly stood in need of for we brought neither beer nor water with us and our victual was only biscuit and holland cheese and a little bottle of aqua vitae so we were sore athirst about ten oclock we came into a deep valley full of brush sweet gaile and long grass through which we found little paths or tracks and we saw there a deer and found springs of water of which we were heartily glad and sat us down and drunk our first new england water with as much delight as we ever drunk drink in all our lives  three such expeditions through the country with all sorts of haps and mishaps and adventures took up the time until near the 15th of december when having selected a spot for their colony they weighed anchor to go to their future home  plymouth harbor as they found it is thus described  this harbor is a bay greater than cape cod compassed with a goodly land and in the bay two fine islands uninhabited wherein are nothing but woods oaks pines walnuts beeches sassafras vines and other trees which we know not the bay is a most hopeful place innumerable stores of fowl and excellent good and it cannot but be of fish in their season skate cod and turbot and herring we have tasted ofabundance of mussels clams the best we ever saw and crabs and lobsters in their time infinite  on the main land they write  the land is for a spits depth excellent black mould and fat in some places two or three great oaks pines walnut beech ash birch hazel holly and sassafras in abundance and vines everywhere with cherry trees plumtrees and others which we know not many kind of herbs we found here in winter as strawberry leaves innumerable sorrel yarrow carvel brooklime liverwort watercresses with great store of leeks and onions and an excellent strong kind of flax and hemp  it is evident from this description that the season was a mild one even thus late into december that there was still sufficient foliage hanging upon the trees to determine the species and that the pilgrims viewed their new motherland through eyes of cheerful hope  and now let us look in the glass at them once more on saturday morning of the 23d of december  the little mayflower lies swinging at her moorings in the harbor while every man and boy who could use a tool has gone on shore to cut down and prepare timber for future houses  mary winslow and rose standish are sitting together on deck fashioning garments while little love winslow is playing at their feet with such toys as the new world afforded herstrings of acorns and scarlet holly berries and some birdclaws and arrowheads and brightcolored ears of indian corn which captain miles standish has brought home to her from one of their explorations  through the still autumnal air may now and then be heard the voices of men calling to one another on shore the quick sharp ring of axes and anon the crash of falling trees with shouts from juveniles as the great forest monarch is laid low some of the women are busy below sorting over and arranging their little household stores and stuff with a view to moving on shore and holding domestic consultations with each other  a sadness hangs over the little company for since their arrival the stroke of death has more than once fallen we find in bradfords brief record that by the 24th of december six had died  what came nearest to the hearts of all was the loss of dorothea bradford who when all the men of the party were absent on an exploring tour accidentally fell over the side of the vessel and sunk in the deep waters what this loss was to the husband and the little company of brothers and sisters appears by no note or word of wailing merely by a simple entry which says no more than the record on a gravestone that on the 7th of december dorothy wife of william bradford fell over and was drowned  that muchenduring company could afford themselves few tears earthly having and enjoying was a thing long since dismissed from their calculations they were living on the primitive christian platform they rejoiced as though they rejoiced not and they wept as though they wept not and they had wives and children as though they had them not or as one of themselves expressed it we are in all places strangers pilgrims travelers and sojourners our dwelling is but a wandering our abiding but as a fleeting our home is nowhere but in the heavens in that house not made with hands whose builder and maker is god  when one of their number fell they were forced to do as soldiers in the stress of battleclose up the ranks and press on  but mary winslow as she sat over her sewing dropped now and then a tear down on her work for the loss of her sister and counselor and longtried friend from the lower part of the ship floated up at intervals snatches of an old english ditty that margery was singing while she moved to and fro about her work one of those genuine english melodies full of a rich strange mournfulness blent with a soothing pathos  fear no more the heat o the sun   nor the furious winter rages thou thy worldly task hast done   home art gone and taen thy wages  the air was familiar and mary winslow dropping her work in her lap involuntarily joined in it  fear no more the frown of the great   thou art past the tyrants stroke care no more to clothe and eat   to thee the reed is as the oak  there goes a great tree on shore quoth little love winslow clapping her hands dost hear mother ive been counting the strokesfifteen and then crackle crackle crackle and down it comes  peace darling said mary winslow hear what old margery is singing below  fear no more the lightnings flash   nor the alldreaded thunder stone fear not slander censure rash   thou hast finished joy and moan all lovers youngall lovers must   consign to thee and come to dust  why do you cry mother said the little one climbing on her lap and wiping her tears  i was thinking of dear auntie who is gone from us  she is not gone from us mother  my darling she is with jesus  well mother jesus is ever with usyou tell me thatand if she is with him she is with us tooi know she isfor sometimes i see her she sat by me last night and stroked my head when that ugly stormy wind waked meshe looked so sweet oh ever so beautifuland she made me go to sleep so quietit is sweet to be as she is mothernot away from us but with jesus  these little ones see further in the kingdom than we said rose standish if we would be like them we should take things easier when the lord would show who was greatest in his kingdom he took a little child on his lap  ah me rose said mary winslow i am aweary in spirit with this tossing sealife i long to have a home on dry land once more be it ever so poor the sea wearies me only think it is almost christmas time only two days now to christmas how shall we keep it in these woods  aye aye said old margery coming up at the moment a brave muster and to do is there now in old england and men and boys going forth singing and bearing home branches of holly and pine and mistletoe for christmas greens oh i remember i used to go forth with them and help dress the churches god help the poor children they will grow up in the wilderness and never see such brave sights as i have they will never know what a church is such as they are in old england with fine old windows like the clouds and rainbows and great wonderful arches like the very skies above us and the brave music with the old organs rolling and the boys marching in white garments and singing so as should draw the very heart out of one all this we have left behind in old englandah well a day well a day  oh but margery said mary winslow we have a better country than old england where the saints and angels are keeping christmas we confess that we are strangers and pilgrims on earth  and rose standish immediately added the familiar quotation from the geneva bible  for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country for if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they had leisure to have returned but now they desire a betterthat is an heavenly wherefore god is not ashamed of them to be called their god  the fair young face glowed as she repeated the heroic words for already though she knew it not rose standish was feeling the approaching sphere of the angel life strong in spirit as delicate in frame she had given herself and drawn her martial husband to the support of a great and noble cause but while the spirit was ready the flesh was weak and even at that moment her name was written in the lambs book to enter the higher life in one short months time from that christmas  only one month of sweetness and perfume was that sweet rose to shed over the hard and troubled life of the pilgrims for the saints and angels loved her and were from day to day gently untying mortal bands to draw her to themselves yet was there nothing about her of mournfulness on the contrary she was ever alert and bright with a ready tongue to cheer and a helpful hand to do and seeing the sadness that seemed stealing over mary winslow she struck another key and catching little love up in her arms said cheerily  come hither pretty one and rose will sing thee a brave carol for christmas we wont be downhearted will we hark now to what the minstrels used to sing under my window when i was a little girl  i saw three ships come sailing in on christmas day on christmas day i saw three ships come sailing in on christmas day in the morning  and what was in those ships all three on christmas day on christmas day and what was in those ships all three on christmas day in the morning  our saviour christ and his laydie on christmas day on christmas day our saviour christ and his laydie on christmas day in the morning  pray whither sailed those ships all three on christmas day on christmas day oh they sailed into bethlehem on christmas day in the morning  and all the bells on earth shall ring on christmas day on christmas day and all the angels in heaven shall sing on christmas day in the morning  then let us all rejoice amain on christmas day on christmas day then let us all rejoice amain on christmas day in the morning  now isnt that a brave ballad said rose yea and thou singest like a real english robin said margery to do the heart good to hear thee    chapter iv   elder brewsters christmas sermon  sunday morning found the little company gathered once more on the ship with nothing to do but rest and remember their homes temporal and spiritualhomes backward in old england and forward in heaven they were every man and woman of them english to the backbone from captain jones who commanded the ship to elder brewster who ruled and guided in spiritual affairs all alike were of that stock and breeding which made the englishman of the days of bacon and shakespeare and in those days christmas was knit into the heart of every one of them by a thousand threads which no after years could untie  christmas carols had been sung to them by nurses and mothers and grandmothers the christmas holly spoke to them from every berry and prickly leaf full of dearest household memories some of them had been men of substance among the english gentry and in their prosperous days had held high festival in ancestral halls in the season of good cheer elder brewster himself had been a rising young diplomat in the court of elizabeth in the days when the lord keeper of the seals led the revels of christmas as lord of misrule  so that though this sunday morning arose gray and lowering with snow flakes hovering through the air there was christmas in the thoughts of every man and woman among themalbeit it was the christmas of wanderers and exiles in a wilderness looking back to bright homefires across stormy waters  the men had come back from their work on shore with branches of green pine and holly and the women had stuck them about the ship not without tearful thoughts of old homeplaces where their childhood fathers and mothers did the same  bits and snatches of christmas carols were floating all around the ship like landbirds blown far out to sea in the forecastle master coppin was singing  come bring with a noise  my merry boys    the christmas log to the firing  while my good dame she  bids ye all be free    and drink to your hearts desiring  drink now the strong beer  cut the white loaf here    the while the meat is shredding  for the rare minced pie  and the plums stand by    to fill the paste thats akneading  ah welladay master jones it is dull cheer to sing christmas songs here in the woods with only the owls and the bears for choristers i wish i could hear the bells of merry england once more  and down in the cabin rose standish was hushing little peregrine the first americanborn baby with a christmas lullaby  this winters night i saw a sight   a star as bright as day and ever among a maiden sung   lullay byby lullay  this lovely laydie sat and sung   and to her child she said my son my brother and my father dear   why lyest thou thus in hayd my sweet bird tho it betide   thou be not king veray but nevertheless i will not cease   to sing byby lullay  the child then spake in his talking   and to his mother he said it happeneth mother i am a king   in crib though i be laid for angels bright did down alight   thou knowest it is no nay and of that sight thou mayst be light   to sing byby lullay  now sweet son since thou art a king   why art thou laid in stall why not ordain thy bedding   in some great king his hall we thinketh tis right that king or knight   should be in good array and them among it were no wrong   to sing byby lullay  mary mother i am thy child   tho i be laid in stall lords and dukes shall worship me   and so shall kinges all and ye shall see that kinges three   shall come on the twelfth day for this behest give me thy breast   and sing byby lullay  see here quoth miles standish when my rose singeth the children gather round her like bees round a flower come let us all strike up a goodly carol together sing one sing all girls and boys and get a bit of old englands christmas before tomorrow when we must to our work on shore  thereat rose struck up a familiar balladmeter of a catching rhythm and every voice of young and old was soon joining in it  behold a silly1 tender babe   in freezing winter night in homely manger trembling lies   alas a piteous sight the inns are full no man will yield   this little pilgrim bed but forced he is with silly beasts   in crib to shroud his head despise him not for lying there   first what he is inquire an orient pearl is often found   in depth of dirty mire  weigh not his crib his wooden dish   nor beasts that by him feed weigh not his mothers poor attire   nor josephs simple weed this stable is a princes court   the crib his chair of state the beasts are parcel of his pomp   the wooden dish his plate the persons in that poor attire   his royal liveries wear the prince himself is come from heaven   this pomp is prized there with joy approach o christian wight   do homage to thy king and highly praise his humble pomp   which he from heaven doth bring  footnote 1 old englishsimple  the cheerful sounds spread themselves through the ship like the flavor of some rare perfume bringing softness of heart through a thousand tender memories  anon the hour of sabbath morning worship drew on and elder brewster read from the new testament the whole story of the nativity and then gave a sort of christmas homily from the words of st paul in the eighth chapter of romans the sixth and seventh verses which the geneva version thus renders  for the wisdom of the flesh is death but the wisdom of the spirit is   life and peace  for the wisdom of the flesh is enmity against god for it is not subject   to the law of god neither indeed can be  ye know full well dear brethren what the wisdom of the flesh sayeth the wisdom of the flesh sayeth to each one take care of thyself look after thyself to get and to have and to hold and to enjoy the wisdom of the flesh sayeth so thou art warm full and in good liking take thine ease eat drink and be merry and care not how many go empty and be lacking but ye have seen in the gospel this morning that this was not the wisdom of our lord jesus christ who though he was lord of all became poorer than any that we through his poverty might become rich when our lord jesus christ came the wisdom of the flesh despised him the wisdom of the flesh had no room for him at the inn  there was room enough always for herod and his concubines for the wisdom of the flesh set great store by them but a poor man and woman were thrust out to a stable and there was a poor baby born whom the wisdom of the flesh knew not because the wisdom of the flesh is enmity against god  the wisdom of the flesh brethren ever despiseth the wisdom of god because it knoweth it not the wisdom of the flesh looketh at the thing that is great and strong and high it looketh at riches at kings courts at fine clothes and fine jewels and fine feastings and it despiseth the little and the poor and the weak  but the wisdom of the spirit goeth to worship the poor babe in the manger and layeth gold and myrrh and frankincense at his feet while he lieth in weakness and poverty as did the wise men who were taught of god  now forasmuch as our saviour christ left his riches and throne in glory and came in weakness and poverty to this world that he might work out a mighty salvation that shall be to all people how can we better keep christmas than to follow in his steps we be a little company who have forsaken houses and lands and possessions and come here unto the wilderness that we may prepare a restingplace whereto others shall come to reap what we shall sow and tomorrow we shall keep our first christmas not in fleshpleasing and in reveling and in fullness of bread but in small beginning and great weakness as our lord christ kept it when he was born in a stable and lay in a manger  tomorrow god willing we will all go forth to do good honest christian work and begin the first housebuilding in this our new englandit may be roughly fashioned but as good a house ill warrant me as our lord christ had on the christmas day we wot of and let us not faint in heart because the wisdom of the world despiseth what we do though sanballat the horonite and tobias the ammonite and geshem the arabian make scorn of us and say what do these weak jews if a fox go up he shall break down their stone wall yet the lord our god is with us and he can cause our work to prosper  the wisdom of the spirit seeth the grain of mustardseed that is the least of all seeds how it shall become a great tree and the fowls of heaven shall lodge in its branches let us then lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees and let us hope that like as great salvation to all people came out of small beginnings of bethlehem so the work which we shall begin tomorrow shall be for the good of many nations  it is a custom on this christmas day to give lovepresents what love gift giveth our lord jesus on this day brethren it is a great one and a precious as st paul said to the philippians for unto you it is given for christ not only that ye should believe on him but also that ye should suffer for his sake and st peter also saith behold we count them blessed which endure and the holy apostles rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer rebuke for the name of jesus  our lord christ giveth us of his cup and his baptism he giveth of the manger and the straw he giveth of persecutions and afflictions he giveth of the crown of thorns and right dear unto us be these gifts  and now will i tell these children a story which a cunning playwright whom i once knew in our queens court hath made concerning gifts  a great king would marry his daughter worthily and so he caused three caskets to be made in one of which he hid her picture the one casket was of gold set with diamonds the second of silver set with pearls and the third a poor casket of lead  now it was given out that each comer should have but one choice and if he chose the one with the picture he should have the lady to wife  divers kings knights and gentlemen came from far but they never won because they always snatched at the gold and the silver caskets with the pearls and diamonds so when they opened these they found only a grinning deathshead or a fools cap  but anon cometh a true brave knight and gentleman who chooseth for love alone the old leaden casket and behold within is the picture of her he loveth and they were married with great feasting and content  so our lord jesus doth not offer himself to us in silver and gold and jewels but in poverty and hardness and want but whoso chooseth them for his loves sake shall find him therein whom his soul loveth and shall enter with joy to the marriage supper of the lamb  and when the lord shall come again in his glory then he shall bring worthy gifts with him for he saith be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life to him that overcometh i will give to eat of the hidden manna and i will give him a white stone with a new name that no man knoweth save he that receiveth it he that overcometh and keepeth my words i will give power over the nations and i will give him the morning star  let us then take joyfully christs christmas gifts of labors and adversities and crosses today that when he shall appear we may have these great and wonderful gifts at his coming for if we suffer with him we shall also reign but if we deny him he also will deny us  and so it happens that the only record of christmas day in the pilgrims journal is this  monday the 25th being christmas day we went ashore some to fell timber some to saw some to rive and some to carry and so no man rested all that day but towards night some as they were at work heard a noise of indians which caused us all to go to our muskets but we heard no further so we came aboard again leaving some to keep guard that night we had a sore storm of wind and rain but at night the ship master caused us to have some beer aboard  so worthily kept they the first christmas from which comes all the christmas cheer of new england today there is no record how mary winslow and rose standish and others with women and children came ashore and walked about encouraging the builders and how little love gathered stores of bright checkerberries and partridge plums and was made merry in seeing squirrels and wild rabbits nor how old margery roasted certain wild geese to a turn at a woodland fire and conserved wild cranberries with honey for sauce in their journals the good pilgrims say they found bushels of strawberries in the meadows in december but we knowing the nature of things know that these must have been cranberries which grow still abundantly around plymouth harbor  and at the very time that all this was doing in the wilderness and the men were working yeomanly to build a new nation in king jamess court the ambassadors of the french king were being entertained with maskings and mummerings wherein the staple subject of merriment was the puritans  so goes the wisdom of the world and its waysand so goes the wisdom of god
