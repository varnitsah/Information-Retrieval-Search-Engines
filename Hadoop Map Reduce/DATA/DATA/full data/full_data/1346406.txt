1346406	the yellow crayon  by e phillips oppenheim     chapter i  it was late summertime and the perfume of flowers stole into the darkened room through the halfopened window the sunlight forced its way through a chink in the blind and stretched across the floor in strange zigzag fashion from without came the pleasant murmur of bees and many lazier insects floating over the gorgeous flower beds resting for a while on the clematis which had made the piazza a blaze of purple splendour and inside in a highbacked chair there sat a man his arms folded his eyes fixed steadily upon vacancy as he sat then so had he sat for a whole day and a whole night the faint sweet chorus of glad living things which alone broke the deep silence of the house seemed neither to disturb nor interest him he sat there like a man turned to stone his forehead riven by one deep line his straight firm mouth set close and hard his servant the only living being who had approached him had set food by his side which now and then he had mechanically taken changeless as a sphinx he had sat there in darkness and in light whilst sunlight had changed to moonlight and the songs of the birds had given place to the low murmuring of frogs from a lake below the lawns  at last it seemed that his unnatural fit had passed away he stretched out his hand and struck a silver gong which had been left within his reach almost immediately a man palefaced with full dark eyes and olive complexion dressed in the sombre garb of an indoor servant stood at his elbow  duson  your grace  bring wineburgundy  it was before him served with almost incredible despatcha small cobwebbed bottle and a glass of quaint shape on which were beautifully emblazoned a coronet and fleurdelis he drank slowly and deliberately when he set the glass down it was empty  duson  your grace  you will pack my things and your own we shall leave for new york this evening telegraph to the holland house for rooms  for how many days your grace  we shall not return here pay off all the servants save two of the most trustworthy who will remain as caretakers  the mans face was as immovable as his masters  and madame  madame will not be returning she will have no further use for her maid see however that her clothes and all her personal belongings remain absolutely undisturbed  has your grace any further orders  take pencil and paper send this cablegram are you ready  the mans head moved in respectful assent       to felix        no 27 rue de st  pierre          avenue de lopera paris     meet me at sherrys restaurant new york one month today eleven      pmv  s  it shall be sent immediately your grace the train for new york leaves at seventen a carriage will be here in one hour and five minutes  the man moved towards the door his master looked up  duson  your grace  the duc de souspennier remains hereor at the bottom of the lakewhat matters it is mr sabin who travels to new york and for whom you engage rooms at the holland house mr sabin is a cosmopolitan of english proclivities  very good sir  lock this door bring my coat and hat five minutes before the carriage starts let the servants be well paid let none of them attempt to see me  the man bowed and disappeared left to himself mr sabin rose from his chair and pushing open the windows stood upon the verandah he leaned heavily upon his stick with both hands holding it before him slowly his eyes traveled over the landscape  it was a very beautiful home which he was leaving before him stretched the gardensitalian in design brilliant with flowers with here and there a dark cedartree drooping low upon the lawn a yew hedge bordered the rosegarden a fountain was playing in the middle of a lake a wooden fence encircled the grounds and beyond was a smooth rolling park with little belts of pine plantations and a few larger trees here and there in the far distance the red flag was waving on one of the putting greens archie green was strolling up the hillsidehis pipe in his mouth and his driver under his arm mr sabin watched and the lines in his face grew deeper and deeper  i am an old man he said softly but i will live to see them suffer who have done this evil thing  he turned slowly back into the room and limping rather more than was usual with him he pushed aside a portiere and passed into a charmingly furnished country drawingroom only the flowers hung dead in their vases everything else was fresh and sweet and dainty slowly he threaded his way amongst the elegant louis quinze furniture examining as though for the first time the beautiful old tapestry the sevres china the chippendale table which was priceless the exquisite portraits painted by greuze and the mysterious green twilights and grey dawns of corot everywhere treasures of art yet everywhere the restraining hand of the artist the faint smell of dead rose leaves hung about the room already one seemed conscious of a certain emptiness as though the genius of the place had gone mr sabin leaned heavily upon his stick and his head drooped lower and lower a soft respectful voice came to him from the other room  in five minutes sir the carriage will be at the door i have your coat and hat here  mr sabin looked up  i am quite ready duson he said                                                      the servants in the hall stood respectfully aside to let him pass on the way to the depot he saw nothing of those who saluted him in the car he sat with folded arms in the most retired seat looking steadfastly out of the window at the dying day there were mountains away westwards touched with golden light sometimes for long minutes together the train was rushing through forests whose darkness was like that of a tunnel mr sabin seemed indifferent to these changes the coming of night did not disturb him his brain was at work and the things which he saw were hidden from other men  duson with a murmur of apology broke in upon his meditations  you will pardon me sir but the second dinner is now being served the restaurant car will be detached at the next stop  what of it mr sabin asked calmly  i have taken the liberty of ordering dinner for you sir it is thirty hours since you ate anything save biscuits  mr sabin rose to his feet  you are quite right duson he said i will dine  in halfanhour he was back again duson placed before him silently a box of cigarettes and matches mr sabin smoked  soon the lights of the great city flared in the sky the train stopped more frequently the express men and newspaper boys came into evidence mr sabin awoke from his long spell of thought he bought a newspaper and glanced through the list of steamers which had sailed during the week when the train glided into the depot he was on his feet and ready to leave it  you will reserve our rooms duson for one month he said on the way to the hotel we shall probably leave for europe a month tomorrow  very good sir  you were mrs petersons servant duson before you were mine  yes sir  you have been with her i believe for many years you are doubtless much attached to her  indeed i am sir  you may have surmised duson that she has left me i desire to ensure your absolute fidelity so i take you into my confidence to this extent your mistress is in the hands of those who have some power over her her absence is involuntary so far as she is concerned it has been a great blow to me i am prepared to run all risks to discover her whereabouts it is late in my life for adventures but it is very certain that adventures and dangers are before us in accompanying me you will associate yourself with many risks therefore  duson held up his hand  i beg sir he exclaimed that you will not suggest for a moment my leaving your service on that account i beg most humbly sir that you will not do me that injustice  mr sabin paused his eyes like lightning read the others face  it is settled then duson he said kindly pay this cabman and follow me as quickly as possible  mr sabin passed across the marble hall leaning heavily upon his stick yet for all his slow movements there was a new alertness in his eyes and bearing he was once more taking keen note of everybody and everything about him only a few days ago she had been here  he claimed his rooms at the office and handed the keys to duson who by this time had rejoined him at the moment of turning away he addressed an inquiry to the clerk behind the counter  can you tell me if the duchess of souspennier is staying here he inquired  the young man glanced up  been here i guess left on tuesday  mr sabin turned away he did not speak again until duson and he were alone in the sittingroom then he drew out a five dollar bill  duson he said take this to the head luggage porter tell him to bring his departure book up here at once and there is another waiting for him you understand  certainly sir  mr sabin turned to enter his bedchamber his attention was attracted however by a letter lying flat upon the table he took it up it was addressed to mr sabin  this is very clever he mused hesitating for a moment before opening it i wired for rooms only a few hours agoand i find a letter it is the commencement  he tore open the envelope and drew out a single halfsheet of notepaper across it was scrawled a single sentence only  go back to lenox  there was no signature nor any date the only noticeable thing about this brief communication was that it was written in yellow pencil of a peculiar shade mr sabins eyes glittered as he read  the yellow crayon he muttered  duson knocked softly at the door mr sabin thrust the letter and envelope into his breast coat pocket    chapter ii  this is the luggage porter sir duson announced he is prepared to answer any questions  the man took out his book mr sabin who was sitting in an easychair turned sideways towards him  the duchess of souspennier was staying here last week he said she left i believe on thursday or friday can you tell me whether her baggage went through your hands  the man set down his hat upon a vacant chair and turned over the leaves of his book  guess i can fix that for you he remarked running his forefinger down one of the pages here we are the duchess left on friday and we checked her baggage through to lenox by the new york new haven  hartford  mr sabin nodded  thank you he said she would probably take a carriage to the station it will be worth another ten dollars to you if you can find me the man who drove her  well we ought to manage that for you the man remarked encouragingly it was one of steve hassells carriages i guess unless the lady took a hansom  very good mr sabin said see if you can find him keep my inquiries entirely to yourself it will pay you  thats all right the man remarked dont you go to bed for halfanhour and i guess youll hear from me again  duson busied himself in the bedchamber mr sabin sat motionless in his easy chair soon there came a tap at the door the porter reappeared ushering in a smartlooking young man who carried a shiny coachmans hat in his hand  struck it right fust time the porter remarked cheerfully this is the man sir  mr sabin turned his head  you drove a lady from here to the new york new haven  hartford depot last friday he asked  well not exactly sir the man answered the duchess took my cab and the first address she gave was the new york new haven  hartford depot but before wed driven a hundred yards she pulled the checkstring and ordered me to go to the waldorf she paid me there and went into the hotel  you have not seen her since  no sir  you knew her by sight you say was there anything special about her appearance  the man hesitated  shed a pretty thick veil on sir but she raised it to pay me and i should say shed been crying she was much paler too than last time i drove her  when was that mr sabin asked  in the spring sirwith you begging your pardon you were at the netherlands and i drove you out several times  you seem mr sabin said to be a person with some powers of observation it would pay you very well indeed if you would ascertain from any of your mates at the waldorf when and with whom the lady in question left that hotel  ill have a try sir the man answered the duchess was better known here but some of them may have recognised her  she had no luggage i presume mr sabin asked  her dressingcase and jewelcase only sir  so you see mr sabin continued it is probable that she did not remain at the waldorf for the night base your inquiries on that supposition  very good sir  from your manners and speech mr sabin said raising his head i should take you to be an englishman  quite correct sir the man answered i drove a hansom in london for eight years  you will understand me then mr sabin continued when i say that i have no great confidence in the police of this country i do not wish to be blackmailed or bullied i would ask you therefore to make your inquiries with discretion  ill be careful sir the man answered  mr sabin handed to each of them a roll of notes the cabdriver lingered upon the threshold mr sabin looked up  well  could i speak a word to youin private sir  mr sabin motioned duson to leave the room the baggage porter had already departed  when i cleaned out my cab at night sir i found this i didnt reckon it was of any consequence at first but from the questions you have been asking it may be useful to you  mr sabin took the halfsheet of notepaper in silence it was the ordinary stationery of the waldorf astoria hotel and the following words were written upon it in a faint delicate handwriting but in yellow pencil                                                    sept  10th   to lucille duchesse de souspennier   you will be at the waldorf astoria hotel in the main corridor    at four oclock this afternoon  the thin paper shook in mr sabins fingers there was no signature but he fancied that the handwriting was not wholly unfamiliar to him he looked slowly up towards the cabman  i am much obliged to you he said this is of interest to me  he stretched out his hand to the little wad of notes which duson had left upon the table but the cabdriver backed away  beg pardon sir he said youve given me plenty the letters of no value to me i came very near tearing it up but for the peculiar colour pencil its written with kinder took my fancy sir  the letter is of value mr sabin said it tells me much more than i hoped to discover it is our good fortune  the man accepted the little roll of bills and departed mr sabin touched the bell  duson what time is it  nearly midnight sir  i will go to bed  very good sir  mix me a sleeping draught duson i need rest see that i am not disturbed until ten oclock tomorrow morning    chapter iii  at precisely ten oclock on the following morning duson brought chocolate which he had prepared himself and some dry toast to his masters bedside upon the tray was a single letter mr sabin sat up in bed and tore open the envelope the following words were written upon a sheet of the holland house notepaper in the same peculiar coloured crayon  the first warning addressed to you yesterday was a friendly one profit by it go back to lenox you are only exposing yourself to danger and the person you seek to discomfort wait there and some one shall come to you shortly who will explain what has happened and the necessity for it  mr sabin smiled a slow contemplative smile he sipped his chocolate and lit a cigarette  our friends then he said softly do not care about pursuit and inquiries it is ridiculous to suppose that their warning is given out of any consideration to me duson  yes sir  my bath i shall rise now  mr sabin made his toilet with something of the same deliberation which characterised all his movements then he descended into the hall bought a newspaper and from a convenient easychair kept a close observation upon every one who passed to and fro for about an hour later on he ordered a carriage and made several calls down town  at a few minutes past twelve he entered the bar of the fifth avenue hotel and ordering a drink sat down at one of the small tables the room was full but mr sabins attention was directed solely to one group of men who stood a short distance away before the counter drinking champagne the central person of the group was a big man with an unusually large neck a fat pale face a brown moustache tinged with grey and a voice and laugh like a foghorn it was he apparently who was paying for the champagne and he was clearly on intimate terms with all the party mr sabin watched for his opportunity and then rising from his seat touched him on the shoulder  mr skinner i believe he said quietly  the big man looked down upon mr sabin with the sullen offensiveness of the professional bully  youve hit it first time he admitted who are you anyway  mr sabin produced a card  i called this morning he said upon the gentleman whose name you will see there he directed me to you and told me to come here  the man tore the card into small pieces  so long boys he said addressing his late companions see you tonight  they accepted his departure in silence and one and all favoured mr sabin with a stare of blatant curiosity  i should be glad to speak with you mr sabin said in a place where we are likely to be neither disturbed nor overheard  you come right across to my office was the prompt reply i guess we can fix it up there  mr sabin motioned to his coachman and they crossed broadway his companion led him into a tall building talking noisily all the time about the pals whom he had just left an elevator transported them to the twelfth floor in little more than as many seconds and mr skinner ushered his visitor into a somewhat barelooking office smelling strongly of stale tobacco smoke mr skinner at once lit a cigar and seating himself before his desk folded his arms and leaned over towards mr sabin  smoke one he asked pointing to the open box  mr sabin declined  get right ahead then  i am an englishman mr sabin said slowly and consequently am not altogether at home with your ways over here i have always understood however that if you are in need of any special information such as we should in england apply to the police for over here there is a quicker and more satisfactory method of procedure  youve come a long way round mr skinner remarked spitting upon the floor but youre dead right  i am in need of some information mr sabin continued and accordingly i called this morning on mr  mr skinner held up his hand  all right he said we dont mention names more than we can help call him the boss  he assured me that the information i was in need of was easily to be obtained and gave me a card to you  go right on mr skinner said what is it  on friday last mr sabin said at four oclock the duchess of souspennier whose picture i will presently show you left the holland house hotel for the new york new haven  hartford depot presumably for her home at lenox to which place her baggage had already been checked on the way she ordered the cabman to set her down at the waldorfastoria hotel which he did at a few minutes past four the duchess has not returned home or been directly heard from since i wish to ascertain her movements since she arrived at the waldorf  sounds dead easy mr skinner remarked reassuringly got the picture  mr sabin touched the spring of a small gold locket which he drew from an inside waistcoat pocket and disclosed a beautifully painted miniature mr skinners thick lips were pursed into a whistle he was on the point of making a remark when he chanced to glance into mr sabins face the remark remained unspoken  he drew a sheet of notepaper towards him and made a few notes upon it  the duchess many friends in new york  at present none the few people whom she knows here are at newport or in europe just now  any idea whom she went to the waldorf to see more we know the better  mr sabin handed him the letter which had been picked up in the cab mr skinner read it through and spat once more upon the floor  what the hs this funny coloured pencil mean  i do not know mr sabin answered you will see that the two anonymous communications which i have received since arriving in new york yesterday are written in the same manner  mr sabin handed him the other two letters which mr skinner carefully perused  i guess youd better tell me who you are he suggested  i am the husband of the duchess of souspennier mr sabin answered  the duchess send any word home at all mr skinner asked  mr sabin produced a worn telegraph form it was handed in at fifth avenue new york at six oclock on friday it contained the single word goodbye  hm mr skinner remarked well find all you want to know by tomorrow sure  what do you make of the two letters which i received mr sabin asked  bunkum mr skinner replied confidently  mr sabin nodded his head  you have no secret societies over here i suppose he said  mr skinner laughed loudly and derisively  i guess not he answered they keep that sort of rubbish on the other side of the pond  ah  mr sabin was thoughtful for a moment you expect to find then he remarked some other cause for my wifes disappearance  there dont seem much room for doubt concerning that sir mr skinner said but i never speculate i will bring you the facts tonight between eight and eleven now as to the business side of it  mr sabin was for a moment puzzled  whats the job worth to you mr skinner asked i am willing to pay mr sabin answered according to your demands  its a simple case mr skinner admitted but our man at the waldorf is expensive if you get all your facts i guess five hundred dollars will about see you through  i will pay that mr sabin answered  i will bring you the letters back tonight mr skinner said i guess ill borrow that locket of yours too  mr sabin shook his head  that he said firmly i do not part with mr skinner scratched his ear with his penholder its the only scrap of identifying matter weve got he remarked of course its a dead simple case and we can probably manage without it but i guess its as well to fix the thing right down  if you will give me a piece of paper mr sabin said i will make you a sketch of the duchess the larger the better i can give you an idea of the sort of clothes she would probably be wearing  mr skinner furnished him with a double sheet of paper and mr sabin with set face and unflinching figures reproduced in a few simple strokes a wonderful likeness of the woman he loved he pushed it away from him when he had finished without remark mr skinner was loud in its praises  i guess youre an artist sir for sure he remarked thisll fix the thing shall i come to your hotel  if you please mr sabin answered i shall be there for the rest of the day  mr skinner took up his hat  guess ill take my dinner and get right to work he remarked say you come along mr sabin ill take you where theyll fix you such a beefsteak as you never tasted in your life  i thank you very much mr sabin said but i must beg to be excused i am expecting some despatches at my hotel if you are successful this afternoon you will perhaps do me the honour of dining with me tonight i will wait until eightthirty  the two men parted upon the pavement mr skinner with his small bowler hat on the back of his head a fresh cigar in the corner of his mouth and his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat strolled along broadway with something akin to a smile parting his lips and showing his yellow teeth  darned old fool he muttered to marry a slapup handsome woman like that and then pretend not to know what it means when she bolts guess ill spoil his supper tonight  mr sabin however was recovering his spirits he too was leaning back in the corner of his carriage with a faint smile brightening his hard stern face but unlike mr skinner he did not talk to himself    chapter iv  r sabin who was never for its own sake fond of solitude had ordered dinner for two at eightthirty in the general diningroom at a few minutes previous to that hour mr skinner presented himself  mr skinner was not in the garb usually affected by men of the world who are invited to dine out the long days exertion too had had its effect upon his linen his front indeed through a broad gap confessed to a foundation of blue and one of his cuffs showed a marked inclination to escape from his wrist over his knuckles his face was flushed and he exhaled a strong odour of cigars and cocktails nevertheless mr sabin was very glad to see him and to receive the folded sheet of paper which he at once produced  i have taken the liberty mr sabin remarked on his part of adding a trifle to the amount we first spoke of which i beg you will accept from me as a mark of my gratitude for your promptness  sure mr skinner answered tersely receiving the little roll of bills without hesitation and retreating into a quiet corner where he carefully counted and examined every one thats all right he announced at the conclusion of his task come and have one with me now before you read your little billetdoux eh  i shall not read your report until after dinner mr sabin said and i think if you are ready that we might as well go in at the headwaiters suggestion i have ordered a cocktail with the oysters and if we are much later he seemed to fear that it might affect the condition of thei think it was terrapin he said  mr skinner stopped short his tone betrayed emotion  did you say terrapin sir  mr sabin nodded mr skinner at once took his arm  guess well go right in he declared i hate to have a good meal spoiled  they were an oldlooking couple mr sabin quietly but faultlessly attired in the usual evening dinner garb mr skinner illdressed untidy unwashed and frowsy but here at least mr sabins incognito had been unavailing for he had stayed at the hotel several timesas he remembered with an odd little pangwith lucille and the headwaiter with a low bow ushered them to their table mr skinner saw the preparations for their repast the oysters the cocktails in tall glasses the magnum of champagne in ice and chuckled to take supper with a duke was a novelty to him but he was not shy he sat down and tucked his serviette into his waistcoat raised his glass and suddenly set it down again  the boss he exclaimed in amazement  mr sabin turned his head in the direction which his companion had indicated coming hastily across the room towards them already out of breath as though with much hurrying was a thickset powerful man with the brutal face and coarse lips of a prizefighter a beard cropped so short as to seem the growth of a few days only covered his chin and his moustache treated in the same way was not thick enough to conceal a cruel mouth he was carefully enough dressed and a great diamond flashed from his tie there was a red mark round his forehead where his hat had been and the perspiration was streaming from his forehead he strode without hesitation to the table where mr sabin and his guest were sitting and without even a glance at the former turned upon his myrmidon  wheres that report he cried roughly where is it  mr skinner seemed to have shrunk into a smaller man he pointed across the table  ive given it to him he said whats wrong boss  the newcomer raised his hand as though to strike skinner he gnashed his teeth with the effort to control himself  you damned blithering idiot he said hoarsely gripping the side of the table why wasnt it presented to me first  guess it didnt seem worth while skinner answered theres nothing in the darned thing  you ignorant fool hold your tongue was the fierce reply  the newcomer sank into a chair and wiped the perspiration from his streaming forehead mr sabin signaled to a waiter  you seem upset mr horser he remarked politely allow me to offer you a glass of wine  mr horser did not immediately reply but he accepted the glass which the waiter brought him and after a moments hesitation drained its contents then he turned to mr sabin  you said nothing about those letters you had had when you came to see me this morning  it was you yourself mr sabin reminded him who begged me not to enter into particulars you sent me on to mr skinner i told him everything  mr horser leaned over the table his eyes were bloodshot his tone was fierce and threatening mr sabin was coldly courteous the difference between the demeanour of the two men was remarkable  you knew what those letters meant this is a plot where is skinners report  mr sabin raised his eyebrows he signaled to the headwaiter  be so good as to continue the service of my dinner he ordered the champagne is a trifle too chilled you can take it out of the cooler  the man bowed with a curious side glance at horser  certainly your grace  horser was almost speechless with anger  are you going to answer my questions he demanded thickly  i have no particular objection to doing so mr sabin answered but until you can sit up and compose yourself like an ordinary individual i decline to enter into any conversation with you at all  again mr horser raised his voice and the glare in his eyes was like the glare of a wild beast  do you know who i am he asked do you know who youre talking to  mr sabin looked at him coolly and fingered his wineglass  well he said ive a shocking memory for names but yours ismr horser isnt it i heard it for the first time this morning and my memory will generally carry me through fourandtwenty hours  there was a moments silence horser was no fool he accepted his defeat and dropped the bully  youre a stranger in this city mr sabin and i guess you arent altogether acquainted with our ways yet he said but i want you to understand this the report which is in your pocket has got to be returned to me if id known what i was meddling with i wouldnt have touched your business for a hundred thousand dollars its got to be returned to me i say he repeated in a more threatening tone  mr sabin helped himself to fish and made a careful examination of the sauce  after all he said meditatively i am not sure that i was wise in insisting upon a sauce piquante i beg your pardon mr horser please do not think me inattentive but i am very hungry so i believe is my friend mr skinner will you not join usor perhaps you have already dined  there was an ugly flush in mr horsers cheeks but he struggled to keep his composure  will you give me back that report  when i have read it with pleasure mr sabin answered before no  mr horser swallowed an exceedingly vicious oath he struck the table lightly with his forefinger  look here he said if youd lived in new york a couple of years even a couple of months you wouldnt talk like that i tell you that i hold the government of this city in my right hand i dont want to be unpleasant but if that paper is not in my hands by the time you leave this table i shall have you arrested as you leave this room and the papers taken from you  dear me mr sabin said this is serious on what charge may i ask should i be exposed to this inconvenience  charge be damned mr horser answered the police dont want particulars from me when i say do a thing they do it they know that if they declined it would be their last day on the force  mr sabin filled his glass and leaned back in his chair  this he remarked is interesting i am always glad to have the opportunity of gaining an insight into the customs of different countries i had an idea that america was a country remarkable for the amount of liberty enjoyed by its inhabitants your proposed course of action seems scarcely in keeping with this  what are you going to do come ive got to have an answer  i dont quite understand mr sabin remarked with a puzzled look what your official position is in connection with the police  mr horsers face was a very ugly sight oh curse my official position he exclaimed thickly if you want proof of what i say you shall have it in less than five minutes skinner be off and fetch a couple of constables  i really must protest mr sabin said mr skinner is my guest and i will not have him treated in this fashion just as the terrapin is coming in too sit down mr skinner sit down i will settle this matter with you in my room mr horser after i have dined i will not even discuss it before  mr horser opened his mouth twice and closed it again he knew that his opponent was simply playing to gain time but after all he held the trump card he could afford to wait he turned to a waiter and ordered a cigar mr sabin and mr skinner continued their dinner  conversation was a little difficult though mr sabin showed no signs of an impaired appetite skinner was white with fear and glanced every now and then nervously at his chief mr horser smoked without ceasing and maintained an ominous silence mr sabin at last with a sigh rose and lighting a cigarette took his stick from the waiter and prepared to leave  i fear mr horser he remarked that your presence has scarcely contributed to the cheerfulness of our repast mr skinner am i to be favoured with your company also upstairs  horser clutched that gentlemans arm and whispered a few words in his ear  mr skinner he said will join us presently what is your number  336 mr sabin answered you will excuse my somewhat slow progress  they crossed the hall and entered the elevator mr horsers face began to clear in a moment or two they would be in mr sabins sittingroomalone he regarded with satisfaction the others slim delicate figure and the limp with which he moved he felt that the danger was already over    chapter v  but after all things did not exactly turn out as mr horser had imagined the sight of the empty room and the closed door were satisfactory enough and he did not hesitate for a moment  look here sir he said you and i are going to settle this matter quick whatever you paid skinner you can have back again but im going to have that report  he took a quick step forward with uplifted handand looked into the shining muzzle of a tiny revolver behind it mr sabins face no longer pleasant and courteous had taken to itself some very grim lines  i am a weak man mr horser but i am never without the means of selfdefence mr sabin said in a still cold tone be so good as to sit down in that easychair  mr horser hesitated for one moment he stood as though about to carry out his first intention he stood glaring at his opponent his face contracted into a snarl his whole appearance hideous almost bestial mr sabin smiled upon him contemptuouslythe maddening compelling smile of the born aristocrat  sit down  mr horser sat down whereupon mr sabin followed suit  now what have you to say to me mr sabin asked quietly  i want that report was the dogged answer  you will not have it mr sabin answered you can take that for granted you shall not take it from me by force and i will see that you do not charm it out of my pocket by other means the information which it contains is of the utmost possible importance to me i have bought it and paid for it and i shall use it  mr horser moistened his dry lips  i will give you he said twenty thousand dollars for its return  mr sabin laughed softly  you bid high he said i begin to suspect that our friends on the other side of the water have been more than ordinarily kind to you  i will give youforty thousand dollars  mr sabin raised his eyebrows  so much after all that sounds more like fear than anything you cannot hope to make a profitable deal out of that dear me it seems only a few minutes ago that i heard your interesting friend mr skinner shake with laughter at the mention of such a thing as a secret society  skinner is a blasted fool horser exclaimed fiercely listen here mr sabin you can read that report if you must but as im a living man youll not stir from new york if you do ill make your life a hell for you dont you understand that no one but a born fool would dare to quarrel with me in this city i hold the prison keys the police are mine i shall make my own charge whatever i choose and they shall prove it for me  mr sabin shook his head  this sounds very shocking he remarked i had no idea that the largest city of the most enlightened country in the world was in such a sorry plight  oh curse your sarcasm mr horser said im talking facts and youve got to know them will you give up that report you can find out all there is in it for yourself but im going to give it you straight if i dont have that report back unread youll never leave new york  mr sabin was genuinely amused  my good fellow he said you have made yourself a notorious person in this country by dint of incessant bullying and bribing and corruption of every sort you may possess all the powers you claim your only mistake seems to be that you are too thickheaded to know when you are overmatched i have been a diplomatist all my life mr sabin said rising slowly to his feet and with a sudden intent look upon his face and if i were to be outwitted by such a novice as you i should deserve to end my daysin new york  mr horser rose also to his feet a smile of triumph was on his lips  well he said we come in come in the door was thrown open skinner and two policemen entered mr sabin leaned towards the wall and in a second the room was plunged in darkness  turn on the lights skinner shouted seize him hes in that corner use your clubs horser bawled stand by the door one of you damnation where is that switch  he found it with a shout of triumph lights flared out in the room they stared around into every corner mr sabin was not there then horser saw the door leading into the bedchamber and flung himself against it with a hoarse cry of rage  break it open he cried to the policemen  they hammered upon it with their clubs mr sabins quiet voice came to them from the other side  pray do not disturb me gentlemen he said i am reading  break it open you damned fools horser cried they battered at it sturdily but the door was a solid one suddenly they heard the key turn in the lock mr sabin stood upon the threshold  gentlemen he exclaimed these are my private apartments why this violence  he held out the paper  this is mine he said the information which it contains is bought and paid for but if the giving it up will procure me the privilege of your departure pray take it  horser was purple with rage he pointed with shaking fist to the still calm figure  arrest him he ordered take him to the cells  mr sabin shrugged his shoulders  i am ready he said but it is only fair to give you this warning i am the duke of souspennier and i am well known in england and france the paper which you saw me hand to the porter in the hall as we stepped into the elevator was a despatch in cipher to the english ambassador at washington claiming his protection if you take me to prison tonight you will have him to deal with tomorrow  mr horser bore himself in defeat better than at any time during the encounter he turned to the constables  go down stairs and wait for me in the hall he ordered you too skinner  they left the room horser turned to mr sabin and the veins on his forehead stood out like whipcord  i know when im beaten he said keep your report and be damned to you but remember that you and i have a score to settle and you can ask those who know me how often dick horser comes out underneath in the long run  he followed the others mr sabin sat down in his easychair with a quiet smile upon his lips once more he glanced through the brief report then his eyes half closed and he sat quite stilla tired wearylooking man almost unnaturally pale  they have kept their word he said softly to himself after many years after many years                                                      duson came in to undress him shortly afterwards he saw signs of the struggle but made no comment mr sabin after a moments hesitation took a phial from his pocket and poured a few drops into a wineglassful of water  duson he said bring me some despatch forms and a pencil  yes sir  mr sabin wrote for several moments then he placed the forms in an envelope sealed it and handed it to duson  duson he said that fellow horser is annoyed with me if i should be arrested on any charge or should fail to return to the hotel within reasonable time break that seal and send off the telegrams  yes sir  mr sabin yawned  i need sleep he said do not call me tomorrow morning until i ring and duson  yes sir  the campania will sail from new york somewhere about the tenth of october i wish to secure the whole of stateroom number twentyeight go round to the office as soon as they open secure that room if possible and pay a deposit no other will do also one for yourself  very good sir    chapter vi  heres a lady inquiring for you sirjust gone up to your room in the elevator the hotel clerk remarked to mr sabin as he paused on his way to the door to hand in his key shall i send a boy up  mr sabin hesitated  a lady he remarked tentatively  the hotel clerk nodded  yes i didnt notice the name but she was an englishwoman ill send up  thank you i will return mr sabin said if i should miss her on the way perhaps you will kindly redirect her to my rooms  he rang for the elevator and was swiftly transported to his own floor the door of his sittingroom was open duson was talking to a tall fair woman who turned swiftly round at the sound of his approach  ah they found you then she exclaimed coming towards him with outstretched hands isnt this a strange place and a strange country for us to meet once more in  he greeted her gallantly but with a certain reserve of which she was at once aware  are there any countries in the world left which are strange to so great a traveler as lady muriel carey he said the papers here have been full of your wonderful adventures in south africa  she laughed  everything shockingly exaggerated of course she declared i have really been plagued to death since i got here with interviewers and that sort of person i wonder if you know how glad i am to see you again  you are very kind indeed he said certainly there was no one whom i expected less to see over here you have come for the yacht races i suppose  she looked at him with a faint smile and raised eyebrows  come she said shall we lie to one another is it worth while candour is so much more original  candour by all means then i beg he answered  i have come over with the dalkeiths ostensibly to see the yacht races really i have come to see you  mr sabin bowed  i am delightfully flattered he murmured  i dont exactly mean for the pleasure of gazing into your face once more she continued i have a mission  mr sabin looked up quickly  great heavens you too he exclaimed  she nodded  why not she asked coolly i have been in it for years you know and when i got back from south africa everything seemed so terribly slow that i begged for some work to do  and they sent you hereto me  yes she answered and i was here also a few weeks ago but you must not ask me anything about that  mr sabins eyebrows contracted his face darkened she shrank a little away from him  so it is you who have robbed me of her then he said slowly yes the description fits you well enough i ask you lady carey to remember the last time when chance brought you and me together have i deserved this from you  she made a little gesture of impotence  do be reasonable she begged what choice had i  he looked at her steadfastly  the folly of womenof clever women such as you he said is absolutely amazing you have deliberately made a slave of yourself  one must have distraction she murmured  distraction and so you play at this sort of thing is it worth while  her eyes for a moment clouded over with weariness  when one has filled the cup of life to the brim for many years she said what remains that is worth while  he bowed  you are a young woman he said you should not yet have learned to speak with such bitterness as for mewell i am old indeed in youth and age the affections claim us i am approaching my second childhood  she laughed derisively yet not unkindly what folly she exclaimed  you are right he admitted i suppose it is the fault of old associations  in a few minutes she said smiling at him we should have become sentimental  i he admitted was floundering already  she shrugged her shoulders  you talk as though sentiment were a bog  there have been worse similes he declared  how horrid and do you know sir for all your indignation you have not yet even inquired after your wifes health  i trust he said that she is well  she is in excellent health  your second visit to this country he remarked follows very swiftly upon your first  she nodded  i am here she said on your account  you excite my interest he declared may i know your mission  i have to remind you of your pledge she said to assure you of lucilles welfare and to prevent your leaving the country  marvelous he exclaimed with a slight mocking smile and may i ask what means you intend to employ to keep me here  well she said i have large discretionary powers we have a very strong branch over on this side but i would very much rather induce you to stay here without applying to them  and the inducements he asked  she took a cigarette from a box which stood on the table and lit one  well she said i might appeal to your hospitality might i not i am in a strange country which you have made your home i want to be shown round do you remember dining with me one night at the ambassadors it was very hot even for paris and we drove afterwards in the bois ask me to dine with you here wont you i have never quite forgotten the last time  mr sabin laughed softly but with undisguised mirth  come he said this is an excellent start you are to play the circe up to date and i am to be beguiled how ought i to answer you i do remember the ambassadors and i do remember driving down the bois in your victoria and holdingi believe i am rightyour hand you have no right to disturb those charming memories by attempting to turn them into bathos  she blew out a little cloud of tobacco smoke and watched it thoughtfully  ah she remarked i wonder who is better at that you or i i may not be exactly a sentimental person but youyou are a flint  on the contrary mr sabin assured her earnestly i am very much in love with my wife  dear me she exclaimed you carry originality to quixoticism i have met several men before in my life whom i have suspected of such a thing but i never heard any one confess it this little domestic contretemps is then i presume disagreeable to you  to the last degree mr sabin asserted so much so that i leave for england by the campania  she shook her head slowly  i wouldnt if i were you  why not  lady carey threw away the end of her cigarette and looked for a moment thoughtfully at her long white fingers glittering with rings then she began to draw on her gloves  well in the first place she said lucille will have no time to spare for you you will be de trop in decidedly an uncomfortable position you wouldnt find london at all a good place to live in just now even if you ever got therewhich i am inclined to doubt and secondly here am i  circe he murmured  waiting to be entertained in a strange country almost friendless i want to be shown everything taken everywhere and i am dying to see your home at lenox i do not think your attitude towards me in the least hospitable  come you are judging me very quickly he declared what opportunities have i had  what opportunities can there be if you sail by the campania  you might dine with me tonight at least  impossible the dalkeiths have a party to meet me come too wont you they love dukeseven french ones  he shook his head  there is no attraction for me in a large party he answered i am getting to an age when to make conversation in return for a dinner seems scarcely a fair exchange  from your hosts point of view or yours  from both besides ones digestion suffers  you are certainly getting old she declared come i must go you havent been a bit nice to me when shall i see you again  it is he answered for you to say  she looked at him for a moment thoughtfully  supposing she said that i cried off the yacht race today would you take me out to lunch  he smiled  my dear lady he said it is for circe to commandand for me to obey  and youll come and have tea with me afterwards at the waldorf  that mr sabin declared will add still further to my happiness  will you call for me thenand where shall we have lunch and at what time i must go and develop a headache at once or that tiresome dalkeith boy will be pounding at my door  i will call for you at the waldorf at halfpast one mr sabin said unless you have any choice i will take you to a little place downtown where we can imagine ourselves back on the continent and where we shall be spared the horror of green corn  delightful she murmured buttoning her glove then you shall take me for a drive to fifth avenue or to see somebodys tomb and my woman shall make some real russian tea for us in my sittingroom really i think im doing very well for the first day is the spell beginning to work  hideously he assured her i feel already that the only thing i dread in life are these two hours before luncheon  she nodded  that is quite as it should be dont trouble to come down with me i believe that dalkeith pere is hanging round somewhere and in view of my headache perhaps you had better remain in the background for the moment at onethirty then  mr sabin smiled as she passed out of the room and lit a cigarette  i think he said to himself that the arrival of felix is opportune    chapter vii  they sat together at a small table looking upon a scene which was probably unique in the history of the great restaurant the younger man was both frankly interested and undoubtedly curious mr sabin though his eyes seemed everywhere retained to the full extent that nonchalance of manner which all his life he had so assiduously cultivated  it is wonderful my dear felix he said leisurely drawing his cigarettecase from his pocket wonderful what good fellowship can be evolved by a kindred interest in sport and a bottle or so of good champagne but after all this is not to be taken seriously  shamrock the fourth shamrock the fourth  a tall young american his thick head of hair which had once been carefully parted in the middle a little disheveled his hard cleancut face flushed with enthusiasm had risen to his feet and stood with a brimming glass of champagne high over his head almost every one in the room rose to their feet a college boy sprang upon a table with extended arms the yale shout split the room the very glasses on the table rattled  columbia columbia  it was an englishman now who had leaped upon a vacant table with upraised glass there was an answering roar of enthusiasm every one drank and every one sat down again with a pleasant thrill of excitement at this unique scene felix leaned back in his chair and marveled  one would have imagined he murmured that america and england together were at war with the rest of the world and had won a great victory to think that this is all the result of a yacht race it is incredible  all your life my dear felix mr sabin remarked you have underrated the sporting instinct it has a great place amongst the impulses of the world see how it has brought these people together  but they are already of the same kin felix remarked their interests and aims are alike their destinies are surely identical  mr sabin who had lit his cigarette watched the blue smoke curl upwards and was thoughtful for a moment  my dear felix he said you are very very young the interests of two great nations such as america and england can never be alike it is the language of diplomacy but it is also the language of fools  their conversation was for the moment interrupted by a fresh murmur of applause rising above the loved hum of conversation the laughter of women and the popping of corks a little troop of waiters had just wheeled into the room two magnificent models of yachts hewn out of blocks of solid ice and crowned with flowers on the one were the stars and stripes on the other the shamrock and thistle there was much clapping of hands and cheering lady carey who was sitting at the next table with her back to them joined in the applause so heartily that a tiny gold pencil attached to her bracelet became detached and rolled unobserved to mr sabins side felix half rose to pick it up but was suddenly checked by a quick gesture from his companion  leave it mr sabin whispered i wish to return it myself  he stooped and picked it up a certain stealthiness apparent in his movement felix watched him in amazement  it is lady careys is it not he asked  yes be silent i will give it back to her presently  a waiter served them with coffee mr sabin was idly sketching something on the back of his menu card felix broke into a little laugh as the man retired  mysterious as ever he remarked  mr sabin smiled quietly he went on with his sketch  i do not want felix said to seem impatient but you must remember that i have come all the way from europe in response to a very urgent message as yet i have done nothing except form a very uncomfortable third at a luncheon and tea party and listen to a good deal of enigmatic conversation between you and the charming lady carey this evening i made sure that i should be enlightened but no you have given me a wonderful dinnerfrom you i expected it we have eaten terrapin canvasback duck and many other things the names of which alone were known to me but of the reason for which you have summoned me herei know nothing not one word have you spoken i am beginning to fear from your avoidance of the subject that there is some trouble between you and lucille i beg that you will set my anxiety at rest  mr sabin nodded  it is reasonable he said look here  he turned the menu card round on the back he had sketched some sort of a device with the pencil which he had picked up and which instead of blacklead contained a peculiar shade of yellow crayon felix sat as though turned to stone  try mr sabin said smoothly and avoid that air of tragedy some of these good people might be curious  felix leaned across the table he pointed to the menu card  what does that mean he muttered  mr sabin contemplated it himself thoughtfully well he said i rather thought that you might be able to explain that to me i have an idea that there is a society in europesort of aristocratic oddfellows you knowwho had adopted it for their crest am i not right  felix looked at him steadfastly  tell me two things he said first why you sent for me and secondly what do you meanby that  lucille mr sabin said has been taken away from me  lucille great god  she has been taken away from me mr sabin said without a single word of warning  felix pointed to the menu card  by them he asked  by them it was a month ago two days before my cable  felix was silent for several moments he had not the selfcommand of his companion and he feared to trust himself to speech  she has been taken to europe mr sabin continued i do not know i cannot even guess at the reason she left no word i have been warned not to follow her  you obey  i sail tomorrow  and i felix asked  mr sabin looked for a moment at the drawing on the back of the menu card and up at felix felix shook his head  you must know he said that i am powerless  you may be able to help me mr sabin said without compromising yourself  impossible felix declared but what did they want with lucille  that mr sabin said is what i am desirous of knowing it is what i trust that you my dear felix may assist me to discover  you are determined then to follow her  mr sabin helped himself to a liqueur from the bottle by his side  my dear felix he said reproachfully you should know me better than to ask me such a question  felix moved uneasily in his chair  of course he said it depends upon how much they want to keep you apart but you know that you are running great risks  why no mr sabin said i scarcely thought that i have understood that the society was by no means in its former flourishing condition  felix laughed scornfully  they have never been he answered richer or more powerful during the last twelve months they have been active in every part of europe  mr sabins face hardened  very well he said we will try their strength  we felix laughed shortly you forget that my hands are tied i cannot help you or lucille you must know that  you cannot interfere directly mr sabin admitted yet you are lucilles brother and i am forced to appeal to you if you will be my companion for a little while i think i can show you how you can help lucille at any rate and yet run no risk  the little party at the next table were breaking up at last lady carey pale and bored with tired swollen eyesthey were always a little prominentrose languidly and began to gather together her belongings as she did so she looked over the back of her chair and met mr sabins eyes he rose at once and bowed she cast a quick sidelong glance at her companions which he at once understood  i have the honour lady carey he said of recalling myself to your recollection we met in paris and london not so very many years ago you perhaps remember the cardinals dinner  a slight smile flickered upon her lips the mans adroitness always excited her admiration  i remember it perfectly and you duke she answered have you made your home on this side of the water  mr sabin shook his head slowly  home he repeated ah i was always a bird of passage you remember yet i have spent three very delightful years in this country  and i she said lowering her tone and leaning towards him one very stupid idiotic day  mr sabin assumed the look of a man who denies any personal responsibility in an unfortunate happening  it was regrettable he murmured but i assure you that it was unavoidable lucilles brother must have a certain claim upon me and it was his first day in america  she was silent for a moment then she turned abruptly towards the door her friends were already on the way  come with me she said i want to speak to you  he followed her out into the lobby felix came a few paces behind the restaurant was still full of people the hum of conversation almost drowning the music every one glanced curiously at lady carey who was a famous woman she carried herself with a certain insolent indifference the national deportment of her sex and rank the women whispered together that she was very english  in the lobby she turned suddenly upon mr sabin  will you take me back to my hotel she asked pointedly  i regret that i cannot he answered i have promised to show felix some of the wonders of new york by night  you can take him tomorrow  tomorrow mr sabin said he leaves for the west  she looked closely into his impassive face  i suppose that you are lying she said shortly  your candour he answered coldly sometimes approaches brutality  she leaned towards him her face suddenly softened  we are playing a foolish game with one another she murmured i offer you an alliance my friendship perhaps my help  what can i do he answered gravely save be gratefuland accept  then  she stopped short it was mr sabins luck which had intervened herbert daikeith stood at her elbow  lady carey he said theyre all gone but the mater and i forgive my interrupting you he added hastily  you can go on herbert she added the duc de souspennier will bring me  mr sabin who had no intention of doing anything of the sort turned towards the young man with a smile  lady carey has not introduced us he said but i have seen you at ranelagh quite often if you are still keen on polo you should have a try over here i fancy you would find that these american youngsters can hold their own all right felix i am ready now lady carey i shall do myself the honour of waiting upon you early tomorrow morning as i have a little excursion to propose goodnight  she shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly as she turned away mr sabin smiledfaintly amused he turned to felix  come he said we have no time to lose    chapter viii  i regret mr sabin said to felix as they sat side by side in the small coupe that your stay in this country will be so brief  indeed felix answered may i ask what you call brief  mr sabin looked out of the carriage window  we are already he said on the way to england  felix laughed  this he said is like old times  mr sabin smiled  the system of espionage here he remarked is painfully primitive it lacks finesse and judgment the fact that i have taken expensive rooms on the campania and that i have sent many packages there that my own belongings are still in my rooms untouched seems to our friends conclusive evidence that i am going to attempt to leave america by that boat they have i believe a warrant for my arrest on some ridiculous charge which they intend to present at the last moment they will not have the opportunity  but there is no other steamer sailing tomorrow is there felix asked  not from new york mr sabin answered but it was never my intention to sail from new york we are on our way to boston now and we sail in the saxonia at six oclock tomorrow morning  we appear to be stopping at the waldorf felix remarked  it is quite correct mr sabin answered follow me through the hall as quickly as possible there is another carriage waiting at the other entrance and i expect to find in it duson and my dressingcase  they alighted and made their way though the crowded vestibules at the thirtyfourth street entrance a carriage was drawn up duson was standing upon the pavement his pale nervous face whiter than ever under the electric light mr sabin stopped short  felix he said one word if by any chance things have gone wrong they will not have made any arrangements to detain you catch the midnight train to boston and embark on the saxonia there will be a cable for you at liverpool but the moment you leave me send this despatch  felix nodded and put the crumpledup piece of paper in his pocket the two men passed on duson took off his hat but his fingers were trembling the carriage door was opened and a tall spare man descended  this is mr sabin he remarked  mr sabin bowed  that is my name he admitted by which i have been generally called in this democratic country what is your business with me  i rather guess that youre my prisoner the man answered if youll step right in here we can get away quietly  the suggestion mr sabin remarked sounds inviting but i am somewhat pressed for time might i inquire the nature of the charge you have against me  theyll tell you that at the office the man answered get in please  mr sabin looked around for felix but he had disappeared he took out his cigarettecase  you will permit me first to light a cigarette he remarked  all right only look sharp  mr sabin kept silence in the carriage the drive was a long one when they descended he looked up at duson who sat upon the box  duson he said and his voice though low was terrible i see that i can be mistaken in men you are a villain  the man sprung to his feet hat in hand his face was wrung with emotion  your grace he said it is true that i betrayed you but i did it without reward i am a ruined man i did it because the orders which came to me were such as i dare not disobey here are your keys your grace and money  mr sabin looked at him steadily  you too duson  i too alas your grace  mr sabin considered for a moment  duson he said i retain you in my service take my luggage on board the campania tomorrow afternoon and pay the bill at the hotel i shall join you on the boat  duson was amazed the man who was standing by laughed  if you take my advice sir he remarked youll order your clothes to be sent here ive a kind of fancy the campania will sail without you tomorrow  you have my orders duson mr sabin said you can rely upon seeing me  the detective led the way into the building and opened the door leading into a large barely furnished office  chiefs gone home for the night i guess he remarked we can fix up a shakedown for you in one of the rooms behind  i thank you mr sabin said sitting down in a highbacked wooden chair i decline to move until the charge against me is properly explained  there is no one here to do it just now the man answered better make yourself comfortable for a bit  you detain me here then mr sabin said without even a sight of your warrant or any intimation as to the charge against me  oh the chiefll fix all that the man answered dont you worry  mr sabin smiled  in a magnificently furnished apartment somewhere in the neighbourhood of fifth avenue a small party of men were seated round a card table piled with chips and rolls of bills on the sideboard there was a great collection of empty bottles spirit decanters and vichy syphons mr horser was helping himself to brandy and water with one hand and holding himself up with the other there was a knock at the door  a man who was still playing looked up he was about fifty years of age clean shaven with vacuous eyes and a weak mouth he was the host of the party  come in he shouted  a young man entered in a long black overcoat and soft hat he looked about him without surprise but he seemed to note mr horsers presence with some concern the man at the table threw down his cards  what the devil do you want smith  an important despatch from washington has just arrived sir i have brought it up with the codebook  from washington at this time of the night he exclaimed thickly come in here smith  he raised the curtains leading into a small anteroom and turned up the electric light his clerk laid the message down on the table before him  here is the despatch mr mace he said and here is the translation  english ambassador demands immediate explanation of arrest of duke souspennier at waldorf tonight reply immediately what charge and evidence souspennier naturalised englishman  mr mace sprang to his feet with an oath he threw aside the curtain which shielded the room from the larger apartment  horser come here you damned fool  horser with a stream of magnificent invectives obeyed the summons his host pointed to the message  read that  mr horser read and his face grew even more repulsive a dull purple flush suffused his cheeks his eyes were bloodshot and the veins on his forehead stood out like cords he leaned for several moments against the table and steadily cursed mr sabin the government at washington and something under his breath which he did not dare to name openly  oh shut up his host said at last how the devil are we going to get out of this  mr horser left the room and returned with a tumbler full of brandy and a very little water  take a drink yourself he said itll steady you  oh im steady enough mr mace replied impatiently i want to know how youre going to get us out of this what was the charge anyhow  passing forged bills horser answered parsons fixed it up  mr mace turned a shade paler  where the devils the sense in a charge like that he answered fiercely the mans a millionaire hell turn the tables on us nicely  weve got to keep him till after the campania sails anyhow horser said doggedly  were not going to keep him ten minutes mace replied im going to sign the order for his release  horsers speech was thick with drunken fury by  ill see that you dont he exclaimed  mace turned upon him angrily  you selfish fool he muttered youre not in the thing anyhow if you think im going to risk my position for the sake of one little job youre wrong i shall go down myself and release him with an apology  hell have his revenge all the same horser answered its too late now to funk the thing they cant budge you well see to that we hold new york in our hands be a man mace and run a little risk its fifty thousand  mace looked up at him curiously  what do you get out of it horser  horsers face hardened  not one cent he declared fiercely only if i fail it might be unpleasant for me next time i crossed  i dont know mace declared weakly i dont know what to do its twelve hours horser and the charge is ridiculous  you have me behind you  i cant tell them that at washington mace said  its a fact all the same dont be so damned nervous  mace dismissed his clerk and found his other guests too on the point of departure but the last had scarcely left before a servant entered with another despatch  release souspennier  mace handed it to his companion  this settles it he declared i shall go round and try and make my peace with the fellow  horser stood in the way burly halfdrunk and vicious he struck his host in the face with clenched fist mace went down with scarcely a groan a servant hearing the fall came hurrying back  your master is drunk and he has fallen down horser said put him to bedgive him a sleeping draught if youve got one  the servant bent over the unconscious man  hadnt i better fetch a doctor sir he asked im afraid hes hurt  not he horser answered contemptuously hes cut his cheek a little thats all put him to bed say i shall be round again by nine oclock  horser put on his coat and left the house the morning sunlight was flooding the streets away down town mr sabin was dozing in his highbacked chair    chapter ix  felix after an uneventful voyage landed duly at liverpool to his amazement the first person he saw upon the quay was mr sabin leaning upon his stick and smoking a cigarette  come come felix he exclaimed dont look at me as though i were a ghost you have very little confidence in me after all i see  buthow did you get here  the campania of course i had plenty of time it was easy enough for those fellows to arrest me but they never had a chance of holding me  but how did you get away in time  mr sabin sighed  it was very simple he said one day while one of those wonderful spies was sleeping on my doormat i slipped away and went over to washington saw the english ambassador convinced him of my bonafides told him very nearly the whole truth he promised if i wired him that i was arrested to take my case up at once you sent the despatch and he kept his word i breakfasted on saturday morning at the waldorf and though a great dray was driven into my carriage on the way to the boat i escaped as i always doand here i am  unhurt felix remarked with a smile as usual  mr sabin nodded  the driver of my carriage was killed and duson had his arm broken he said i stepped out of the debris without a scratch come into the customs house now and get your baggage through i have taken a coupe on the special train and ordered lunch  before long they were on the way to london mr sabin whilst luncheon was being served talked only of the lightest matters but afterwards when coffee was served and he had lit a cigarette he leaned over towards felix  felix he said your sister is dear to you  she is the only creature on earth felix said whom i care for she is very dear to me indeed  am i right mr sabin asked in assuming that the old enmity between us is dead that the last few years has wiped away the old soreness  yes felix answered i know that she was happy with you that is enough for me  you and i mr sabin continued must work out her salvation do not be afraid that i am going to ask you impossibilities i know that our ways must lie apart you can go to her at once it may be many many months before i can catch even a glimpse of her never mind let me feel that she has you within the circle and i without with our lives devoted to her  you may rely upon that felix answered wherever she is i am going i shall be there i will watch over her  mr sabin sighed  the more difficult task is mine he said but i have no fear of failure i shall find her surrounded by spies by those who are now my enemies still they will find it hard to shake me off it may be that they took her from me only out of revenge if that be so my task will be easier if there are other dangers which she is called upon to face it is still possible that they might accept my service instead  you would give it felix exclaimed  to the last drop of blood in my body mr sabin answered save for my love for her i am a dead man upon the earth i have no longer politics or ambition so the past can easily be expunged those who must be her guiding influence shall be mine  you will win her back felix said i am sure of it  i am willing to pay any price on earth mr sabin answered if they can forget the past i can i want you to remember this i want her to know it i want them to know it that is all felix  mr sabin leaned back in his seat he had left this country last a stricken and defeated man left it with the echoes of his ruined schemes crashing in his ears he came back to it a man with one purpose only and that such a purpose as never before had guided himthe love of a woman was it a sign of age he wondered this return to the humanities his life had been full of great schemes he had wielded often a gigantic influence more than once he had made history and now the love of these things had gone from him their fascination was powerless to quicken by a single beat his steady pulse monarchy or republicwhat did he care it was lucille he wanted the woman who had shown him how sweet even defeat might be who had made these three years of his life so happy that they seemed to have passed in one delightful dream were they dead annihilated these old ambitions the old love of great doings or did they only slumber he moved in his seat uneasily  at euston the two men separated with a silent handshake mr sabin drove to one of the largest and newest of the modern hotels de luxe he entered his name as mr sabinthe old exiles hatred of using his title in a foreign country had become a confirmed habit with himand mingled freely with the crowds who thronged into the restaurant at night there were many faces which he remembered there were a few who remembered him he neither courted nor shunned observation he sat at dinnertime at a retired table and found himself watching the people with a stir of pleasure afterwards he went round to a famous club of which he had once been made a life member but towards midnight he was wearied of the dull decorum of his surroundings and returning to the hotel sought the restaurant once more the stream of people coming in to supper was greater even than at dinnertime he found a small table and ordered some oysters the sight of this bevy of pleasureseekers all apparently with multitudes of friends might have engendered a sense of loneliness in a man of different disposition to mr sabin his isolation was a luxury he had an uninterrupted opportunity of pursuing his favourite study  there entered a party towards midnight to meet whom the headwaiter himself came hurrying from the further end of the room and whose arrival created a little buzz of interest the woman who formed the central figure of the little group had for two years known no rival either at court or in society she was the most beautiful woman in england beautiful too with all the subtle grace of her royal descent there were women upon the stage whose faces might have borne comparison with hers but there was not one who in a room would not have sunk into insignificance by her side her movements her carriage were incomparablethe inherited gifts of a race of women born in palaces  mr sabin who neither shunned nor courted observation watched her with a grim smile which was not devoid of bitterness suddenly she saw him with a little cry of wonder she came towards him with outstretched hands  it is marvelous she exclaimed you really you  he bowed low over her hands  it is i dear helene he answered a moment ago i was dreaming i thought that i was back once more at versailles and in the presence of my queen  she laughed softly  there may be no versailles she murmured but you will be a courtier to the end of your days  at least he said believe me that my congratulations come from my heart your happiness is written in your face and your husband must be the proudest man in england  he was standing now by her side and he held out his hand to mr sabin  i hope sir he said pleasantly that you bear me no illwill  it would be madness mr sabin answered to be the most beautiful peeress in england is perhaps for helene a happier fate than to be the first queen of a new dynasty  and you uncle helene said you are back from your exile then how often i have felt disposed to smile when i thought of you of all men in america  i went into exile mr sabin answered and i found paradise the three years which have passed since i saw you last have been the happiest of my life  lucille helene exclaimed  is my wife mr sabin answered  delightful helene murmured she is with you then i hope indeed i felt sure that i saw her the other night at the opera  at the opera mr sabin for a moment was silent he would have been ashamed to confess that his heart was beating strongly that a crowd of eager questions trembled upon his lips he recovered himself after a moment  lucille is not with me for the moment he said in measured tones i am detaining you from your guests helene if you will permit me i will call upon you  wont you join us lord camperdown asked courteously we are only a small partythe portuguese ambassador and his wife the duke of medchester and stanley phillipson  mr sabin rose at once  i shall be delighted he said  lord camperdown hesitated for a moment  i present monsieur le due de souspennier i presume he remarked smiling  mr sabin bowed  i am mr sabin he said at the hotels and places where one travels to my friends i have no longer an incognito it is not necessary  it was a brilliant little supper party and mr sabin contributed at least his share to the general entertainment before they dispersed he had to bring out his tablets to make notes of his engagements he stood on the top of the steps above the palmcourt to wish them goodbye leaning on his stick helene turned back and waved her hand  he is unchanged she murmured yet i fear that there must be trouble  why he seemed cheerful enough her husband remarked  she dropped her voice a little  lucille is in london she is staying at dorset house    chapter x  mr sabin was deep in thought he sat in an easychair with his back to the window his hands crossed upon his stick his eyes fixed upon the fire duson was moving noiselessly about the room cutting the mornings supply of newspapers and setting them out upon the table his master was in a mood which he had been taught to respect it was mr sabin who broke the silence  duson  your grace  i have always as you know ignored your somewhat anomalous position as the servant of one man and the slave of a society the questions which i am about to ask you you can answer or not according to your own apprehensions of what is due to each  i thank your grace  my departure from america seemed to incite the most violent opposition on the part of your friends as you know it was with a certain amount of difficulty that i reached this country now however i am left altogether alone i have not received a single warning letter my comings and goings although purposely devoid of the slightest secrecy are absolutely undisturbed yet i have some reason to believe that your mistress is in london  your grace will pardon me duson said but there is outside a gentleman waiting to see you to whom you might address the same questions with better results for compared with him i know nothing it is monsieur felix  why have you kept him waiting mr sabin asked  your grace was much absorbed duson answered  felix was smoking a cigarette and mr sabin greeted him with a certain grim cordiality  is this permittedthis visit he asked himself selecting a cigarette and motioning his guest to a chair  it is even encouraged felix answered  you have perhaps some message  none  i am glad to see you mr sabin said just now i am a little puzzled i will put the matter to you you shall answer or not at your own discretion  i am ready felix declared  you know the difficulty with which i escaped from america mr sabin continued every means which ingenuity could suggest seemed brought to bear against me and every movement was directed if not from here from some place in europe well i arrived here four days ago i live quite openly i have even abjured to some extent my incognito yet i have not received even a warning letter i am left absolutely undisturbed  felix looked at him thoughtfully  and what do you deduce from this he asked  i do not like it mr sabin answered drily  after all felix remarked it is to some extent natural the very openness of your life here makes interference with you more difficult and as to warning letterswell you have proved the uselessness of them  perhaps mr sabin answered at the same time if i were a superstitious person i should consider this inaction ominous  you must take account also felix said of the difference in the countries in england the police system if not the most infallible in the world is certainly the most incorruptible there was never a country in which security of person and life was so keenly watched over as here in america up to a certain point a man is expected to look after himself the same feeling does not prevail here  mr sabin assented  and therefore he remarked for the purposes of your friends i should consider this a difficult and unpromising country in which to work  other countries other methods felix remarked laconically  exactly it is the new methods which i am anxious to discover mr sabin said no glimmering of them as yet has been vouchsafed to me yet i believe that i am right in assuming that for the moment london is the headquarters of your friends and that lucille is here  if that is meant for a question felix said i may not answer it  mr sabin nodded  yet he suggested your visit has an object to discover my plans perhaps you are welcome to them  felix thoughtfully knocked the ashes off his cigarette  my visit had an object he admitted but it was a personal one i am not actually concerned in the doings of those whom you have called my friends  we are alone mr sabin reminded him my time is yours  you and i felix said have had our periods of bitter enmity with your marriage to lucille these so far as i am concerned ended for ever i will even admit that in my younger days i was prejudiced against you that has passed away you have been all your days a bold and unscrupulous schemer but ends have at any rate been worthy ones today i am able to regard you with feelings of friendliness you are the husband of my dear sister and for years i know that you made her very happy i ask you will you believe in this statement of my attitude towards you  i do not for a single moment doubt it mr sabin answered  you will regard the advice which i am going to offer as disinterested  certainly  then i offer it to you earnestly and with my whole heart take the next steamer and go back to america  and leave lucille go without making any effort to see her  yes  mr sabin was for a moment very serious indeed the advice given in such a manner was full of forebodings to him the lines from the corners of his mouth seemed graven into his face  felix he said slowly i am sometimes conscious of the fact that i am passing into that period of life which we call old age my ambitions are dead my energies are weakened for many years i have toiledthe time has come for rest of all the great passions which i have felt there remains but onelucille life without her is worth nothing to me i am weary of solitude i am weary of everything except lucille how then can i listen to such advice for me it must be lucille or that little journey into the mists from which one does not return  felix was silent the pathos of this thing touched him  i will not dispute the right of those who have taken her from me mr sabin continued but i want her back she is necessary to me my purse my life my brains are there to be thrown into the scales i will buy her or fight for her or rejoin their ranks myself but i want her back  still felix was silent he was looking steadfastly into the fire  you have heard me mr sabin said  i have heard you felix answered my advice stands  i know now mr sabin said that i have a hard task before me they shall have me for a friend or an enemy i can still make myself felt as either you have nothing more to say  nothing  then let us part company mr sabin said or talk of something more cheerful you depress me felix let duson bring us wine you look like a deaths head  felix roused himself  you will go your own way he said now that you have chosen i will tell you this i am glad yes let duson bring wine i will drink to your health and to your success there have been times when men have performed miracles i shall drink to that miracle  duson brought also a letter which mr sabin with a nod towards felix opened it was from helene       15 park lane london      thursday morning       my dear uncle       i want you to come to luncheon today  the princess de catelan is      here and i am expecting also mr brott the home secretaryour      one great politician you know  many people say that he is the      most interesting man in england and must be our next prime minister      such people interest you i know  do come                                                    yours sincerely                                                        helene  mr sabin repeated the name to himself as he stood for a moment with the letter in his hand  brott what a name for a statesman well here is your health felix i do not often drink wine in the morning but  he broke off in the middle of his sentence the glass which felix had been in the act of raising to his lips lay shattered upon the floor and a little stream of wine trickled across the carpet felix himself seemed scarcely conscious of the disaster his cheeks were white and he leaned across the table towards mr sabin  what name did you saywhat name  mr sabin referred again to the letter which he held in his hand  brott he repeated he is home secretary i believe  what do you know about him  nothing mr sabin answered my niece the countess of camperdown asks me to meet him today at luncheon explain yourself my young friend there is a fresh glass by your side  felix poured himself out a glass and drank it off but he remained silent  well  felix picked up his gloves and stick  you are asked to meet mr brott at luncheon today  yes  are you going  certainly  felix nodded  very good he said i should advise you to cultivate his acquaintance he is a very extraordinary man  come felix mr sabin said you owe me something more lucid in the way of explanations who is he  a statesmansuccessful ambitious he expects to be prime minister  and what have i to do with him or he with me mr sabin asked quietly  felix shook his head  i cannot tell you he said yet i fancy that you and he may some time be drawn together  mr sabin asked no more questions but he promptly sat down and accepted his nieces invitation when he looked round felix had gone he rang the bell for duson and handed him the note  my town clothes duson he ordered i am lunching out  the man bowed and withdrew mr sabin remained for a few moments in deep thought  brott he repeated brott it is a singular name    chapter xi  so this was the man mr sabin did not neglect his luncheon nor was he ever for a moment unmindful of the greyheaded princess who chatted away by his side with all the vivacity of her race and sex but he watched mr brott  a man this mr sabin was a judge and he appraised him rightly he saw through that courteous geniality of tone and gesture the readymade smile although it seemed natural enough did not deceive him underneath was a man of iron squarejawed nervous forceful mr brott was probably at that time the ablest politician of either party in the country mr sabin knew it he found himself wondering exactly at what point of their lives this man and he would come into contact  after luncheon helene brought them together  i believe she said to mr brott that you have never met my uncle may i make you formally acquainted uncle this is mr brott whom you must know a great deal about even though you have been away for so longthe duc de souspennier  the two men bowed and helene passed on mr sabin leaned upon his stick and watched keenly for any sign in the others face if he expected to find it he was disappointed either this man had no knowledge of who he was or those things which were to come between them were as yet unborn  they strolled together after the other guests into the winter gardens which were the envy of every hostess in london mr sabin lit a cigarette mr brott regretfully declined he neither smoked nor drank wine yet he was disposed to be friendly and selected a seat where they were a little apart from the other guests  you at least he remarked in answer to an observation of mr sabins are free from the tyranny of politics i am assuming of course that your country under its present form of government has lost its hold upon you  mr sabin smiled  it is a doubtful boon he said it is true that i am practically an exile republican france has no need of me had i been a soldier i could still have remained a patriot but for one whose leanings were towards politics neither my father before me nor i could be of service to our country you should be thankful he continued with a slight smile that you are an englishman no constitution in the world can offer so much to the politician who is strong enough and fearless enough  mr brott glanced towards his twinkling eyes  do you happen to know what my politics are he asked  mr sabin hesitated  your views i know are advanced he said for the rest i have been abroad for years i have lost touch a little with affairs in this country  i am afraid mr brott said that i shall shock you you are an aristocrat of the aristocrats i a democrat of the democrats the people are the only masters whom i own they first sent me to parliament  yet mr sabin remarked you are i understand in the cabinet  mr brott glanced for a moment around the prime minister was somewhere in the winter gardens  that he declared is an accident i happened to be the only man available who could do the work when lord kilbrooke died i am telling you only what is an open secret but i am afraid i am boring you shall we join the others  not unless you yourself are anxious to mr sabin begged it is scarcely fair to detain you talking to an old man when there are so many charming women here but i should be sorry for you to think me hidebound in my prejudices you must remember that the revolution decimated my family it was a long time ago but the horror of it is still a live thing  yet it was the natural outcome mr brott said of the things which went before such hideous misgovernment as generations of your countrymen had suffered was logically bound to bring its own reprisal  there is truth in what you say mr sabin admitted he did not want to talk about the french revolution  you are a stranger in london are you not mr brott asked  i feel myself one mr sabin answered i have been away for a few years and i do not think that there is a city in the world where social changes are so rapid i should perhaps except the cities of the country from which i have come but then america is a universe of itself  for an instant mr brott gave signs of the man underneath the air of polite interest had left his face he glanced swiftly and keenly at his companion mr sabins expression was immutable it was he who scored for he marked the change whilst mr brott could not be sure whether he had noticed it or not  you have been living in america then  for several yearsyes  it is a country mr brott said which i am particularly anxious to visit i see my chances however grow fewer and fewer as the years go by  for one like yourself mr sabin said whose instincts and sympathies are wholly with the democracy a few months in america would be very well spent  and you mr brott remarked how did you get on with the people  mr sabin traced a pattern with his stick upon the marble floor  i lived in the country he said i played golf and read and rested  were you anywhere near new york mr brott asked  a few hours journey only mr sabin answered my home was in a very picturesque part near lenox  mr brott leaned a little forward  you perhaps know then a lady who spent some time in that neighbourhooda mrs james peterson her husband was i believe the american consul in vienna  mr sabin smiled very faintly his face betrayed no more than a natural and polite interest there was nothing to indicate the fact that his heart was beating like the heart of a young man that the blood was rushing hot through his veins  yes he said i know her very well is she in london  mr brott hesitated he seemed a little uncertain how to continue  to tell you the truth he said i believe that she has reasons for desiring her present whereabouts to remain unknown i should perhaps not have mentioned her name at all it was i fancy indiscreet of me the coincidence of hearing you mention the name of the place where i believe she resided surprised my question with your permission we will abandon the subject  you disappoint me mr sabin said quietly it would have given me much pleasure to have resumed my acquaintance with the lady in question  you will without doubt have an opportunity mr brott said glancing at his watch and suddenly rising dear me how the time goes  he rose to his feet mr sabin also rose  must i understand he said in a low tone that you are not at liberty to give me mrs petersons address  i am not at liberty even mr brott answered with a frown to mention her name it will give me great pleasure duke to better my acquaintance with you will you dine with me at the house of commons one night next week  i shall be charmed mr sabin answered my address for the next few days is at the carlton i am staying there under my family name of sabinmr sabin it is a fancy of mineit has been ever since i became an aliento use my title as little as possible  mr brott looked for a moment puzzled  your pseudonym he remarked thoughtfully seems very familiar to me  mr sabin shrugged his shoulders  it is a family name he remarked but i flattered myself that it was at least uncommon  fancy no doubt mr brott remarked turning to make his adieux to his hostess  mr sabin joined a fresh group of idlers under the palms mr brott lingered over his farewells  your uncle lady camperdown he said is delightful i enjoy meeting new types and he represents to me most perfectly the old order of french aristocracy  i am glad helene said that you found him interesting i felt sure you would in fact i asked him especially to meet you  you are the most thoughtful of hostesses he assured her by the bye your uncle has just told me the name by which he is known at the hotel mr sabin sabin it recalls something to my mind i cannot exactly remember what  she smiled upon him people generally forgot things when helene smiled  it is an odd fancy of his to like his title so little she remarked at heart no one is prouder of their family and antecedents i have heard him say though that an exile had better leave behind him even his name  sabin mr brott repeated sabin  it is an old family name she murmured  his face suddenly cleared she knew that he had remembered but he took his leave with no further reference to it  sabin he repeated to himself when alone in his carriage that was the name of the man who was supposed to be selling plans to the german government poor renshaw was in a terrible stew about it sabin an uncommon name  he had ordered the coachman to drive to the house of commons suddenly he pulled the checkstring  call at dorset house he directed                                                      mr sabin lingered till nearly the last of the guests had gone then he led helene once more into the winter gardens  may i detain you for one moments gossip he asked i see your carriage at the door  she laughed  it is nothing she declared i must drive in the park for an hour one sees ones friends and it is cool and refreshing after these heated rooms but at any time talk to me as long as you will and then i will drop you at the carlton  it is of brott he remarked ah i thank you i will smoke your husbands taste in cigarettes is excellent  perhaps mine she laughed  mr sabin shrugged his shoulders  in either case i congratulate you this man brott he interests me  he interests every one why not he is a great personality  politically mr sabin said the gauge of his success is of course the measure of the man but he himselfwhat manner of a man is he  she tapped with her fingers upon the little table by their side  he is rich she said and an uncommon mixture of the student and the man of society he refuses many more invitations than he accepts he entertains very seldom but very magnificently he has never been known to pay marked attentions to any woman even the scandal of the clubs has passed him by what else can i say about him i wonder she continued reflectively nothing i think except this he is a strong man you know that that counts for much  mr sabin was silent perhaps he was measuring his strength in some imagined encounter with this man something in his face alarmed helene she suddenly leaned forward and looked at him more closely  uncle she exclaimed in a low voice there is something on your mind do not tell me that once more you are in the maze that again you have schemes against this country  he smiled at her sadly enough but she was reassured  you need have no fear he told her with politicsi have finished why i am here what i am here for i will tell you very soon it is to find one whom i have lostand who is dear to me forgive me if for today i say no more come if you will you shall drive me to my hotel  he offered his arm with the courtly grace which he knew so well how to assume together they passed out to her carriage    chapter xii  after all lady carey sighed throwing down a racing calendar and lighting a cigarette london is the only thoroughly civilized anglosaxon capital in the world please dont look at me like that duchess i knowthis is your holy of holies but the duke smokes hereive seen him my cigarettes are very tiny and very harmless  the duchess who wore goldrimmed spectacles and was a person of weight in the councils of the primrose league went calmly on with her knitting  my dear muriel she said if my approval or disapproval was of the slightest moment to you it is not your smoking of which i should first complain i know however that you consider yourself a privileged person pray do exactly as you like but dont drop the ashes upon the carpet  lady carey laughed softly  i suppose i am rather a thorn in your side as a relative she remarked you must put it down to the roving blood of my ancestors i could no more live the life of you other women than i could fly i must have excitement movement all the time  a tall heavily built man who had been reading some letters at the other end of the room came sauntering up to them  well he said you assuredly live up to your principles for you travel all over the world as though it were one vast playground  and sometimes she remarked my journeys are not exactly successful i know that that is what you are dying to say  on the contrary he said i do not blame you at all for this last affair you brought lucille here which was excellent your failure as regards mr sabin is scarcely to be fastened upon you it is horser whom we hold responsible for that  she laughed  poor horser it was rather rough to pit a creature like that against souspennier  the man shrugged his shoulders  horser he said may not be brilliant but he had a great organisation at his back souspennier was without friends or influence the contest should scarcely have been so onesided to tell you the truth my dear muriel i am more surprised that you yourself should have found the task beyond you  lady careys face darkened  it was too soon after the loss of lucille she said and besides there was his vanity to be reckoned with it was like a challenge to him and he had taken up the glove before i returned to new york  the duchess looked up from her work  have you had any conversation with my husband prince she asked  the prince of saxe leinitzer twirled his heavy moustache and sank into a chair between the two women  i have had a long talk with him he announced and the result the duchess asked  the result i fear you would scarcely consider satisfactory the prince declared the moment that i hinted at the existence oferconditions of which you duchess are aware he showed alarm and i had all that i could do to reassure him i find it everywhere amongst your aristocracythis stubborn confidence in the existence of the reigning order of things this absolute detestation of anything approaching intrigue  my dear man i hope you dont include me lady carey exclaimed  you lady muriel he answered with a slow smile are an exception to all rules no you are a rule by yourself  to revert to the subject then for a moment the duchess said stiffly you have made no progress with the duke  none whatever saxe leinitzer admitted he was sufficiently emphatic to inspire me with every caution even now i have doubts as to whether i have altogether reassured him i really believe dear duchess that we should be better off if you could persuade him to go and live upon his estates  the duchess smiled grimly  whilst the house of lords exists she remarked you will never succeed in keeping algernon away from london he is always on the point of making a speech although he never does it  i have heard of that speech lady carey drawled from her low seat it is to be a thoroughly enlightening affair all the great social questions are to be permanently disposed of the prime minister will come on his knees and beg algernon to take his place  the duchess looked up over her knitting  algernon is at least in earnest she remarked drily and he has the good conscience of a clean living and honest man  what an unpleasant possession it must be lady carey remarked sweetly i disposed of my conscience finally many years ago i am not sure but i believe that it was the prince to whom i entrusted the burying of it by the bye lucille will be here directly i suppose is she to be told of souspenniers arrival in london  i imagine the prince said with knitted brows that it will not be wise to keep it from her it is impossible to conceal her whereabouts and the papers will very shortly acquaint her with his  and lady carey asked how does the little affair progress  admirably the prince answered already some of the society papers are beginning to chatter about the friendship existing between a cabinet minister and a beautiful hungarian lady of title etc etc the fact of it is that brott is in deadly earnest he gives himself away every time if lucille has not lost old cleverness she will be able to twist him presently around her little finger  if only some one would twist him on the rack the duchess murmured vindictively i tried to read one of his speeches the other day it was nothing more nor less than blasphemy i do not think that i am naturally a cruel woman but i would hand such men over to the public executioner with joy  lucille came in as beautiful as ever but with tired lines under her full dark eyes she sank into a low chair with listless grace  reginald brott again i suppose she remarked curtly i wish the man had never existed  that is a very cruel speech lucille the prince said with a languishing glance towards her for if it had not been for brott we should never have dared to call you out from your seclusion  then more heartily than ever lucille declared i wish the man had never been born you cannot possibly flatter yourself prince that your summons was a welcome one  he shrugged his shoulders  i shall never be able to believe he said that the countess radantz was able to do more than support existence in a small american townwithout society with no scope for her ambitions detached altogether from the whole civilized world  which only goes to prove prince lucille remarked contemptuously that you do not understand me in the least as a place of residence lenox would compare very favourably withsay homburg and for companionship you forget my husband i never met the woman yet who did not prefer the company of one man if only it were the right one to the cosmopolitan throng we call society  it sounds idyllic but very gauche lady carey remarked drily in effect it is rather a blow on the cheek for you prince of course you know that the prince is in love with you lucille  i wish he were she answered looking lazily out of the window  he bent over her  why  i would persuade him to send me home again she answered coldly  the duchess looked up from her knitting your husband has saved you the journey she remarked even if you were able to work upon the princes good nature to such an extent  lucille started round eagerly  what do you mean she cried  your husband is in london the duchess answered  lucille laughed with the gaiety of a child like magic the lines from beneath her eyes seemed to have vanished lady carey watched her with pale cheeks and malevolent expression  come prince she cried mockingly it was only a week ago that you assured me that my husband could not leave america already he is in london i must go to see him oh i insist upon it  saxe leinitzer glanced towards the duchess she laid down her knitting  my dear countess she said firmly i beg that you will listen to me carefully i speak to you for your own good and i believe i may add prince that i speak with authority  with authority the prince echoed  we all the duchess continued look upon your husbands arrival as inopportune and unfortunate we are all agreed that you must be kept apart certain obligations have been laid upon you you could not possibly fulfil them with a husband at your elbow the matter will be put plainly before your husband as i am now putting it before you he will be warned not to attempt to see or communicate with you as your husband if he or you disobey the consequences will be serious  lucille shrugged her shoulders  it is easy to talk she said but you will not find it easy to keep victor away when he has found out where i am  the prince intervened  we have no objection to your meeting he said but it must be as acquaintances there must be no intermission or slackening in your task and that can only be properly carried out by the countess radantz and from dorset house  lucille smothered her disappointment  dear me she said you will find victor a little hard to persuade  there was a moments silence then the prince spoke slowly and watching carefully the effect of his words upon lucille  countess he said it has been our pleasure to make of your task so far as possible a holiday yet perhaps it is wiser to remind you that underneath the glove is an iron hand we do not often threaten but we brook no interference we have the means to thwart it i bear no illwill to your husband but to you i say this if he should be so mad as to defy us to incite you to disobedience he must pay the penalty  a servant entered  mr reginald brott is in the small drawingroom your grace he announced he enquired for the countess radantz  lucille rose when the servant had disappeared she turned round for a moment and faced the prince a spot of colour burned in her cheeks her eyes were bright with anger  i shall remember your words prince she said so far from mine being however a holiday task it is one of the most wearisome and unpleasant i ever undertook and in return for your warnings let me tell you this if you should bring any harm upon my husband you shall answer for it all your days to me i will do my duty be careful that you do not exceed yours  she swept out of the room lady carey laughed mockingly at the prince  poor ferdinand she exclaimed    chapter xiii  he had been kept waiting longer than usual and he had somehow the feeling that his visit was illtimed when at last she came to him he looked up eagerly as she entered the little reception room which he had grown to know so well during the last few weeks and it struck him for the first time that her welcome was a little forced her eyes a little weary  i havent he said apologetically the least right to be here  at least she murmured i may be permitted to remind you that you are here without an invitation  the worse luck he said that one should be necessary  this is the one hour of the day she remarked sinking into a large easychair which i devote to repose how shall i preserve my fleeting youth if you break in upon it in this ruthless manner  if i could only truthfully say that i was sorry he answered but i cant i am hereand i would rather be here than anywhere else in the world  she looked at him with curving lips and even he who had watched her often could not tell whether that curve was of scorn or mirth  they told me she said impressively that you were differenta womanhater honest gruff a little cynical yet those are the speeches of your salad days what a disenchantment  the things which one invents when one is young he said come perhaps fresh from the heart in later life the words may sound the same but there is a difference  come she said you are improving that at any rate is ingenious suppose you tell me now what has brought you here before four oclock when i am not fit to be seen  he smiled she shrugged her shoulders  i mean it i havent either my clothes or my manners on yet come explain  i met a man who interested me he answered he comes from america from lenox  he saw her whiten he saw her fingers clutch the sides of her chair  from lenox and his name  the duke of souspennier he takes himself so seriously that he even travels incognito at the hotel he calls himself mr sabin  indeed  i wondered whether you might not know him  yes i know him  and in connection with this man brott continued i have something in the nature of a confession to make i forgot for a moment your request i even mentioned your name  the pallor had spread to her cheeks even to her lips yet her eyes were soft and brilliant so brilliant that they fascinated him  what did he say what did he ask  he asked for your address dont be afraid i made some excuse i did not give it  for the life of him he could not tell whether she was pleased or disappointed she had turned her shoulder to him she was looking steadily out of the window and he could not see her face  why are you curious about him she asked  i wish i knew i think only because he came from lenox  she turned her face slowly round towards him he was astonished to see the dark rings under her eyes the weariness of her smile  the duke of souspennier she said slowly is an old and a dear friend of mine when you tell me that he is in london i am anxious because there are many here who are not his friendswho have no cause to love him  i was wrong then he said not to give him your address  you were right she answered i am anxious that he should not know it you will remember this he rose and bowed over her hand  this has been a selfish interlude he said i have destroyed your rest and i almost fear that i have also disturbed your peace of mind let me take my leave and pray that you may recover both  she shook her head  do not leave me she said i am lowspirited you shall stay and cheer me  there was a light in his eyes which few people would have recognised she rose with a little laugh and stood leaning towards the fire her elbow upon the broad mantel tall graceful alluring her soft crimson gown with its wealth of old lace fell around her in lines and curves full of grace the pallor of her face was gone nowthe warmth of the fire burned her cheeks her voice became softer  sit down and talk to me she murmured do you remember the old days when you were a very timid young secretary of sir george nomsom and i was a maidofhonour at the viennese court dear me how you have changed  time he said will not stand still for all of us yet my memory tells me how possible it would befor indeed those days seem but as yesterday  he looked up at her with a sudden jealousy his tone shook with passion no one would have recognised brott now in his fiercest hour of debate his hour of greatest trial he had worn his mask always master of himself and his speech and now he had cast it off his eyes were hungry his lips twitched  as yesterday lucille i could kill you when i think of those days for twenty years your kiss has lain upon my lipsand youwith youit has been different  she laughed softly upon him laughed more with her eyes than with her lips she watched him curiously  dear me she murmured what would you have i am a womani have been a woman all my days and the memory of one kiss grows cold so i will admit that with meit has been different come what then  he groaned  i wonder he said what miserable fate what cursed stroke of fortune brought you once more into my life  she threw her head back and laughed at him this time heartily unaffectedly  what adorable candour she exclaimed my dear friend how amiable you are  he looked at her steadfastly and somehow the laugh died away from her lips  lucille will you marry me  marry you i certainly not  and why not  for a score of reasons if you want them she answered first because i think it is delightful to have you for a friend i can never quite tell what you are going to do or say as a husband i am almost sure that you would be monotonous but then how could you avoid it it is madness to think of destroying a pleasant friendship in such a manner  you are mocking me he said sadly  well she said why not your own proposal is a mockery  a mockery my proposal  yes she answered steadily you know quite well that the very thought of such a thing between you and me is an absurdity i abhor your politics i detest your party you are ambitious i know you intend to be prime minister a peoples prime minister well for my part i hate the people i am an aristocrat as your wife i should be in a perfectly ridiculous position how foolish you have led me into talking of this thing seriously let us forget all this rubbish  he stood before herwaiting patiently his mouth close set his manner dogged with purpose  it is not rubbish he said it is true that i shall be prime minister it is true also that you will be my wife  she shrank back from himuneasily the fire in his eyes the ring in his tone distressed her  as for my politics you do not understand them but you shall i will convert you to my way of thinking yes i will do that the cause of the people of freedom is the one great impulse which beats through all the world you too shall hear it  thank you she said i have no wish to hear it i do not believe in what you call freedom for the people i have discovered in america how uncomfortable a peoples country can be  yet you married an american you call yourself still the countess radantz but you married mr james b peterson  it is true my friend she answered but the american in question was a person of culture and intelligence and at heart he was no more a democrat than i am further i am an extravagant woman and he was a millionaire  and you after his death without necessitywent to bury yourself in his country  why not  i am jealous of every year of your life which lies hidden from me he said slowly  dear mehow uncomfortable  before youreappeared he said i had learnt yes i had learnt to do without you i had sealed up the one chapter of my life which had in it anything to do with sentiment your coming has altered all that you have disturbed the focus of my ambitions lucille i have loved you for more than half a lifetime isnt it time i had my reward  he took a quick step towards her in his tone was the ring of mastery the light in his eyes was compelling she shrank back but he seized one of her hands it lay between his a cold dead thing  what have my politics to do with it he asked fiercely you are not an englishwoman be content that i shall set you far above these gods of my later life there is my work to be done and i shall do it let me be judge of these things believe me that it is a great work if you are ambitiousgive your ambitions into my keeping and i will gratify them only i cannot bear this suspensethese changing moods marry menow at once or send me back to the old life  she drew her fingers away and sank down into her easychair her head was buried in her hands was she thinking or weeping he could not decide while he hesitated she looked up and he saw that there was no trace of tears upon her face  you are too masterful she said gently i will not marry you i will not give myself body and soul to any man yet that is what you ask i am not a girl my opinions are as dear to me in their way as yours are to you you want me to close my eyes while you drop sugar plums into my mouth that is not my idea of life i think that you had better go away let us forget these things  very well he answered it shall be as you say he did not wait for her to ring nor did he attempt any sort of farewell he simply took up his hat and before she could realise his intention he had left the room lucille sat quite still looking into the fire  if only she murmured if only this were the end    chapter xiv  duson entered the sittingroom noiseless as ever with pale passionless face the absolute prototype of the perfect french servant to whom any expression of vigorous life seems to savour of presumption he carried a small silver salver on which reposed a card  the gentleman is in the anteroom sir he announced  mr sabin took up the card and studied it  lord robert foulkes  do i know this gentleman duson mr sabin asked  not to my knowledge sir the man answered  you must show him in mr sabin said with a sigh in this country one must never be rude to a lord  duson obeyed lord robert foulkes was a small young man very carefully groomed nondescript in appearance he smiled pleasantly at mr sabin and drew off his gloves  how do you do mr sabin he said dont remember me i daresay met you once or twice last time you were in london i wish i could say that i was glad to see you here again  mr sabins forehead lost its wrinkle he knew where he was now  sit down lord robert he begged i do not remember you it is true but i am getting an old man my memory sometimes plays me strange tricks  the young man looked at mr sabin and laughed softly indeed mr sabin had very little the appearance of an old man he was leaning with both hands clasped upon his stick his face alert his eyes bright and searching  you carry your years well mr sabin yet while we are on the subject do you know that london is the unhealthiest city in the world  i am always remarkably well here mr sabin said drily  london has changed since your last visit lord robert said with a gentle smile believe me if i sayas your sincere wellwisherthat there is something in the air at present positively unwholesome to you i am not sure that unwholesome is not too weak a word  is this official mr sabin asked quietly  the young man fingered the gold chain which disappeared in his trousers pocket  need i introduce myself he asked  quite unnecessary mr sabin assured him permit me to reflect for a few minutes your visit comes upon me as a surprise will you smoke there are cigarettes at your elbow  i am entirely at your service lord robert answered thanks i will try one of your cigarettes you were always famous for your tobacco  there was a short silence mr sabin had seldom found it more difficult to see the way before him  i imagined he said at last from several little incidents which occurred previous to my leaving new york that my presence here was regarded as superfluous do you know i believe that i could convince you to the contrary  lord robert raised his eyebrows  mr dear mr sabin he said pray reflect i am a messenger no more a hired commissionaire  mr sabin bowed  you are an ambassador he said  the young man shook his head  you magnify my position he declared my errand is done when i remind you that it is many years since you visited paris that vienna is as fascinating a city as ever and pesth a few hours journey beyond but londonno london is not possible for you after the seventh day from this london would be worse than impossible  mr sabin smoked thoughtfully for a few moments  lord robert he said i have i believe the right of a personal appeal i desire to make it  lord robert looked positively distressed  my dear sir he said the right of appeal any right of any sort belongs only to those within the circle  exactly mr sabin agreed i claim to belong there  lord roberts shrugged his shoulders  you force me to remind you he said of a certain decreea decree of expulsion passed five years ago and of which i presume due notification was given to you  mr sabin shook his head very slowly  i deny the legality of that decree he said there can be no such thing as expulsion  there was lefanu lord robert murmured  he died mr sabin answered that was reasonable enough  your services had been great lord robert said and your fault was but venial  nevertheless mr sabin said the one was logical the other is not  you claim then the young man said to be still within the circle  certainly  you are aware that this is a very dangerous claim  mr sabin smiled but he said nothing lord robert hastened to excuse himself  i beg your pardon he said i should have known better than to have used such a word to you permit me to take my leave  mr sabin rose  i thank you sir he said for the courteous manner in which you have discharged your mission  lord robert bowed  my good wishes he said are yours  mr sabin when alone called duson to him  have you any report to make duson he asked  none sir  mr sabin dismissed him impatiently  after all i am getting old he is young and he is stronga worthy antagonist come let us see what this little volume has to say about him  he turned over the pages rapidly and read aloud  reginald cyril brott born 18 son of john reginald brott esq of manchester educated at harrow and merton college cambridge ma lld and winner of the rudlock history prize also tenth wrangler entered the diplomatic service on leaving college and served as junior attache at vienna  mr sabin laid down the volume and made a little calculation at the end of it he had made a discovery his face was very white and set  i was at petersburg he muttered now i think of it i heard something of a young english attache but  he touched the bell  duson a carriage  at camperdown house he learned that helene was outshopping the hall porter believed mr sabin drove slowly down bond street and was rewarded by seeing her brougham outside a famous milliners he waited for her upon the pavement presently she came out and smiled her greetings upon him  you were waiting for me she asked  i saw your carriage  how delightful of you let me take you back to luncheon  he shook his head  i am afraid he said that i should be poor company may i drive home with you at any rate when you have finished  of course you may and for luncheon we shall be quite alone unless somebody drops in  he took his seat beside her in the carriage helene he said i am interested in mr brott no dont look at me like that you need have no fear my interest is in him as a man and not as a politician the other days are over and done with now i am on the defensive and hard pressed  her face was bright with sympathy she forgot everything except her old admiration for him in the clashing of their wills the victory had remained with her and as for those things which he had done the cause at least had been a great one her happiness had come to her through him she bore him no grudge for that fierce opposition which after all had been fruitless  i believe you uncle she said affectionately if i can help you in any way i will  this mr brott he goes very little into society i believe  scarcely ever she answered he came to us because my husband is one of the few radical peers  you have not heard of any recent change in himin this respect  well i did hear wolfendon chaffing him the other day about somebody she said oh i know he has been going often to the duchess of dorsets he is such an ultra radical you know and the dorsets are fierce tories wolfendon says it is a most unwise thing for a good radical who wants to retain the confidence of the people to be seen about with a duchess  the duchess of dorset mr sabin remarked must be wella middleaged woman  helene laughed  she is sixty if she is a day but i daresay she herself is not the attraction there is a very beautiful woman staying with herthe countess radantz a hungarian i believe  mr sabin sat quite still his face was turned away from helene she herself was smiling out of the window at some acquaintances  i wonder if there is anything more that i can tell you she asked presently  he turned towards her with a faint smile  you have told me he said all that i want to know  she was struck by the change in his face the quietness of his tone was ominous  am i meant to understand she said dubiously because i dont in the least it seems to me that have told you nothing i cannot imagine what mr brott and you have in common  if your invitation to lunch still holds good he said may i accept it afterwards if you can spare me a few minutes i will make things quite clear to you  she laughed  you will find she declared that i shall leave you little peace for luncheon i am consumed with curiosity    chapter xv  nevertheless mr sabin lunched with discretion as usual but with no lack of appetite it chanced that they were alone lord camperdown was down in the midlands for a days hunting and helene had ensured their seclusion from any one who might drop in by a whispered word to the hall porter as they passed into the house it seemed to her that she had never found mr sabin more entertaining had never more appreciated his rare gift of effortless and anecdotal conversation what a marvelous memory he knew something of every country from the inside he had been brought at various times during his long diplomatic career into contact with most of the interesting people in the world he knew well how to separate the grain from the chaff according to the tastes of his listener the pathos of his present position appealed to her irresistibly the possibilities of his life had been so great fortune had treated him always so strangely the greatest of his schemes had come so near to success the luck had turned against him only at the very moment of fruition helene felt very kindly towards her uncle as she led him after luncheon to a quiet corner of the winter garden where a servant had already arranged a table with coffee and liqueurs and cigarettes unscrupulous all his life there had been an element of greatness in all his schemes even his failures had been magnificent for his successes he himself had seldom reaped the reward and now in the autumn of his days she felt dimly that he was threatened with some evil thing against which he stood at bay singlehanded likely perhaps to be overpowered for there was something in his face just now which was strange to her  helene he said quietly i suppose that you who knew nothing of me till you left school have looked upon me always as a selfish passionless creaturea weaver of plots perhaps sometimes a dreamer of dreams but a person wholly selfcentred always selfengrossed  she shook her head  not selfish she objected no i never thought that it is the wrong word  at least he said you will be surprised to hear that i have loved one woman all my life  she looked at him half doubtfully  yes she said i am surprised to hear that  i will surprise you still more i was married to her in america within a month of my arrival there we have lived together ever since and i have been very happy i speak of course of lucille  it is amazing she murmured you must tell me all about it  not all he answered sadly only this i met her first at vienna when i was thirtyfive and she was eighteen i treated her shamefully marriage seemed to me with all my dreams of great achievements an act of madness i believed in myself and my career i believed that it was my destiny to restore the monarchy to our beloved country and i wanted to be free i think that i saw myself a second napoleon so i won her love took all that she had to give and returned nothing  in the course of years she married the son of the american consul at vienna i was obliged by the bye to fight her brother and he carried his enmity to me through life i saw her sometimes in the course of years she was always beautiful always surrounded by a host of admirers always cold when the end of my great plans here came and i myself was a fugitive her brother found me out he gave me a letter to deliver in america i delivered itto his sister  she was as beautiful as ever and alone in the world it seemed to me that i realised then how great my folly had been for always i had loved her always there had been that jealously locked little chamber in my life helene she pointed no finger of scorn to my broken life she uttered no reproaches she took me as i was and for three years our life together has been to me one long unbroken harmony our tastes were very similar she was well read receptive a charming companion ennui was a word of which i have forgotten the meaning and it seemed so with her too for she grew younger and more beautiful  and why is she not with you helene cried i must go and see her how delightful it sounds  one day about three months ago mr sabin continued she left me to go to new york for two days her milliner in paris had sent over and twice a year lucille used to buy clothes i had sometimes accompanied her but she knew how i detested new york and this time she did not press me to go she left me in the highest spirits as tender and gracefully affectionate as ever she never returned  helene started in her chair  oh uncle she cried  i have never seen her since he repeated  have you no clue she could not have left you willingly have you no idea where she is  he bowed his head slowly  yes he said i know where she is she came to europe with lady carey she is staying with the duchess of dorset  the countess radantz helene cried  it was her maiden name he answered  there was a moments silence helene was bewildered  then you have seen her  he shook his head slowly  no i did not even know where she was until you told me  but why do you wait a single moment she asked there must be some explanation let me order a carriage now i will drive round to dorset house with you  she half rose he held out his hand and checked her  there are other things to be explained he said quickly sit down helene  she obeyed him mystified  for your own sake he continued there are certain facts in connection with this matter which i must withhold all i can tell you is this there are people who have acquired a hold upon lucille so great that she is forced to obey their bidding lady carey is one the duchess of dorset is another they are no friends of mine and apparently lucille has been taken away from me by them  aa hold upon her helene repeated vaguely  it is all i can tell you you must suppose an extreme case you may take my word for it that under certain circumstances lucille would have no power to deny them anything  butwithout a word of farewell they could not insist upon her leaving you like that it is incredible  it is quite possible mr sabin said  helene caught herself looking at him stealthily was it possible that this wonderful brain had given way at last there were no signs of it in his face or expression but the duchess of dorset lady carey these were women of her own circlelondoners and the duchess at any rate a woman of the very highest social position and unimpeached conventionality  this soundsvery extraordinary uncle she remarked a little lamely  it is extraordinary he answered drily i do not wonder that you find it hard to believe me i  not to believeto understand  he smiled  we will not distinguish after all what does it matter assume if you cannot believe that lucilles leaving me may have been at the instigation of these people and therefore involuntary if this be so i have hard battle to fight to win her back but in the end i shall do it  she nodded sympathetically  i am sure she said that you will not find it difficult tell me cannot i help you in any way i know the duchess very well indeedwell enough to take you to call quite informally if you please she is a great supporter of what they call the primrose league here i do not understand what it is all about but it seems that i may not join because my husband is a radical  mr sabin looked for a moment over his clasped hands through the faint blue cloud of cigarette smoke and sundry possibilities flashed through his mind to be at once rejected he shook his head  no he said firmly i do not wish for your help at present directly or indirectly if you meet the countess i would rather that you did not mention my name there is only one person whom if you met at dorset house or anywhere where lucille is i would ask you to watch that is mr brott  it was to be a conversation full of surprises for helene mr brott her hand went up to her forehead for a moment and a little gesture of bewilderment escaped her  will you tell me she asked almost plaintively what on earth mr brott can have to do with this businesswith lucillewith youwith any one connected with it  mr sabin shrugged his shoulders  mr brott he remarked a cabinet minister of marked radical proclivities has lately been a frequent visitor at dorset house which is the very home of the old aristocratic toryism mr brott was acquainted with lucille many years agoin vienna at that time he was i believe deeply interested in her i must confess that mr brott causes me some uneasiness  i thinkthat men always know helene said if they care to was lucille happy with you  absolutely i am sure of it  then your first assumption must be correct she declared you cannot explain things to me so i cannot help you even with my advice i am sorry  he turned his head towards her and regarded her critically as though making some test of her sincerity  helene he said gravely it is for your own sake that i do not explain further that i do not make things clearer to you only i wanted you to understand why i once more set foot in europe i wanted you to understand why i am here it is to win back lucille it is like that with me helene i who once schemed and plotted for an empire am once more a schemer and a worker but for no other purpose than to recover possession of the woman whom i love you do not recognise me helene i do not recognise myself nevertheless i would have you know the truth i am here for that and for no other purpose  he rose slowly to his feet she held out both her hands and grasped his  let me help you she begged do this is not a matter of politics or anything compromising i am sure that i could be useful to you  so you can he answered quietly do as i have asked you watch mr brott    chapter xvi  mr brott and mr sabin dined togethernot as it happened at the house of commons but at the formers club in pall mall for mr sabin it was not altogether an enjoyable meal the club was large gloomy and political the cooking was exactly of that order which such surroundings seemed to require nor was mr brott a particularly brilliant host yet his guest derived a certain amount of pleasure from the entertainment owing to brotts constant endeavours to bring the conversation round to lucille  i find he said as they lit their cigarettes that i committed an indiscretion the other day at camperdown house  mr sabin assumed the puzzled air of one endeavouring to pin down an elusive memory  let me see he murmured doubtfully it was in connection with  the countess radantz if you remember i told you that it was her desire just now to remain incognito i however unfortunately forgot this during the course of our conversation  yes i remember you told me where she was staying but the countess and i are old acquaintances i feel sure that she did not object to your having given me her address i could not possibly leave london without calling upon her  mr brott moved in his chair uneasily  it seems presumption on my part to make such a suggestion perhaps he said slowly but i really believe that the countess is in earnest with reference to her desire for seclusion just at present i believe that she is really very anxious that her presence in london just now should not be generally known  i am such a very old friend mr sabin said i knew her when she was a child  mr brott nodded  it is very strange he said that you should have come together again in such a country as america and in a small town too  lenox mr sabin said is a small place but a great center by the bye is there not some question of an impending marriage on the part of the countess  i have heardof nothing of the sort mr brott said looking up startled then after a moments pause during which he studied closely his companions imperturbable face he added the question which forced its way to his lips  have you  mr sabin looked along his cigarette and pinched it affectionately it was one of his own which he had dexterously substituted for those which his host had placed at his disposal  the countess is a very charming a very beautiful and a most attractive woman he said slowly her marriage has always seemed to me a matter of certainty  mr brott hesitated and was lost  you are an old friend of hers he said you perhaps know more of her recent history than i do for a time she seemed to drop out of my life altogether now that she has come back i am very anxious to persuade her to marry me  a single lightninglike flash in mr sabins eyes for a moment disconcerted his host but after all it was gone with such amazing suddenness that it left behind it a sense of unreality mr brott decided that after all it must have been fancy  may i ask mr sabin said quietly whether the countess appears to receive your suit with favour  mr brott hesitated  i am afraid i cannot go so far as to say that she does he said regretfully i do not know why i find myself talking on this matter to you i feel that i should apologise for giving such a personal turn to the conversation  i beg that you will do nothing of the sort mr sabin protested i am as a matter of fact most deeply interested  you encourage me mr brott declared to ask you a questionto me a very important question  it will give me great pleasure mr sabin assured him if i am able to answer it  you know mr brott said of that portion of her life concerning which i have asked no questions but which somehow whenever i think of it fills me with a certain amount of uneasiness i refer to the last three years which the countess has spent in america  mr sabin looked up and his lips seemed to move but he said nothing mr brott felt perhaps that he was on difficult ground  i recognise the fact he continued slowly that you are the friend of the countess and that you and i are nothing more than the merest acquaintances i ask my question therefore with some diffidence can you tell me from your recent more intimate knowledge of the countess and her affairs whether there exists any reason outside her own inclinations why she should not accept my proposals of marriage  mr sabin had the air of a man gravely surprised he shook his head very slightly  you must not ask me such a question as that mr brott he said it is not a subject which i could possibly discuss with you but i have no objection to going so far as this my experience of the countess is that she is a woman of magnificent and effective will power i think if she has any desire to marry you there are or could be no obstacles existing which she would not easily dispose of  there are obstacles then  you must not ask me that mr sabin said with a certain amount of stiffness the countess is a very dear friend of mine and you must forgive me now if i say that i prefer not to discuss her any longer  a hall servant entered the room bearing a note for mr brott he received it at first carelessly but his expression changed the moment he saw the superscription he turned a little away and mr sabin noticed that the fingers which tore open the envelope were trembling the note seemed short enough but he must have read it half a dozen times before at last he turned round to the messenger  there is no answer he said in a low tone  he folded the note and put it carefully into his breast pocket mr sabin subdued an insane desire to struggle with him and discover by force if necessary who was the sender of those few brief lines for mr brott was a changed man  i am afraid he said turning to his guest that this has been a very dull evening for you to tell you the truth this club is not exactly the haunt of pleasureseekers it generally oppresses me for the first hour or so would you like a hand at bridge or a game of billiards i am wholly at your serviceuntil twelve oclock  mr sabin glanced at the clock  you are very good he said but i was never much good at indoor games golf has been my only relaxation for many years besides i too have an engagement for which i must leave in a very few minutes  it is very good of you mr brott said to have given me the pleasure of your company i have the greatest possible admiration for your niece mr sabin and camperdown is a thundering good fellow he will be our leader in the house of lords before many years have passed  he is i believe mr sabin remarked of the same politics as yourself  we are both mr brott answered with a smile i am afraid outside the pale of your consideration in this respect we are both radicals  mr sabin lit another cigarette and glanced once more at the clock  a radical peer he remarked isnt that rather an anomaly the principles of radicalism and aristocracy seem so divergent  yet mr brott said they are not wholly irreconcilable i have often wished that this could be more generally understood i find myself at times very unpopular with people whose good opinion i am anxious to retain simply owing to this too general misapprehension  mr sabin smiled gently  you were referring without doubt he began  to the countess brott admitted yes it is true but after all he added cheerfully i believe that our disagreements are mainly upon the surface the countess is a woman of wide culture and understanding her mind too is plastic she has few prejudices  mr sabin glanced at the clock for the third time and rose to his feet he was quite sure now that the note was from her he leaned on his stick and took his leave quietly all the time he was studying his host wondering at his air of only partially suppressed excitement  i must thank you very much mr brott he said for your entertainment i trust that you will give me an opportunity shortly of reciprocating your hospitality  the two men parted finally in the hall mr sabin stepped into his hired carriage  dorset house he directed    chapter xvii  this little difference of opinion the prince remarked looking thoughtfully through the emerald green of his liqueur interests me our friend dolinski here thinks that he will not come because he will be afraid de brouillac on the contrary says that he will not come because he is too sagacious felix here who knows him best says that he will not come because he prefers ever to play the game from outside the circle a lookeron to all appearance yet sometimes wielding an unseen force it is a strong position that  lucille raised her head and regarded the last speaker steadily  and i prince she exclaimed i say that he will come because he is a man and because he does not know fear  the prince of saxe leinitzer bowed low towards the speaker  dear lucille he said so respectfully that the faint irony of his tone was lost to most of those present i too am of your opinion the man who has a right real or fancied to claim you must indeed be a coward if he suffered dangers of any sort to stand in the way after all dangers from us is it not a little absurd  lucille looked away from the prince with a little shudder he laughed softly and drank his liqueur afterwards he leaned back for a moment in his chair and glanced thoughtfully around at the assembled company as though anxious to impress upon his memory all who were present it was a little group every member of which bore a wellknown name their host the duke of dorset in whose splendid library they were assembled was if not the premier duke of the united kingdom at least one of those whose many hereditary offices and ancient family entitled him to a foremost place in the aristocracy of the world raoul de brouillac count of orleans bore a name which was scarcely absent from a single page of the martial history of france the prince of saxe leinitzer kept up still a semblance of royalty in the state which his ancestors had ruled with despotic power lady muriel carey was a younger daughter of a ducal house which had more than once intermarried with royalty the others too had their claims to be considered amongst the greatest families of europe  the prince glanced at his watch and then at the bridge tables ready set out  i think he said that a little diversionwhat does our hostess say  two sets can start at least the duchess said lucille and i will stay out and the count de brouillac does not play  the prince rose  it is agreed he said duke will you honour me felix and dolinski are our ancient adversaries it should be an interesting trial of strength  there was a general movement a rearrangement of seats and a little buzz of conversation then silence lucille sat back in a great chair and lady carey came over to her side  you are nervous tonight lucille she said  yes i am nervous lucille admitted why not at any moment he may be here  and you careso much lady carey said with a hard little laugh  i care so much lucille echoed  lady carey shook out her amber satin skirt and sat down upon a low divan she held up her hands small white hands ablaze with jewels and looked at them for a moment thoughtfully  he was very much in earnest when i saw him at sherrys in new york she remarked and he was altogether too clever for mr horser and our friends there after all their talk and boasting too why they are ignorant of the very elements of intrigue  lucille sighed  here she said it is different the prince and he are ancient rivals and raoul de brouillac is no longer his friend muriel i am afraid of what may happen  lady carey shrugged her shoulders  he is no fool she said in a low tone he will not come here with a magistrates warrant and a policeman to back it up nor will he attempt to turn the thing into an adelphi drama i know him well enough to be sure that he will attempt nothing crude lucille dont you find it exhilarating  exhilarating but why  it will be a game played through to the end by masters and you my dear woman are the inspiration i think that it is most fascinating  lucille looked sadly into the fire  i think she said that i am weary of all these things i seem to have lived such a very long time at lenox i was quite happy of my own will i would never have left it  lady careys thin lips curled a little her blue eyes were full of scorn she was not altogether a pleasant woman to look upon her cheeks were thin and hollow her eyes a little too prominent some hidden expression which seemed at times to flit from one to the other of her features suggested a sensuality which was a little incongruous with her somewhat angular figure and generally cold demeanour but that she was a woman of courage and resource history had proved  how idyllic she exclaimed positively medieval fancy living with one man three years  lucille smiled  why not i never knew a woman yet however cold however fond of change who had not at some time or other during her life met a man for whose sake she would have donewhat i did i have had as many admirersas many lovers i suppose as most women but i can truthfully say that during the last three years no thought of one of them has crossed my mind  lady carey laughed scornfully  upon my word she said if the prince had not a temper and if they were not playing for such ruinous points i would entertain them all with these delightful confidences by the bye the prince himself was once one of those who fell before your chariot wheels was he not look at him nowsideways what does he remind you of  lucille raised her eyes  a fat angel she answered or something equally distasteful how i hate those mild eyes and that sweet slow smile i saw him thrash a poor beater once in the saxe leinitzer forests ugh  i should not blame him for that lady carey said coldly i like masterful men even to the point of cruelty general dolinski there fascinates me i believe that he keeps a little private knout at home for his wife and children a wicked little contrivance with an ivory handle i should like to see him use it  lucille shuddered this teteatete did not amuse her she rose and looked over one of the bridge tables for a minute the prince who was dealing looked up with a smile  be my good angel countess he begged fortune has deserted me tonight you shall be the goddess of chance and smile your favours upon me  a hard little laugh came from the chair where lady carey sat she turned her head towards them and there was a malicious gleam in her eyes  too late prince she exclaimed the favours of the countess are all given away lucille has become even as one of those flaxenhaired dolls of your mountain villages she has given her heart away and she is sworn to perpetual constancy  the prince smiled  the absence he said glancing up at the clock of that most fortunate person should surely count in our favour  lucille followed his eyes the clock was striking ten she shrugged her shoulders  if the converse also is true prince she said you can scarcely have anything to hope for from me for by halfpast ten he will be here  the prince picked up his cards and sorted them mechanically  we shall see he remarked it is true countess that you are here but in this instance you are set with thorns  to continue the allegory prince she answered passing on to the next table also with poisonous berries but to the hand which has no fear neither are harmful  the prince laid down his hand  now i really believe he said gently that she meant to be rude partner i declare hearts  felix was standing out from the next table whilst his hand was being played by general dolinski his partner he drew her a little on one side  do not irritate saxe leinitzer he whispered remember everything must rest with him twice tonight you have brought that smile to his lips and i never see it without thinking of unpleasant things  you are right she answered but i hate him so he and muriel carey seem to have entered into some conspiracy to lead me on to say things which i might regret  saxe leinitzer he said has never forgotten that he once aspired to be your lover  he has not failed to let me know it she answered he has even daredah  there was a sudden stir in the room the library door was thrown open the solemnvisaged butler stood upon the threshold  his grace the duke of souspennier he announced    chapter xviii  there was for the moment a dead silence the soft patter of cards no longer fell upon the table the eyes of every one were turned upon the newcomers and he leaning upon his stick looked only for one person and having found her took no heed of any one else  lucille  she rose from her seat and stood with hands outstretched towards him her lips parted in a delightful smile her eyes soft with happiness  victor welcome it is like you to have found me and i knew that you would come  he raised her fingers to his lipstenderlywith the grace of a prince but all the affection of a lover what he said to her none could hear for his voice was lowered almost to a whisper but the colour stained her cheeks and her blush was the blush of a girl  a movement of the duchess recalled him to a sense of his social duty he turned courteously to her with extended hand  i trust he said that i may be forgiven my temporary fit of aberration i cannot thank you sufficiently duchess for your kind invitation  her answering smile was a little dubious  i am sure she said that we are delighted to welcome back amongst us so old and valued a friend i suppose you know every one  mr sabin looked searchingly around exchanging bows with those whose faces were familiar to him but between him and the prince of saxe leinitzer there passed no pretense at any greeting the two men eyed one another for a moment coldly each seemed to be trying to read the other through  i believe mr sabin said that i have that privilege i see however that i am interrupting your game let me beg you to continue with your permission duchess i will remain a spectator there are many things which my wife and i have to say to one another  the prince of saxe leinitzer laid his cards softly upon the table he smiled upon mr sabina slow unpleasant smile  i think he said slowly that our game must be postponed it is a pity but i think it had better be so  it must be entirely as you wish mr sabin answered i am at your service now or later  the prince rose to his feet  monsieur le due de souspennier he said what are we to conclude from your presence here this evening  it is obvious mr sabin answered i claim my place amongst you  you claim to be one of us  i do  ten years ago the prince continued you were granted immunity from all the penalties and obligations which a comembership with us might involve this privilege was extended to you on account of certain great operations in which you were then engaged and the object of which was not foreign to our own aims you are aware that the period of that immunity is long since past  mr sabin leaned with both hands upon his stick and his face was like the face of a sphinx only lucille who knew him best of all those there saw him wince for a moment before this reminder of his great failure  i am not accustomed mr sabin said quietly to shirk my share of the work in any undertaking with which i am connected only in this case i claim to take the place of the countess lucille my wife i request that the task whatever it may be which you have imposed upon her may be transferred to me  the princes smile was sweet but those who knew him best wondered what evil it might betoken for his ancient enemy  you offer yourself then as a full member  assuredly  subject he drawled to all the usual pains and privileges  certainly  the prince played with the cards upon the table his smooth fair face was unruffled almost undisturbed yet underneath he was wondering fiercely eagerly how this might serve his ends  the circumstances he said at last are peculiar i think that we should do well to consult togetheryou and i felix and raoul here  the two men named rose up silently the prince pointed to a small round table at the farther end of the apartment half screened off by a curtained recess  am i also mr sabin asked of your company  the prince shook his head  i think not he said in a few moments we will return  mr sabin moved away with a slight enigmatic gesture lucille gathered up her skirts making room for him by her side on a small sofa  it is delightful to see you victor she murmured it is delightful to know that you trusted me  mr sabin looked at her and the smile which no other woman had ever seen softened for a moment his face  dear lucille he murmured how could you ever doubt it there was a day i admit when the sun stood still when if i had felt inclined to turn to light literature i should have read aloud the book of job but afterwardswell you see that i am here  she laughed  i knew that you would come she said and yet i knew that it would be a struggle between you and them forthe prince she murmured lowering her voice had pledged his word to keep us apart  mr sabin raised his head and his eyes traveled towards the figure of the man who sat with his back to them in the far distant corner of the room  the prince he said softly is faithful to his ancient enmities  lucilles face was troubled she turned to her companion with a little grimace  he would have me believe she murmured that he is faithful to other things besides his enmities  mr sabin smiled  i am not jealous he said softly of the prince of saxe leinitzer  as though attracted by the mention of his name which must however have been unheard by him the prince at that moment turned round and looked for a moment towards them he shot a quick glance at lady carey almost at once she rose from her chair and came across to them  the princes watchdog lucille murmured hateful woman she is bound hand and foot to him and yet  her eyes met his and he laughed  really he said you and i in our old age might be hero and heroine of a little romancethe undesiring objects of a hopeless affection  lady carey sank into a low chair by their side you two she said with a slow malicious smile are a pattern to this wicked world dont you know that such fidelity is positively sinful and after three years in such a country too  it is the approach of senility mr sabin answered her i am an old man lady muriel  she shrugged her shoulders  you are like ulysses she said the gods or rather the goddesses have helped you towards immortality  it is mr sabin answered the most delicious piece of flattery i have ever heard  calypso she murmured nodding towards lucille is by your side  really mr sabin interrupted i must protest lucille and i were married by a most respectable episcopalian clergyman we have documentary evidence besides if lucille is calypso what about penelope  lady carey smiled thoughtfully  i have always thought she said that penelope was a myth in your case i should say that penelope represents a return to sanityto the ordinary ways of life  mr sabin and lucille exchanged swift glances he raised his eyebrows  our little idyll he said seems to be the sport and buffet of every one you forget that i am of the old world i do not understand modernity  ulysses she answered was of the old world yet he was a wanderer in more senses of the word than one and there have been times  her eyes sought his he ignored absolutely the subtlety of meaning which lurked beneath the heavy drooping eyelids  one travels through life he answered by devious paths and a little wandering in the flowergardens by the way is the lot of every one but when the journey is over ones taste for wandering has gonewell ulysses finished his days at the hearth of penelope  she rose and walked away mr sabin sat still and watched her as though listening to the soft sweep of her gown upon the carpet  hateful woman lucille exclaimed lightly to make love and such love to ones lawful husband before ones face is a little crude dont you think  he shook his head  too obvious he answered she is playing the princes game dear me how interesting this will be soon  she nodded a faint smile of bitterness had stolen into her tone  already she said you are beginning to scent the delight of the atmosphere you are stiffening for the fight soon  ah no dont say it he whispered taking her hand i shall never forget if the fight seems good to me it is because you are the prize and after all you know to fight for ones womenkind is amongst the primeval instincts  lady carey who had been pacing the room restlessly touching an ornament here looking at a picture there came back to them and stood before mr sabin she had caught his last words  primeval instincts she exclaimed mockingly what do you know about them you of all men a bundle of nerves and brains with a motor for a heart and an automatic brake upon your passions upon my word i believe that i have solved the mystery of your perennial youth you have found a way of substituting machinery for the human organ and you are wound up to go for ever  you have found me out he admitted professor penningram of chicago will supply you too with an outfit mention my name if you like it is a wonderful country america  the prince came over to them fair and bland with no trace upon his smooth features or in his halfjesting tone of any evil things  souspennier he said holding out his hand welcome back once more to your old place i am happy to say that there appears to be no reason why your claim should not be fully admitted  mr sabin rose to his feet  i presume he said that no very active demands are likely to be made upon my services in this country more than any other i fear that the possibilities of my aid are scanty  the prince smiled  it is a fact he said which we all appreciate upon you at present we make no claim  there was a moments intense silence a steely light glittered in mr sabins eyes he and the prince alone remained standing the duchess of dorset watched them through her lorgnettes lady carey watched too with an intense eagerness her eyes alight with mingled cruelty and excitement lucilles eyes were so bright that one might readily believe the tears to be glistening beneath    chapter xix  i will not pretend mr sabin said to misunderstand you my help is not required by you in this enterprise whatever it may be in which you are engaged on the contrary you have tried by many and various ways to keep me at a distance but i am here princehere to be dealt with and treated according to my rights  the prince stroked his fair moustache  i am a little puzzled he admitted as to thisshall i not call it selfassertivenesson the part of my good friend souspennier  i will make it quite clear then mr sabin answered lucille will you favour me by ringing for your maid the carriage is at the door  the prince held out his hand  my dear souspennier he said you must not think of taking lucille away from us  indeed mr sabin answered coolly why not  it must be obvious to you the prince answered that we did not send to america for lucille without an object she is now engaged in an important work upon our behalf it is necessary that she should remain under this roof  i demand mr sabin said that the nature of that necessity should be made clear to me  the prince smiled with the air of one disposed to humour a wilful child  come he said you must know very well that i cannot stand here and tell you the bare outline much less the details of an important movement tomorrow at any hour you choose one from amongst us shall explain the whole matterand the part to be borne in it by the countess  and tonight mr sabin asked  the prince shrugged his shoulders and glanced at the clock  tonight my dear friend he said all of us i believe go on to a ball at carmarthen house it would grieve me also i am sure duke to seem inhospitable but i am compelled to mention the fact that the hour for which the carriages have been ordered is already at hand  mr sabin reflected for a few moments  did i understand you to say he asked that the help to be given to you by my wife lucille duchess of souspennier entailed her remaining under this roof  the prince smiled seraphically  it is unfortunate he murmured since you have been so gallant as to follow her but it is true you will understand this perfectlytomorrow  and why should i wait until tomorrow mr sabin asked coolly  i fear the prince said that it is a matter of necessity  mr sabin glanced for a moment in turn at the faces of all the little company as though seeking to discover how far the attitude of his opponent met with their approval lady careys thin lips were curved in a smile and her eyes met his mockingly the others remained imperturbable last of all he looked at lucille  it seems he said smiling towards her that i am called upon to pay a heavy entrance fee on my return amongst your friends but the prince of saxe leinitzer forgets that he has shown me no authority or given me no valid reason why i should tolerate such flagrant interference with my personal affairs  tomorrowtomorrow my good sir the prince interrupted  no tonight mr sabin answered sharply lucille in the absence of any reasonable explanation i challenge the right of the prince of saxe leinitzer to rob me even for an hour of my dearest possession i appeal to you come with me and remain with me until it has been proved if ever it can be proved that greater interests require our separation if there be blame i will take it will you trust yourself to me  lucille half rose but lady careys hand was heavy upon her shoulder as though by a careless movement general dolinski and raoul de brouillac altered their positions slightly so as to come between the two the duke of dorset had left the room then mr sabin knew that they were all against him  lucille he said have courage i wait for you  she looked towards him and her face puzzled him for there flashed across the shoulders of these people a glance which was wholly out of harmony with his own state of barely subdued passiona glance half tender half humorous full of subtle promise yet her words were a blow to him  victor how is it possible believe me i should come if i could tomorrowvery soon it may be possible but now you hear what the prince says i fear that he is right  to mr sabin the shock was an unexpected one he had never doubted but that she at least was on his side her words found him unprepared and a moment he showed his discomfiture his recovery however was swift and amazing he bowed to lucille and by the time he raised his head even the reproach had gone from his eyes  dear lady he said i will not venture to dispute your decision prince will you appoint a time tomorrow when this matter shall be more fully explained to me  the princes smile was sweetness itself and his tone very gentle but mr sabin who seldom yielded to any passionate impulse kept his teeth set and his hand clenched lest the blow he longed to deal should escape him  at midday tomorrow i shall be pleased to receive you he said the countess with her usual devotion and good sense has i trust convinced you that our action is necessary  tomorrow at midday mr sabin said i will be here i have the honour to wish you all goodnight  his farewell was comprehensive he did not even single out lucille for a parting glance but down the broad stairs and across the hall of dorset house he passed with weary steps leaning heavily upon his stick it was a heavy blow which had fallen upon him as yet he scarcely realised it  his carriage was delayed for a few moments and just as he was entering it a young woman plainly dressed in black came hurrying out and slipped a note into his hand  pardon monsieur she exclaimed with a smile i feared that i was too late  mr sabins fingers closed over the note and he stepped blithely into the carriage but when he tore it open and saw the handwriting he permitted himself a little groan of disappointment it was not from her he read the few lines and crushed the sheet of paper in his hand    i am having supper at the carlton with some friends on our way   to c h  i want to speak to you for a moment  be in the palm   court at 1215 but do not recognise me until i come to you  if   possible keep out of sight  if you should have left my maid will   bring this on to your hotel                                                            m c  mr sabin leaned back in his carriage and a frown of faint perplexity contracted his forehead  if i were a younger man he murmured to himself i might believe that this woman was really in earnest as well as being saxe leinitzers jackal we were friendly enough in paris that year she is unscrupulous enough of course always with some odd fancy for the grotesque or unlikely i wonder  he pulled the checkstring and was driven to camperdown house a great many people were coming and going mr sabin found helenes maid and learnt that her mistress was just going to her room and would be alone for a few minutes he scribbled a few words on the back of a card and was at once taken up to her boudoir  my dear uncle helene exclaimed you have arrived most opportunely we have just got rid of a few dinner people and we are going on to carmarthen house presently take that easychair please and light a cigarette will you have a liqueur wolfendon has some old brandy which every one seems to think wonderful  you are very kind helene mr sabin said i cannot refuse anything which you offer in so charming a manner but i shall not keep you more than a few minutes  we need not leave for an hour helene said and i am dressed except for my jewels tell me have you seen lucille i am so anxious to know  i have seen lucille this evening mr sabin answered  at dorset house  yes  helene sat down smiling  do tell me all about it  there is very little to tell mr sabin answered  she is with youshe returns at least  mr sabin shook his head  no he answered she remains at dorset house  helene was silent mr sabin smoked pensively a moment or two and sipped the liqueur which camperdowns own servant had just brought him  it is very hard helene he said to make you altogether understand the situation for there are certain phases of it which i cannot discuss with you at all i have made my first effort to regain lucille and it has failed it is not her fault i need not say that it is not mine but the struggle has commenced and in the end i shall win  lucille herself helene began hesitatingly  lucille is i firmly believe as anxious to return to me as i am anxious to have her mr sabin said  helene threw up her hands  it is bewildering she exclaimed  it must seem so to you mr sabin admitted  i wish that lucille were anywhere else helene said the dorset house set you know although they are very smart and very exclusive have a somewhat peculiar reputation lady carey although she is such a brilliant woman says and does the most insolent the most amazing things and the prince of saxe leinitzer goes everywhere in europe by the name of the royal libertine they are powerful enough almost to dominate society and we poor people who abide by the conventions are absolutely nowhere beside them they think that we are bourgeois because we have virtue and prehistoric because we are not decadent  the duke mr sabin remarked  oh the duke is quite different of course helene admitted he is a fanatical tory very stupid very blind to anything except his beloved primrose league how he came to lend himself to the vagaries of such a set i cannot imagine  mr sabin smiled  cest la femme toujours he remarked his grace is i fear henpecked and the duchess herself is the sport of cleverer people and now my dear niece i see that the time is going i came to know if you could get me a card for the ball at carmarthen house tonight  helene laughed softly  very easily my dear uncle lady carmarthen is wolfendons cousin you know and a very good friend of mine i have half a dozen blank cards here shall i really see you there  i believe so mr sabin answered  and lucille  it is possible  there is nothing i suppose which i can do in the way of intervention or anything of that sort  mr sabin shook his head  lucille and i are the best of friends he answered talk to her if you will by the bye is that twelve oclock i must hurry doubtless we shall meet again at the ball  but carmarthen house saw nothing of mr sabin that night    chapter xx  mr sabin from his seat behind a gigantic palm watched her egress from the supperroom with a little group of friends  they came to a halt in the broad carpeted way only a few feet from him lady carey in a wonderful green gown her neck and bosom ablaze with jewels seemed to be making her farewells  i must go in and see the de lausanacs she exclaimed they are in the blue room supping with the portuguese ambassador i shall be at carmarthen house within half an hourunless my headache becomes unbearable au revoir all of you goodbye laura  her friends passed on towards the great swing doors lady carey retraced her steps slowly towards the supperroom and made some languid inquiries of the head waiter as to a missing handkerchief then she came again slowly down the broad way and reached mr sabin he rose to his feet  i thank you very much for your note he said you have something i believe to say to me  she stood before him for a moment in silence as though not unwilling that he should appreciate the soft splendour of her toilette the jewels which encircled her neck were priceless and dazzling the soft material of her gown the most delicate shade of sea green seemed to foam about her feet a wonderful triumph of allegoric dressmaking she saw that he was studying her and she laughed a little uneasily looking all the time into his eyes  shockingly overdressed aint i she said we were going straight to carmarthen house you know come and sit in this corner for a moment and order me some coffee i suppose there isnt any less public place  i fear not he answered you will perhaps be unobserved behind this palm  she sank into a low chair and he seated himself beside her she sighed contentedly  dear me she said do men like being run after like this  mr sabin raised his eyebrows  i understood he said that you had something to say to me of importance  she shot a quick look up at him  dont be horrid she said in a low tone of course i wanted to see you i wanted to explain give me one of your cigarettes  he laid his case silently before her she took one and lit it watching him furtively all the time the man brought their coffee the place was almost empty now and some of the lights were turned down  it is very kind of you he said slowly to honour me by so much consideration but if you have much to say perhaps it would be better if you permitted me to call upon you tomorrow i am afraid of depriving you of your balland your friends will be getting impatient  bother the balland my friends she exclaimed a certain strained note in her tone which puzzled him im not obliged to go to the thing and i dont want to ive invented a headache and they wont even expect me they know my headaches  in that case mr sabin said i am entirely at your service  she sighed and looked up at him through a little cloud of tobacco smoke  what a wonderful man you are she said softly you accept defeat with the grace of a victor i believe that you would triumph as easily with a shrug of the shoulders havent you any feeling at all dont you know what it is like to feel  he smiled  we both come he said of a historic race if ancestry is worth anything it should at least teach us to go about without pinning our hearts upon our sleeves  but you she murmured you have no heart  he looked down upon her then with still cold face and steady eyes  indeed he said you are mistaken  she moved uneasily in her chair she was very pale except for a faint spot of pink colour in her cheeks  it is very hard to find then she said speaking quickly her bosom rising and falling her eyes always seeking to hold his tonight you see what i have donei have sent away my friendsand my carriage they may know me hereyou see what i have risked and i dont care you thought tonight that i was your enemyand i am not i am not your enemy at all  her hand fell as though by accident upon his and remained there mr sabin was very nearly embarrassed he knew quite well that if she were not his enemy at that moment she would be very shortly  lucille she continued will blame me too i cannot help it i want to tell you that for the present your separation from her is a certain thing she acquiesces you heard her she is quite happy she is at the ball tonight and she has friends there who will make it pleasant for her wont you understand  no mr sabin answered  she beat the ground with her foot  you must understand she murmured you are not like these fools of englishmen who go to sleep when they are married and wake in the divorce court for the present at least you have lost lucille you heard her choose shes at the ball tonightand i have come here to be with you wont you please she added with a little nervous laugh show some gratitude  the interruption which mr sabin had prayed for came at last the musicians had left and many of the lights had been turned down an official came across to them  i beg your pardon sir he said addressing mr sabin but we are closing now unless you are a guest in the hotel  i am staying here mr sabin answered rising but the lady  lady carey interrupted him  i am staying here also she said to the man  he bowed at once and withdrew she rose slowly to her feet and laid her fingers upon his arm he looked steadily away from her  fortunately he said i have not yet dismissed my own carriage permit me                                                      mr sabin leaned heavily upon his stick as he slowly made his way along the corridor to his rooms things were going ill with him indeed he was not used to the fear of an enemy but the memory of lady careys white cheeks and indrawn lips as she had entered his carriage chilled him her one look too was a threat worse than any which her lips could have uttered he was getting old indeed he thought wearily when disappointment weighed so heavily upon him and lucille had he any real fears of her he felt a little catch in his throat at the bare thoughtin a moments singular clearness of perception he realised that if lucille were indeed lost the world was no longer a place for him so his feet fell wearily upon the thickly carpeted floor of the corridor and his face was unusually drawn and haggard as he opened the door of his sittingroom  and thena transformation amazing stupefying it was lucille who was smiling a welcome upon him from the depths of his favourite easychairlucille sitting over his fire a novel in her hand and wearing a delightful rosepink dressinggown some of her belongings were scattered about his room giving it a delicate air of femininity the faint odour of her favourite and only perfume gave to her undoubted presence a wonderful sense of reality  she held out her hands to him and the broad sleeves of her dressinggown fell away from her white rounded arms her eyes were wonderfully soft the pink upon her cheeks was the blush of a girl  victor she murmured do not look so stupefied did you not believe that i would risk at least a little for you who have risked so much for me only come to me make the most of me all sorts of things are sure to happen directly i am found out  he took her into his arms it was one of the moments of his lifetime  tell me he murmured how have you dared to do this  she laughed  you know the prince and his set you know the way they bribe intrigues everywhere new and old overlapping they have really some reason for keeping you and me apart but as regards my other movements i am free enough and they thought victordont be angrybut i let them think it was some one else and i stole away from the ball and they thinknever mind what they think but you victor are my intrigue you my love my husband  then all the fatigue and all the weariness died away from mr sabins face once more the fire of youth burned in his heart and lucille laughed softly as her lips met his and her head sank upon his shoulder    chapter xxi  lady carey suddenly dropped her partners arm she had seen a man standing by himself with folded arms and moody face at the entrance to the ballroom she raised her lorgnettes his identity was unquestionable  will you excuse me for a moment captain horton she said to her escort i want particularly to speak to mr brott  captain horton bowed with the slight disappointment of a hungry man on his way to the supperroom  dont be long he begged the places are filling up  lady carey nodded and walked swiftly across to where brott was standing he moved eagerly forward to meet her  not dancing mr brott  he shrugged his shoulders  this sort of thing isnt much in my way he answered i was rather hoping to see the countess here i trust that she is not indisposed  she looked at him steadily  do you mean she said that you do not know where she is  i he answered in amazement how should i i have not seen her at all this evening i understood that she was to be here  lady carey hesitated the man was too honest to be able to lie like this even in a good cause she stood quite still for a moment thinking several of her dearest friends had already told her that she was looking tired and ill this evening at that moment she was positively haggard  i have been down at ranelagh this afternoon she said slowly and dining out so i have not seen lucille she was complaining of a headache yesterday but i quite thought that she was coming here have you seen the duchess  he shook his head  no there is such a crowd  lady carey glanced towards her escort and turned away  i will try and find out what has become of her she said dont go away yet  she rejoined her escort  when we have found a table she said i want you to keep my place for a few moments while i try and find some of my party  they passed into the supperroom and appropriated a small table lady carey left her partner and made her way to the farther end of the apartment where the prince of saxe leinitzer was supping with half a dozen men and women she touched him on the shoulder  i want to speak to you for a moment ferdinand she whispered  he rose at once and she drew him a little apart  brott is here she said slowly  brott here he repeated and lucille  he is asking for herexpected to find her here he is downstairs now looking the picture of misery  he looked at her inquiringly there was a curious steely light in her eyes and she was showing her front teeth which were a little prominent  do you think he asked that she has deceived us  what else where are the dorsets  the duchess is with the earl of condon and some more people at the round table under the balcony  give me your arm she whispered we must go and ask her  they crossed the room together lady carey sank into a vacant chair by the side of the duchess and talked for a few minutes to the people whom she knew then she turned and whispered in the duchesss ear  where is lucille  the duchess looked at her with a meaning smile  how should i know she left when we did  alone  yes it was all understood wasnt it  lady carey laughed unpleasantly  she has fooled us she said brott is here alone knows nothing of her  the duchess was puzzled  well i know nothing more than you do she answered are you sure the man is telling the truth  of course he is the image of despair  i am sure she was in earnest the duchess said when i asked her whether she should come on here she laughed a little nervously and said perhaps or something of that sort  the fool may have bungled it lady carey said thoughtfully i will go back to him theres that idiot of a partner of mine i must go and pretend to have some supper  captain horton found his visavis a somewhat unsatisfactory companion she drank several glasses of champagne ate scarcely anything and rushed him away before he had taken the edge off his appetite he brought her to the duchess and went back in a huff to finish his supper alone lady carey went downstairs and discovered mr brott who had scarcely moved  have you seen anything of her she asked  he shook his head gloomily  no it is too late for her to come now isnt it  take me somewhere where we can talk she said abruptly one of those seats in the recess will do  he obeyed her and they found a retired corner lady carey wasted no time in fencing  i am lucilles greatest friend mr brott and her confidante she said  he nodded  so i have understood  she tells me everything  he glanced towards her a little uneasily  that is comprehensive he remarked  it is true she answered lucille has told me a great deal about your friendship come there is no use in our mincing words lucille has been badly treated years ago and she has a perfect right to seek any consolation she may find the old fashioned ideas thank goodness do not hold any longer amongst us it is not necessary to tie yourself for life to a man in order to procure a little diversion  i will not pretend to misunderstand you lady carey he said gravely but i must decline to discuss the countess of radantz in connection with such matters  oh come she declared impatiently remember that i am her friend yours is quite the proper attitude but with me it doesnt matter now i am going to ask you a plain question had you any engagement with lucille tonight  she watched him mercilessly he was colouring like a boy lady careys thin lips curled she had no sympathy with such amateurish lovemaking nevertheless his embarrassment was a great relief to her  she promised to be here he answered stiffly  everything depends upon your being honest with me she continued you will see from my question that i know was there not something said about supper at your rooms before or after the dance  i cannot discuss this matter with you or any living person he answered if you know so much why ask me  lady carey could have shaken the man but she restrained herself  it is sufficient she declared what i cannot understand is why you are herewhen lucille is probably awaiting for you at your rooms  he started from his chair as though he had been shot  what do you mean he exclaimed she was to  he stopped short lady carey shrugged her shoulders  oh written you or something i suppose she exclaimed trust an englishman for bungling a love affair all i can tell you is that she left dorset house in a hansom without the others and said some thing about having supper with some friends  brott sprang to his feet and took a quick step towards the exit  it is not possible he exclaimed  she took his arm he almost dragged her along  well we are going to see she said coolly tell the man to call a hansom  they drove almost in silence through the square to pall mall brott leaped out onto the pavement directly the cab pulled up  i will wait here lady carey said i only want to know that lucille is safe  he disappeared and she sat forward in the cab drumming idly with her forefingers upon the apron in a few minutes he came back his appearance was quite sufficient he was very pale the change in him was so ludicrous that she laughed  get in she said i am going round to dorset house we must find out if we can what has become of her  he obeyed without comment at dorset house lady carey summoned the duchesss own maid  marie she said you were attending upon the countess radantz tonight  yes my lady  at what time did she leave  at about eleven my lady  alone  yes my lady  lady carey looked steadily at the girl  did she take anything with her  the girl hesitated lady carey frowned  it must be the truth remember marie  certainly my lady she took her small dressingcase  lady carey set her teeth hard then with a movement of her head she dismissed the maid she walked restlessly up and down the room then she stopped short with a hard little laugh  if i give way like this she murmured i shall be positively hideous and after all if she was there it was not possible for him  she stopped short and suddenly tearing the handkerchief which she had been carrying into shreds threw the pieces upon the floor and stamped upon them then she laughed shortly and turned towards the door  now i must go and get rid of that poor fool outside she said what a bungler  brott was beside himself with impatience  lucille is here she announced stepping in beside him she has a shocking headache and has gone to bed as a matter of fact i believe that she was expecting to hear from you  impossible he answered shortly he was beginning to distrust this woman  never mind you can make it up with her tomorrow i was foolish to be anxious about her at all are you coming in again  they were at carmarthen house he handed her out  no thanks if you will allow me i will wish you goodnight  she made her way into the ballroom and found the prince of saxe leinitzer who was just leaving  do you know where lucille is she asked  he looked up at her sharply where  at the carlton hotelwith him  he rose to his feet with slow but evil promptitude his face just then was very unlike the face of an angel lady carey laughed aloud  poor man she said mockingly it is always the same when you and souspennier meet  he set his teeth  this time he muttered i hold the trumps  she pointed at the clock it was nearly four she was there at eleven she remarked drily    chapter xxii  his highness the prince of saxe leinitzer  duson stood away from the door with a low bow the princein the buttonhole of whose frockcoat was a large bunch of russian violets passed across the threshold mr sabin rose slowly from his chair  i fear the prince said suavely that i am an early visitor i can only throw myself upon your indulgence and plead the urgency of my mission  his arrival appeared to have interrupted a late breakfast of the continental order the small table at which lucille and mr sabin were seated was covered with roses and several dishes of wonderful fruit a coffee equipage was before lucille mr sabin dressed with his usual peculiar care and looking ten years younger had just lit a cigarette  we have been anticipating your visit prince mr sabin remarked with grim courtesy can we offer you coffee or a liqueur  i thank you no the prince answered i seldom take anything before lunch let me beg that you do not disturb yourselves with your permission i will take this easychair so that is excellent we can now talk undisturbed  mr sabin bowed  you will find me he said an excellent listener  the prince smiled in an amiable manner his eyes were fixed upon lucille who had drawn her chair a little away from the table what other woman in the world who had passed her first youth could sit thus in the slanting sunlight and remain beautiful  i will ask you to believe the prince said slowly how sincerely i regret this unavoidable interference in a domestic happiness so touching nevertheless i have come for the countess it is necessary that she returns to dorset house this morning  you will oblige me mr sabin remarked by remembering that my wife is the duchesse de souspennier and by so addressing her  the prince spread out his handsa deprecating gesture  alas he said for the present it is not possible until the little affair upon which we are now engaged is finally disposed of it is necessary that lucille should be known by the title which she bears in her own right or by the name of her late husband mr james b peterson  that little affair mr sabin remarked is i presume the matter which you have come to explain to me  the prince smiled and shook his head  explain my dear duke that is not possible it is not within your rights to ask questions or to require any explanation as to anything which lucille is required to do by us you must remember that our claim upon her comes before yours it is a claim which she cannot evade or deny and in pursuance of it countess i deeply regret having to tell you that your presence at dorset house within the next hour is demanded  lucille made no answer but looked across the table at mr sabin with a little grimace  it is a comedy she murmured after all it is a comedy  mr sabin fingered his cigarette thoughtfully  i believe he said that the duchess realises her responsibilities in this matter i myself have no wish to deny them as ordinary members we are both pledged to absolute obedience i therefore place no embargo upon the return of my wife to dorset house but there are certain conditions prince that considering the special circumstances of the case i feel impelled to propose  i can recognise the prince said no conditions  they are very harmless mr sabin continued calmly the first is that in a friendly way and of course under the inviolable law of secrecy you explain to me for what part lucille is cast in this little comedy the next that i be allowed to see her at reasonable intervals and finally that she is known by her rightful name as duchesse de souspennier  the forced urbanity which the prince had assumed fell away from him without warning the tone of his reply was almost a sneer  i repeat he said that i can recognise no conditions  it is perhaps mr sabin continued the wrong word to use we submit to your authority but you and i are well aware that your discretionary powers are large i ask you to use them  and i the prince said refuse let me add that i intend to prevent any recurrence of your little adventure of last night lucille shall not see you again until her task is over and as for you my dear duke i desire only your absence i do not wish to hurt your feelings but your name has been associated in the past with too many failures to inspire us with any confidence in engaging you as an ally countess a carriage from dorset house awaits you  but lucille sat still and mr sabin rose slowly to his feet  i thank you prince he said for throwing away the mask fighting is always better without the buttons it is true that i have failed more than once but it is also true that my failures have been more magnificent than your waddle across the plain of life as for your present authority i challenge you to your face that you are using it to gain your private ends what i have said to you i shall repeat to those whose place is above yours lucille shall go to dorset house but i warn you that i hold my life a slight thing where her welfare is concerned your hand is upon the lever of a great organization i am only a unit in the world yet i would have you remember that more than once prince when you and i have met with the odds in your favour the victory has been mine play the game fairly and you have nothing to fear from me but the open opposition i have promised you bring but the shadow of evil upon her misuse your power but ever so slightly against her and i warn you that i shall count the few years of life left to me a trifleof less than no accountuntil you and i cry quits  the prince smiled a fat goodnatured smile behind which the malice was indeed well hidden  come come my dear souspennier he declared this is unworthy of you it is positively melodramatic it reminds me of the plays of my fatherland and of your own adelphi theatre we should be men of the world you and i you must take your defeats with your victories i can assure you that the welfare of the countess lucille shall be my special care  lucille for the first time spoke she rose from her chair and rested her hands affectionately upon her husbands shoulder  dear victor she said remember that we are in london and need i add have confidence in me the prince of saxe leinitzer and i understand one another i believe if we do not it is not my fault my presence here at this moment should prove to you how eagerly i shall look forward to the time when our separation is no longer necessary  she passed away into the inner room with a little farewell gesture tender and regretful mr sabin resumed his seat  i believe prince he said that no good can come of any further conference between you and me we understand one another too well might i suggest therefore that you permit me to ring  the prince rose to his feet  you are right he said the bandying of words between you and me is a waste of time we are both of us too old at the game but come before i go i will do you a good turn i will prove that i am in a generous mood  mr sabin shrugged his shoulders  if anything in this world could inspire me with fear he remarked it would be the generosity of the prince of saxe leinitzer  the prince sighed  you always misunderstand me he murmured however i will prove my words you spoke of an appeal  certainly mr sabin answered i intend to impeach you for making use of the powers entrusted to you for your own private endsin other words for making an arbitrary misuse of your position  the prince nodded  it is very well put he said i shall await the result of your appeal in fear and trembling i confess that i am very much afraid but come now i am going to be generous i am going to help you on a little do you know to whom your appeal must be made  to the grand duke mr sabin replied  the prince shook his head  ah me he said how long indeed you have been absent from the world the grand duke is no longer the head of our little affair shall i tell you who has succeeded him  i can easily find out mr sabin answered  ah but i warned you that i was in a generous mood the prince said with a smile i will save you the trouble with your permission i will whisper the name in your ear it is not one which we mention lightly  he stepped forward and bent his head for a moment afterwards as he drew back the smile upon his lips broadened until he showed all his teeth it was a veritable triumph mr sabin taken wholly by surprise had not been able to conceal his consternation  it is not possible he exclaimed hoarsely he would not dare  but in his heart he knew that the prince had spoken the truth    chapter xxiii  after all said the prince looking up from the wine list why cannot i be satisfied with you and why cannot you be satisfied with me it would save so much trouble  lady carey who was slowly unwinding the white veil from her picture hat shrugged her shoulders  my dear man she said you could not seriously expect me to fall in love with you  the prince sipped his winea cabinet hock of rare vintageand found it good he leaned over towards his companion  why not he asked i wish that you would tryin earnest i mean you are capable of great things i believeperhaps of the great passion itself  perhaps she murmured derisively  and yet he continued there has always been in our lovemaking a touch of amateurishness it is an awkward word but i do not know how better to explain myself  i understand you perfectly she answered i can also i think explain it it is because i never cared a rap about you  the prince did not appear altogether pleased he curled his fair moustache and looked deprecatingly at his companion she had so much the air of a woman who has spoken the truth  my dear muriel he protested  she looked at him insolently  my good man she said whatever you do dont try and be sentimental you know quite well that i have never in my life pretended to care a rap about youexcept to pass the time you are altogether too obvious very young girls and very old women would rave about you you simply dont appeal to me perhaps i know you too well what does it matter  he sighed and examined a sauce critically they were lunching at princes alone at a small table near the wall  your taste he remarked a little spitefully would be considered a trifle strange souspennier carries his years well but he must be an old man  she sipped her wine thoughtfully  old or young she said he is a man and all my life i have loved menstrong men to have him here opposite to me at this moment mine belonging to me the slave of my will i would givewell i would givea year of my lifemy new tiaraanything  what a pity he murmured that we cannot make an exchange you and i lucille and he  ah lucille she murmured well she is beautiful that goes for much and she has the grand air but heavens how stupid  stupid he repeated doubtfully  she drummed nervously upon the tablecloth with her fingers  oh not stupid in the ordinary way of course but yet a fool i should like to see man or devil try and separate us if i belonged to himuntil i was tired of him that would come of course it comes always it is the hideous part of life  you look always he said a little too far forward it is a mistake after all it is the present only which concerns us  admirable philosophy she laughed scornfully but when one is bored to death in the present one must look forward or backward for consolation  he continued his lunch in silence for a while  i am rebuked he said  there came a pause in the courses he looked at her critically she was very handsomely dressed in a walking costume of dovecoloured grey the ostrich feathers which drooped from her large hat were almost priceless she had the undeniable air of being a person of breeding but she was paler even than usual her hair notwithstanding its careful arrangement gave signs of being a little thin in front there were wrinkles at the corners of her eyes she knew these things but she bore his inspection with indifference  i wonder he said reflectively what we men see in you you have plenty of admirers they say that grefton got himself shot out at the front because you treated him badly yetyou are not much to look at are you  she laughed at him hers was never a pleasant laugh but this time it was at least natural  how discriminating she declared i am an ugly woman and men of taste usually prefer ugly women then i am always well dressed i know how to wear my clothes and i have a shocking reputation a really wicked woman i once heard pious old lady surbiton call me dear old thing it did me no end of good then i have the very great advantage of never caring for any one more than a few days together men find that annoying  you have violent fancies he remarked and strange ones  perhaps she admitted they concern no one except myself  this souspennier craze for instance  she nodded  well you cant say that im not honest it is positively my only virtue i adore the truth i loathe a lie that is one reason i daresay why i can only barely tolerate you you are a shockinga gross liar  muriel  oh dont look at me like that she exclaimed irritably you must hear the truth sometimes and now please remember that i came to lunch with you to hear about your visit this morning  the prince gnawed his moustache and the light in his eyes was not a pleasant thing to see this woman with her reckless life her odd fascination her brusque hatred of affectations was a constant torment to him if only he could once get her thoroughly into his power  my visit he said was wholly successful it could not well be otherwise lucille has returned to dorset house souspennier is confounded altogether by a little revelation which i ventured to make he spoke of an appeal i let him know with whom he would have to deal i left him nerveless and crushed he can do nothing save by open revolt and if he tries thatwell there will be no more of this wonderful mr sabin  altogether a triumph to you she remarked scornfully oh i know the sort of thing but after all my dear ferdinand what of last night i hate the woman but she played the game and played it well we were fooled both of us and to think that i  she broke off with a short laugh the prince looked at her curiously  perhaps he said you had some idea of consoling the desolate husband  perhaps i had she answered coolly it didnt come off did it order me some coffee and give me a cigarette my friend i have something else to say to you  he obeyed her and she leaned back in the high chair  listen to me she said i have nothing whatever to do with you and lucille i suppose you will get your revenge on souspennier through her it wont be like you if you dont try and you ought to have the game pretty well in your own hands but i wont have souspennier harmed you understand  he shrugged his shoulders  souspennier he said must take care if he oversteps the bounds he must pay the penalty  she leaned forward there was a look in her face which he knew very well  you and i understand one another she said coolly if you want me for an enemy you can have me very likely i shall tell you before long that you can do what you like with the man but until i do it will be very dangerous for you if harm comes to him  it is no use he answered doggedly if he attacks he must be silenced  if he attacks she answered you must give me twentyfour hours clear notice before you move a hand against him afterwardswell we will discuss that  you had better he said looking at her with an ugly gleam in his eyes persuade him to take you for a little tour on the continent it would be safer  if he would come she said coolly i would go tomorrow but he wontjust yet never mind you have heard what i wanted to say now shall we go i am going to get some sleep this afternoon everybody tells me that i look like a ghost  why not come to grosvenor square with me he leaning a little across the table patoff shall make you some russian tea and afterwards you shall sleep as long as you like  how idyllic she answered with a faint sarcastic smile it goes to my heart to decline so charming an invitation but to tell you the truth it would bore me excessively  he muttered something under his breath which startled the waiter at his elbow then he followed her out of the room she paused for a few moments in the portico to finish buttoning her gloves  many thanks for my lunch she said nodding to him carelessly im sure ive been a delightful companion  you have been a very tormenting one he answered gloomily as he followed her out on to the pavement  you should try lucille she suggested maliciously  he stood by her side while they waited for her carriage and looked at her critically her slim elegant figure had never seemed more attractive to him even the insolence of her tone and manner had an odd sort of fascination he tried to hold for a moment the fingers which grasped her skirt  i think he whispered that after you lucille would be dull  she laughed  that is because lucille has morals and a conscience she said and i have neither but dear me how much more comfortably one gets on without them no thank you prince my coupe is only built for one remember  she flung him a careless nod from the window the prince remained on the pavement until after the little brougham had driven away then he smiled softly to himself as he turned to follow it  no he said i think not i think that she will not get our good friend souspennier we shall see    chapter xxiv  a barely furnished mans room comfortable austere scholarly the refuge of a busy man to judge by the piles of books and papers which littered the large open writingtable there were despatch boxes turned upside down a sea of parchment and foolscap in the midst of it all a man deep in thought  a visitor entering with the freedom of an old acquaintance laid his hand upon his shoulder and greeted him with an air of suppressed enthusiasm  planning the campaign eh brott or is that a handbook to court etiquette you will need it within the week there are all sorts of rumours at the clubs  brott shook himself free from his fit of apathetic reflection he would not have dared to tell his visitor where his thoughts had been for the last half hour  somehow he said i do not think that little trip to windsor will come just yet the king will never send for me unless he is compelled  his visitor an excabinet minister a pronounced radical and a lifelong friend of brotts shrugged his shoulders  that time he said is very close at hand he will send for letheringham first of course and great pressure will be brought to bear upon him to form a ministry but without you he will be helpless he has not the confidence of the people  without me brott repeated slowly you think then that i should not accept office with letheringham  his visitor regarded him steadily for a moment openmouthed obviously taken aback  brott are you in your right senses he asked incredulously do you know what you are saying  brott laughed a little nervously  this is a great issue grahame he said i will confess that i am in an undecided state i am not sure that the country is in a sufficiently advanced state for our propaganda is this really our opportunity or is it only the shadow of what is to come thrown before if we show our hand too soon all is lost for this generation dont look at me as though i were insane grahame remember that the country is only just free from a long era of conservative rule  the better our opportunity grahame answered vigorously two decades of puppet government are enervating i admit but they only pave the way more surely to the inevitable reaction what is the matter with you brott are you ill this is the great moment of our lives you must speak at manchester and birmingham within this week glasgow is already preparing for you everything and everybody waits for your judgment good god man its magnificent wheres your enthusiasm within a month you must be prime minister and we will show the world the way to a new era  brott sat quite still his friends words had stirred him for the moment yet he seemed the victim of a curious indecision grahame leaned over towards him  brott old friend he said you are not ill  brott shook his head  i am perfectly well he said  grahame hesitated  it is a delicate thing to mention he said perhaps i shall pass even the bounds of our old comradeship but you have changed something is wrong with you what is it  there is nothing brott answered looking up it is your fancy i am well enough  grahames face was dark with anxiety  this is no idle curiosity of mine he said you know me better than that but the cause which is nearer my heart than life itself is at stake brott you are the peoples man their promised redeemer think of them the toilers the oppressed gods children groaning under the iniquitous laws of generations of evil statesmanship it is the dawn of their new day their faces are turned to you man cant you hear them crying you cant fail them you mustnt i dont know what is the matter with you brott but away with it free yourself man  brott sighed wearily but already there was a change in him his face was hardeningthe lines in his face deepened grahame continued hastilyeagerly  public men he said are always at the mercy of the halfpenny press but you know brott your appearance so often in society lately has set mens tongues wagging there is no harm done but it is time to stop them you are right to want to understand these people you must go down amongst them it has been slumming in mayfair for you i know but have done with it now it is these people we are going to fight let it be open war let them hear your programme at glasgow we dont want another french revolution but it is going to be war against the drones fierce merciless war you must break with them brott once and for ever and the time is now  brott held out his hand across the table no one but this one man could have read the struggle in his face  you are right grahame i thank you i thank you as much for what you have left unsaid as for what you have said i was a fool to think of compromising letheringham is a nerveless leader we should have gone pottering on for another seven years thank god that you came when you did see here  he tossed him over a letter grahames cheek paled as he read  already he murmured  brott nodded  read it  grahame devoured every word his eyes lit up with excitement  my prophecy exactly he exclaimed laying it down it is as i said he cannot form the ministry without you his letter is abject he gives himself away it is an entreaty and your answer  has not yet gone brott said you shall write it yourself if you like i am thankful that you came when you did  you were hesitating grahame exclaimed  i was  grahame looked at him in wonder and brott faced him sturdily  it seems like treason to you grahame he said so it does to me now i want nothing in the future to come between us he continued more slowly and i should like if i can to expunge the memory of this interview and so i am going to tell you the truth grahame held out his hand  dont he said i can forget without  brott shook his head  no he said you had better understand everything the halfpenny press told the truth yet only half the truth i have been to all these places wasted my time wasted their time from a purely selfish reasonto be near the only woman i have ever cared for the woman grahame  i knew it grahame murmured i fought against the belief i thought that i had stifled it but i knew it all the time  if i have seemed lukewarm sometimes of late brott said there is the cause she is an aristocrat and my politics are hateful to her she has told me so seriously playfully angrily she has let me feel it in a hundred ways she has drawn me into discussions and shown the utmost horror of my views i have cared for her all my life and she knows it and i think grahame that lately she has been trying constantly persistently to tone down my opinions she has let me understand that they are a bar between us and it is a horrible confession grahame but i believe that i was wavering this invitation from letheringham seemed such a wonderful opportunity for compromise  this must never go out of the room grahame said hoarsely it would ruin your popularity they would never trust you again  i shall tell no one else brott said  and it is over grahame demanded eagerly  it is over                                                     the duke of dorset who entertained for his party gave a great dinner that night at dorset house and towards its close the prince of saxe leinitzer who was almost the only nonpolitical guest moved up to his host in response to an eager summons the duke was perturbed  you have heard the news saxe leinitzer  i did not know of any news the prince answered what is it  brott has refused to join with letheringham in forming a ministry it is rumoured even that a coalition was proposed and that brott would have nothing to do with it  the prince looked into his wineglass  ah he said  this is disturbing news the duke continued you do not seem to appreciate its significance  the prince looked up again  perhaps not he said you shall explain to me  brott refuses to compromise the duke said he stands for a ministry of his own selection heaven only knows what mischief this may mean his doctrines are thoroughly revolutionary he is an iconoclast with a genius for destruction but he has the ear of the people he is today their rienzi  the prince nodded  and lucille he remarked what does she say  i have not spoken to her the duke answered the news has only just come  we will speak to her the prince said together  afterwards in the library there was a sort of informal meeting and their opportunity came  so you have failed countess her host said knitting his grey brows at her  she smilingly acknowledged defeat  but i can assure you she said that i was very near success only on monday he had virtually made up his mind to abandon the extreme party and cast in his lot with letheringham what has happened to change him i do not know  the prince curled his fair moustache  it is a pity he said that he changed his mind for one thing is very certain the duke and i are agreed upon it a brott ministry must never be formed  she looked up quickly  what do you mean  the prince answered her without hesitation  if one course fails he said another must be adopted i regret having to make use of means which are somewhat clumsy and obvious but our pronouncement on this one point is final brott must not be allowed to form a ministry  she looked at him with something like horror in her soft full eyes  what would you do she murmured  the prince shrugged his shoulders  well he said we are not quite medieval enough to adopt the only really sensible method and remove mr brott permanently from the face of the earth we should stop a little short of that but i can assure you that mr brotts health for the next few months is a matter for grave uncertainty it is a pity for his sake that you failed  she bit her lip  do you know if he is still in london she asked  he must be on the point of leaving for scotland the duke answered if he once mounts the platform at glasgow there will be no further chance of any compromise he will be committed irretrievably to his campaign of anarchy  and to his own disaster the prince murmured  lucille remained for a moment deep in thought then she looked up  if i can find him before he starts she said hurriedly i will make one last effort    chapter xxv  he peered forward over his desk at the tall graceful figure whose entrance had been so noiseless and whose footsteps had been so light that she stood almost within a few feet of him before he was even aware of her presence then his surprise was so great that he could only gasp out her name  you lucille  she smiled upon him delightfully  me lucille dont blame your servant i assured him that i was expected so he allowed me to enter unannounced his astonishment was a delightful testimony to your reputation by the bye he was evidently not used to these invasions  brott had recovered himself by this time and if any emotion still remained he was master of it  you must forgive my surprise he said you have of course something important to say to me will you not loosen your cloak  she unfastened the clasp and seated herself in his most comfortable chair the firelight flashed and glittered on the silver ornaments of her dress her neck and arms with their burden of jewels gleamed like porcelain in the semidarkness outside the halo of his student lamp and he saw that her dark hair hung low behind in graceful folds as he had once admired it he stood a little apart and she noted his traveling clothes and the various signs of a journey about the room  you may be glad to see me she remarked looking at him with a smile you dont look it  i am anxious to hear your news he answered i am convinced that you have something important to say to me  supposing she answered still looking at him steadily supposing i were to say that i had no object in coming here at allthat it was merely a whim what should you say then  i should take the liberty he answered quietly of doubting the evidence of my senses  there was a moments silence she felt his aloofness it awoke in her some of the enthusiasm with which this mission itself had failed to inspire her this man was measuring his strength against hers  it was not altogether a whim she said her eyes falling from his and yetnow i am hereit does not seem easy to say what was in my mind  he glanced towards the clock  i fear he said that it may sound ungallant but in case this somewhat mysterious mission of yours is of any importance i had better perhaps tell you that in twenty minutes i must leave to catch the scotch mail  she rose at once to her feet and swept her cloak haughtily around her  i have made a mistake she said be so good as to pardon my intrusion i shall not trouble you again  she was halfway across the room she was at the door her hand was upon the handle he was white to the lips his whole frame was shaking with the effort of intense repression he kept silence till only a flutter of her cloak was to be seen in the doorway and then the cry which he had tried so hard to stifle broke from his lips  lucille lucille  she hesitated and came backlooking at him so he thought with trembling lips and eyes soft with unshed tears  i was a brute he murmured i ought to be grateful for this chance of seeing you once more of saying goodbye to you  goodbye she repeated  yes he said gravely it must be goodbye i have a great work before me and it will cut me off completely from all association with your world and your friends something wider and deeper than an ocean will divide us something so wide that our hands will never reach across  you can talk about it very calmly she said without looking at him  i have been disciplining myself he answered  she rested her face upon her hand and looked into the fire  i suppose she said this means that you have refused mr letheringhams offer  i have refused it he answered  i am sorry she said simply  she rose from her chair with a sudden start began to draw on her cloak and then let it fall altogether from her shoulders  why do you do this she asked earnestly is it that you are so ambitious you used not to be soin the old days  he laughed bitterly  you too then he said can remember ambitious well why not to be premier of england to stand for the people to carry through to its logical consummation a bloodless revolution surely this is worth while is there anything in the world better worth having than power  yes she answered looking him full in the eyes  what is it then let me know before it is too late  love  he threw his arms about her for a moment she was powerless in his grasp  so be it then he cried fiercely give me the one and i will deny the other only no half measures i will drink to the bottom of the cup or not at all  she shook herself free from him breathless consumed with an anger to which she dared not give voice for a moment or two she was speechless her bosom rose and fell a bright streak of colour flared in her cheeks brott stood away from her white and stern  youare clumsy she said you frighten me  her words carried no conviction he looked at her with a new suspicion  you talk like a child he answered roughly or else your whole conduct is a fraud for months i have been your slave i have abandoned my principles given you my time followed at your heels like a tame dog and for what you will not marry me you will not commit yourself to anything you are a past mistress in the art of binding fools to your chariot wheels you know that i love youthat there breathes on this earth no other woman for me but you i have told you this in all save words a hundred times and nownow it is my turn i have been played with long enough you are here unbiddenunexpected you can consider that door locked now tell me why you came  lucille had recovered herself she stood before him white but calm  because she said i am a woman  that means that you came without reasonon impulse he asked  i came she said because i heard that you were about to take a step which must separate us for ever  and that he asked disturbed you  yes  come we are drawing nearer together he said a kindling light in his eyes now answer me this how much do you care if this eternal separation does come here am i on the threshold of action unless i change my mind within ten minutes i must throw in my lot with those whom you and your order loathe and despise there can be no half measures i must be their leader or i must vanish from the face of the political world this i will do if you bid me but the price must be yourselfwholly without reservationyourself body and soul  you careas much as that she murmured  ask me no questions answer mine he cried fiercely you shall stay with me hereor in five minutes i leave on my campaign  she laughed musically  this is positively delicious she exclaimed i am being made love to in medieval fashion other times other manners sir will you listen to reason  i will listen to nothingsave your answer yes or no he declared drawing on his overcoat  she laid her hand upon his shoulder  reginald she said you are like the whirlwindand how can i answer you in five minutes  you can answer me in one he declared fiercely will you pay my price if i do your bidding yes or no the price is yourself now yes or no  she drew on her own cloak and fastened the clasp with shaking fingers then she turned towards the door  i wish you goodbye and good fortune reginald she said i daresay we may not meet again it will be better that we do not  this then is your answer he cried  she looked around at him was it his fancy or were those tears in her eyes or was she really so wonderful an actress  do you think she said that if i had not cared i should have come here  tell me that in plain words he cried it is all i ask  the door was suddenly opened grahame stood upon the threshold he looked beyond lucille to brott  you must really forgive me he said but there is barely time to catch the train brott i have a hansom waiting and your luggage is on  brott answered nothing lucille held out her hands to him  yes or no he asked her in a low hoarse tone  you mustgive me time i dont want to lose you i  he caught up his coat  coming grahame he said firmly countess i must beg your pardon ten thousand times for this abrupt departure my servants will call your carriage  she leaned towards him beautiful anxious alluring  reginald  yes or no he whispered in her ear  give me until tomorrow she faltered  not one moment he answered yesnow this instantor i go  brott my dear man we have not a second to lose  you hear he muttered yes or no  she trembled  give me until tomorrow she begged it is for your own sake for your own safety  he turned on his heel his muttered speech was profane but inarticulate he sprang into the hansom by grahames side  euston the latter cried through the trapdoor double fare cabby we must catch the scotchman  lucille came out a few moments later and looked up and down the street as her brougham drove smartly up the hansom was fast disappearing in the distance she looked after it and sighed    chapter xxvi  lucille gave a little start of amazement as she realised that she was not alone in the brougham she reached out for the checkcord but a strong hand held hers  my dear lucille a familiar voice exclaimed why this alarm is it your nerves or your eyesight which is failing you  her hand dropped she turned towards him  it is you then prince she said but why are you here i do not understand  the prince shrugged his shoulders  it is so simple he said we are all very anxious indeed to hear the result of your interview with brottand apart from that i personally have too few opportunities to act as your escort to let a chance go by i trust that my presence is not displeasing to you  she laughed a little uneasily  it is at any rate unnecessary she answered but since you are here i may as well make my confession i have failed  it is incredible the prince murmured  as you willbut it is true she answered i have done my very best or rather my worst and the result has been failure mr brott has a great frienda man named grahame whose influence prevailed against mine he has gone to scotland  that is serious news the prince said quietly  lucille leaned back amongst the cushions  after all she declared we are all out of place in this country there is no scope whatever for such schemes and intrigues as you and all the rest of them delight in in france and russia even in austria it is different the working of all great organisation there is undergroundit is easy enough to meet plot by counterplot to suborn to deceive to undermine but here all the great games of life seem to be played with the cards upon the table we are hopelessly out of place i cannot think prince what ill chance led you to ever contemplate making your headquarters in london  the prince stroked his long moustache  that is all very well lucille he said but you must remember that in england we have very large subscriptions to the order these people will not go on paying for nothing there was a meeting of the london branch a few months ago and it was decided that unless some practical work was done in this country all english subscriptions should cease we had no alternative but to come over and attempt something brott is of course the bete noire of our friends here he is distinctly the man to be struck at  and what evil stroke of fortune lucille asked induced you to send for me  that is a very cruel speech dear lady the prince murmured  i hope lucille said that you have never for a moment imagined that i find any pleasure in what i am called upon to do  why not it must be interesting you can have had no sympathy with brotta hopeless plebeian a very paragon of anglosaxon stupidity  lucille laughed scornfully  reginald brott is a man at any rate and an honest one she answered but i am too selfish to think much of him it is myself whom i pity i have a home prince and a husband i want them both  you amaze me the prince said slowly lucille indeed you amaze me you have been buried alive for three years positively we believed that our summons would sound to you like a message from heaven  lucille was silent for a moment she rubbed the mist from the carriage window and looked out into the streets  well she said i hope that you realise now how completely you have misunderstood me i was perfectly happy in america i have been perfectly miserable here i suppose that i have grown too old for intrigues and adventures  too old lucille the prince murmured leaning a little towards her lucille you are the most beautiful woman in london many others may have told you so but there is no one lucille who is so devotedly so hopelessly your slave as i  she drew her hand away and sat back in her corner the mans hot breath fell upon her cheek his eyes seemed almost phosphorescent in the darkness lucille could scarcely keep the biting words from her tongue  you do not answer me lucille you do not speak even a single kind word to me come surely we are old friends we should understand one another it is not a great deal that i ask from your kindnessnot a great deal to you but it is all the difference between happiness and misery for me  this is a very wornout game prince lucille said coldly you have been making love to women in very much the same manner for twenty years and iwell to be frank i am utterly weary of being made love to like a doll laugh at me as you will my husband is the only man who interests me in the slightest my failure today is almost welcome to me it has at least brought my work here to a close come prince if you want to earn my eternal gratitude tell me now that i am a free woman  you give me credit the prince said slowly for great generosity if i let you go it seems to me that i shall lose you altogether you will go to your husband he will take you away  why not lucille asked i want to go i am tired of london you cannot lose what you never possessedwhat you never had the slightest chance of possessing  the prince laughed softlynot a pleasant laugh not even a mirthful one  dear lady he said you speak not wisely for i am very much in earnest when i say that i love you and until you are kinder to me i shall not let you go  that is rather a dangerous threat is it not lucille asked you dare to tell me openly that you will abuse your position that you will keep me bound a servant to the cause because of this foolish fancy of yours  the prince smiled at her through the glooma white set smile  it is no foolish fancy lucille you will find that out before long you have been cold to me all your life yet you would find me a better friend than enemy  if i am to choose she said steadily i shall choose the latter  as you will he answered in time you will change your mind  the carriage had stopped the prince alighted and held out his hand lucille half rose and then with her foot upon the step she paused and looked around  where are we she exclaimed this is not dorset house  no we are in grosvenor square the prince answered i forgot to tell you that we have a meeting arranged for here this evening permit me but lucille resumed her seat in the carriage  it is your house is it not she asked  yes my house assuredly  very well lucille said i will come in when the duchess of dorset shows herself at the window or the front dooror felix or even de brouillae  the prince still held open the carriage door  they will all be here he assured her we are a few minutes early  then i will drive round to dorset house and fetch the duchess it is only a few yards  the prince hesitated his cheeks were very white and something like a scowl was blackening his heavy insipid face  lucille he said you are very foolish it is not much i ask of you but that little i will have or i pledge my word to it that things shall go ill with you and your husband there is plain speech for you do not be absurd come within and let us talk what do you fear the house is full of servants and the carriage can wait for you here  lucille smiled at hima maddening smile  i am not a child she said and such conversations as i am forced to hold with you will not be under your own roof be so good as to tell the coachman to drive to dorset house  the prince turned on his heel with a furious oath  he can drive you to hell he answered thickly  lucille found the duchess and lady carey together at dorset house she looked from one to the other  i thought that there was a meeting tonight she remarked  the duchess shook her head  not tonight she answered it would not be possible general dolinski is dining at marlborough house and de broullae is in paris now tell us all about mr brott  he has gone to scotland lucille answered i have failed  lady carey looked up from the depths of the chair in which she was lounging  and the prince she asked he went to meet you  he also failed lucille answered    chapter xxvii  mr sabin drew a little breath partly of satisfaction because he had discovered the place he sought and partly of disgust at the neighbourhood in which he found himself nevertheless he descended three steps from the court into which he had been directed and pushed open the swing door behind which emil sachs announced his desire to supply the world with dinners at eightpence and vin ordinaire at fourpence the small bottle  a stout blackeyed woman looked up at his entrance from behind the counter the place was empty  what does monsieur require she asked peering forward through the gloom with some suspicion for the eightpenny dinners were the scorn of the neighbourhood and strangers were rare in the wine shop of emil sachs  mr sabin smiled  one of your excellent omelettes my good annette he answered if your hand has not lost its cunning  she gave a little cry  it is monsieur she exclaimed after all these years it is monsieur ah you will pardon that i did not recognise you this place is a cellar monsieur has not changed in the daylight one would know him anywhere  the woman talked fast but even in that dim light mr sabin knew quite well that she was shaking with fear he could see the corners of her mouth twitch her black eyes rolled incessantly but refused to meet his mr sabin frowned  you are not glad to see me annette  she leaned over the counter  for monsieurs own sake she whispered go  mr sabin stood quite still for a short space of time  can i rest in there for a few minutes he asked pointing to the door which led into the room beyond  the woman hesitated she looked up at the clock and down again  emil will return she said at three monsieur were best out of the neighbourhood before then for ten minutes it might be safe  mr sabin passed forward the woman lifted the flap of the counter and followed him within was a smaller room far cleaner and better appointed than the general appearance of the place promised mr sabin seated himself at one of the small tables the linen cloth he noticed was spotless the cutlery and appointments polished and clean  this i presume he remarked is not where you serve the eightpenny table dhote  the woman shrugged her shoulders  but it would not be possible she answered we have no customers for that if one arrives we put together a few scraps but one must make a pretense monsieur understands  mr sabin nodded  i will take he said a small glass of fin champagne  she vanished and reappeared almost immediately with the brandy in a quaintly cut liqueur glass a glance at the clock as she passed seemed to have increased her anxiety  if monsieur will drink his liqueur and depart she prayed indeed it will be for the best  mr sabin set down his glass his steadfast gaze seemed to reduce annette into a state of nervous panic  annette he said they have placed me upon the list  it is true monsieur she answered why do you come here  i wanted to know first for certain that they had ventured so far mr sabin said i believe that i am only the second person in this country who has been so much honoured  the woman drew nearer to him  monsieur she said your only danger is to venture into such parts as these london is so safe and the law is merciless they only watch they will attempt nothing do not leave england there is here no machinery of criminals besides the life of monsieur is insured  insured mr sabin remarked quietly that is good news and who pays the premium  a great lady monsieur i know no more monsieur must go indeed he has found his way into the only place in london where he is not safe  mr sabin rose  you are expecting perhaps he said one of my friends from the  she interrupted him  it is true she declared he may be here at any instant the time is already up oh monsieur indeed indeed it would not do for him to find you  mr sabin moved towards the door  you are perhaps right he said regretfully although i should much like to hear about this little matter of life insurance while i am here  indeed monsieur annette declared i know nothing there is nothing which i can tell monsieur  mr sabin suddenly leaned forward his gaze was compelling his tone was low but terrible  annette he said obey me send emil here  the woman trembled but she did not move mr sabin lifted his forefinger and pointed slowly to the door the womans lips parted but she seemed to have lost the power of speech  send emil here mr sabin repeated slowly  annette turned and left the room groping her way to the door as though her eyesight had become uncertain mr sabin lit a cigarette and looked for a moment carefully into the small liqueur glass out of which he had drunk  that was unwise he said softly to himself just such a blunder might have cost me everything  he held it up to the light and satisfied himself that no dregs remained then he took from his pocket a tiny little revolver and placing it on the table before him covered it with his handkerchief almost immediately a door at the farther end of the room opened and closed a man in dark clothes small unnaturally pale with deepset eyes and nervous twitching mouth stood before him mr sabin smiled a welcome at him  goodmorning emil sachs he said i am glad that you have shown discretion stand there in the light please and fold your arms thanks do not think that i am afraid of you but i like to talk comfortably  i am at monsieurs service the man said in a low tone  exactly now emil before starting to visit you i left a little note behind addressed to the chief of the police hereno you need not startto be sent to him only if my return were unduly delayed you can guess what that note contained it is not necessary for us to revert tounpleasant subjects  the man moistened his dry lips  it is not necessary he repeated monsieur is as safe herefrom meas at his own hotel  excellent mr sabin said now listen emil it has pleased me chiefly as you know for the sake of your wife the good annette to be very merciful to you as regards the past but i do not propose to allow you to run a poison bureau for the advantage of the prince of saxe leinitzer and his friendsmore especially perhaps as i am at present upon his list of superfluous persons  the man trembled  monsieur he said the prince knows as much as you know and he has not the mercy that one shows to a dog  you will find mr sabin said that if you do not obey me i myself can develop a similar disposition now answer me this you have within the last few days supplied several people with that marvelous powder for the preparation of which you are so justly famed  severalno monsieur two only  their names  the man trembled  if they should know  they will not emil i will see to that  the first i supplied to the order of the prince  good and the second  to a lady whose name i do not know  mr sabin raised his eyebrows  is not that he remarked a little irregular  the lady wrote her request before me in the yellow crayon it was sufficient  and you do not know her name emil  no monsieur she was dark and tall and closely veiled she was here but a few minutes since  dark and tall mr sabin repeated to himself thoughtfully emil you are telling me the truth  i do not dare to tell you anything else monsieur the man answered  mr sabin did not continue his interrogations for a few moments suddenly he looked up  has that lady left the place yet emil  no monsieur  mr sabin smiled  have you a back exit he asked  none that the lady would know of emil answered she must pass along the passage which borders this apartment and enter the bar by a door from behind if monsieur desires it it is impossible for her to leave unobserved  that is excellent emil mr sabin said now there is one more questionquite a harmless one annette spoke of my life being in some way insured  it is true monsieur emil admitted a lady who also possessed the yellow crayon came here the day thatthat monsieur incurred the displeasure ofof his friends she tried to bribe me to blow up my laboratory and leave the country or that i should substitute a harmless powder for any required by the prince i was obliged to refuse  and then  then she promised me a large sum if you were alive in six months and made me at once a payment  dear me mr sabin said this is quite extraordinary  i can tell monsieur the ladys name emil continued for she raised her veil and everywhere the illustrated papers have been full of her picture it was the lady who was besieged in a little town of south africa and who carried despatches for the general disguised as a man  lady carey mr sabin remarked quietly  that was the ladys name emil agreed  mr sabin was thoughtful for a few moments then he looked up  emil sachs he said sternly you have given out at least one portion of your abominable concoction which is meant to end my days whether i shall escape it or not remains to be seen i am forced at the best to discharge my servant and to live the life of a hunted man now you have done enough mischief in the world tomorrow morning a messenger will place in your hands two hundred pounds a larger sum will await you at barings bank in new york you will go there and buy a small restaurant in the business quarter this is your last chance emil i give it to you for the sake of annette  and i accept it monsieur with gratitude  for the present  mr sabin stopped short his quick ears had caught the swish of womans gown passing along the passage outside emil too had heard it  it is the dark lady he whispered who purchased from me the other powder see i open gently this door monsieur must both see and hear  the door at the end of the passage was opened a woman stepped out into the little bar and made her way towards the door here she was met by a man entering mr sabin held up his forefinger to stop the terrified exclamation which trembled on emils lips the woman was lucille the man the prince it was lucille who was speaking  you have followed me prince it is intolerable  dear lucille it is for your own sake these are not fit parts for you to visit alone  it is my own business she answered coldly  the prince appeared to be in a complaisant mood  come he said the affair is not worth a quarrel i ask you no questions only since we are here i propose that we test the cooking of the good annette we will lunch together  what here she answered absurd  by no means he answered as you doubtless know the exterior of the place is entirely misleading these people are old servants of mine i can answer for the luncheon  you can also eat it came the prompt reply i am returning to the carriage  but  mr sabin emerged through the swing door your discretion my dear lucille he said smiling is excellent the place is indeed better than it seems and annettes cookery may be all that the prince claims yet i think i know better places for a luncheon party and the ventilation is not of the best may i suggest that you come with me instead to the milan  victor you here  mr sabin smiled as he admitted the obvious fact the princes face was as black as night  believe me mr sabin said turning to the prince i sympathise entirely with your feelings at the present moment i myself have suffered in precisely the same manner the fact is intrigue in this country is almost an impossibility at paris vienna pesth how different you raise your little finger and the deed is done superfluous peoplelike myselfare removed like the hairs from your chin but here intrigue seems indeed to exist only within the pages of a shilling novel or in a comic opera the gentleman with a helmet there who regards us so benignly will presently earn a shilling by calling me a hansom yet in effect he does me a far greater service he stands for a multitude of cold anglosaxon laws adamant incorruptible inflexibleas certain as the laws of nature herself i am quite aware that by this time i ought to be lying in a dark cellar with a gag in my mouth or perhaps in the river with a dagger in my chest but here in england no  the prince smiledto all appearance a very genial smile  you are right my dear friend he said yet what you say possesses shall we call it a somewhat antediluvian flavour intrigue is no longer a clumsy game of knife and string and bowl it becomes today a game of finesse i can assure you that i have no desire to give a stage whistle and have you throttled at my feet on the contrary i beg you to use my carriage which you will find in the street you will lunch at the milan with lucille and i shall retire discomfited to eat alone at my club but the game is a long one my dear friend the new methods take time  this conversation mr sabin said to lucille is interesting but it is a little ungallant i think that we will resume it at some future occasion shall we accept the princes offer or shall we be truly democratic and take a hansom  lucille passed her arm through his and laughed  you are robbing the prince of me she declared let us leave him his carriage  she nodded her farewells to saxe leinitzer who took leave of them with a low bow as they waited at the corner for a hansom mr sabin glanced back the prince had disappeared through the swing doors  i want you to promise me one thing lucille said earnestly  it is promised mr sabin answered  you will not ask me the reason of my visit to this place  i have no curiosity mr sabin answered come    chapter xxviii  mr sabin contrary to his usual custom engaged a private room at the milan lucille was in the highest spirits  if only this were a game instead of reality she said flashing a brilliant smile at him across the table i should find it most fascinating you seem to come to me always when i want you most and do you know it is perfectly charming to be carried off by you in this manner  mr sabin smiled at her and there was a look in his eyes which shone there for no other woman  it is in effect he said keeping me young events seem to have enclosed us in a curious little cobweb all the time we are struggling between the rankest primitivism and the most delicate intrigue today is the triumph of primitivism  meaning that you the medieval knight have carried me off the distressed maiden on your shoulder  having confounded my enemy he continued smiling by an embarrassing situation a little argument and the distant view of a policemans helmet  this she remarked with a little satisfied sigh as she selected an ortolan is a very satisfactory place to be carried off to and you she added leaning across the table and touching his fingers for a moment tenderly are a very delightful knighterrant  he raised the fingers to his lipsthe waiter had left the room she blushed but yielded her hand readily enough  victor she murmured you would spoil the most faithless woman on earth for all her lovers you make me very impatient  impatience then he declared must be the most infectious of fevers for i too am a terrible sufferer  if only the prince she said would be reasonable  i am afraid mr sabin answered that from him we have not much to hope for  yet she continued i have fulfilled all the conditions reginald brott remains the enemy of our cause and order yet some say that his influence upon the people is lessened in any case my work is over he began to mistrust me long ago today i believe that mistrust is the only feeling he has in connection with me i shall demand my release  i am afraid mr sabin said that saxe leinitzer has other reasons for keeping you at dorset house  she shrugged her shoulders  he has been very persistent even before i left vienna but he must know that it is hopeless i have never encouraged him  i am sure of it mr sabin said it is the incorrigible vanity of the man which will not be denied he has been taught to believe himself irresistible i have never doubted you for a single moment lucille i could not but you have been the slave of these people long enough as you say your task is over its failure was always certain brott believes in his destiny and it will be no slight thing which will keep him from following it they must give you back to me  we will go back to america she said i have never been so happy as at lenox  nor i mr sahin said softly  besides she continued the times have changed since i joined the society in hungary you know how things were the socialists were carrying all before them a united solid body the aristocracy were forced to enter into some sort of combination against them we saved austria i am not sure that we did not save russia but england is different the aristocracy here are a strong resident class they have their house of lords they own the land and will own it for many years to come their position is unassailable it is the worst country in europe for us to work in the very climate and the dispositions of the people are inimical to intrigue it is muriel carey who brought the society here it was a mistake the country is in no need of it there is no scope for it  if only one could get beyond saxe leinitzer mr sabin said  she shook her head  behind him she said there is only the one to whom all reference is forbidden and there is no man in the world who would be less likely to listen to an appeal from youor from me  after all mr sabin said though saxe leinitzer is our enemy i am not sure that he can do us any harm if he declines to release youwell when the twelve months are up you are free whether he wishes it or not he has put me outside the pale but this is not or never was a vindictive society they do not deal in assassinations in this country at least anything of the sort is rarely attempted if i were a young man with my life to live in the capitals of europe i should be more or less a social outcast i suppose but i am proof against that sort of thing  lucille looked a little doubtful  the prince she said is an intriguer of the old school i know that in vienna he has more than once made use of more violent means than he would dare to do here and there is an underneath machinery very seldom used i believe and of which none of us who are ordinary members know anything at all which gives him terrible powers  mr sabin nodded grimly  it was worked against me in america he said but i got the best of it here in england i do not believe that he would dare to use it if so i think that before now it would have been aimed at brott i have just read his glasgow speech if he becomes premier it will lead to something like a revolution  she sighed  brott is a clever man and a strong man she said i am sorry for him but i do not believe that he will never become prime minister of england  mr sabin sipped his wine thoughtfully  i believe he said that intrigue is the resource of those who have lived their lives so quickly that they have found weariness for these things today interest me very little i am only anxious to have you back again lucille to find ourselves on our way to our old home  she laughed softly  and i used to think she said that after all i could only keep you a little timethat presently the voices from the outside world would come whispering in your ears and you would steal back again to where the wheels of life were turning  a man he answered is not easily whispered out of paradise  she laughed at him  ah it is so easy she said to know that your youth was spent at a court  there is only one court he answered where men learn to speak the truth  she leaned back in her chair  oh you are incorrigible she said softly the one role in life in which i fancied you ill at ease you seem to fill to perfection  and that  you are an adorable husband  i should like he said a better opportunity to prove it  let us hope she murmured that our separation is nearly over i shall appeal to the prince tonight my remaining at dorset house is no longer necessary  i shall come he said and demand you in person  she shook her head  no they would not let you in and it would make it more difficult be patient a little longer  he came and sat by her side she leaned over to meet his embrace  you make patience he murmured a torture                                                      mr sabin walked home to his rooms late in the afternoon well content on the whole with his day he was in no manner prepared for the shock which greeted him on entering his sittingroom duson was leaning back in his most comfortable easychair  duson mr sabin said sharply what does this mean  there was no answer mr sabin moved quickly forward and then stopped short he had seen dead men and he knew the signs duson was stone dead  mr sabins nerve answered to this demand upon it he checked his first impulse to ring the bell and looked carefully on the table for some note or message from the dead man he found it almost at oncea large envelope in dusons handwriting mr sabin hastily broke the seal and read    monsieuri kill myself because it is easiest and best  the   poison was given me for you but i have not the courage to become   a murderer or afterwards to conceal my guilt  monsieur has been   a good master to me and also madame la comtesse was always   indulgent and kind  the mistake of my life has been the joining   the lower order of the society  the money which i have received   has been but a poor return for the anxiety and trouble which have   come upon me since madame la comtesse left america  now that i   seek shelter in the grave i am free to warn monsieur that the   prince of s l is his determined and merciless enemy and that   he has already made an unlawful use of his position in the society   for the sake of private vengeance  if monsieur would make a   powerful friend he should seek the lady muriel carey    monsieur will be so good as to destroy this when read  my will   is in my trunk                                  your graces faithful servant                                          jules duson  mr sabin read this letter carefully through to the end then he put it into his pocketbook and quickly rang the bell  you had better send for a doctor at once he said to the waiter who appeared my servant appears to have suffered from some sudden illness i am afraid that he is quite dead    chapter xxix  you spoke my dear lucille the duchess of dorset said of your departure is not that a little premature  lucille shrugged her beautiful shoulders and leaned back in her corner of the couch with halfclosed eyes the duchess who was very anglosaxon was an easy person to read and lucille was anxious to know her fate  why premature she asked i was sent for to use my influence with reginald brott well i did my best and i believe that for days it was just a chance whether i did not succeed however as it happened i failed one of his friends came and pulled him away just as he was wavering he has declared himself now once and for all after his speech at glasgow he cannot draw back i was brought all the way from america and i want to go back to my husband  the duchess pursed her lips  when one has the honour my dear she said of belonging to so wonderful an organisation as this we must not consider too closely the selfish claims of family i am sure that years ago i should have laughed at any one who had told me that i georgina croxton should ever belong to such a thing as a secret society even though it had some connection with so harmless and excellent an organisation as the primrose league  it does seem remarkable lucille murmured  but look what terrible times have come upon us the duchess continued without heeding the interruption when i was a girl a radical was a person absolutely without consideration now all our great cities are hotbeds of socialism andand anarchism the whole country seems banded together against the aristocracy and the landowners combination amongst us became absolutely necessary in some shape or form when the prince came and began to drop hints about the way the spread of socialism had been checked in hungary and austria and even germany i was interested from the first and when he went further and spoke of the society it was i who persuaded dorset to join dear man he is very earnest but very slow and very averse to anything at all secretive i am sure the reflection that he is a member of a secret society even although it is simply a linking together of the aristocracy of europe in their own defence has kept him awake for many a night  lucille was a little bored  the society she said is an admirable one enough but just now i am beginning to feel it a little exacting i think that the prince expects a good deal of one i shall certainly ask for my release tonight  the duchess looked doubtful  release she repeated come is that not rather an exaggerated expression i trust that your stay at dorset house has not in any way suggested an imprisonment  on the contrary lucille answered you and the duke have been most kind but you must remember that i have home of my ownand a husband of my own  i have no doubt the duchess said that you will be able to return to them some day but you must not be impatient i do not think that the prince has given up all hopes of reginald brott yet  lucille was silent so her emancipation was to be postponed after all it was what she had feared she sat watching idly the duchesss knitting needles lady carey came sweeping in wonderful in a black velvet gown and a display of jewels almost barbaric  on my way to the opera she announced the maddersons sent me their box will any of you good people come what do you say lucille  lucille shook her head  my toilette is deficient she said and besides i am staying at home to see the prince we expect him this evening  youll probably be disappointed then lady carey remarked for hes going to join us at the opera run and change your gown ill wait  are you sure that the prince will be there lucille asked  certain  then i will come she said if the duchess will excuse me  the duchess and lady carey were left alone for a few minutes the former put down her knitting  why do we keep that woman here she asked now that brott has broken away from her altogether  lady carey laughed meaningly  better ask the prince she remarked  the duchess frowned  my dear muriel she said i think that you are wrong to make such insinuations i am sure that the prince is too much devoted to our cause to allow any personal considerations to intervene  lady carey yawned  rats she exclaimed  the duchess took up her knitting and went on with it without remark lady carey burst out laughing  dont look so shocked she exclaimed its funny i cant help being a bit slangy you do take everything so seriously of course you can see that the prince is waiting to make a fool of himself over lucille he has been trying more or less all his life  he may admire her the duchess said i am sure that he would not allow that to influence him in his present position by the bye she is anxious to leave us now that the brott affair is over do you think that the prince will agree  lady careys face hardened  i am sure that he will not she said coolly there are reasons why she may not at present be allowed to rejoin her husband  the duchess used her needles briskly  for my part she said i can see no object in keeping her here any longer mr brott has shown himself quite capable of keeping her at arms length i cannot see what further use she is  lady carey heard the flutter of skirts outside and rose  there are wheels within wheels she remarked my dear lucille what a charming toilette we shall have the lady journalists besieging us in our box paquin of course goodnight duchess glad to see youre getting on with the socks or stockings do you call them  insolent aristocratic now and then attractive in some strange suggestive way lady carey sat in front of the box and exchanged greetings with her friends presently the prince came in and took the chair between the two women lady carey greeted him with a nod  heres lucille dying to return to her lawful husband she remarked odd thing isnt it most of the married women i ever knew are dying to get away from theirs you can make her happy or miserable in a few moments  the prince leaned over between them but he looked only at lucille  i wish that i could he murmured i wish that that were within my power  it is she answered coolly muriel is quite right i am most anxious to return to my husband  the prince said nothing lady carey glancing towards him at that moment was surprised at certain signs of disquietude in his face which startled her  what is the matter with you she asked almost roughly  matter with me nothing he answered why this unaccustomed solicitude  lady carey looked into his face fiercely he was pale and there was a strained look about his eyes he seemed too to be listening from outside in the street came faintly to their ears the cry of a newsboy  get me an evening paper she whispered in his ear  he got up and left the box lucille was watching the people below and had not appreciated the significance of what had been passing between the two lady carey leaned back in the box with halfclosed eyes her fingers were clenched nervously together her bosom was rising and falling quickly if he had dared to defy her what was it the newsboys were calling what a jargon why did not saxe leinitzer return perhaps he was afraid her heart stood still for a moment and a little halfstifled cry broke from her lips lucille looked around quickly  what is the matter muriel she asked are you faint  faint no lady carey answered roughly im quite well dont take any notice of me do you hear dont look at me  lucille obeyed lady carey sat quite still with her hand pressed to her side it was a stifling pain she was sure that she had heard at last sudden death of a visitor at the carlton hotel the place was beginning to go round  saxe leinitzer returned his face to her seemed positively ghastly he carried an evening paper in his hand she snatched it away from him it was there before her in bold black letters  sudden death in the carlton hotel  her eyes dim a moment ago suddenly blazed fire upon him  it shall be a life for a life she whispered if you have killed him you shall die  lucille looked at them bewildered and just then came a sharp tap at the box door no one answered it but the door was softly opened mr sabin stood upon the threshold  pray dont let me disturb you he said i was unable to refrain from paying you a brief visit why prince lady carey i can assure you that i am no ghost  he glanced from one to the other with a delicate smile of mockery parting his thin lips for upon the princes forehead the perspiration stood out like beads and he shrank away from mr sabin as from some unholy thing lady carey had fallen back across her chair her hand was still pressed to her side and her face was very pale a nervous little laugh broke from her lips    chapter xxx  mr sabin found a fourth chair and calmly seated himself by lucilles side but his eyes were fixed upon lady carey she was slowly recovering herself but mr sabin who had never properly understood her attitude towards him was puzzled at the air of intense relief which almost shone in her face  you seemall of you he remarked suavely to have found the music a little exciting wagner certainly knew how to find his way to the emotions or perhaps i interrupted an interesting discussion  lucille smiled gently upon him  these two she said looking from the prince to lady carey seem to have been afflicted with a sudden nervous excitement and yet i do not think that they are either of them very susceptible to music  lady carey leaned forward and looked at him from behind the large fan of white feathers which she was lazily fluttering before her face  your entrance she murmured was most opportune besides being very welcome the prince and i were literallyon the point of flying at one anothers throats  mr sabin glanced at his neighbour and smiled  you are certainly a little out of sorts saxe leinitzer he remarked you look pale and your hands are not quite steady nerves i suppose you should see dr carson in brook street  the prince shrugged his shoulders  my health he said was never better it is true that your coming was somewhat of a surprise he added looking steadily at mr sabin i understood that you had gone for a short journey and i was not expecting to see you back again so soon  duson mr sabin said has taken that short journey instead it was rather a liberty but he left a letter for me fully explaining his motives i cannot blame him  the prince stroked his moustache  ah he remarked that is a pity you may however find it politic even necessary to join him very shortly  mr sabin smiled grimly  i shall go when i am ready he said not before  lucille looked from one to the other with protesting eyebrows  come she said it is very impolite of you to talk in riddles before my face i have been flattering myself victor that you were here to see me do not wound my vanity  he whispered something in her ear and she laughed softly back at him the prince with the evening paper in his hand escaped from the box and found a retired spot where he could read the little paragraph at his leisure lady carey pretended to be absorbed by the music  has anything happened victor lucille whispered  he hesitated  well in a sense yes he admitted i appear to have become unpopular with our friend the prince duson who has always been a spy upon my movements was entrusted with a little sleeping draught for me which he preferred to take himself that is all  duson is  he nodded  he is dead  lucille went very pale  this is horrible she murmured  the prince is a little annoyed naturally mr sabin said it is vexing to have your plans upset in such a manner  she shuddered  he is hateful victor i fear that he does not mean to let me leave dorset house just yet i am almost inclined to become like you an outcast who knowswe might go free bloodshed is always avoided as much as possible and i do not see how else they could strike at me social ostracism is their chief weapon but in america that could not hurt us  he shook his head  not yet he said i am sure that saxe leinitzer is not playing the game but he is too well served here to make defiance wise  you run the risk yourself she protested  he smiled  it is a different matter by the bye we are overheard  lady carey had forgotten to listen any more to the music she was watching them both a steely light in her eyes her fingers nervously entwined the prince was still absent  pray do not consider me she begged so far as i am concerned your conversation is of no possible interest but i think you had better remember that the prince is in the corridor just outside  we are much obliged to you mr sabin said the prince may hear every word i have to say about him but all the same i thank you for your warning  i fear that we are very unsociable muriel lucille said and after all i should never have been here but for you  lady carey turned her left shoulder upon them  i beg she said that you will leave me alone with the music i prefer it  the prince suddenly stood upon the threshold his hand rested lightly upon the arm of another man  come in brott he said the women will be charmed to see you and i dont suppose theyve read your speeches countess here is the man who counts all equal under the sun who decries class and recognises no social distinctions brott was born to lead a revolution he is our natural enemy let us all try to convert him  brott was pale and deep new lines were furrowed on his face nevertheless he smiled faintly as he bowed over lucilles fingers  my introduction he remarked is scarcely reassuring yet here at least if anywhere in the world we should all meet upon equal ground music is a universal leveler  and we havent a chance lady carey remarked with uplifted eyebrows of listening to a bar of it  lucille welcomed the newcomer coldly nevertheless he manoeuvred himself into the place by her side she took up her fan and commenced swinging it thoughtfully  you are surprised to see me here he murmured  yes she admitted  he looked wearily away from the stage up into her face  and i too he said i am surprised to find myself here  i pictured you she remarked as immersed in affairs did i not hear something of a radical ministry with you for premier  it has been spoken of he admitted  then i really cannot see she said what you are doing here  why not he asked doggedly  she shrugged her shoulders  in the first place she said you ought to be rushing about amongst your supporters keeping them up to the mark and all that sort of thing and in the second  well  are we not the very people against whom you have declared war  i have declared war against no people he answered it is systems and classes abuses injustice against which i have been forced to speak i would not deprive your order of a single privilege to which they are justly entitled but you must remember that i am a peoples man their cause is mine they look to me as their mouthpiece  lucille shrugged her shoulders  you cannot evade the point she said if you are the what do you call it the mouthpiece of the people i do not see how you can be anything else than the enemy of the aristocracy  the aristocracy who are they he asked i am the enemy of all those who because they possess an ancient name and inherited wealth consider themselves the godappointed bullies of the poor dealing them out meagre charities lordly patronage an unspoken but bitter contempt but the aristocracy of the earth are not of such as these your class are furnishing the world with advanced thinkers every year every month inherited prejudices can never survive the next few generations the fusion of classes must come  she shook her head  you are sanguine my friend she said many generations have come and gone since the wonderful pages of history were opened to us and during all these years how much nearer have the serf and the aristocrat come together nay have they not rather drifted apart but listen this is the great chorus we must not miss it  so the prince has brought back the wanderer lady carey whispered to mr sabin behind her fan hasnt he rather the air of a sheep who has strayed from the fold  mr sabin raised the horn eyeglass which he so seldom used and contemplated brott steadily  he reminds me more than ever he remarked of rienzi he is like a man torn asunder by great causes they say that his speech at glasgow was the triumph of a born orator  lady carey shrugged her shoulders  it was practically the preaching a revolution to the people she said a few more such and we might have the red flag waving he left glasgow in a ferment if he really comes into power what are we to expect  to the onlookers mr sabin remarked a revolution in this country would possess many interesting features the common people lack the ferocity of our own rabble but they are even more determined i may yet live to see an english duke earning an honest living in the states  it depends very much upon brott lady carey said for his own sake it is a pity that he is in love with lucille  mr sabin agreed with her blandly  it is he affirmed a most regrettable incident  she leaned a little towards him the box was not a large one and their chairs already touched  are you a jealous husband she asked  horribly he answered  your devotion to lucille or rather the singleness of your devotion to lucille she remarked is positively the most gauche thing about you it isabsolutely callow  he laughed gently  did i not always tell you he said that when i did marry i should make an excellent husband  you are at least she answered sharply a very complaisant one  the prince leaned forward from the shadows of the box  i invite you all he said to supper with me it is something of an occasion this for i do not think that we shall all meet again just as we are now for a very long time  your invitation mr sabin remarked is most agreeable but your suggestion is to say the least of it nebulous i do not see what is to prevent your all having supper with me tomorrow evening  lady carey laughed as she rose and stretched out her hand for her cloak  tomorrow evening she said is a long way off let us make sure of tonightbefore the prince changes his mind  mr sabin bowed low  tonight by all means he declared but my invitation remainsa challenge    chapter xxxi  the prince being host arranged the places at his suppertable mr sabin found himself therefore between lady carey and a young german attache whom they had met in the anteroom of the restaurant lucille had the prince and mr brott on either side of her  lady carey monopolised at first the greater part of the conversation mr sabin was unusually silent the german attache whose name was baron von opperman did not speak until the champagne was served when he threw a bombshell into the midst of the little party  i hear he said with a broad and seraphic smile that in this hotel there has today a murder been committed  baron von opperman was suddenly the cynosure of several pairs of eyes he was delighted with the success of his attempt towards the general entertainment  the evening papers he continued they have in them news of a sudden death but in the hotel here now they are speaking of somethingwhat you call moremysterious there has been ordered an examination postmortem  it is a case of poisoning then i presume the prince asked leaning forward  it is so supposed the attache answered it seems that the doctors could find no trace of disease nothing to have caused death they were not able to decide anything the man they said was in perfect healthbut dead  it must have been then the prince remarked a very wonderful poison  without doubt baron opperman answered  the prince sighed gently  there are many such he murmured indeed the science of toxicology was never so illunderstood as now i am assured that there are many poisons known only to a few chemists in the world a single grain of which is sufficient to destroy the strongest man and leave not the slightest trace behind if the poisoner be sufficiently accomplished he can pursue hiscalling without the faintest risk of detection  mr sabin sipped his wine thoughtfully  the prince is i believe right he remarked it is for that reason doubtless that i have heard of men whose lives have been threatened who have deposited in safe places a sealed statement of the danger in which they find themselves with an account of its source so that if they should come to an end in any way mysterious there may be evidence against their murderers  a very reasonable and judicious precaution the prince remarked with glittering eyes only if the poison was indeed of such a nature that it was not possible to trace it nothing worse than suspicion could ever be the lot of any one  mr sabin helped himself carefully to salad and resumed the discussion with his next course  perhaps not he admitted but you must remember that suspicion is of itself a grievous embarrassment no man likes to feel that he is being suspected of murder by the bye is it known whom the unfortunate person was  the servant of a french nobleman who is staying in the hotel mr brott remarked i heard as much as that  mr sabin smiled lady carey glanced at him meaningly  you have worried the prince quite sufficiently she whispered change the subject  mr sabin bowed  you are very considerateto the prince he said  it is perhaps for your sake she answered and as for the princewell you know or you should know for how much he counts with me  mr sabin glanced at her curiously she was a little flushed as though with some inward excitement her eyes were bright and soft despite a certain angularity of figure and her hollow cheeks she was certainly one of the most distinguishedlooking women in the room  you are so dense she whispered in his ear wilfully dense perhaps you will not understand that i wish to be your friend  he smiled with gentle deprecation  do you blame me he murmured if i seem incredulous for i am an old man and you are spoken of always as the friend of my enemy the friend of the prince  i wonder she said thoughtfully if this is really the secret of your mistrust do you indeed fear that i have no other interest in life save to serve saxe leinitzer  as to that he answered i cannot say yet i know that only a few months ago you were acting under orders from him it is you who brought lucille from america it was through you that the first blow was struck at my happiness  cannot i atone she murmured under her breath if i can i will and as for the present well i am outside his schemes now let us be friends you would find me a very valuable ally  let it be so he answered without emotion you shall help me if you will to regain lucille i promise you then that my gratitude shall not disappoint you  she bit her lip  and are you sure she whispered that lucille is anxious to be won back she loves intrigue excitement the sense of being concerned in important doings besidesyou must have heard what they say about herand brott look at her now she wears her grass widowhood lightly enough  mr sabin looked across the table lucille had indeed all the appearance of a woman thoroughly at peace with the world and herself brott was talking to her in smothered and eager undertones the prince was waiting for an opportunity to intervene mr sabin looked into brotts white strong face and was thoughtful  it is a great powerthe power of my sex lady carey continued with a faint subtle smile a word from lucille and the history book of the future must be differently written  she will not speak that word mr sabin said lady carey shrugged her shoulders the subtlety of her smile faded away her whole face expressed a contemptuous and selfassured cynicism  you know her very well she murmured yet she and i are no strangers she is one who loves to tasteno to drinkdeeply of all the experiences of life why should we blame her you and i have we not the same desire  mr sabin lit a cigarette  once perhaps he remarked you must not forget that i am no longer a young man  she leaned towards him  you will die young she murmured you are not of the breed of men who grow old  do you mean to turn my head he asked her with a humorous smile  it would be easier she answered than to touch your heart  then lucille looked across at themand mr sabin suddenly remembered that reginald brott knew them both only as strangers  muriel she said you are behaving disgracefully  i am doing my best lady carey answered to keep you in countenance  the eyes of the two women met for a moment and though the smiles lingered still upon their faces lady carey at any rate was not able to wholly conceal her hatred lucille shrugged her shoulders  i am doing my best she said to convert mr brott  to what lady carey asked  to a sane point of view concerning the holiness of the aristocracy lucille answered i am afraid though that i have made very little impression in his heart i believe mr brott would like to see us all working for our living schoolteachers and dressmakers and that sort of thing you know  mr brott protested  i am not even he declared moderately advanced in my views as regards matters of your sex to tell you the truth i do not like women to work at all outside their homes  lady carey laughed  my dear she said to lucille you and i may as well retire in despair cant you see the sort of woman mr brott admires she isnt like us a bit she is probably a healthy ruddycheeked young person who lives in the country gets up to breakfast to pour out the coffee for some sort of a male relative goes round the garden snipping off roses in big gloves and a huge basket interviews the cook orders the dinner makes fancy waistcoats for her husband and failing a sewing maid does the mending for the family you and i lucille are not like that  well you have mentioned nothing which i couldnt do if it seemed worth while lucille objected it sounds very primitive and delightful i am sure we are all too luxurious and too lazy i think we ought to turn over a new leaf  for you dear lucille lady carey said with suave and deadly satire what improvement is possible you have all that you could desire it is much less fortunate persons such as myself to whom utopia must seem such a delightful place  a frockcoated and altogether immaculate young man approached their table and accosted mr sabin  i beg your pardon sir he said but the manager would be much obliged if you would spare him a moment or two in his private room as soon as possible  mr sabin nodded  in a few minutes he answered  the little party broke up almost immediately coffee was ordered in the palm court where the band was playing mr sabin and the prince fell a little behind the others on the way out of the room  you heard my summons mr sabin asked  yes  i am going to be crossexamined as regards duson i am no longer a member of the order what is to prevent my setting them upon the right track  the fact the prince said coolly that you are hoping one day to recover lucille  i doubt mr sabin said whether you are strong enough to keep her from me  the prince smiled all his white teeth were showing  come he said you know better thanmuch better than that lucille must wait her release you know that  i will buy it mr sabin said with a lie to the manager here or i will tell the truth and still take her from you  the prince stood upon the topmost step of the balcony below was the palm court with many little groups of people dotted about  my dear friend he said duson died absolutely of his own free will you know that quite well we should have preferred that the matter had been otherwise arranged but as it is we are safe absolutely safe  dusons letter mr sabin remarked  you will not show it the prince answered you cannot you have kept it too long and after all you cannot escape from the main fact duson committed suicide  he was incited to murder his letter proves it  the prince shrugged his shoulders  by whom ah how your story would excite ridicule i seem to hear the laughter now no my dear souspennier you would bargain for me with lucille look below are we likely to part with her just yet  in a corner behind a gigantic palm lucille and brott were talking together lady carey had drawn opperman a little distance away brott was talking eagerly his cheeks flushed his manner earnest mr sabin turned upon his heel and walked away    chapter xxxii  mr sabin although he had registered at the hotel under his accustomed pseudonym had taken no pains to conceal his identity and was well known to the people in authority about the place he was received with all the respect due to his rank  your grace will i trust accept my most sincere apologies for disturbing you mr hertz the manager said rising and bowing at his entrance we have here however an emissary connected with the police come to inquire into the sad incident of this afternoon he expressed a wish to ask your grace a question or two with a view to rendering your graces attendance at the inquest unnecessary  mr sabin nodded  i am perfectly willing he said to answer any questions you may choose to put to me  a plain hardfeatured little man in a long black overcoat and holding a bowler hat in his hand bowed respectfully to mr sabin  i am much obliged to you sir he said my name is john passmore we do not of course appear in this matter unless the postmortem should indicate anything unusual in the circumstances of dusons death but it is always well to be prepared and i ventured to ask mr hertz here to procure for me your opinion as regards the death of your servant  you have asked me mr sabin said gravely a very difficult question  the eyes of the little detective flashed keenly  you do not believe then sir that he died a natural death  i do not mr sabin answered  mr hertz was startled the detective controlled his features admirably  may i ask your reasons sir  mr sabin lightly shrugged his shoulders  i have never known the man to have a days illness in his life he said further since his arrival in england he has been acting in a strange and furtive manner and i gathered that he had some cause for fear which he was indisposed to talk about  this the detective said is very interesting  doubtless mr sabin answered but before i say anything more i must clearly understand my position i am giving you personally a few friendly hints in the interests of justice perhaps but still quite informally i am not in possession of any definite facts concerning duson and what i say to you here i am not prepared to say at the inquest before which i presume i may have to appear as a witness there i shall do nothing more save identify duson and state the circumstances under which i found him  i understand that perfectly sir the man answered the less said at the inquest the better in the interests of justice  mr sabin nodded  i am glad he said that you appreciate that i do not mind going so far then as to tell you that i believe duson died of poison  can you give me any idea the detective asked as to the source  none mr sabin answered that you must discover for yourselves duson was a man of silent and secretive habits and it has occurred to me more than once that he might possibly be a member of one of those foreign societies who have their headquarters in soho and concerning which you probably know more than i do  the detective smiled it was a very slight flicker of the lips but it attracted mr sabins keen attention  your suggestions the detective said are making this case a very interesting one i have always understood however that reprisals of this extreme nature are seldom resorted to in this country besides the mans position seems scarcely to indicate sufficient importanceperhaps  well mr sabin interjected  i notice that duson was found in your sittingroom it occurs to me as a possibility that he may have met with a fate intended for some one elsefor yourself for instance sir  but i mr sabin said smoothly am a member of no secret society nor am i conscious of having enemies sufficiently venomous to desire my life  the detective sat for a moment with immovable face  we all of us know our friends sir he said there are few of us properly acquainted with our enemies  mr sabin lit a cigarette his fingers were quite steady but this man was making him think  you do not seriously believe he asked that duson met with a death which was intended for me  i am afraid the detective said thoughtfully that i know no more about it than you do  i see mr sabin said that i am no stranger to you  you are very far from being that sir the man answered a few years ago i was working for the governmentand you were not often out of my sight  mr sabin smiled  it was perhaps judicious he remarked though i am afraid it proved of very little profit to you and what about the present time  i see no harm in telling you sir that a general watch is kept upon your movements duson was useful to us but now duson is dead  it is a fact mr sabin said impressively that duson was a genius my admiration for him continually increases  duson made harmless reports to us as we desired them the detective said i have an idea however that if this course had at any time been inimical to your interests that duson would have deceived us  i am convinced of it mr sabin declared  and duson is dead  mr sabin nodded gravely  the little hardvisaged man looked steadily for a moment upon the carpet  duson died virtually whilst accepting pay from if not actually in the employ of our secret service department you will understand therefore that we knowing of this complication in his life naturally incline towards the theory of murder shall i be taking a liberty sir if i give you an unprofessional word of warning  mr sabin raised his eyebrows  by no means he answered but surely you cannot  the man smiled  no sir he said drily i do not for one moment suspect you the man was our spy upon your movements but i am perfectly aware that there has been nothing worth reporting and i also know that you would never run such a risk for the removal of so insignificant a person no my warning comes to you from a different point of view it is if you will pardon my saying so none the less personal but wholly friendly the case of duson will be sifted to the dregs but unless i am greatly mistaken and i do not see room for the possibility of a mistake i know the truth already  you will share your knowledge mr sabin asked quietly  the detective shook his head  you shall know he said before the last moment but i want to warn you that when you do know itit will be a shock to you  mr sabin stood perfectly still for several moments this little man believed what he was saying he was certainly deceived yet none the less mr sabin was thoughtful  you do not feel inclined he said slowly to give me your entire confidence  not at present sir the man answered you would certainly intervene and my case would be spoilt  mr sabin glanced at the clock  if you care to call on me tomorrow he said i could perhaps show you something which might change your opinion  the detective bowed  i am always open sir he said to conviction i will come about twelve oclock  mr sabin went back to the palm lounge lucille and reginald brott were sitting together at a small table talking earnestly to one another the prince and lady carey had joined another party who were all talking together near the entrance the latter directly she saw them coming detached herself from them and came to him  your coffee is almost cold she said but the prince has found some brandy of wonderful age somewhere in the last century i believe  mr sabin glanced towards lucille she appeared engrossed in her conversation and had not noticed his approach lady carey shrugged  you have only a few minutes she said before that dreadful person comes and frowns us all out i have kept you a chair  mr sabin sat down lady carey interposed herself between him and the small table at which lucille was sitting  have they discovered anything she asked  nothing mr sabin answered  she played with her fan for a moment then she looked him steadily in the face  my friend  he glanced towards her  lady carey  why are you so obstinate she exclaimed in a low passionate whisper i want to be your friend and i could be very useful to you yet you keep me always at arms length you are making a mistake indeed you are i suppose you do not trust me yet reflect have i ever told you anything that was not true have i ever tried to deceive you i dont pretend to be a paragon of the virtues i live my life to please myself i admit it why not it is simply applying the same sort of philosophy to my life as you have applied to yours my enemies can find plenty to say about mebut never that i have been false to a friend why do you keep me always at arms length as though i were one of those who wished you evil  lady carey mr sabin said i will not affect to misunderstand you and i am flattered that you should consider my good will of any importance but you are the friend of the prince of saxe leinitzer you are one of those even now who are working actively against me i am not blaming you but we are on opposite sides  lady carey looked for a moment across at the prince and her eyes were full of venom  if you knew she murmured how i loathe that man friends that is all long since past nothing would give me so much pleasure as never to see his face again  nevertheless mr sabin reminded her whatever your private feelings may be he has claims upon you which you cannot resist  there is one thing in the world she said in a low tone for which i would risk even the abnegation of those claims  you would perjure your honour  yesif it came to that  mr sabin moved uneasily in his chair the woman was in earnest she offered him an invaluable alliance she could show him the way to hold his own against even the inimical combination by which he was surrounded if only he could compromise but her eyes were seeking his eagerly even fiercely  you doubt me still she whispered and i thought that you had genius listen i will prove myself the prince has one of his foolish passions for lucille you know that so far she has shown herself able to resist his fascinations he is trying other means lucille is in danger dusonbut after all i was never really in danger except the time when i carried the despatches for the colonel and rode straight into a boer ambush  mr sabin saw nothing but he did not move a muscle of his face a moment later they heard the princes voice from behind them  i am very sorry he said to interrupt these interesting reminiscences but you see that every one is going lucille is already in the cloakroom  lady carey rose at once but the glance she threw at the prince was a singularly malicious one they walked down the carpeted way together and lady carey left them without a word in the vestibule mr sabin and reginald brott came face to face    chapter xxxiii  the greeting between the two men was cold and the prince almost immediately stepped between them nevertheless brott seemed to have a fancy to talk with mr sabin  i was at camperdown house yesterday he remarked her ladyship was regretting that she saw you so seldom  i have been a little remiss mr sabin answered i hope to lunch there tomorrow  you have seen the evening paper brott the prince asked  i saw the early editions brott answered is there anything fresh  the prince dropped his voice a little he drew brott on one side  the westminster declared that you had left for windsor by an early train this afternoon and gives a list of your cabinet the pall mall on the other hand declares that letheringham will assuredly be sent for tomorrow  brott shrugged his shoulders  there are bound to be a crop of such reports at a time like this he remarked  the prince dropped his voice almost to a whisper  brott he said there is something which i have had it in my mind to say to you for the last few days i am not perhaps a great politician but like many outsiders i see perhaps a good deal of the game i know fairly well what the feeling is in vienna and berlin i can give you a word of advice  you are very kind prince brott remarked looking uneasily over his shoulder but  it is concerning brand there is no man more despised and disliked abroad not only because he is a jew and illbred but because of his known sympathy with some of these anarchists who are perfect firebrands in europe  i am exceedingly obliged to you brott answered hurriedly i am afraid however that you anticipate matters a good deal i have not yet been asked to form a cabinet it is doubtful whether i ever shall and beyond that it is also doubtful whether even if i am asked i shall accept  i must confess the prince said that you puzzle me every one says that the premiership of the country is within your reach it is surely the mecca of all politicians  there are complications brott muttered you  he stopped short and moved towards the door lucille unusually pale and grave had just issued from the ladies anteroom and joined lady carey who was talking to mr sabin she touched the latter lightly on the arm  help us to escape she said quickly i am weary of my task can we get away without their seeing us  mr sabin offered his arm they passed along the broad way and as they were almost the last to leave the place their carriage was easily found the prince and mr brott appeared only in time to see mr sabin turning away hat in hand from the curbstone brotts face darkened  prince he said who is that man  the prince shrugged his shoulders  a man he said who has more than once nearly ruined your country his life has been a splendid failure he would have given india to the russians but they mistrusted him and trifled away their chance once since then he nearly sold this country to germany it was a trifle only which intervened he has been all his life devoted to one cause  and that brott asked  the restoration of the monarchy to france he as you of course know is the duc de souspennier the sole living member in the direct line of one of the most ancient and historical houses in england my friend he added turning to mr sabin you have stolen a march upon us we had not even an opportunity of making our adieux to the ladies  i imagine mr sabin answered that the cause of quarrel may rest with them you were nowhere in sight when they came out  these fascinating politics the prince remarked we all want to talk politics to mr brott just now  i will wish you goodnight gentlemen mr sabin said and passed into the hotel  the prince touched brott on the arm  will you come round to the club and take a hand at bridge he said  brott laughed shortly  i imagine he said that i should be an embarrassing guest to you just now at say the mallborough or even at the st james i believe the aristocracy are looking forward to the possibility of my coming into power with something like terror  i am not thoroughly versed in the politics of this country the prince said but i have always understood that your views were very much advanced dorset solemnly believes that you are pledged to exterminate the large landed proprietors and i do not think he would be surprised to hear that you had a guillotine up your sleeve  the two men were strolling along pall mall the prince had lit a large cigar and was apparently on the best of terms with himself and the world in general brott on the contrary was most unlike himself preoccupied and apparently ill at ease  the duke and his class are of course my natural opponents brott said shortly by the bye prince he added suddenly turning towards him and with a complete change of tone it is within your power to do me a favour  you have only to command the prince assured him goodnaturedly  my rooms are close here brott continued will you accompany me there and grant me the favour of a few minutes conversation  assuredly the prince answered flicking the end off his cigar it will be a pleasure  they walked on towards their destination in silence brotts secretary was in the library with a huge pile of letters and telegrams before him he welcomed brott with relief  we have been sending all over london for you sir he said  brott nodded  i am better out of the way for the present he answered deny me to everybody for an hour especially letheringham there is nothing here i suppose which cannot wait so long as that  the secretary looked a little doubtful  i think not sir he decided  very good go and get something to eat you look fagged and tell hyson to bring up some liqueurs will you i shall be engaged for a short time  the secretary withdrew a servant appeared with a little tray of liqueurs and in obedience to an impatient gesture from his master left them upon the table brott closed the door firmly  prince he said resuming his seat i wished to speak with you concerning the countess  saxe leinitzer nodded  all right he said i am listening  i understand brott continued that you are one of her oldest friends and also one of the trustees of her estates i presume that you stand to her therefore to some extent in the position of an adviser  it is perfectly true the prince admitted  i too am an old friend as she has doubtless told you brott said all my life she has been the one woman whom i have desired to call my wife that desire has never been so strong as at the present moment  the prince removed his cigar from his mouth and looked grave  but my dear brott he said have you considered the enormous gulf between yourviews the countess owns great hereditary estates she comes from a family which is almost royal she herself is an aristocrat to the backbone it is a class against which you have declared war how can you possibly come together on common ground  brott was silent for a moment looking at him steadily the prince was surprised at the change in the mans appearance his cheeks seemed blanched and his skin drawn he had lost flesh his eyes were hollow and he frequently betrayed in small mannerisms a nervousness wholly new and unfamiliar to him  you speak as a man of sense prince he said after a while you are absolutely correct this matter has caused me a great deal of anxious thought to falter at this moment is to lose politically all that i have worked for all my life it is to lose the confidence of the people who have trusted me it is a betrayal the thought of which is a constant shame to me but on the other hand lucille is the dearest thing to me in life  the princes expression was wholly sympathetic the derision which lurked behind he kept wholly concealed a strong man so abjectly in the toils and he to be chosen for his confidant it was melodrama with a dash of humour  if i am to help you the prince said i must know everything have you made any proposals to lucille in plain words how much of your political future are you disposed to sacrifice  all brott said hoarsely all for a certainty of her not one jot without  and she  brott sprang to his feet white and nervous  it is where i am at fault he exclaimed it is why i have asked for your advice your help perhaps i do not find it easy to understand lucille perhaps it is because i am not well versed in the ways of her sex i find her elusive she will give me no promise before i went to glasgow i talked with her if she would have married me then my political career was overthrown on one side like an old garment but she would give me no promise in everything save the spoken words i crave she has promised me her love again there comes a climax in a few hours i must make my final choice i must decline to join letheringham in which case the king must send for me or accept office with him and throw away the one great chance of this generation letheringhams cabinet of course would be a moderate liberal one a paragon of milk and water in effectiveness if i go in alone we make history the moment of issue has come and prince although i have pleaded with all the force and all the earnestness i know lucille remains elusive if i choose for her sideshe promises mereward but it is vague to me i dont i cant understand i want her for my wife i want her for the rest of my lifenothing else tell me is there any barrier to this there are no complications in her life which i do not know of i want your assurance i want her promise you understand me  yes i understand you the prince said gravely i understand more than you do i understand lucilles position  brott leaned forward with bright eyes  ah  lucille the countess of radantz is at the present moment a married woman  brott was speechless his face was like a carved stone image from which the life had wholly gone  her husbandin name only let me tell you is the mr sabin with whom we had supper this evening  great god  their marriage had strange features in it which are not my concern or even yours the prince said deliberately the truth is that they have not lived together for years they never will again for their divorce proceedings would long ago have been concluded but for the complications arising from the difference between the hungarian and the american laws here without doubt is the reason why the countess has hesitated to pledge her word directly  it is wonderful brott said slowly but it explains everything  there was a loud knock at the door the secretary appeared upon the threshold behind him was a tall slim young man in traveling costume  the kings messenger brott exclaimed rising to his feet    chapter xxxiv  the prince presented himself with a low bow lucille had a copy of the morning paper in her hand  i congratulate you countess he said you progress admirably it is a great step gained  lucille who was looking pale and nervous regarded him with anxiety  a step but it is everything if these rumours are true he refuses the attempt to form a cabinet he takes a subordinate position under letheringham every paper this morning says that if this is so his political career is over it is true is it not  it is a great gain the prince said slowly  but it is everything lucille declared with a rising note of passion in her tone it was my task it is accomplished i demand my release  the prince was silent for a moment  you are in a great hurry lucille he said  what if i am she replied fiercely do you suppose that this life of lies and deceit is pleasant to me do you suppose that it is a pleasant task to lure a brave man on to his ruin  the prince raised his eyebrows  come he said you can have no sympathy with reginald brott the sworn enemy of our class a socialist a demagogue who would parcel out our lands in allotments a man who has pledged himself to nothing more nor less than a revolution  the mans views are hateful enough she answered but he is in earnest and however misguided he may be there is something noble in his unselfishness in his steady fixedness of purpose  the princes face indicated his contempt  such men he declared are only fit to be crushed like vermin under foot in any other country save england we should have dealt with him differently  this is all beside the question she declared my task was to prevent his becoming prime minister and i have succeeded  the prince gave vent to a little gesture of dissent your task he said went a little farther than that we require his political ruin  she pointed to the pile of newspapers upon the table  read what they say she exclaimed there is not one who does not use that precise term he has missed his opportunity the people will never trust him again  that at any rate is not certain the prince said you must remember that before long he will realise that he has been your tool what then he will become more rabid than ever more also to be feared no lucille your task is not yet over he must be involved in an open and public scandal and with you  she was white almost to the lips with passion  you expect a great deal she exclaimed you expect me to ruin my life then to give my honour as well as these weary months this constant humiliation  you are pleased to be melodramatic he said coldly it is quite possible to involve him without actually going to extremes  and what of my husband she asked  the prince laughed unpleasantly  if you have not taught him complaisance he said it is possible of course that mr sabin might be unkind but what of it you are your own mistress you are a woman of the world without him there is an infinitely greater future before you than as his wife you could ever enjoy  you are pleased she said to be enigmatic  the prince looked hard at her her face was white and set he sighed  lucille he said i have been very patient for many years yet you know very well my secret and in your heart you know very well that i am one of those who generally win the thing upon which they have set their hearts i have always loved you lucille but never more than now fidelity is admirable but surely you have done your duty he is an old man and a man who has failed in the great things of life i on the other hand can offer you a great future saxe leinitzer as you know is a kingdom of its own and lucille i stand well with the emperor the socialist party in berlin are strong and increasing he needs us who can say what honours may not be in store for us for i too am of the royal house lucille i am his kinsman he never forgets that come throw aside this restlessness i will tell you how to deal with brott and the publicity after all will be nothing we will go abroad directly afterwards  have you finished she asked  you will be reasonable he begged  reasonable she turned upon him with flashing eyes i wonder how you ever dared to imagine that i could tolerate you for one moment as a lover or a husband wipe it out of your mind once and for all you are repellent to me positively the only wish i have in connection with you is never to see your face again as for my duty i have done it my conscience is clear i shall leave this house today  i hope the prince said softly that you will do nothing rash  in an hour she said i shall be at the carlton with my husband i will trust to him to protect me from you  the prince shook his head  you talk rashly he said you do not think you are forbidden to leave this house you are forbidden to join your husband  she laughed scornfully but underneath was a tremor of uneasiness  you summoned me from america she said and i came i was forced to leave my husband without even a word of farewell i did it you set me a taski have accomplished it i claim that i have kept my bond that i have worked out my own freedom if you require more of me i say that you are overstepping your authority and i refuse set the black cross against my name if you will i will take the risk  the prince came a little nearer to her she held her own bravely enough but there was a look in his face which terrified her  lucille he said you force me to disclose something which i have kept so far to myself i wished to spare you anxiety but you must understand that your safety depends upon your remaining in this house and in keeping apart from all association withyour husband  you will find it difficult she said to convince me of that  on the contrary he said i shall find it easytoo easy believe me you will remember my finding you at the wineshop of emil sachs  yes  you refused to tell me the object of your visit it was foolish for of course i was informed you procured from emil a small quantity of the powder prepared according to the recipe of herr estentrauzen and for which we paid him ten thousand marks it is the most silent the most secret the most swift poison yet discovered  i got it for myself she said coldly there have been times when i have felt that the possession of something of that sort was an absolute necessity  i do not question you as to the reason for your getting it he answered very shortly afterwards you left your carriage in pall mall and without even asking for your husband you called at his hotelyou stole up into his room  i took some roses there and left them she said what of that  only that you were the last person seen to enter mr sabins rooms before duson was found there dead and duson died from a dose of that same poison a packet of which you procured secretly from emil sachs an empty wineglass was by his sideit was one generally used by mr sabin i know that the english police who are not so foolish as people would have one believe are searching now for the woman who was seen to enter the sittingroom shortly before mr sabin returned and found duson there dead  she laughed scornfully  it is ingenious she admitted and perhaps a little unfortunate for me but the inference is ridiculous what interest had i in the mans death  none of course the prince said but lucille in all cases of poisoning it is the wife of whom one first thinks  the wife i did not even know that the creature had a wife  of course not but duson drank from mr sabins glass and you are mr sabins wife you are living apart from him he is old and you are young and for the other manthere is reginald brott your names have been coupled together of course see what an excellent case stands there you procure the poisonsecretly you make your way to your husbands roomsecretly the fatal dose is taken from your husbands wineglass you leave no note no message the poison of which the man died is exactly the same as you procured from sachs lucille after all do you wonder that the police are looking for a woman in black with an ermine toque what a mercy you wore a thick veil  she sat down suddenly  this is hideous she said  think it over he said step by step it is wonderful how all the incidents dovetail into one another  too wonderful she cried it sounds like some vile plot to incriminate me how much had you to do with this prince  dont be a fool he answered roughly cant you see for yourself that your arrest would be the most terrible thing that could happen for us even sachs might break down in crossexamination and youwell you are a woman and you want to live we should all be in the most deadly peril lucille i would have spared you this anxiety if i could but your defiance made it necessary there was no other way of getting you away from england tonight except by telling you the truth  away from england tonight she repeated vaguely but i will not go it is impossible  it is imperative the prince declared with a sharp ring of authority in his tone it is your own folly for which you have to pay you went secretly to emil sachs you paid surreptitious visits to your husband which were simply madness you have involved us all in danger for our own sakes we must see that you are removed  it is the very thing to excite suspicionflight abroad she objected  your flight he said coolly will be looked upon from a different point of view for reginald brott must follow you it will be an elopement not a flight from justice  and in case i should decline lucille asked quietly  the prince shrugged his shoulders  well we have done the best we can for ourselves he said come i will be frank with you there are great interests involved here and before all things i have had to consider the welfare of our friends that is my duty emil sachs by this time is beyond risk of detection he has left behind a letter in which he confesses that he has for some time supplemented the profits of his wineshop by selling secretly certain deadly poisons of his own concoctions alarmed at reading of the death of duson immediately after he had sold a poison which the symptoms denoted he had fled the country that letter is in the hands of the woman who remains in the wineshop and will only be used in case of necessity by other means we have dissociated ourselves from duson and all connection with him i think i could go so far as to say that it would be impossible to implicate us our sole anxiety now therefore is to save you  lucille rose to her feet  i shall go at once to my husband she said i shall tell him everything i shall act on his advice  the prince stood over by the door and she heard the key turn  you will do nothing of the sort he said quietly you are in my power at last lucille you will do my bidding or  or what  i shall myself send for the police and give you into custody    chapter xxxv  the prince crossed the hall and entered the morningroom felix was there and raoul de brouillac the duchess sat at her writingtable scribbling a note lady carey in a wonderful white serge costume and a huge bunch of neapolitan violets at her bosom was lounging in an easychair swinging her foot backwards and forwards the duke in a very old tweed coat but immaculate as to linen and the details of his toilet stood a little apart with a frown upon his forehead and exactly that absorbed air which in the house of lords usually indicated his intention to make a speech the entrance of the prince who carefully closed the door behind him was an event for which evidently they were all waiting  my good people he said blandly i wish you all a very goodmorning  there was a little murmur of greetings and before they had all subsided the duke spoke  saxe leinitzer he said i have a few questions to ask you  the prince looked across the room at him  by all means duke he said but is the present an opportune time  opportune or no it is the time which i have selected the duke answered stiffly i do not altogether understand what is going on in this house i am beginning to wonder whether i have been misled  the prince as he twirled his fair moustache glanced carelessly enough across at the duchess she was looking the other way  i became aergeneral member of this society the duke continued sympathising heartily with its objects as explained to me by you prince and believing although to confess it is somewhat of a humiliation that a certain amount ofercombination amongst the aristocracy has become necessary to resist the terrible increase of socialism which we must all so much deplore  you are not making a speech dear the duchess remarked looking coldly across the room at him we are all anxious to hear what the prince has to say to us  your anxiety the duke continued and the anxiety of our friends must be restrained for a few minutes for there are certain things which i am determined to say and to say them now i must confess that it was at first a painful shock to me to realise that the time had come when it was necessary for us to take any heed of the uneducated rabble who seem born into the world discontented with their station in life and instead of making honest attempts to improve it waste their time railing against us who are more fortunately placed and in endeavours to mislead in every possible way the electorate of the country  the prince sighed softly and lit a cigarette lady carey and felix were already smoking  however the duke continued i was convinced i have always believed in the principle of watching closely the various signs of the times and i may say that i came to the conclusion that a combination of the thinking members of the aristocratic party throughout the world was an excellent idea i therefore became what is i believe called a general member of the order of which i believe you prince are the actual head  my dear james the duchess murmured the prince has something to say to us  the prince her husband answered coldly can keep back his information for a few minutes i am determined to place my position clearly before all of you who are present here now it is only since i have joined this society that i have been made aware that in addition to the general members of which body i believe that the duchess and i are the sole representatives here there are special members and members of the inner circle and i understand that in connection with these there is a great machinery of intrigue going on all the time with branches all over the world spies everywhere with unlimited funds and with huge opportunities of good or evil in effect i have become an outside member of what is nothing more nor less than a very powerful and it seems to me daring secret society  so far as you are concerned duke the prince said your responsibility ceases with ordinary membership you can take no count of anything beyond the time may come when the inner circle may be opened to you  the duke coughed  you misapprehend me he said i can assure you i am not anxious for promotion on the contrary i stand before you an aggrieved person i have come to the conclusion that my house and the shelter of my wifes name have been used for a plot the main points of which have been kept wholly secret from me  the prince flicked his cigarette ash into the grate  my dear dorset he said gently if you will allow me to explain  i thank you saxe leinitzer the duke said coldly but it is beginning to occur to me that i have had enough of your explanations it seemed natural enough to me and i must say well conceived that some attempt should be made to modify the views of if not wholly convert reginald brott by means of the influence of a very charming woman it was my duty as a member of the order to assist in this and the shelter of my house and name were freely accorded to the countess but it is news to me to find that she was brought here practically by force that because she was an inner member and therefore bound to implicit obedience that she was dragged away from her husband kept apart from him against her will forced into endeavours to make a fool of brott even at the cost of her good name and now worst of all i am told that a very deeply laid plot on the part of some of you will compel her to leave england almost at once and that her safety depends upon her inducing reginald brott to accompany her  she has appealed to you the prince muttered  she has done nothing so sensible the duke answered drily the facts which i have just stated are known to every one in this room i perhaps know less than any one but i know enough for this i request saxe leinitzer that you withdraw the name of myself and my wife from your list of members and that you understand clearly that my house is to be no more used for meetings of the society formal or informal and further though i regret the apparent inhospitality of my action my finger is now as you see upon the bell and i venture to wish you all a very goodmorning groves he added to the servant who answered the door the prince of saxe leinitzers carriage is urgently required  the prince and lady carey descended the broad steps side by side she was laughing softly but immoderately the prince was pale with fury  pompous old ass he muttered savagely he may have a worse scandal in his house now than he dreams of  she wiped her eyes  have i not always told you she said that intrigue in this country was a sheer impossibility you may lay your plans ever so carefully but you cannot foresee such a contretemps as this  idiot the prince cried oh the dolt why even his wife was amazed  he may be all those pleasant things lady carey said but he is a gentleman  he stopped short the footman was standing by the side of lady careys victoria with a rug on his arm  lucille he said thoughtfully is locked in the morningroom she is prostrate with fear if the duke sees her everything is over upon my word i have a good mind to throw this all up and cross to paris tonight let england breed her own revolutions what do you say muriel will you come with me  she laughed scornfully  id as soon go with my coachman she said  his eyebrows narrowed a dull purple flush crept to his forehead  your wit he said is a little coarse listen you wish our first plan to go through  of course  then you must get lucille out of that house if she is left there she is absolutely lost to us apart from that she is herself not safe our plan worked out too well she is really in danger from this duson affair  the laughter died away from lady careys face she hesitated with her foot upon the step of her carriage  you can go back easily enough the prince said you are the dukes cousin and you were not included in his tirade lucille is in the morningroom and here is the key i brought it away with me you must tell her that all our plans are broken that we have certain knowledge that the police are on the track of this duson affair get her to your house in pont street and i will be round this afternoon or better still take her to mine  lady carey stepped back on to the pavement she was still however hesitating  leave her with the duke and duchess the prince said and she will dine with her husband tonight  lady carey took the key from his hand  i will try she said how shall you know whether i succeed  i will wait in the gardens he answered i shall be out of sight but i shall be able to see you come out if you are alone i shall come to you if she is with you i shall be at your house in an hour and i promise you that she shall leave england tonight with me  poor brott she murmured ironically  the prince smiled  he will follow her every one will believe that they left london together that is all that is required  lady carey reentered the house the prince made his way into the gardens ten minutes passeda quarter of an hour then lady carey with lucille reappeared and stepping quickly into the victoria were driven away the prince drew a little sigh of relief he looked at his watch called a hansom and drove to his club for lunch  another man who had also been watching dorset house from the gardens for several hours also noted lucilles advent with relief he followed the prince out and entered another hansom  follow that victoria which has just driven off he ordered dont lose sight of it double fare  the trapdoor fell and the man whipped up his horse    chapter xxxvi  mr sabin received an early visitor whilst still lingering over a slight but elegant breakfast passmore seated himself in an easychair and accepted the cigar which his host himself selected for him  i am glad to see you mr sabin said this affair of dusons remains a complete mystery to me i am looking to you to help me solve it  the little man with the imperturbable face removed his cigar from his mouth and contemplated it steadfastly  it is mysterious he said there are circumstances in connection with it which even now puzzle me very much very much indeed there are circumstances in connection with it also which i fear may be a shock to you sir  my life mr sabin said with a faint smile has been made up of shocks a few more or less may not hurt me  duson the detective said was at heart a faithful servant  i believe it mr sabin said  he was much attached to you  i believe it  it is possible that unwittingly he died for you  mr sabin was silent it was his way of avoiding a confession of surprise and he was surprised you believe then he said after a moments pause that the poison was intended for me  certainly i do the detective answered duson was after all a valet a person of little importance there is no one to whom his removal could have been of sufficient importance to justify such extreme measures with you it is different  mr sabin knocked the ash from his cigarette  why not be frank with me mr passmore he said there is no need to shelter yourself under professional reticence your connection with scotland yard ended i believe some time ago you are free to speak or to keep silence do one or the other tell me what you think and i will tell you what i know that surely will be a fair exchange you shall have my facts for your surmises  passmores thin lips curled into a smile you know that i have left scotland yard then sir  quite well you are employed by them often i believe but you are not on the staff not since the affair of nerman and the code book  if passmore had been capable of reverence his eyes looked it at that moment  you knew this last night sir  certainly  five years ago sir he said i told my chief that in you the detective police of the world had lost one who must have been their king more and more you convince me of it i cannot believe that you are ignorant of the salient points concerning dusons death  treat me as being so at any rate mr sabin said  i am pardoned passmore said for speaking plainly of family mattersmy concern in which is of course purely professional  mr sabin looked up for a moment but he signified his assent  you left america passmore said in search of your wife formerly countess of radantz who had left you unexpectedly  it is true mr sabin answered  madame la duchesse on reaching london became the guest of the duchess of dorset where she has been staying since whilst there she has received many visits from mr reginald brott  mr sabins face was as the face of a sphinx he made no sign  you do not waste your time sir over the society papers yet you have probably heard that madame la duchesse and mr reginald brott have been written about and spoken about as intimate friends they have been seen together everywhere gossip has been busy with their names mr brott has followed the countess into circles which before her coming he zealously eschewed the countess is everywhere regarded as a widow and a marriage has been confidently spoken of  mr sabin bowed his head slightly but of expression there was in his face no sign  these things passmore continued are common knowledge i have spoken up to now of nothing which is not known to the world i proceed differently  good mr sabin said  there is passmore continued in the foreign district of london a man named emil sachs who keeps a curious sort of a wineshop and supplements his earnings by disposing at a high figure of certain rare and deadly poisons a few days ago the countess visited him and secured a small packet of the most deadly drug the man possesses  mr sabin sat quite still he was unmoved  the countess passmore continued shortly afterwards visited these rooms an hour after her departure duson was dead he died from drinking out of your liqueur glass into which a few specks of that powder invisible almost to the naked eye had been dropped at dorset house reginald brott was waiting for her he left shortly afterwards in a state of agitation  and from these things mr sabin said you draw i presume the natural inference that madame la duchesse desiring to marry her old admirer reginald brott first left me in america and then since i followed her here attempted to poison me  there is passmore said a good deal of evidence to that effect  here mr sabin said handing him dusons letter is some evidence to the contrary  passmore read the letter carefully  you believe this he asked to be genuine  mr sabin smiled  i am sure of it he answered  you recognise the handwriting  certainly  and this came into your possessionhow  i found it on the table by dusons side  you intend to produce it at the inquest  i think not mr sabin answered  there was a short silence passmore was revolving a certain matter in his mindthinking hard mr sabin was apparently trying to make rings of the blue smoke from his cigarette  has it occurred to you passmore asked to wonder for what reason your wife visited these rooms on the morning of dusons death  mr sabin shook his head  i cannot say that it has  she knew that you were not here passmore continued she left no message she came closely veiled and departed unrecognised mr sabin nodded  there were reasons he said for that but when you say that she left no message you are mistaken  passmore nodded  go on he said  mr sabin nodded towards a great vase of la france roses upon a side table  i found these here on my return he said and attached to them the card which i believe is still there go and look at it  passmore rose and bent over the fragrant blossoms the card still remained and on the back of it in a delicate feminine handwriting                              for my husband                             with love from                                lucille   mr passmore shrugged his shoulders he had not the vice of obstinacy and he knew when to abandon a theory  i am corrected he said in any case a mystery remains as well worth solving who are these people at whose instigation duson was to have murdered youthese people whom duson feared so much that suicide was his only alternative to obeying their behests  mr sabin smiled faintly  ah my dear passmore he said you must not ask me that question i can only answer you in this way if you wish to make the biggest sensation which has ever been created in the criminal world to render yourself immortal and your fame imperishablefind out i may not help you i doubt whether you will find any to help you but if you want excitement the excitement of a dangerous chase after a tremendous quarry take your life in your hands go in and win  passmores withered little face lit up with a gleam of rare excitement  these are your enemies sir he said they have attempted your life once they may do it again assume the offensive yourself give me a hint  mr sabin shook his head  that i cannot do he said i have saved you from wasting your time on a false scent i have given you something definite to work upon further than that i can do nothing  passmore looked his disappointment but he knew mr sabin better than to argue the matter  you will not even produce that letter at the inquest he asked  not even that mr sabin answered  passmore rose to his feet  you must remember he said that supposing any one else stumbles upon the same trail as i have been pursuing and suspicion is afterwards directed towards madame your not producing that letter at the inquest will make it useless as evidence in her favour  i have considered all these things mr sabin said i shall deposit the letter in a safe place but its use will never be necessary you are the only man who might have forced me to produce it and you know the truth  passmore rose reluctantly  i want you mr sabin said to leave me not only your address but the means of finding you at any moment during the next fourandtwenty hours i may have some important work for you  the man smiled as he tore leaf from his pocketbook and a made a few notes  i shall be glad to take any commission from you sir he said to tell you the truth i scarcely thought that you would be content to sit down and wait  mr sabin smiled  i think he said that very shortly i can find you plenty to do    chapter xxxvii  mr sabin a few minutes afterwards ordered his carriage and was driven to dorset house he asked for lucille but was shown at once into the library where the duke was awaiting him then mr sabin knew that something had happened  the duke extended his hand solemnly  my dear souspennier he said i am glad to see you i was in fact on the point of despatching a messenger to your hotel  i am glad mr sabin remarked that my visit is opportune to tell you the truth duke i am anxious to see my wife  the duke coughed  i trust he said that you will not for a moment consider me guilty of any discourtesy to the countess for whom i have a great respect and liking but it has come to my knowledge that the shelter of my roof and name were being given to proceedings of which i heartily disapproved i therefore only a few hours ago formally broke off all connection with saxe leinitzer and his friends and to put the matter plainly i expelled them from the house  i congratulate you heartily duke upon a most sensible proceeding mr sabin said but in the meantime where is my wife  your wife was not present at the time the duke answered and i had not the slightest intention of including her in the remarks i made whether she understood this or not i cannot say but i have since been given to understand that she left with them  how long ago mr sabin asked  several hours i fear the duke answered i should like souspennier to express to you my regrets that i was ever induced to become connected in any way with proceedings which must have caused you a great deal of pain i beg you to accept my apologies  i do not blame you duke mr sabin said my one desire now is to wrest my wife away from this gang can you tell me whether she left alone or with any of them  i will endeavour to ascertain the duke said ringing the bell  but before the dukes somewhat longwinded series of questions had gone very far mr sabin grasped the fact that the servants had been tampered with without wasting any more time he took a somewhat hurried leave and drove back to the hotel one of the hall porters approached him smiling  there is a lady waiting for you in your rooms sir he announced she arrived a few minutes ago  mr sabin rang for the elevator got out at his floor and walked down the corridor leaning a little more heavily than usual upon his stick if indeed it were lucille who had braved all and come to him the way before them might still be smooth sailing he would never let her go again he was sure of that they would leave englandyes there was time still to catch the five oclock train he turned the handle of his door and entered a familiar figure rose from the depths of his easychair her hat lay on the table her jacket was open one of his cigarettes was between her lips but it was not lucille  lady carey he said slowly this is an unexpected pleasure have you brought lucille with you  i am afraid she answered that i have no ropes strong enough  you insinuate he remarked that lucille would be unwilling to come  there is no longer any need she declared with a hard little laugh for insinuations we have all been turned out from dorset house neck and crop lucille has accepted the inevitable she has gone to reginalds brotts rooms  mr sabin smiled  indeed i have just come from dorset house myself the duke has supplied me with a highly entertaining account of his sudden awakening the situation must have been humorous  her eyes twinkled  it was really screamingly funny the duke had on his house of lords manner and we all sat round like a lot of naughty children if only you had been there  mr sabin smiled suddenly she laid her hand upon his arm  victor she said i have come to prove that i am your friend you do not believe that lucille is with reginald brott it is true not only that but she is leaving england with him tonight the mans devotion is irresistiblehe has been gaining on her slowly but surely all the time  i have noticed mr sabin remarked calmly that he has been wonderfully assiduous i am sure i congratulate him upon his success if he has succeeded  you doubt my word of course she said but i have not come here to tell you things i have come to prove them i presume that what you see with your own eyes will be sufficient  mr sabin shook his head  certainly not he answered i make it a rule to believe nothing that i see and never to trust my ears  she stamped her foot lightly upon the floor  how impossible you are she exclaimed i can tell you by what train lucille and reginald brott will leave london tonight i can tell you why lucille is bound to go  now mr sabin said you are beginning to get interesting  lucille must goor run the risk of arrest for complicity in the murder of duson  are you serious mr sabin asked with admirably assumed gravity  is it a jesting matter she answered fiercely lucille bought poison the same poison which it will be proved that duson died of she came here she was the last person to enter your room before duson was found dead the police are even now searching for her escape is her only chance  dear me mr sabin said then it is not only for brotts sake that she is running away  what does that matter she is going and she is going with him  and why he asked do you come to give me warning i have plenty of time to interpose  you can try if you will lucille is in hiding she will not see you if you go to her she is determined indeed she has no choice lucille is a brave woman in many ways but you know that she fears death she is in a corner she is forced to go  again he said i feel that i must ask you why do you give me warning  she came and stood close to him  perhaps she said earnestly i am anxious to earn your gratitude perhaps too i know that no interposition of yours would be of any avail  mr sabin smiled  still he said i do not think that it is wise of you i might appear at the station and forcibly prevent lucilles departure after all she is my wife you know  she shrugged her shoulders  i am not afraid she said you will make inquiries when i have gone and you will find out that i have spoken the truth if you keep lucille in england you will expose her to a terrible risk it is not like you to be selfish you will yield to necessity  will you tell me where lucille is now he asked  for your own sake and hers no she answered you also are watched besides it is too late she was with brott half an hour after the duke turned us out of dorset house dont you understand victorwont you it is too late  he sat down heavily in his easychair his whole appearance was one of absolute dejection  so i am to be left alone in my old age he murmured you have your revenge now at last you have come to take it  she sank on her knees by the side of his chair and her arms fell upon his shoulders  how can you think so cruelly of me victor she murmured you were always a little mistaken in lucille she loved you it is true but all her life she has been fond of change and excitement she came to europe willinglylong before this brott would have been her slave save for your reappearance cant you forget herfor a little while  mr sabin sat quite still her hair brushed his cheeks her arms were about his neck her whole attitude was an invitation for his embrace but he sat like a figure of stone neither repulsing nor encouraging her  you need not be alone unless you like she whispered  i am an old man he said slowly and this is a hard blow for me to bear i must be sure absolutely sure that she has gone  by this time tomorrow she murmured all the world will know it  come to me then he said i shall need consolation  her eyes were bright with triumph she leaned over him and kissed him on the lips then she sprang lightly to her feet  wait here for me she said and i will come to you you shall know victor that lucille is not the only woman in the world who has cared for you  there was a tap at the door lady carey was busy adjusting her hat passmore entered and stood hesitating upon the threshold mr sabin had risen to his feet he took one of her hands and raised it to his lips she gave him a swift wonderful look and passed out  mr sabins manner changed as though by magic he was at once alert and vigorous  my dear passmore he said come to the table we shall want those continental timetables and the london abc you will have to take a journey tonight    chapter xxxviii  the two women were alone in the morningroom of lady careys house in pont street lucille was walking restlessly up and down twisting her handkerchief between her fingers lady carey was watching her more composed to all outward appearance but with closely compressed lips and boding gleam in her eyes  i think lady carey said that you had better see him  lucille turned almost fiercely upon her  and why  well for one thing he will not understand your refusal he may be suspicious  what does it matter i have finished with him i have done all that i pledged myself to what more can be expected of me i do not wish to see him again  lady carey laughed  at least she said i think that the poor man has a right to receive his congé from you you cannot break with him without a word of explanation perhapsyou may not find it so easy as it seems  lucille swept around  what do you mean  lady carey shrugged her shoulders  you are in a curious mood my dear lucille what i mean is obvious enough brott is a strong man and a determined man i do not think that he will enjoy being made a fool of  lucille was indifferent  at any rate she said i shall not see him i have quite made up my mind about that  and why not countess a deep voice asked from the threshold what have i done may i not at least know my fault  lady carey rose and moved towards the door  you shall have it out between yourselves she declared looking up and nodding at brott as she passed dont fight  muriel  the cry was imperative but lady carey had gone mr brott closed the door behind him and confronted lucille a brilliant spot of colour flared in her pale cheeks  but this is a trap she exclaimed who sent for you why did you come  he looked at her in surprise  lucille  his eyes were full of passionate remonstrance she looked nervously from him towards the door he intercepted her glance  what have i done he asked fiercely what have i failed to do why do you look as though i had forced myself upon you havent i the right dont you wish to see me  in brotts face and tone was all the passionate strenuousness of a great crisis lucille felt suddenly helpless before the directness of his gaze his storm of questions in all their former intercourse it had been she who by virtue of her sex and his blind love for her had kept the upper hand and now the position was changed all sorts of feeble explanations of appeals to him occurred to her dimly only to be rejected by reason of their ridiculous inadequacy she was silentabjectly silent  he came a little closer to her and the strength of the man was manifest in his intense selfrestraint his words were measured his tone quiet yet both somehow gave evidence of the smouldering fires beneath  lucille he said i find you hard to understand today you have made me your slave you came once more into my life at its most critical moment and for your sake i have betrayed a great trust my conscience my faith and although that counts for little my political career were in the balance against my love for you you know which conquered at your bidding i have made myself the jest of every man who buys the halfpenny paper and calls himself a politician my friends heap abuse upon me my enemies derision i cannot hold my position in this new cabinet i had gone too far for compromise i wonder if you quite understand what has happened  oh i have heard too much she cried spare me the rest  he continued as though he had not heard her  men who have been my intimate associates for many years and whose friendship was dear to me cross the road to avoid meeting me day by day i am besieged with visitors and letters from the suffering people to whom my word had been pledged imploring me for some explanation for one word of denial life has become a hell for me a pestilent militant hell yet lucille unless you break faith with me i make no complaint i am content  i am very sorry she said i do not think that you have properly understood me i have never made you any promise  for a moment he lost control of himself she shrank back at the blaze of indignation half scornful half incredulous which lit up his clear grey eyes  it is a lie he answered between you and me it can be no question of words you were always very careful of your pledges but there are limits even to your cautionas to my forbearance a woman does not ask a man who is pleading to her for her love to give up everything else he cares for in life without hope of reward it is monstrous i never sought you under false pretenses i never asked you for your friendship i wanted you i told you so plainly you wont deny that you gave me hopeencouraged me you cant even deny that i am within my rights if i claim now at this instant the reward for my apostasy  her hands were suddenly locked in his she felt herself being drawn into his arms with a desperate effort she avoided his embrace he still held her left wrist and his face was dark with passion  let me go she pleaded  not i he answered with an odd choked little laugh you belong to me i have paid the price i too am amongst the long list of those poor fools who have sold their gods and their honour for a womans kiss but i will not be left wholly destitute you shall pay me for what i have lost  oh you are mad she answered how could you have deceived yourself so dont you know that my husband is in london  the man who calls himself mr sabin he answered roughly what has that to do with it you are living apart saxe leinitzer and the duchess have both told me the history of your married life or is the whole thing a monstrous lie he cried with a sudden dawning sense of the truth nonsense i wont believe it lucille youre not afraid i shall be good to you you dont doubt that sabin will divorce you of course you wont lose your friends i  there was a sudden loud tapping at the door brott dropped her wrist and turned round with an exclamation of anger to lucille it was a heavensent interposition the prince entered pale and with signs of hurry and disorder about his usually immaculate person  you are both here he exclaimed good lucille i must speak with you urgently in five minutes brott come this way with me  lucille sank into a chair with a little murmur of relief the prince led brott into another room and closed the door carefully behind him  mr brott he said can i speak to you as a friend of lucilles  brott who distrusted the prince looked him steadily in the face saxe leinitzers agitation was too apparent to be wholly assumed he had all the appearance of being a man desperately in earnest  i have always considered myself one brott answered i am beginning to doubt however whether the countess holds me in the same estimation  you found her hysterical unreasonable overwrought the prince exclaimed that is so eh  the prince drew a long breath  brott he said i am forced to confide in you lucille is in terrible danger i am not sure that there is anybody who can effectually help her but you are you prepared to make a great sacrifice for her saketo leave england at once to take her to the uttermost part of the world  brotts eyes were suddenly bright the prince quailed before the fierceness of his gaze  she would not go he exclaimed sharply  she will the prince answered she must not only that but you will earn her eternal gratitude listen i must tell you the predicament in which we find ourselves it places lucilles life in your hands  what  the exclamation came like a pistol shot the prince held up his hand  do not interrupt let me speak every moment is very valuable you heard without doubt of the sudden death at the carlton hotel it took place in mr sabins sittingroom the victim was mr sabins servant the inquest was this afternoon the verdict was death from the effect of poison the police are hot upon the case there was no evidence as to the person by whom the poison was administered but by a hideous combination of circumstances one person before many hours have passed will be under the surveillance of the police  and that person brott asked  the prince looked round and lowered his voice although the room was empty  lucille he whispered hoarsely  brott stepped backwards as though he were shot  what damned folly he exclaimed  it is possible that you may not think so directly saxe leinitzer continued the day it happened lucille bought this same poison and it is a rare one from a man who has absconded an hour before this man was found dead she called at the hotel left no name but went upstairs to mr sabins room and was alone there for five minutes the man died from a single grain of poison which had been introduced into mr sabins special liqueur glass out of which he was accustomed to drink three or four times a day all these are absolute facts which at any moment may be discovered by the police added to that she is living apart from her husband and is known to be on bad terms with him  brott as gripping the back of a chair he was white to the lips  you dont think he cried hoarsely you cant believe  no the prince answered quickly i dont believe anything of the sort i will tell you as man to man that i believe she wished mr sabin dead you yourself should know why but no i dont believe she went so far as that it was an accident but what we have to do is to save her will you help  yes  she must cross to the continent tonight before the police get on the scent afterwards she must double back to havre and take the bordlaise for new york on saturday once there i can guarantee her protection  well  she cannot go alone  you mean that i should go with her  yes get her right away and i will employ special detectives and have the matter cleared up if ever it can be but if she remains here i fear that nothing can save her from the horror of an arrest even if afterwards we are able to save her you yourself risk much brott the only question that remains is will you do it  at her biddingyes brott declared  wait here the prince answered    chapter xxxix  saxe leinitzer returned to the morningroom and taking the key from his pocket unlocked the door inside lucille was pale with fury  what i am a prisoner then she exclaimed how dare you lock me in this is not your house let me pass i am tired of all this stupid espionage  the prince stood with his back to the door  it is for your own sake lucille the house is watched  she sank into a low chair trembling the prince had all the appearance of a man himself seriously disturbed  lucille he said we will do what we can for you the whole thing is horribly unfortunate you must leave england tonight muriel will go with you her presence will help to divert suspicion once you can reach paris i can assure you of safety but in this country i am almost powerless  i must see victor she said in a low tone i will not go without  the prince nodded  i have thought of that there is no reason lucille why he should not be the one to lead you into safety  you mean that she cried  i mean it the prince answered after what has happened you are of course of no further use to us i am inclined to think too that we have been somewhat exacting i will send a messenger to souspennier to meet you at charing cross tonight  she sprang up  let me write it myself  very well he agreed with a shrug of the shoulders but do not address or sign it there is danger in any communication between you  she took a sheet of notepaper and hastily wrote a few words  i have need of your help will you be at charing cross at twelve oclock prepared for a journeylucille  the prince took the letter from her and hastily folded it up  i will deliver it myself he announced it will perhaps be safest until i return lucille do not stir from the house or see any one muriel has given the servants orders to admit no one all your life he added after a moments pause you have been a little cruel to me and this time also i shall pray that you will relent before our next meeting  she rose to her feet and looked him full in the face she seemed to be following out her own train of thought rather than taking note of his words  even now she said thoughtfully i am not sure that i can trust you i have a good mind to fight or scream my way out of this house and go myself to see victor  he shrugged his shoulders  the fighting or the screaming will not be necessary dear countess he said the doors are open to you but it is as clear as day that if you go to the hotel or near it you will at once be recognised and recognition means arrest there is a limit beyond which one cannot help a wilful woman take your life in your hands and go your own way or trust in us who are doing our best to save you  and what of reginald brott she asked  brott the prince repeated impatiently who cares what becomes of him you have made him seem a fool but lucille to tell you the truth i am sorry that we did not leave this country altogether alone there is not the soil for intrigue here or the possibility then too the police service is too stolid too inaccessible and even our friends for whose aid we are herewell you heard the duke the castiron saxon idiocy of the man the aristocracy here are what they call bucolic it is their own fault they have intermarried with parvenus and americans for generations they are a race by themselves we others may shake ourselves free from them i would work in any country of the globe for the good of our cause but never again in england  lucille shivered a little  i am not in the humour for argument she declared if you would earn my gratitude take that note to my husband he is the only man i feel sure ofwhom i know can protect me  the prince bowed low  it is our farewell countess he said  i cannot pretend she answered to regret it  saxe leinitzer left the room there was a peculiar smile upon his lips as he crossed the hall brott was still awaiting for him  mr brott he said the countess is as i feared too agitated to see you again for the present or any one else she sends you however this message  he took the folded paper from his waistcoat pocket and handed it to the other man brott read it through eagerly his eyes shone  she accepts the situation then he exclaimed  precisely will you pardon me my friend if i venture upon one other word lucille is not an ordinary woman she is not in the least like the majority of her sex especially i might add amongst us the fact that her husband was living would seriously influence her consideration of any other manas her lover the present crisis however has changed everything i do not think that you will have cause to complain of her lack of gratitude  brott walked out into the streets with the half sheet of notepaper twisted up between his fingers for the first time for months he was conscious of a distinct and vivid sense of happiness the terrible period of indecision was past he knew now where he stood nor was his immediate departure from england altogether unpleasant to him his political career was shatteredfriends and enemies were alike cold to him such an act of cowardice as his such pitiful shrinking back at the last fateful moment was inexplicable and revolting even letheringham was barely civil it was certain that his place in the cabinet would be intolerable he yearned for escape from it all and the means of escape were now at hand in after years he knew very well that the shadow of his broken trust the torture of his misused opportunities would stand for ever between him and the light but at that moment he was able to clear his mind of all such disquieting thoughts he had won lucillenever mind at what cost at what peril he had won lucille  he was deeply engrossed and his name was spoken twice in his ear before he turned round a small somewhat shabbylooking man with tired eyes and more than a days growth of beard upon his chin had accosted him  mr brott sir a word with you please  brott held out his hand nevertheless his tone when he spoke lacked heartiness  you hedley why what brings you to london  the little man did not seem to see the hand at any rate he made no motion to take it  a few minutes chat with mr brott thats what ive come for  brott raised his eyebrows and nodded in somewhat constrained fashion  well he said i am on my way to my rooms we can talk as we go if you like i am afraid the good people up in your part of the world are not too well pleased with me  the little man smiled rather queerly  that is quite true he answered calmly they hate a liar and a turncoat so do i  brott stopped short upon the pavement  if you are going to talk like that to me hedley he said the less you have to say the better  the man nodded  very well he said what i have to say wont take me very long but as ive tramped most of the way up here to say it youll have to listen here or somewhere else i thought you were always one who liked the truth  so i do brott answered go on  the man shuffled along by his side they were an oddlooking pair for brott was rather a careful man as regards his toilet and his companion looked little better than a tramp  all my life he continued ive been called mad hedley or hedley the mad tailor sometimes one and sometimes the other it dont matter which theres truth in it i am a bit mad you mr brott were one of those who understood me a little i have brooded a good deal perhaps and things have got muddled up in my brain you know what has been at the bottom of it all  i began making speeches when i was a boy people laughed at me but ive set many a one athinking im no anarchist although people call me one ill admit that i admire the men who set the french revolution going if such a thing happened in this country id be one of the first to join in but ive never had a taste for bloodshed id rather the thing had been done without from the first you seemed to be the man who might have brought it about we listened to you we watched your career and we began to have hopes mr brott the bodies and souls of millions of your fellowcreatures were in the hollow of your hand it was you who might have set them free it was you who might have made this the greatest the freest the happiest country in the world not so much for us perhaps as for our children and our childrens children we didnt expect a huge social upheaval in a week or even a decade of years but we did expect to see the first blow struck oh yes we expected that  i have disappointed you i know you and many others brott said bitterly i wish i could explain but i cant  oh it doesnt matter the man answered you have broken the hearts of thousands of suffering men and womenyou who might have led them into the light have forged another bolt in the bars which stand between them and liberty so they must live on in the darkness dull dumb creatures with just spirit enough to spit and curse at the sound of your name it was the greatest trust god ever placed in one mans handand youyou abused it they were afraid of youthe aristocrats and they bought you oh we are not blind up therethere are newspapers in our public houses and now and then one can afford a halfpenny we have read of you at their parties and their dances quite one of them you have become havent you but mr brott have you never been afraid have you never said to yourself there is justice in the earth suppose it finds me out  hedley you are talking rubbish brott said up here you would see things with different eyes letheringham is pledged  if any man ever earned hell hedley continued it is you brott you who came to us a deliverer and turned out to be a lying prophet hell he repeated fiercely and may you find it swiftly  the mans right hand came out of his long pocket they were in the thick of piccadilly but his action was too swift for any interference four reports rang suddenly out and the muzzle of the revolver was held deliberately within an inch or so of bretts heart and before even the nearest of the bystanders could realise what had happened brott lay across the pavement a dead man and hedley was calmly handing over the revolver to a policeman who had sprang across the street  be careful officer he said there are still two chambers loaded i will come with you quite quietly that is mr reginald brott the cabinet minister and i have killed him    chapter xl  for once lady carey said with a faint smile your admirable crichton has failed you  lucille opened her eyes she had been leaning back amongst the railway cushions  i think not she said only i blame myself that i ever trusted the prince even so far as to give him that message for i know very well that if victor had received it he would have been here  lady carey took up a great pile of papers and looked them carelessly through  i am afraid she said that i do not agree with you i do not think that saxe leinitzer had any desire except to see you safely away i believe that he will be quite as disappointed as you are that your husband is not here to aid you some one must see you safely on the steamer at havre perhaps he will come himself  i shall wait in paris lucille said quietly for my husband  you may wait lady carey said for a very long time  lucille looked at her steadily what do you mean  what a fool you are lucille if to other people it seems almost certain on the face of it that you were responsible for that drop of poison in your husbands liqueur glass why should it not seem so to himself  lucille laughed but there was a look of horror in her dark eyes  how absurd i know victor better than to believe him capable of such a suspicion just as he knows me better than to believe me capable of such an act  really but you were in his rooms secretly just before  i went to leave some roses for him lucille answered and if you would like to know it i will tell you this i left my card tied to them with a message for him  lady carey yawned  a remarkably foolish thing to do she said that may cause you trouble later on great heavens what is this  she held the evening paper open in her hand lucille leaned over with blanched face  what has happened she cried tell me cant you  reginald brott has been shot in piccadilly lady carey said  is he hurt lucille asked  he is dead  they read the brief announcement together the deed had been committed by a man whose reputation for sanity had long been questioned one of brotts own constituents he was in custody and freely admitted his guilt the two women looked at one another in horror even lady carey was affected  what a hateful thing she said i am glad that we had no hand in it  are you so sure that we hadnt lucille asked bitterly you see what it says the man killed him because of his political apostasy we had something to do with that at least  lady carey was recovering her sang froid  oh well she said indirect influences scarcely count or one might trace the causes of everything which happens back to an absurd extent if this man was mad he might just as well have shot brott for anything  lucille made no answer she leaned back and closed her eyes she did not speak again till they reached dover  they embarked in the drizzling rain lady carey drew a little breath of relief as they reached their cabin and felt the boat move beneath them  thank goodness that we are really off i have been horribly nervous all the time if they let you leave england they can have no suspicion as yet  lucille was putting on an ulster and cap to go out on deck  i am not at all sure she said that i shall not return to england at any rate if victor does not come to me in paris i shall go to him  what beautiful trust lady carey answered my dear lucille you are more like a schoolgirl than a woman of the world   a steward entered with a telegram for lucille it was banded in at the haymarket an hour before their departure lucille read it and her face blanched i thank you for your invitation but i fear that it would not be good for my healths  lady carey looked over her shoulder she laughed hardly  how brutal she murmured but then victor can be brutal sometimes cant he  lucille tore it into small pieces without a word lady carey waited for a remark from her in vain  i too she said at last have had some telegrams i have been hesitating whether to show them to you or not perhaps you had better see them  she produced them and spread them out the first was dated about the same time as the one lucille had received  have seen s with message from lucille fear quite useless as he believes worst  the second was a little longer  have just heard s has left for liverpool and has engaged berth in campania sailing tomorrow break news to lucille if you think well have wired him begging return and promising full explanation  if these lucille said calmly belonged to me i should treat them as i have my own  what do you mean  i should tear them up  lady carey shrugged her shoulders with the air of one who finds further argument hopeless  i shall have no more to say to you lucille on this subject she said you are impossible in a few days you will be forced to come round to my point of view i will wait till then and in the meantime if you think i am going to tramp up and down those sloppy decks and gaze at the sea you are very much mistaken i am going to lie down like a civilized being and try and get a nap you had better do the same  lucille laughed  for my part she said i find any part of the steamer except the deck intolerable i am going now in search of some fresh air shall i send your woman along  lady carey nodded for just then the steamer gave a violent lurch and she was not feeling talkative lucille went outside and walked up and down until the lights of calais were in sight all the time she felt conscious of the observation of a small man clad in a huge mackintosh whose peaked cap completely obscured his features as they were entering the harbour she purposely stood by his side he held on to the rail with one hand and turned towards her  it has been quite a rough passage has it not he remarked  she nodded  i have crossed she said when it has been much worse i do not mind so long as one may come on deck  your friend he remarked is perhaps not so good a sailor  i believe lucille said that she suffers a great deal i just looked in at her and she was certainly uncomfortable  the little man gripped the rail and held on to his cap with the other hand  you are going to paris he asked  lucille nodded  yes  they were in smoother water now he was able to relax his grip of the rail he turned towards lucille and she saw him for the first time distinctlya thin wizenedup little man with shrewd kindly eyes and a long deeply cut mouth  i trust he said that you will not think me impertinent but it occurred to me that you have noticed some apparent interest of mine in your movements since you arrived on the boat  lucille nodded  it is true she answered that is why i came and stood by your side what do you want with me  nothing madam he answered i am here altogether in your interests if you should want help i shall be somewhere near you for the next few hours do not hesitate to appeal to me my mission here is to be your protector should you need one  lucilles eyes grew bright and her heart beat quickly  tell me she said who sent you  he smiled  i think that you know he answered one who i can assure you will never allow you to suffer any harm i have exceeded my instructions in speaking to you but i fancied that you were looking worried you need not i can assure you that you need have no cause  her eyes filled with tears  i knew she said that those telegrams were forgeries  he looked carefully around  i know nothing about any telegrams he said but i am here to see that no harm comes to you and i promise you that it shall not your friend is looking out of the cabin door i think we may congratulate ourselves madam on an excellent passage  lady carey disembarked a complete wreck leaning on the arm of her maid and with a bottle of smelling salts clutched in her hand she slept all the way in the train and only woke up when they were nearing paris she looked at lucille in astonishment  why what on earth have you been doing to yourself she exclaimed you look disgustingly fit and well  lucille laughed softly  why not i have had a nap and we are almost at paris i only want a bath and a change of clothes to feel perfectly fresh  but lady carey was suspicious  have you seen any one you know upon the train she asked  lucille shook her head  not a soul a little man whom i spoke to on the steamer brought me some coffee that is all  lady carey yawned and shook out her skirts i suppose im getting old she said i couldnt look as you do with as much on my mind as you must have and after traveling all night too  lucille laughed  after all she said you know that i am a professional optimist and i have faith in my luck i have been thinking matters over calmly and to tell you the truth i am not in the least alarmed  lady carey looked at her curiously  has the optimism been imbibed she asked or is it spontaneous  lucille smiled  unless the little man in the plaid mackintosh poured it into the coffee with the milk she said i could not possibly have imbibed it for i havent spoken to another soul since we left  paris here we are thank goodness celeste can see the things through the customs she is quite used to it we are going to the ritz i suppose    chapter xli  at eight oclock in the evening lucille knocked at the door of lady careys suite of rooms at the hotel there was no answer a chambermaid who was near came smiling up  miladi has i think descended for dinner she said  lucille looked at her watch she saw that she was a few minutes late so she descended to the restaurant the small table which they had reserved was however still unoccupied lucille told the waiter that she would wait for a few moments and sent for an english newspaper  lady carey did not appear a quarter of an hour passed the head waiter came up with a benign smile  madam will please to be served he suggested with a bow  i am waiting for my friend lady carey lucille answered i understood that she had come down perhaps you will send and see if she is in the readingroom  with much pleasure madam the man answered  in a few minutes he returned  madams friend was the lady carey he asked  lucille nodded  the man was gently troubled  but miladi carey he said has left more than an hour ago  lucille looked up astonished  left the hotel she exclaimed  but yes madam he exclaimed miladi carey left to catch the boat train at calais for england  it is impossible lucille answered we only arrived at midday  i will inquire again the man declared but it was in the office that they told me so  they told you quite correctly said a familiar voice i have come to take her place countess i trust that in me you will recognise an efficient substitute  it was the prince of saxe leinitzer who was calmly seating himself opposite to her the waiter with the discretion of his class withdrew for a few paces and stood awaiting orders lucille looked across at him in amazement  you here she exclaimed and muriel gone what does this mean  the prince leaned forward  it means he said that after you left i was in torment i felt that you had no one with you who could be of assistance supposing the worst happened muriel is all very well but she is a woman and she has no diplomacy no resource i felt lucille that i should not be happy unless i myself saw you into safety  so you followed us here lucille remarked quietly  exactly you do not blame me it was for your sakeas well as my own  and murielwhy has she left me without farewellwithout warning of any sort  the prince smiled and stroked his fair moustache  well he said it is rather an awkward thing for me to explain but to tell you the truth muriel was a littlemore than a littleannoyed at my coming she has no right to be butwell you know she is what you call a monopolist she and i have been friends for many years  i understand perfectly what you have wished to convey lucille said but what i do not understand are the exact reasons which brought you here  the prince took up the carte de jour  as we dine he said i will tell you you will permit me to order  lucille rose to her feet  for yourself certainly she answered as for me i have accepted no invitation to dine with you nor do i propose to do so  the prince frowned  be reasonable lucille he pleaded i must talk with you there are important plans to be made i have a great deal to say to you sit down  lucille looked across at him with a curious smile upon her lips  you have a good deal to say to me she remarked yes i will believe that but of the truth how much i wonder  by and bye he said you will judge me differently for hors doeuvres what do you say to oeufs de pluvier then  pardon me she interrupted i am not interested in your dinner  in our dinner he ventured gently  i am not dining with you she declared firmly if you insist upon remaining here i shall have something served in my room you know quite well that we are certain to be recognised one would imagine that this was a deliberate attempt on your part to compromise me  lucille he said do not be foolish why do you persist in treating me as though i were your persecutor  because you are she said coolly  it is ridiculous he declared you are in the most serious danger and i have come only to save you i can do it and i will but listennot unless you change your demeanour towards me  she laughed scornfully she had risen to her feet now and he was perforce compelled to follow her example  is that a challenge she asked  you may take it as such if you will he answered with a note of sullenness in his tone you know very well that i have but to lift my finger and the gendarmes will be here yes we will call it a challenge all my life i have wanted you now i think that my time has come even souspennier has deserted you you are alone and let me tell you that danger is closer at your heels than you know of i can save you and i will but i have a price and it must be paid  if i refuse she asked  i send for the chief of the police  she looked him up and down a measured merciless survey he was a tall big man but he seemed to shrink into insignificance  you are a coward and a bully she said slowly you know quite well that i am innocent of any knowledge even concerning dusons death but i would sooner meet my fate whatever it might be than suffer even the touch of your fingers upon my hand your presence is hateful to me send for your chief of the police string your lies together as you will i am satisfied  she left him and swept from the room a spot of colour burning in her cheeks her eyes lit with fire the pride of her race had asserted itself she felt no longer any fear she only desired to sever herself at once and completely from all association with this man in the hall she sent for her maid  fetch my cloak and jewel case celeste she ordered i am going across to the bristol you can return for the other luggage  but madam  do as i say at once lucille ordered  the girl hesitated and then obeyed lucille found herself suddenly addressed in a quiet tone by a man who had been sitting in an easychair half hidden by a palm tree  will you favour me madam with a moments conversation  lucille turned round she recognised at once the man with whom she had conversed upon the steamer in the quietest form of evening dress there was something noticeable in the mans very insignificance he seemed a little out of his element lucille had a sudden inspiration the man was a detective  what do you wish to say she asked half doubtfully  i overheard he remarked your order to your maid she had something to say to you but you gave her no opportunity  and you she asked what do you wish to say  i wish to advise you he said not to leave the hotel  she looked at him doubtfully  you cannot understand she said why i wish to leave it i have no alternative  nevertheless he said i hope that you will change your mind  are you a detective she asked abruptly  madam is correct  the flush of colour faded from her cheeks  i presume then she said that i am under your surveillance  in a sense he admitted it is true  on the steamer she remarked you spoke as though your interest in me was not inimical  nor is it he answered promptly you are in a difficult position but you may find things not so bad as you imagine at present my advice to you is this go upstairs to your room and stay there  the little man had a compelling manner lucille made her way towards the elevator  as a matter of fact she murmured bitterly i am not i suppose permitted to leave the hotel  madam puts the matter bluntly he answered but certainly if you should insist upon leaving it would be my duty to follow you  she turned away from him and entered the elevator the door of her room was slightly ajar and she saw that a waiter was busy at a small round table she looked at him in surprise he was arranging places for two  who gave you your orders she asked  but it was monsieur the man answered with a low bow dinner for two  monsieur she repeated what monsieur  i am the culprit a familiar voice answered from the depths of an easychair whose back was to her i was very hungry and it occurred to me that under the circumstances you would probably not have dined either i hope that you will like what i have ordered the plovers eggs look delicious  she gave a little cry of joy it was mr sabin    chapter xlii  the prince dined carefully but with less than his usual appetite afterwards he lit a cigarette and strolled for a moment into the lounge celeste who was waiting for him glided at once to his side  monsieur she whispered i have been here for one hour  he nodded  well  monsieur le duc has arrived  the prince turned sharply round  who  monsieur le duc de souspennier he calls himself no longer mr sabin  a dull flush of angry colour rose almost to his temples  why did you not tell me before he exclaimed  monsieur was in the restaurant she answered it was impossible for me to do anything but wait  where is he  alas he is with madam the girl answered  the prince was very profane he started at once for the elevator in a moment or two he presented himself at lucilles sittingroom they were still lingering over their dinner mr sabin welcomed him with grave courtesy  the prince is in time to take his liqueur with us he remarked rising will you take fin champagne prince or chartreuse i recommend the fin champagne  the prince bowed his thanks he was white to the lips with the effort for selfmastery  i congratulate you mr sabin he said upon your opportune arrival you will be able to help lucille through the annoyance to which i deeply regret that she should be subjected  mr sabin gently raised his eyebrows  annoyance he repeated i fear that i do not quite understand  the prince smiled  surely lucille has told you he said of the perilous position in which she finds herself  my wife mr sabin said has told me nothing you alarm me  the prince shrugged his shoulders  i deeply regret to tell you he said that the law has proved too powerful for me i can no longer stand between her and what i fear may prove a most unpleasant episode lucille will be arrested within the hour  upon what charge mr sabin asked  the murder of duson  mr sabin laughed very softly very gently but with obvious genuineness  you are joking prince he exclaimed  i regret to say the prince answered that you will find it very far from a joking matter  mr sabin was suddenly stern  prince of saxe leinitzer he said you are a coward and a bully  the prince started forward with clenched fist mr sabin had no weapon but he did not flinch  you can frighten women he said with a bogie such as this but you have no longer a woman to deal with you and i know that such a charge is absurdbut you little know the danger to which you expose yourself by trifling with this subject duson left a letter addressed to me in which he announced his reasons for committing suicide  suicide  yes he preferred suicide to murder even at the bidding of the prince of saxe leinitzer he wrote and explained these things to meand the letter is in safe hands the arrest of lucille my dear prince would mean the ruin of your amiable society  this letter the prince said slowly why was it not produced at the inquest where is it now  it is deposited in a sealed packet with the earl of deringham mr sabin answered as to producing it at the inquesti thought it more discreet not to i leave you to judge of my reasons but i can assure you that your fears for my wifes safety have been wholly misplaced there is not the slightest reason for her to hurry off to america we may take a little trip there presently but not just yet  the prince made a mistake he lost his temper  you he cried you can go to america when you like and stay there europe has had enough of you with your harebrained schemes and foolish failures but lucille does not leave this country we have need of her i forbid her to leave do you hear in the name of the order i command her to remain here  mr sabin was quite calm but his face was full of terrible things  prince he said if i by any chance numbered myself amongst your friends i would warn you that you yourself are a traitor to your order you prostitute a great cause when you stoop to use its machinery to assist your own private vengeance i ask you for your own sake to consider your words lucille is minemine she will remain even though you should descend to something more despicable more cowardly than ordinary treason to wrest her from me you reproach me with the failures of my life great they may have been but if you attempt this you will find that i am not yet an impotent person  the prince was white with rage the sight of lucille standing by mr sabins side her hand lightly resting upon his her dark eyes full of inscrutable tenderness maddened him he was flouted and ignored he was carried away by a storm of passion he tore a sheet of paper from his pocket book and unlocking a small gold case at the end of his watch chain shook from it a pencil with yellow crayon mr sabin leaned over towards him  you sign it at your peril prince he said it will mean worse things than that for you  for a second he hesitated lucille also leaned towards him  prince she said have i not kept my vows faithfully think i came from america at a moments notice i left my husband without even a word of farewell i entered upon a hateful task and though to think of it now makes me loathe myselfi succeeded i have kept my vows i have done my duty be generous now and let me go  the sound of her voice maddened him a passionate arbitrary man to whom nothing in life had been denied to be baulked in this great desire of his latter days was intolerable he made no answer to either of them he wrote a few lines with the yellow crayon and passed them silently across to lucille  her face blanched she stretched out an unwilling hand but mr sabin intervened he took the paper from the princes hand and calmly tore it into fragments there was a moments breathless silence  victor lucille cried oh what have you done  the princes face lightened with an evil joy  we now i think he said understand one another you will permit me to wish you a very pleasant evening and a speedy leavetaking  mr sabin smiled  many thanks my dear prince he said lightly make haste and complete your charming little arrangements let me beg of you to avoid bungling this time remember that there is not in the whole of europe today a man more dangerous to you than i  the prince had departed mr sabin lit a cigarette and stood on the hearthrug his eyes were bright with the joy of fighting  lucille he said i see that you have not touched your liqueur oblige me by drinking it you will find it excellent  she came over to him and hung upon his arm he threw his cigarette away and kissed her upon the lips  victor she murmured i am afraid you have been rash  dearest he answered it is better to die fighting than to stand aside and watch evil things but after all there is no fear come your cloak and dressing case  you have plans she exclaimed springing up  plans he laughed at her a little reproachfully my dear lucille a carriage awaits us outside a special train with steam up at the gard de louest this is precisely the contingency for which i have planned  oh you are wonderful victor she murmured as she drew on her coat but what corner of the earth is there where we should be safe  i am going mr sabin said to try and make every corner of the earth safe  she was bewildered but he only laughed and held open the door for her mr sabin made no secret of his departure he lingered for a moment in the doorway to light a cigarette he even stopped to whisper a few words to the little man in plain dinner clothes who was lounging in the doorway but when they had once left the hotel they drove fast  in less than half an hour paris was behind them they were traveling in a royal saloon and at a fabuulous cost for in france they are not fond of special trains but mr sabin was very happy at least he had escaped an ignominious defeat it was left to him to play the great card  and now lucille said coming out from her little bedchamber which the femme de chambre was busy preparing suppose you tell me where we are going  mr sabin smiled  do not be alarmed he said even though it will sound to you the least likely place in the world we are going to berlin    chapter xliii  the great room was dimly enough lit for the windows looking out upon the street were high and heavily curtained the man who sat at the desk was almost in the shadow yet every now and then a shaft of sunlight fell across his pale worn face a strange combination this of the worker the idealist the man of affairs from outside came the hum of a great city at times too there came to his ears as he sat here the roar of nations at strife the fierce underneath battle of the great countries of the world struggling for supremacy and here at this cabinet this man sat often and listened strenuous romantic with the heart of a lion and the lofty imagination of an eagle he steered unswervingly on to her destiny a great people others might rest but never he  he looked up from the letter spread out before him lucille was seated at his command a few yards away mr sabin stood respectfully before him  monsieur le duc he said this letter penned by my illustrious father to you is sufficient to secure my good offices in what manner can i serve you  your majesty mr sabin answered in the first place by receiving me here in the second by allowing me to lay before you certain grave and very serious charges against the order of the yellow crayon of which your majesty is the titular head  the order of the yellow crayon the emperor said thoughtfully is society composed of aristocrats pledged to resist the march of socialism it is true that i am the titular head of this organisation what have you to say about it  only that your majesty has been wholly deceived mr sabin said respectfully concerning the methods and the working of this society its inception and inauguration were above reproach i myself at once became a member my wife countess of radantz and sole representative of that ancient family has been one all her life  the emperor inclined his head towards lucille  i see no reason he said when our capitals are riddled with secret societies all banded together against us why the great families of europe should not in their turn come together and display a united front against this common enemy the order of the yellow crayon has had more than my support it has had the sanction of my name tell me what you have against it  i have grave things to say concerning it mr sahin answered and concerning those who have wilfully deceived your majesty the influences to be wielded by the society were mainly i believe wealth education and influence there was no mention made of murder of an underground alliance with the gamins of paris the dregs of humanity prisoners men skilled in the art of secret death  the emperors tone was stern almost harsh  duc de souspennier what are these things which you are saying he asked  your majesty i speak the truth mr sabin answered firmly there are in the order of the yellow crayon three degrees of membership the first which alone your majesty knows of simply corresponds with what in england is known as the primrose league the second knows that beneath is another organisation pledged to frustrate the advance of socialism if necessary by the use of their own weapons the third whose meetings and signs and whose whole organisation is carried on secretly is allied in every capital in europe with criminals and murderers with its great wealth it has influence in america as well as in every city of the world where there are police to be suborned or desperate men to be bought for tools at the direction of this third order lavinski died suddenly in the hungarian house of parliament herr krettingen was involved in a duel the result of which was assured beforehand and reginald brott the great english statesman was ruined and disgraced i myself have just narrowly escaped death at his hands and in my place my servant has been driven to death of all these things your majesty i have brought proofs  the emperors face was like a carven image but his tone was cold and terrible  if these things have been sanctioned he said by those who are responsible for my having become the head of the order they shall feel my vengeance  your majesty mr sabin said earnestly a chance disclosure and all might come to light i myself could blazon the story through europe those who are responsible for the third degree of the order of the yellow crayon and for your majestys ignorance concerning its existence have trifled with the destiny of the greatest sovereign of modern times  the prince of saxe leinitzer the emperor said is the acting head of the order  the prince of saxe leinitzer mr sabin said firmly is responsible for the existence of the third degree it is he who has connected the society with a system of corrupt police or desperate criminals in every great city it is the prince of saxe leinitzer your majesty and his horde of murderers from whom i have come to seek your majestys protection i have yet another charge to make against him he has made and is making still use of the society to further his own private intrigues in the name of the order he brought my wife from america she faithfully carried out the instructions of the council she brought about the ruin of reginald brott by the rules of the society she was free then to return to her home the prince who had been her suitor declined to let her go my life was attempted the story of the princes treason is here with the necessary proofs i know that orders have been given to the hired murderers of the society for my assassination my life even here is probably an uncertain thing but i have told your majesty the truth and the papers which i have brought with me contain proof of my words  the emperor struck a bell and gave a few orders to the young officer who immediately answered it then he turned again to mr sabin  i have summoned saxe leinitzer to berlin he said these matters shall be gone into most thoroughly in the meantime what can i do for you  we will await the coming of the prince mr sabin answered grimly                                                     lady carey passed from her bathroom into a luxurious little dressingroom her letters and coffee were on a small table near the fire an easychair was drawn up to the hearthrug she fastened the girdle of her dressinggown and dismissed her maid  i will ring for you in half an hour annette she said see that i am not disturbed  on her way to the fireplace she paused for a moment in front of a tall lookingglass and looked steadily at her own reflection  i suppose she murmured to herself that i am looking at my best now i slept well last night and a bath gives one colour and white is so becoming still i dont know why i failed she may be a little better looking but my figure is as good i can talk better i have learnt how to keep a man from feeling dull and there is my reputation because i played at war correspondence wore a mans clothes and didnt shriek when i was under fire people have chosen to make a heroine of me that should have counted for something with himand it didnt i could have taken my choice of any man in londonand i wanted him and i have failed  she threw herself back in her easychair and laughed softly  failed what an ugly word he is old and he limps and iwell i was never a very bashful person he was beautifully polite but he wouldnt have anything to say to me  she began to tear open her letters savagely  well it is over if ever anybody speaks to me about it i think that i shall kill them that fool saxe leinitzer will stroke his beastly moustache and smile at me out of the corners of his eyes the dorset woman toobah i shall go away what is it annette  his highness the prince of saxe leinitzer has called milady  called does he regard this as a call she exclaimed glancing towards the clock tell him annette that your mistress does not receive at such an hour be quick child of course i know that he gave you a sovereign to persuade me that it was important but i wont see him so be off  but yes milady annette answered and disappeared  lady carey sipped her coffee  i think she said reflectively that it must be melton  annette reappeared  milady she exclaimed his highness insisted upon my bringing you this card he was so strange in his manner milady that i thought it best to obey  lady carey stretched out her hand a few words were scribbled on the back of his visiting card in yellow crayon she glanced at it tore the card up and threw the pieces into the fire  my shoes and stockings annette she said and just a morning wrapanything will do  the prince was walking restlessly up and down the room when lady carey entered he welcomed her with a little cry of relief  heavens he exclaimed i thought that you were never coming  i was in no hurry she answered calmly i could guess your news so i had not even the spur of curiosity  he stopped short  you have heard nothing it is not possible  she shrugged her shoulders  no but i know you and i know him i am quite prepared to hear that you are outwitted indeed to judge from your appearance there can be no doubt about it remember i warned you  the prince was pale with fury  no one could foresee this he exclaimed he has walked into the lions den  then lady carey said i am quite prepared to hear that he tamed the lion  if there was one person living whom i could have sworn that this man dared not visit it was our emperor the prince said it is only a few years since through this mans intrigues germany was shamed before the world  and yet lady carey said sweetly the emperor has received him  i have private intelligence from berlin saxe leinitzer answered mr sabin was in possession of a letter written to him by the emperor frederick thanking him for some service or other and the letter was a talisman  how like him lady carey murmured to have the letter  what a pity the prince sneered that such devotion should remain unrewarded  lady carey sighed  he has broken my heart she replied  the prince threw out his hands  you and i he cried why do we behave like children let us start afresh listen the emperor has summoned me to berlin  dear me lady carey murmured i am afraid you will have a most unpleasant visit  i dare not go the prince said slowly it was i who induced the emperor to become the titular head of this cursed order of course he knew nothing about the second or third degree members and our methods without doubt he is fully informed now i dare not face him  what shall you do lady carey asked curiously  i am off to south america he said it is a great undeveloped country and there is room for us to move there muriel you know what i want of you  my good man she answered i havent the faintest idea  you will come with me he begged you will not send me into exile so lonely a wanderer together there may be a great future before us you have ambition you love intrigue excitement danger none of these can you find here you shall come with me you shall not say no have i not been your devoted slave have  she stopped him her lips were parted in a smile of goodnatured scorn  dont be absurd saxe leinitzer it is true that i love intrigue excitement and danger that is what made me join your order and really i have had quite a little excitement out of it for which i suppose i ought to thank you but as for the rest why you are talking rubbish i would go to south america tomorrow with the right man but with you why it wont bear talking about it makes me angry to think that you should believe me capable of such shocking taste as to dream of going away with you  he flung himself from the room lady carey went back to her coffee and letters she sent for annette  annette she directed we shall go to melton tomorrow wire haggis to have the lodge in order and carriages to meet the midday train i daresay i shall take a few people down with me let george go around to tattershalls at once and make an appointment for me there at three oclock this afternoon look out my habits and boots too annette  lady carey leaned back in her chair for a moment with halfclosed eyes  i think she murmured that some of us in our youth must have drunk from some poisoned cup something which turned our blood into quicksilver i must live or i must die i must have excitement every hour every second or break down there are others toomany others no wonder that that idiot of a man in harley street talked to me gravely about my heart no excitement a quiet life bah such wishywashy coffee and only one cigarette  she lit it and stood up on the hearthrug her eyes were half closed every vestige of colour had left her cheeks her hand was pressed hard to her side for a few minutes she seemed to struggle for breath then with a little lurch as though still giddy she stooped and picking up her fallen cigarette thrust it defiantly between her teeth  not this way she muttered from a horses back if i can with the air rushing by and the hot joy of it in ones heart only i hope it wont hurt the poor old gee come in annette what a time youve been child    the emperor sent for mr sabin he declined to recognise his incognito  monsieur le duc he said if proof of your story were needed it is here the prince of saxe leinitzer has ignored my summons he has fled to south america  mr sabin bowed  a most interesting country he murmured for the prince  you yourself are free to go when and where you will you need no longer have any fears the order does not exist i have crushed it  mr sabin bowed  your majesty he said has shown exemplary wisdom  from its inception the emperor said i believe that the idea was a mistaken one i must confess that its originality pleased me my calmer reflections however show me that i was wrong it is not for the nobles of the earth to copy the methods of socialists and anarchists these men are a pest upon humanity but they may have their good uses they may help us to govern alertly vigorously always with our eyes and ears strained to catch the signs of the changing times monsieur le duc should you decide to take up your residence in this country i shall at all times be glad to receive you but your future is entirely your own  mr sabin accepted his dismissal from audience and went back to lucille  the prince he told her has goneto south america the order does not exist any longer will you dine in vienna or in frankfort  she held out her arms  you wonderful man she cried
