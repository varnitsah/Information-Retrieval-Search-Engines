72167251	john bulls other island   by  bernard shaw     act i  great george street westminster is the address of doyle and broadbent civil engineers on the threshold one reads that the firm consists of mr lawrence doyle and mr thomas broadbent and that their rooms are on the first floor most of their rooms are private for the partners being bachelors and bosom friends live there and the door marked private next the clerks office is their domestic sitting room as well as their reception room for clients let me describe it briefly from the point of view of a sparrow on the window sill the outer door is in the opposite wall close to the right hand corner between this door and the left hand corner is a hatstand and a table consisting of large drawing boards on trestles with plans rolls of tracing paper mathematical instruments and other draughtsmans accessories on it in the left hand wall is the fireplace and the door of an inner room between the fireplace and our observant sparrow against the right hand wall is a filing cabinet with a cupboard on it and nearer a tall office desk and stool for one person in the middle of the room a large double writing table is set across with a chair at each end for the two partners it is a room which no woman would tolerate smelling of tobacco and much in need of repapering repainting and recarpeting but this is the effect of bachelor untidiness and indifference not want of means for nothing that doyle and broadbent themselves have purchased is cheap nor is anything they want lacking on the walls hang a large map of south america a pictorial advertisement of a steamship company an impressive portrait of gladstone and several caricatures of mr balfour as a rabbit and mr chamberlain as a fox by francis carruthers gould  at twenty minutes to five oclock on a summer afternoon in 1904 the room is empty presently the outer door is opened and a valet comes in laden with a large gladstone bag and a strap of rugs he carries them into the inner room he is a respectable valet old enough to have lost all alacrity and acquired an air of putting up patiently with a great deal of trouble and indifferent health the luggage belongs to broadbent who enters after the valet he pulls off his overcoat and hangs it with his hat on the stand then he comes to the writing table and looks through the letters which are waiting for him he is a robust fullblooded energetic man in the prime of life sometimes eager and credulous sometimes shrewd and roguish sometimes portentously solemn sometimes jolly and impetuous always buoyant and irresistible mostly likeable and enormously absurd in his most earnest moments he bursts open his letters with his thumb and glances through them flinging the envelopes about the floor with reckless untidiness whilst he talks to the valet  broadbent calling hodson  hodson in the bedroom yes sir  broadbent dont unpack just take out the things ive worn and put in clean things  hodson appearing at the bedroom door yes sir he turns to go back into the bedroom  broadbent and look here hodson turns again do you remember where i put my revolver  hodson revolver sir yes sir mr doyle uses it as a paperweight sir when hes drawing  broadbent well i want it packed theres a packet of cartridges somewhere i think find it and pack it as well  hodson yes sir  broadbent by the way pack your own traps

right show him in hodson goes out broadbent gets through the rest of his letters before hodson returns with the visitor  hodson mr affigan  haffigan is a stunted shortnecked smallheaded redhaired man of about 30 with reddened nose and furtive eyes he is dressed in seedy black almost clerically and might be a tenthrate schoolmaster ruined by drink he hastens to shake broadbents hand with a show of reckless geniality and high spirits helped out by a rollicking stage brogue this is perhaps a comfort to himself as he is secretly pursued by the horrors of incipient delirium tremens  haffigan tim haffigan sir at your service the top o the mornin to you misther broadbent  broadbent delighted with his irish visitor good afternoon mr haffigan  tim an is it the afthernoon it is already begorra what i call the mornin is all the time a man fasts afther breakfast  broadbent havent you lunched  tim divil a lunch  broadbent im sorry i couldnt get back from brighton in time to offer you some but

a good dhrink if your nerves can stand it mine cant  haffigan sits down at the writing table with his back to the filing cabinet broadbent sits opposite him hodson enters emptyhanded takes two glasses a siphon and a tantalus from the cupboard places them before broadbent on the writing table looks ruthlessly at haffigan who cannot meet his eye and retires  broadbent try a whisky and soda  tim sobered there you touch the national wakeness sir piously not that i share it meself ive seen too much of the mischief of it  broadbent pouring the whisky say when  tim not too sthrong broadbent stops and looks enquiringly at him say halfanhalf broadbent somewhat startled by this demand pours a little more and again stops and looks just a dhrain more the lower half o the tumbler doesnt hold a fair half thankya  broadbent laughing you irishmen certainly do know how to drink pouring some whisky for himself now thats my poor english idea of a whisky and soda  tim an a very good idea it is too dhrink is the curse o me unhappy counthry i take it meself because ive a wake heart and a poor digestion but in principle im a teetoatler  broadbent suddenly solemn and strenuous so am i of course im a local optionist to the backbone you have no idea mr haffigan of the ruin that is wrought in this country by the unholy alliance of the publicans the bishops the tories and the times we must close the publichouses at all costs he drinks  tim sure i know its awful he drinks i see youre a good liberal like meself sir  broadbent i am a lover of liberty like every true englishman mr haffigan my name is broadbent if my name were breitstein and i had a hooked nose and a house in park lane i should carry a union jack handkerchief and a penny trumpet and tax the food of the people to support the navy league and clamor for the destruction of the last remnants of national liberty  tim not another word shake hands  broadbent but i should like to explain  tim sure i know every word youre goin to say before yev said it i know the sort o man yar an so youre thinkin o comin to ireland for a bit  broadbent where else can i go i am an englishman and a liberal and now that south africa has been enslaved and destroyed there is no country left to me to take an interest in but ireland mind i dont say that an englishman has not other duties he has a duty to finland and a duty to macedonia but what sane man can deny that an englishmans first duty is his duty to ireland unfortunately we have politicians here more unscrupulous than bobrikoff more bloodthirsty than abdul the damned and it is under their heel that ireland is now writhing  tim faith theyve reckoned up with poor oul bobrikoff anyhow  broadbent not that i defend assassination god forbid however strongly we may feel that the unfortunate and patriotic young man who avenged the wrongs of finland on the russian tyrant was perfectly right from his own point of view yet every civilized man must regard murder with abhorrence not even in defence of free trade would i lift my hand against a political opponent however richly he might deserve it  tim im sure you wouldnt and i honor you for it youre goin to ireland then out o sympithy is it  broadbent im going to develop an estate there for the land development syndicate in which i am interested i am convinced that all it needs to make it pay is to handle it properly as estates are handled in england you know the english plan mr haffigan dont you  tim bedad i do sir take all you can out of ireland and spend it in england thats it  broadbent not quite liking this my plan sir will be to take a little money out of england and spend it in ireland  tim more power to your elbow an may your shadda never be less for youre the broth of a boy intirely an how can i help you command me to the last dhrop o me blood  broadbent have you ever heard of garden city  tim doubtfully dye mane heavn  broadbent heaven no its near hitchin if you can spare half an hour ill go into it with you  tim i tell you hwat gimme a prospectus lemme take it home and reflect on it  broadbent youre quite right i will he gives him a copy of mr ebenezer howards book and several pamphlets you understand that the map of the citythe circular constructionis only a suggestion  tim ill make a careful note o that looking dazedly at the map  broadbent what i say is why not start a garden city in ireland  tim with enthusiasm thats just what was on the tip o me tongue to ask you why not defiantly tell me why not  broadbent there are difficulties i shall overcome them but there are difficulties when i first arrive in ireland i shall be hated as an englishman as a protestant i shall be denounced from every altar my life may be in danger well i am prepared to face that  tim never fear sir we know how to respict a brave innimy  broadbent what i really dread is misunderstanding i think you could help me to avoid that when i heard you speak the other evening in bermondsey at the meeting of the national league i saw at once that you wereyou wont mind my speaking frankly  tim tell me all me faults as man to man i can stand anything but flatthery  broadbent may i put it in this waythat i saw at once that you were a thorough irishman with all the faults and all the qualities of your race rash and improvident but brave and goodnatured not likely to succeed in business on your own account perhaps but eloquent humorous a lover of freedom and a true follower of that great englishman gladstone  tim spare me blushes i mustnt sit here to be praised to me face but i confess to the goodnature its an irish wakeness id share me last shillin with a friend  broadbent i feel sure you would mr haffigan  tim impulsively damn it call me tim a man that talks about ireland as you do may call me anything gimme a howlt o that whisky bottle he replenishes  broadbent smiling indulgently well tim will you come with me and help to break the ice between me and your warmhearted impulsive countrymen  tim will i come to madagascar or cochin china wid you bedad ill come to the north pole wid you if yll pay me fare for the divil a shillin i have to buy a third class ticket  broadbent ive not forgotten that tim we must put that little matter on a solid english footing though the rest can be as irish as you please you must come as mymywell i hardly know what to call it if we call you my agent theyll shoot you if we call you a bailiff theyll duck you in the horsepond i have a secretary already and  tim then well call him the home secretary and me the irish secretary eh  broadbent laughing industriously capital your irish wit has settled the first difficulty now about your salary  tim a salary is it sure id do it for nothin only me cloes ud disgrace you and id be dhriven to borra money from your friends a thing thats agin me nacher but i wont take a penny more than a hundherd a year he looks with restless cunning at broadbent trying to guess how far he may go  broadbent if that will satisfy you  tim more than reassured why shouldnt it satisfy me a hundherd a year is twelvepound a month isnt it  broadbent no eight pound six and eightpence  tim oh murdher an ill have to sind five timme poor oul mother in ireland but no matther i said a hundherd and what i said ill stick to if i have to starve for it  broadbent with business caution well let us say twelve pounds for the first month afterwards we shall see how we get on  tim youre a gentleman sir whin me mother turns up her toes you shall take the five pounds off for your expinses must be kep down wid a sthrong hand anhe is interrupted by the arrival of broadbents partner  mr laurence doyle is a man of 36 with cold grey eyes strained nose fine fastidious lips critical brown clever head rather refined and goodlooking on the whole but with a suggestion of thinskinedness and dissatisfaction that contrasts strongly with broadbents eupeptic jollity  he comes in as a man at home there but on seeing the stranger shrinks at once and is about to withdraw when broadbent reassures him he then comes forward to the table between the two others  doyle retreating youre engaged  broadbent not at all not at all come in to tim this gentleman is a friend who lives with me here my partner mr doyle to doyle this is a new irish friend of mine mr tim haffigan  tim rising with effusion sure its meself thats proud to meet any friend o misther broadbents the top o the mornin to you sir me heart goes out teeye both its not often i meet two such splendid speciments iv the anglosaxon race  broadbent chuckling wrong for once tim my friend mr doyle is a countryman of yours  tim is noticeably dashed by this announcement he draws in his horns at once and scowls suspiciously at doyle under a vanishing mark of goodfellowship cringing a little too in mere nerveless fear of him  doyle with cool disgust good evening he retires to the fireplace and says to broadbent in a tone which conveys the strongest possible hint to haffigan that he is unwelcome will you soon be disengaged  tim his brogue decaying into a common wouldbe genteel accent with an unexpected strain of glasgow in it i must be going ivnmportnt engeegement in the west end  broadbent rising its settled then that you come with me  tim ishll be verra pleased to accompany ye sir  broadbent but how soon can you start tonightfrom paddington we go by milford haven  tim hesitating wellim afreedi doyle goes abruptly into the bedroom slamming the door and shattering the last remnant of tims nerve the poor wretch saves himself from bursting into tears by plunging again into his role of daredevil irishman he rushes to broadbent plucks at his sleeve with trembling fingers and pours forth his entreaty with all the brogue be can muster subduing his voice lest doyle should hear and return misther broadbent dont humiliate me before a fella counthryman look here me cloes is up the spout gimme a fypounnoteill pay ya nex choosda whin me ship comes homeor you can stop it out o me months sallery ill be on the platform at paddnton punctial an ready gimme it quick before he comes back you wont mind me axin will ye  broadbent not at all i was about to offer you an advance for travelling expenses he gives him a bank note  tim pocketing it thank you ill be there half an hour before the thrain starts larry is heard at the bedroom door returning whisht hes comin back goodbye an god bless ye he hurries out almost crying the 5 pound note and all the drink it means to him being too much for his empty stomach and overstrained nerves  doyle returning where the devil did you pick up that seedy swindler what was he doing here he goes up to the table where the plans are and makes a note on one of them referring to his pocket book as he does so  broadbent there you go why are you so down on every irishman you meet especially if hes a bit shabby poor devil surely a fellowcountryman may pass you the top of the morning without offence even if his coat is a bit shiny at the seams  doyle contemptuously the top of the morning did he call you the broth of a boy he comes to the writing table  broadbent triumphantly yes  doyle and wished you more power to your elbow  broadbent he did  doyle and that your shadow might never be less  broadbent certainly  doyle taking up the depleted whisky bottle and shaking his head at it and he got about half a pint of whisky out of you  broadbent it did him no harm he never turned a hair  doyle how much money did he borrow  broadbent it was not borrowing exactly he showed a very honorable spirit about money i believe he would share his last shilling with a friend  doyle no doubt he would share his friends last shilling if his friend was fool enough to let him how much did he touch you for  broadbent oh nothing an advance on his salaryfor travelling expenses  doyle salary in heavens name what for  broadbent for being my home secretary as he very wittily called it  doyle i dont see the joke  broadbent you can spoil any joke by being cold blooded about it i saw it all right when he said it it was somethingsomething really very amusingabout the home secretary and the irish secretary at all events hes evidently the very man to take with me to ireland to break the ice for me he can gain the confidence of the people there and make them friendly to me eh he seats himself on the office stool and tilts it back so that the edge of the standing desk supports his back and prevents his toppling over  doyle a nice introduction by george do you suppose the whole population of ireland consists of drunken begging letter writers or that even if it did they would accept one another as references  broadbent pooh nonsense hes only an irishman besides you dont seriously suppose that haffigan can humbug me do you  doyle no hes too lazy to take the trouble all he has to do is to sit there and drink your whisky while you humbug yourself however we neednt argue about haffigan for two reasons first with your money in his pocket he will never reach paddington there are too many public houses on the way second hes not an irishman at all  broadbent not an irishman he is so amazed by the statement that he straightens himself and brings the stool bolt upright  doyle born in glasgow never was in ireland in his life i know all about him  broadbent but he spokehe behaved just like an irishman  doyle like an irishman is it possible that you dont know that all this topothemorning and brothofaboy and morepowertoyourelbow business is as peculiar to england as the albert hall concerts of irish music are no irishman ever talks like that in ireland or ever did or ever will but when a thoroughly worthless irishman comes to england and finds the whole place full of romantic duffers like you who will let him loaf and drink and sponge and brag as long as he flatters your sense of moral superiority by playing the fool and degrading himself and his country he soon learns the antics that take you in he picks them up at the theatre or the music hall haffigan learnt the rudiments from his father who came from my part of ireland i knew his uncles matt and andy haffigan of rosscullen  broadbent still incredulous but his brogue  doyle his brogue a fat lot you know about brogues ive heard you call a dublin accent that you could hang your hat on a brogue heaven help you you dont know the difference between connemara and rathmines with violent irritation oh damn tim haffigan lets drop the subject hes not worth wrangling about  broadbent whats wrong with you today larry why are you so bitter  doyle looks at him perplexedly comes slowly to the writing table and sits down at the end next the fireplace before replying  doyle well your letter completely upset me for one thing  broadbent why  larry your foreclosing this rosscullen mortgage and turning poor nick lestrange out of house and home has rather taken me aback for i liked the old rascal when i was a boy and had the run of his park to play in i was brought up on the property  broadbent but he wouldnt pay the interest i had to foreclose on behalf of the syndicate so now im off to rosscullen to look after the property myself he sits down at the writing table opposite larry and adds casually but with an anxious glance at his partner youre coming with me of course  doyle rising nervously and recommencing his restless movements thats it thats what i dread thats what has upset me  broadbent but dont you want to see your country again after 18 years absence to see your people to be in the old home again to  doyle interrupting him very impatiently yes yes i know all that as well as you do  broadbent oh well of course with a shrug if you take it in that way im sorry  doyle never you mind my temper its not meant for you as you ought to know by this time he sits down again a little ashamed of his petulance reflects a moment bitterly then bursts out i have an instinct against going back to ireland an instinct so strong that id rather go with you to the south pole than to rosscullen  broadbent what here you are belonging to a nation with the strongest patriotism the most inveterate homing instinct in the world and you pretend youd rather go anywhere than back to ireland you dont suppose i believe you do you in your heart  doyle never mind my heart an irishmans heart is nothing but his imagination how many of all those millions that have left ireland have ever come back or wanted to come back but whats the use of talking to you three verses of twaddle about the irish emigrant sitting on the stile mary or three hours of irish patriotism in bermondsey or the scotland division of liverpool go further with you than all the facts that stare you in the face why man alive look at me you know the way i nag and worry and carp and cavil and disparage and am never satisfied and never quiet and try the patience of my best friends  broadbent oh come larry do yourself justice youre very amusing and agreeable to strangers  doyle yes to strangers perhaps if i was a bit stiffer to strangers and a bit easier at home like an englishman id be better company for you  broadbent we get on well enough of course you have the melancholy of the celtic race  doyle bounding out of his chair good god  broadbent slylyand also its habit of using strong language when theres nothing the matter  doyle nothing the matter when people talk about the celtic race i feel as if i could burn down london that sort of rot does more harm than ten coercion acts do you suppose a man need be a celt to feel melancholy in rosscullen why man ireland was peopled just as england was and its breed was crossed by just the same invaders  broadbent true all the capable people in ireland are of english extraction it has often struck me as a most remarkable circumstance that the only party in parliament which shows the genuine old english character and spirit is the irish party look at its independence its determination its defiance of bad governments its sympathy with oppressed nationalities all the world over how english  doyle not to mention the solemnity with which it talks oldfashioned nonsense which it knows perfectly well to be a century behind the times thats english if you like  broadbent no larry no you are thinking of the modern hybrids that now monopolize england hypocrites humbugs germans jews yankees foreigners park laners cosmopolitan riffraff dont call them english they dont belong to the dear old island but to their confounded new empire and by george theyre worthy of it and i wish them joy of it  doyle unmoved by this outburst there you feel better now dont you  broadbent defiantly i do much better  doyle my dear tom you only need a touch of the irish climate to be as big a fool as i am myself if all my irish blood were poured into your veins you wouldnt turn a hair of your constitution and character go and marry the most english englishwoman you can find and then bring up your son in rosscullen and that sons character will be so like mine and so unlike yours that everybody will accuse me of being his father with sudden anguish rosscullen oh good lord rosscullen the dullness the hopelessness the ignorance the bigotry  broadbent matteroffactly the usual thing in the country larry just the same here  doyle hastily no no the climate is different here if the life is dull you can be dull too and no great harm done going off into a passionate dream but your wits cant thicken in that soft moist air on those white springy roads in those misty rushes and brown bogs on those hillsides of granite rocks and magenta heather youve no such colors in the sky no such lure in the distances no such sadness in the evenings oh the dreaming the dreaming the torturing heartscalding never satisfying dreaming dreaming dreaming dreaming savagely no debauchery that ever coarsened and brutalized an englishman can take the worth and usefulness out of him like that dreaming an irishmans imagination never lets him alone never convinces him never satisfies him but it makes him that he cant face reality nor deal with it nor handle it nor conquer it he can only sneer at them that do and bitterly at broadbent be agreeable to strangers like a goodfornothing woman on the streets gabbling at broadbent across the table its all dreaming all imagination he cant be religious the inspired churchman that teaches him the sanctity of life and the importance of conduct is sent away empty while the poor village priest that gives him a miracle or a sentimental story of a saint has cathedrals built for him out of the pennies of the poor he cant be intelligently political he dreams of what the shan van vocht said in ninetyeight if you want to interest him in ireland youve got to call the unfortunate island kathleen ni hoolihan and pretend shes a little old woman it saves thinking it saves working it saves everything except imagination imagination imagination and imaginations such a torture that you cant bear it without whisky with fierce shivering selfcontempt at last you get that you can bear nothing real at all youd rather starve than cook a meal youd rather go shabby and dirty than set your mind to take care of your clothes and wash yourself you nag and squabble at home because your wife isnt an angel and she despises you because youre not a hero and you hate the whole lot round you because theyre only poor slovenly useless devils like yourself dropping his voice like a man making some shameful confidence and all the while there goes on a horrible senseless mischievous laughter when youre young you exchange drinks with other young men and you exchange vile stories with them and as youre too futile to be able to help or cheer them you chaff and sneer and taunt them for not doing the things you darent do yourself and all the time you laugh laugh laugh eternal derision eternal envy eternal folly eternal fouling and staining and degrading until when you come at last to a country where men take a question seriously and give a serious answer to it you deride them for having no sense of humor and plume yourself on your own worthlessness as if it made you better than them  broadbent roused to intense earnestness by doyles eloquence never despair larry there are great possibilities for ireland home rule will work wonders under english guidance  doyle pulled up short his face twitching with a reluctant smile tom why do you select my most tragic moments for your most irresistible strokes of humor  broadbent humor i was perfectly serious what do you mean do you doubt my seriousness about home rule  doyle i am sure you are serious tom about the english guidance  broadbent quite reassured of course i am our guidance is the important thing we english must place our capacity for government without stint at the service of nations who are less fortunately endowed in that respect so as to allow them to develop in perfect freedom to the english level of selfgovernment you know you understand me  doyle perfectly and rosscullen will understand you too  broadbent cheerfully of course it will so thats all right he pulls up his chair and settles himself comfortably to lecture doyle now larry ive listened carefully to all youve said about ireland and i can see nothing whatever to prevent your coming with me what does it all come to simply that you were only a young fellow when you were in ireland youll find all that chaffing and drinking and not knowing what to be at in peckham just the same as in donnybrook you looked at ireland with a boys eyes and saw only boyish things come back with me and look at it with a mans and get a better opinion of your country  doyle i daresay youre partly right in that at all events i know very well that if i had been the son of a laborer instead of the son of a country landagent i should have struck more grit than i did unfortunately im not going back to visit the irish nation but to visit my father and aunt judy and nora reilly and father dempsey and the rest of them  broadbent well why not theyll be delighted to see you now that england has made a man of you  doyle struck by this ah you hit the mark there tom with true british inspiration  broadbent common sense you mean  doyle quickly no i dont youve no more common sense than a gander no englishman has any common sense or ever had or ever will have youre going on a sentimental expedition for perfectly ridiculous reasons with your head full of political nonsense that would not take in any ordinarily intelligent donkey but you can hit me in the eye with the simple truth about myself and my father  broadbent amazed i never mentioned your father  doyle not heeding the interruption there he is in rosscullen a landagent whos always been in a small way because hes a catholic and the landlords are mostly protestants what with land courts reducing rents and land acts turning big estates into little holdings hed be a beggar this day if he hadnt bought his own little farm under the land purchase act i doubt if hes been further from home than athenmullet for the last twenty years and here am i made a man of as you say by england  broadbent apologetically i assure you i never meant  doyle oh dont apologize its quite true i daresay ive learnt something in america and a few other remote and inferior spots but in the main it is by living with you and working in double harness with you that i have learnt to live in a real world and not in an imaginary one i owe more to you than to any irishman  broadbent shaking his head with a twinkle in his eye very friendly of you larry old man but all blarney i like blarney but its rot all the same  doyle no its not i should never have done anything without you although i never stop wondering at that blessed old head of yours with all its ideas in watertight compartments and all the compartments warranted impervious to anything that it doesnt suit you to understand  broadbent invincible unmitigated rot larry i assure you  doyle well at any rate you will admit that all my friends are either englishmen or men of the big world that belongs to the big powers all the serious part of my life has been lived in that atmosphere all the serious part of my work has been done with men of that sort just think of me as i am now going back to rosscullen to that hell of littleness and monotony how am i to get on with a little country landagent that ekes out his 5 per cent with a little farming and a scrap of house property in the nearest country town what am i to say to him what is he to say to me  broadbfnt scandalized but youre father and son man  doyle what difference does that make what would you say if i proposed a visit to your father  broadbent with filial rectitude i always made a point of going to see my father regularly until his mind gave way  doyle concerned has he gone mad you never told me  broadbent he has joined the tariff reform league he would never have done that if his mind had not been weakened beginning to declaim he has fallen a victim to the arts of a political charlatan who  doyle interrupting him you mean that you keep clear of your father because he differs from you about free trade and you dont want to quarrel with him well think of me and my father hes a nationalist and a separatist im a metallurgical chemist turned civil engineer now whatever else metallurgical chemistry may be its not national its international and my business and yours as civil engineers is to join countries not to separate them the one real political conviction that our business has rubbed into us is that frontiers are hindrances and flags confounded nuisances  broadbent still smarting under mr chamberlains economic heresy only when there is a protective tariff  doyle firmly now look here tom you want to get in a speech on free trade and youre not going to do it i wont stand it my father wants to make st georges channel a frontier and hoist a green flag on college green and i want to bring galway within 3 hours of colchester and 24 of new york i want ireland to be the brains and imagination of a big commonwealth not a robinson crusoe island then theres the religious difficulty my catholicism is the catholicism of charlemagne or dante qualified by a great deal of modern science and folklore which father dempsey would call the ravings of an atheist well my fathers catholicism is the catholicism of father dempsey  broadbent shrewdly i dont want to interrupt you larry but you know this is all gammon these differences exist in all families but the members rub on together all right suddenly relapsing into portentousness of course there are some questions which touch the very foundations of morals and on these i grant you even the closest relationships cannot excuse any compromise or laxity for instance  doyle impatiently springing up and walking about for instance home rule south africa free trade and the education rate well i should differ from my father on every one of them probably just as i differ from you about them  broadbent yes but you are an irishman and these things are not serious to you as they are to an englishman  doyle what not even home rule  broadbent steadfastly not even home rule we owe home rule not to the irish but to our english gladstone no larry i cant help thinking that theres something behind all this  doyle hotly what is there behind it do you think im humbugging you  broadbent dont fly out at me old chap i only thought  doyle what did you think  broadbent well a moment ago i caught a name which is new to me a miss nora reilly i think doyle stops dead and stares at him with something like awe i dont wish to be impertinent as you know larry but are you sure she has nothing to do with your reluctance to come to ireland with me  doyle sitting down again vanquished thomas broadbent i surrender the poor sillyclever irishman takes off his hat to gods englishman the man who could in all seriousness make that recent remark of yours about home rule and gladstone must be simply the champion idiot of all the world yet the man who could in the very next sentence sweep away all my special pleading and go straight to the heart of my motives must be a man of genius but that the idiot and the genius should be the same man how is that possible springing to his feet by jove i see it all now ill write an article about it and send it to nature  broadbent staring at him what on earth  doyle its quite simple you know that a caterpillar  broadbent a caterpillar  doyle yes a caterpillar now give your mind to what i am going to say for its a new and important scientific theory of the english national character a caterpillar  broadbent look here larry dont be an ass  doyle insisting i say a caterpillar and i mean a caterpillar youll understand presently a caterpillar broadbent mutters a slight protest but does not press it when it gets into a tree instinctively makes itself look exactly like a leaf so that both its enemies and its prey may mistake it for one and think it not worth bothering about  broadbent whats that got to do with our english national character  doyle ill tell you the world is as full of fools as a tree is full of leaves well the englishman does what the caterpillar does he instinctively makes himself look like a fool and eats up all the real fools at his ease while his enemies let him alone and laugh at him for being a fool like the rest oh nature is cunning cunning he sits down lost in contemplation of his wordpicture  broadbent with hearty admiration now you know larry that would never have occurred to me you irish people are amazingly clever of course its all tommy rot but its so brilliant you know how the dickens do you think of such things you really must write an article about it theyll pay you something for it if nature wont have it i can get it into engineering for you i know the editor  doyle lets get back to business id better tell you about nora reilly  broadbent no never mind i shouldnt have alluded to her  doyle id rather nora has a fortune  broadbent keenly interested eh how much  doyle forty per annum  broadbent forty thousand  doyle no forty forty pounds  broadbent much dashed thats what you call a fortune in rosscullen is it  doyle a girl with a dowry of five pounds calls it a fortune in rosscullen whats more 40 pounds a year is a fortune there and nora reilly enjoys a good deal of social consideration as an heiress on the strength of it it has helped my fathers household through many a tight place my father was her fathers agent she came on a visit to us when he died and has lived with us ever since  broadbent attentively beginning to suspect larry of misconduct with nora and resolving to get to the bottom of it since when i mean how old were you when she came  doyle i was seventeen so was she if shed been older shed have had more sense than to stay with us we were together for 18 months before i went up to dublin to study when i went home for christmas and easter she was there i suppose it used to be something of an event for her though of course i never thought of that then  broadbent were you at all hard hit  doyle not really i had only two ideas at that time first to learn to do something and then to get out of ireland and have a chance of doing it she didnt count i was romantic about her just as i was romantic about byrons heroines or the old round tower of rosscullen but she didnt count any more than they did ive never crossed st georges channel since for her sakenever even landed at queenstown and come back to london through ireland  broadbent but did you ever say anything that would justify her in waiting for you  doyle no never but she is waiting for me  broadbent how do you know  doyle she writes to meon her birthday she used to write on mine and send me little things as presents but i stopped that by pretending that it was no use when i was travelling as they got lost in the foreign postoffices he pronounces postoffices with the stress on offices instead of on post  broadbent you answer the letters  doyle not very punctually but they get acknowledged at one time or another  broadbent how do you feel when you see her handwriting  doyle uneasy id give 50 pounds to escape a letter  broadbent looking grave and throwing himself back in his chair to intimate that the crossexamination is over and the result very damaging to the witness hm  doyle what dye mean by hm  broadbent of course i know that the moral code is different in ireland but in england its not considered fair to trifle with a womans affections  doyle you mean that an englishman would get engaged to another woman and return nora her letters and presents with a letter to say he was unworthy of her and wished her every happiness  broadbent well even that would set the poor girls mind at rest  doyle would it i wonder one thing i can tell you and that is that nora would wait until she died of old age sooner than ask my intentions or condescend to hint at the possibility of my having any you dont know what irish pride is england may have knocked a good deal of it out of me but shes never been in england and if i had to choose between wounding that delicacy in her and hitting her in the face id hit her in the face without a moments hesitation  broadbent who has been nursing his knee and reflecting apparently rather agreeably you know all this sounds rather interesting theres the irish charm about it thats the worst of you the irish charm doesnt exist for you  doyle oh yes it does but its the charm of a dream live in contact with dreams and you will get something of their charm live in contact with facts and you will get something of their brutality i wish i could find a country to live in where the facts were not brutal and the dreams not unreal  broadbent changing his attitude and responding to doyles earnestness with deep conviction his elbows on the table and his hands clenched dont despair larry old boy things may look black but there will be a great change after the next election  doyle jumping up oh get out you idiot  broadbent rising also not a bit snubbed ha ha you may laugh but we shall see however dont let us argue about that come now you ask my advice about miss reilly  doyle reddening no i dont damn your advice softening lets have it all the same  broadbent well everything you tell me about her impresses me favorably she seems to have the feelings of a lady and though we must face the fact that in england her income would hardly maintain her in the lower middle class  doyle interrupting now look here tom that reminds me when you go to ireland just drop talking about the middle class and bragging of belonging to it in ireland youre either a gentleman or youre not if you want to be particularly offensive to nora you can call her a papist but if you call her a middleclass woman heaven help you  broadbent irrepressible never fear youre all descended from the ancient kings i know that complacently im not so tactless as you think my boy earnest again i expect to find miss reilly a perfect lady and i strongly advise you to come and have another look at her before you make up your mind about her by the way have you a photograph of her  doyle her photographs stopped at twentyfive  broadbent saddened ah yes i suppose so with feeling severely larry youve treated that poor girl disgracefully  doyle by george if she only knew that two men were talking about her like this  broadbent she wouldnt like it would she of course not we ought to be ashamed of ourselves larry more and more carried away by his new fancy you know i have a sort of presentiment that miss really is a very superior woman  doyle staring hard at him oh you have have you  broadbent yes i have there is something very touching about the history of this beautiful girl  doyle beau oho heres a chance for nora and for me calling hodson  hodson appearing at the bedroom door did you call sir  doyle pack for me too im going to ireland with mr broadbent  hodson right sir he retires into the bedroom  broadbent clapping doyle on the shoulder thank you old chap thank you    act ii  rosscullen westward a hillside of granite rock and heather slopes upward across the prospect from south to north a huge stone stands on it in a naturally impossible place as if it had been tossed up there by a giant over the brow in the desolate valley beyond is a round tower a lonely white high road trending away westward past the tower loses itself at the foot of the far mountains it is evening and there are great breadths of silken green in the irish sky the sun is setting  a man with the face of a young saint yet with white hair and perhaps 50 years on his back is standing near the stone in a trance of intense melancholy looking over the hills as if by mere intensity of gaze he could pierce the glories of the sunset and see into the streets of heaven he is dressed in black and is rather more clerical in appearance than most english curates are nowadays but he does not wear the collar and waistcoat of a parish priest he is roused from his trance by the chirp of an insect from a tuft of grass in a crevice of the stone his face relaxes he turns quietly and gravely takes off his hat to the tuft addressing the insect in a brogue which is the jocular assumption of a gentleman and not the natural speech of a peasant  the man an is that yourself misther grasshopper i hope i see you well this fine evenin  the grasshopper prompt and shrill in answer xx  the man encouragingly thats right i suppose now youve come out to make yourself miserable by admyerin the sunset  the grasshopper sadly xx  the man aye youre a thrue irish grasshopper  the grasshopper loudly xxx  the man three cheers for ould ireland is it that helps you to face out the

wickedness have you done to bring that curse on you here where are you jumpin to wheres your manners to go skyrocketin like that out o the box in the middle o your confession he threatens it with his stick  the grasshopper penitently x  the man lowering the stick i accept your apology but dont do it again and now tell me one thing before i let you go home to bed which would you say this counthry was hell or purgatory  the grasshopper x  the man hell faith im afraid youre right i wondher what you and me did when we were alive to get sent here  the grasshopper shrilly xx  the man nodding well as you say its a delicate subject and i wont press it on you now off widja  the grasshopper xx it springs away  the man waving his stick god speed you he walks away past the stone towards the brow of the hill immediately a young laborer his face distorted with terror slips round from behind the stone  the laborer crossing himself repeatedly oh glory be to god glory be to god oh holy mother an all the saints oh murdher murdher beside himself calling fadher keegan fadher keegan  the man turning whos there whats that he comes back and finds the laborer who clasps his knees patsy farrell what are

penance  patsy sure if you wont let it harm me im not afraid your riverence he gets up a little reassured he is a callow flaxen polled smoothfaced downy chinned lad fully grown but not yet fully filled out with blue eyes and an instinctively acquired air of helplessness and silliness indicating not his real character but a cunning developed by his constant dread of a hostile dominance which he habitually tries to disarm and tempt into unmasking by pretending to be a much greater fool than he really is englishmen think him halfwitted which is exactly what he intends them to think he is clad in corduroy trousers unbuttoned waistcoat and coarse blue striped shirt  keegan admonitorily patsy what did i tell you about callin me father keegan an your reverence what did father dempsey tell you about it  patsy yis fadher  keegan father  patsy desperately arra hwat am i to call you fadher dempsey sez youre not a priest n we all know youre not a man n how do we know what ud happen to us if we showed any disrespect to you n sure they say wanse a priest always a priest  keegan sternly its not for the like of you patsy to go behind the instruction of your parish priest and set yourself up to judge whether your church is right or wrong  patsy sure i know that sir  keegan the church let me be its priest as long as it thought me fit for its work when it took away my papers it meant you to know that i was only a poor madman unfit and unworthy to take charge of the souls of the people  patsy but wasnt it only because you knew more latn than father dempsey that he was jealous of you  keegan scolding him to keep himself from smiling how dar you patsy farrell put your own wicked little spites and foolishnesses into the heart of your priest for two pins id tell him what you just said  patsy coaxing sure you wouldnt  keegan wouldnt i god forgive you youre little better than a heathen  patsy deedn i am fadher its me bruddher the tinsmith in dublin youre thinkin of sure he had to be

yourself together for shame off widja to the road youll be late for the car if you dont make haste bustling him down the hill i can see the dust of it in the gap already  patsy the lord save us he goes down the hill towards the road like a haunted man  nora reilly comes down the hill a slight weak woman in a pretty muslin print gown her best she is a figure commonplace enough to irish eyes but on the inhabitants of fatterfed crowded hustling and bustling modern countries she makes a very different impression the absence of any symptoms of coarseness or hardness or appetite in her her comparative delicacy of manner and sensibility of apprehension her thin hands and slender figure her travel accent with the caressing plaintive irish melody of her speech give her a charm which is all the more effective because being untravelled she is unconscious of it and never dreams of deliberately dramatizing and exploiting it as the irishwoman in england does for tom broadbent therefore an attractive woman whom he would even call ethereal to larry doyle an everyday woman fit only for the eighteenth century helpless useless almost sexless an invalid without the excuse of disease an incarnation of everything in ireland that drove him out of it these judgments have little value and no finality but they are the judgments on which her fate hangs just at present keegan touches his hat to her he does not take it off  nora mr keegan i want to speak to you a minute if you dont mind  keegan dropping the broad irish vernacular of his speech to patsy an hour if you like miss reilly youre always welcome shall we sit down  nora thank you they sit on the heather she is shy and anxious but she comes to the point promptly because she can think of nothing else they say you did a gradle o travelling at one time  keegan well you see im not a mnooth man he means that he was not a student at maynooth college when i was young i admired the older generation of priests that had been educated in salamanca so when i felt sure of my vocation i went to salamanca then i walked from salamanca to rome an sted in a monastery there for a year my pilgrimage to rome taught me that walking is a better way of travelling than the train so i walked from rome to the sorbonne in paris and i wish i could have walked from paris to oxford for i was very sick on the sea after a year of oxford i had to walk to jerusalem to walk the oxford feeling off me from jerusalem i came back to patmos and spent six months at the monastery of mount athos from that i came to ireland and settled down as a parish priest until i went mad  nora startled oh dons say that  keegan why not dont you know the story how i confessed a black man and gave him absolution and how he put a spell on me and drove me mad  nora how can you talk such nonsense about yourself for shame  keegan its not nonsense at all its truein a way but never mind the black man now that you know what a travelled man i am what can i do for you she hesitates and plucks nervously at the heather he stays her hand gently dear miss nora dont pluck the little flower if it was a pretty baby you wouldnt want to pull its head off and stick it in a vawse o water to look at the grasshopper chirps keegan turns his head and addresses it in the vernacular be aisy me son she wont spoil the swingswong in your little three to nora resuming his urbane style you see im quite cracked but never mind im harmless now what is it  nora embarrassed oh only idle curiosity i wanted to know whether you found irelandi mean the country part of ireland of coursevery small and backwardlike when you came back to it from rome and oxford and all the great cities  keegan when i went to those great cities i saw wonders i had never seen in ireland but when i came back to ireland i found all the wonders there waiting for me you see they had been there all the time but my eyes had never been opened to them i did not know what my own house was like because i had never been outside it  nora dye think thats the same with everybody  keegan with everybody who has eyes in his soul as well as in his head  nora but really and truly now werent the people rather disappointing i should think the girls must have seemed rather coarse and dowdy after the foreign princesses and people but i suppose a priest wouldnt notice that  keegan its a priests business to notice everything i wont tell you all i noticed about women but ill tell you this the more a man knows and the farther he travels the more likely he is to marry a country girl afterwards  nora blushing with delight youre joking mr keegan im sure yar  keegan my way of joking is to tell the truth its the funniest joke in the world  nora incredulous galong with you  keegan springing up actively shall we go down to the road and meet the car she gives him her hand and he helps her up patsy farrell told me you were expecting young doyle  nora tossing her chin up at once oh im not expecting him particularly its a wonder hes come back at all after staying away eighteen years he can harly expect us to be very anxious to see him can he now  keegan well not anxious perhaps but you will be curious to see how much he has changed in all these years  nora with a sudden bitter flush i suppose thats all that brings him back to look at us just to see how much weve changed well he can wait and see me be candlelight i didnt come out to meet him im going to walk to the round tower going west across the hill  keegan you couldnt do better this fine evening gravely ill tell him where youve gone she turns as if to forbid him but the deep understanding in his eyes makes that impossible and she only looks at him earnestly and goes he watches her disappear on the other side of the hill then says aye hes come to torment you and youre driven already to torment him he shakes his head and goes slowly away across the hill in the opposite direction lost in thought  by this time the car has arrived and dropped three of its passengers on the high road at the foot of the hill it is a monster jaunting car black and dilapidated one of the last survivors of the public vehicles known to earlier generations as beeyankiny cars the irish having laid violent tongues on the name of their projector one bianconi an enterprising italian the three passengers are the parish priest father dempsey cornelius doyle larrys father and broadbent all in overcoats and as stiff as only an irish car could make them  the priest stout and fatherly falls far short of that finest type of countryside pastor which represents the genius of priesthood but he is equally far above the base type in which a strongminded and unscrupulous peasant uses the church to extort money power and privilege he is a priest neither by vocation nor ambition but because the life suits him he has boundless authority over his flock and taxes them stiffly enough to be a rich man the old protestant ascendency is now too broken to gall him on the whole an easygoing amiable even modest man as long as his dues are paid and his authority and dignity fully admitted  cornelius doyle is an elder of the small wiry type with a hardskinned rather worried face clean shaven except for sandy whiskers blanching into a lustreless pale yellow and quite white at the roots his dress is that of a countrytown titan of business that is an oldish shooting suit and elastic sided boots quite unconnected with shooting feeling shy with broadbent he is hasty which is his way of trying to appear genial  broadbent for reasons which will appear later has no luggage except a field glass and a guide book the other two have left theirs to the unfortunate patsy farrell who struggles up the hill after them loaded with a sack of potatoes a hamper a fat goose a colossal salmon and several paper parcels  cornelius leads the way up the hill with broadbent at his heels the priest follows and patsy lags laboriously behind  cornelius this is a bit of a climb mr broadbent but its shorter than goin round be the road  broadbent stopping to examine the great stone just a moment mr doyle i want to look at this stone it must be finians diecast  cornelius in blank bewilderment hwat  broadbent murray describes it one of your great national heroesi cant pronounce the namefinian somebody i think  father dempsey also perplexed and rather scandalized is it fin mccool you mean  broadbent i daresay it is referring to the guide book murray says that a huge stone probably of druidic origin is still pointed out as the die cast by fin in his celebrated match with the devil  cornelius dubiously jeuce a word i ever heard of it  father dempsey very seriously indeed and even a little severely dont believe any such nonsense sir there never was any such thing when people talk to you about fin mccool and the like take no notice of them its all idle stories and superstition  broadbent somewhat indignantly for to be rebuked by an irish priest for superstition is more than he can stand you dont suppose i believe it do you  father dempsey oh i thought you did dye see the top o the roun tower there thats an antiquity worth lookin at  broadbent deeply interested have you any theory as to what the round towers were for  father dempsey a little offended a theory me theories are connected in his mind with the late professor tyndall and with scientific scepticism generally also perhaps with the view that the round towers are phallic symbols  cornelius remonstrating father dempsey is the priest of the parish mr broadbent what would he be doing with a theory  father dempsey with gentle emphasis i have a knowledge of what the roun towers were if thats what you mean they are the forefingers of the early church pointing us all to god  patsy intolerably overburdened loses his balance and sits down involuntarily his burdens are scattered over the hillside cornelius and father dempsey turn furiously on him leaving broadbent beaming at the stone and the tower with fatuous interest  cornelius oh be the hokey the sammins broke in two you schoopid ass what dye mean  father dempsey are you drunk patsy farrell did i tell you to carry that hamper carefully or did i not  patsy rubbing the back of his head which has almost dented a slab of granite sure me fut slpt howkn i carry three mens luggage at wanst  father dempsey you were told to leave behind what you couldnt carry an go back for it  patsy an whose things was i to lave behind hwat would your reverence think if i left your hamper behind in the wet grass n hwat would the masther say if i left the sammin and the goose be the side o the road for annywan to pick up  cornelius oh youve a dale to say for yourself you buttherfingered omadhaun waitll ant judy sees the state o that sammin shell talk to you here gimme that birdn that fish there an take father dempseys hamper to his house for him n then come back for the rest  father dempsey do patsy and mind you dont fall down again  patsy sure i  cornelius bustling him up the bill whisht heres ant judy patsy goes grumbling in disgrace with father dempseys hamper  aunt judy comes down the hill a woman of 50 in no way remarkable lively and busy without energy or grip placid without tranquillity kindly without concern for others indeed without much concern for herself a contented product of a narrow strainless life she wears her hair parted in the middle and quite smooth with a fattened bun at the back her dress is a plain brown frock with a woollen pelerine of black and aniline mauve over her shoulders all very trim in honor of the occasion she looks round for larry is puzzled then stares incredulously at broadbent  aunt judy surely to goodness thats not you larry  cornelius arra how could he be larry woman alive  larrys in no hurry home it seems i havent set eyes on him this is his friend mr broadbent mr broadbent me sister judy  aunt judy hospitably going to broadbent and shaking

for tea he looks at his watch  aunt judy not a bit we never have it airlier than this i hope they gave you a good dinner at athenmullet  broadbent trying to conceal his consternation as he realizes that he is not going to get any dinner after his drive oherexcellent excellent by the way hadnt i better see about a room at the hotel they stare at him  cornelius the hotel  father dempsey hwat hotel  aunt judy indeedn youe not goin to a hotel youll stay with us id have put you into larrys room only the boys pallyass is too short for you but well make a comfortable bed for you on the sofa in the parlor  broadbent youre very kind miss doyle but really im ashamed to give you so much trouble unnecessarily i shant mind the hotel in the least  father dempsey man alive theres no hotel in rosscullen  broadbent no hotel why the driver told me there was the finest hotel in ireland here they regard him joylessly  aunt judy arra would you mind what the like of him would tell you sure hed say hwatever was the least trouble to himself and the pleasantest to you thinkin you might give him a thruppeny bit for himself or the like  broadbent perhaps theres a public house  father dempsey grimly theres seventeen  aunt judy ah then how could you stay at a public house theyd have no place to put you even if it was a right place for you to go come is it the sofa youre afraid of if it is you can have me own bed i can sleep with nora  broadbent not at all not at all i should be only too delighted but to upset your arrangements in this way  cornelius anxious to cut short the discussion which makes him ashamed of his house for he guesses broadbents standard of comfort a little more accurately than his sister does thats all right itll be no trouble at all hweres nora  aunt judy oh how do i know she slipped out a little while ago i thought she was goin to meet the car  cornelius dissatisfied its a queer thing of her to run out o the way at such a time  aunt judy sure shes a queer girl altogether come come in come in  father dempsey ill say goodnight mr broadbent if theres anything i can do for you in this parish let me know he shakes hands with broadbent  broadbent effusively cordial thank

business to do at home he turns to go and meets patsy farrell returning unloaded have you left that hamper for me  patsy yis your reverence  father dempsey thats a good lad going  patsy to aunt judy fadher keegan sez  father dempsey turning sharply on him whats that you say  patsy frightened fadher keegan  father dempsey how often have you heard me bid you call mister keegan in his proper name the same as i do father keegan indeed cant you tell the difference between your priest and any ole madman in a black coat  patsy sure im afraid he might put a spell on me  father dempsey wrathfully you mind what i tell you or ill put a spell on you thatll make you lep dye mind that now he goes home  patsy goes down the hill to retrieve the fish the bird and the sack  aunt judy ah hwy cant you hold your tongue patsy before father dempsey  patsy well what was i to do father keegan bid me tell you miss nora was gone to the roun tower  aunt judy an hwy couldnt you wait to tell us until father dempsey was gone  patsy i was afeerd o forgetn it and then maybe hed a sent the grasshopper or the little dark looker into me at night to remind me of it the dark looker is the common grey lizard which is supposed to walk down the throats of incautious sleepers and cause them to perish in a slow decline  cornelius yah you great gaum you widjer grasshoppers and dark lookers here take up them things and let me hear no more o your foolish lip patsy obeys you can take the sammin under your oxther he wedges the salmon into patsys axilla  patsy i can take the goose too sir put it on me back and gimme the neck of it in me mouth cornelius is about to comply thoughtlessly  aunt judy feeling that broadbents presence demands special punctiliousness for shame patsy to offer to take the goose in your mouth that we have to eat after you the masterll bring it in for you patsy abashed yet irritated by this ridiculous fastidiousness takes his load up the hill  cornelius what the jeuce does nora want to go to the roun tower for  aunt judy oh the lord knows romancin i suppose props she thinks larry would go there to look for her and see her safe home  broadbent im afraid its all the fault of my motor miss reilly must not be left to wait and walk home alone at night shall i go for her  aunt judy contemptuously arra hwat ud happen to her hurry in now corny come mr broadbent i left the tea on the hob to draw and itll be black if we dont go in an drink it  they go up the hill it is dark by this time  broadbent does not fare so badly after all at aunt judys board he gets not only tea and breadandbutter but more mutton chops than he has ever conceived it possible to eat at one sitting there is also a most filling substance called potato cake hardly have his fears of being starved been replaced by his first misgiving that he is eating too much and will be sorry for it tomorrow when his appetite is revived by the production of a bottle of illicitly distilled whisky called pocheen which he has read and dreamed of he calls it pottine and is now at last to taste his good humor rises almost to excitement before cornelius shows signs of sleepiness the contrast between aunt judys table service and that of the south and east coast hotels at which he spends his fridaystotuesdays when he is in london seems to him delightfully irish the almost total atrophy of any sense of enjoyment in cornelius or even any desire for it or toleration of the possibility of life being something better than a round of sordid worries relieved by tobacco punch fine mornings and petty successes in buying and selling passes with his guest as the whimsical affectation of a shrewd irish humorist and incorrigible spendthrift aunt judy seems to him an incarnate joke the likelihood that the joke will pall after a month or so and is probably not apparent at any time to born rossculleners or that he himself unconsciously entertains aunt judy by his fantastic english personality and english mispronunciations does not occur to him for a moment in the end he is so charmed and so loth to go to bed and perhaps dream of prosaic england that he insists on going out to smoke a cigar and look for nora reilly at the round tower not that any special insistence is needed for the english inhibitive instinct does not seem to exist in rosscullen just as noras liking to miss a meal and stay out at the round tower is accepted as a sufficient reason for her doing it and for the family going to bed and leaving the door open for her so broadbents whim to go out for a late stroll provokes neither hospitable remonstrance nor surprise indeed aunt judy wants to get rid of him whilst she makes a bed for him on the sofa so off he goes full fed happy and enthusiastic to explore the valley by moonlight  the round tower stands about half an irish mile from rosscullen some fifty yards south of the road on a knoll with a circle of wild greensward on it the road once ran over this knoll but modern engineering has tempered the level to the beeyankiny car by carrying the road partly round the knoll and partly through a cutting so that the way from the road to the tower is a footpath up the embankment through furze and brambles  on the edge of this slope at the top of the path nora is straining her eyes in the moonlight watching for larry at last she gives it up with a sob of impatience and retreats to the hoary foot of the tower where she sits down discouraged and cries a little then she settles herself resignedly to wait and hums a songnot an irish melody but a hackneyed english drawingroom ballad of the season before lastuntil some slight noise suggests a footstep when she springs up eagerly and runs to the edge of the slope again some moments of silence and suspense follow broken by unmistakable footsteps she gives a little gasp as she sees a man approaching  nora is that you larry frightened a little whos that  broadbents voice from below on the path dont be alarmed  nora oh what an english accent youve got  broadbent rising into view i must introduce myself  nora violently startled retreating its not you who are you what do you want  broadbent advancing im really so sorry to have alarmed you miss reilly my name is broadbent larrys friend you know  nora chilled and has mr doyle not come with you  broadbent no ive come instead i hope i am not unwelcome  nora deeply mortified im sorry mr doyle should have given you the trouble im sure  broadbent you see as a stranger and an englishman i thought it would be interesting to see the round tower by moonlight  nora oh you came to see the tower i thoughtconfused trying to recover her manners oh of course i was so startledits a beautiful night isnt it  broadbent lovely i must explain why larry has not come himself  nora why should he come hes seen the tower often enough its no attraction to him genteelly an what do you think of ireland mr broadbent have you ever been here before  broadbent never  nora an how do you like it  broadbent suddenly betraying a condition of extreme sentimentality i can hardly trust myself to say how much i like it the magic of this irish scene andi really dont want to be personal miss reilly but the charm of your irish voice  nora quite accustomed to gallantry and attaching no seriousness whatever to it oh get along with you mr broadbent youre breaking your heart about me already i daresay after seeing me for two minutes in the dark  broadbent the voice is just as beautiful in the dark you know besides ive heard a great deal about you from larry  nora with bitter indifference have you now well thats a great honor im sure  broadbent i have looked forward to meeting you more than to anything else in ireland  nora ironically dear me did you now  broadbent i did really i wish you had taken half as much interest in me  nora oh i was dying to see you of course i daresay you can imagine the sensation an englishman like you would make among us poor irish people  broadbent ah now youre chaffing me miss reilly you know you are you mustnt chaff me im very much in earnest about ireland and everything irish im very much in earnest about you and about larry  nora larry has nothing to do with me mr broadbent  broadbent if i really thought that miss reilly i shouldwell i should let myself feel that charm of which i spoke just now more deeply than ithan i  nora is it making love to me you are  broadbent scared and much upset on my word i believe i am miss reilly if you say that to me again i shant answer for myself all the harps of ireland are in your voice she laughs at him he suddenly loses his head and seizes her arms to her great indignation stop laughing do you hear i am in earnestin english earnest when i say a thing like that to a woman i mean it releasing her and trying to recover his ordinary manner in spite of his bewildering emotion i beg your pardon  nora how dare you touch me  broadbent there are not many things i would not dare for you that does not sound right perhaps but i reallyhe stops and passes his hand over his forehead rather lost  nora i think you ought to be ashamed i think if you were a gentleman and me alone with you in this place at night you would die rather than do such a thing  broadbent you mean that its an act of treachery to larry  nora deed i dont what has larry to do with it its an act of disrespect and rudeness to me it shows what you take me for you can go your way now and ill go mine goodnight mr broadbent  broadbent no please miss reilly one moment listen to me im serious im desperately serious tell me that im interfering with larry and ill go straight from this spot back to london and never see you again thats on my honor i will am i interfering with him  nora answering in spite of herself in a sudden spring of bitterness i should think you ought to know better than me whether youre interfering with him youve seen him oftener than i have you know him better than i do by this time youve come to me quicker than he has havent you  broadbent im bound to tell you miss reilly that larry has not arrived in rosscullen yet he meant to get here before me but his car broke down and he may not arrive until tomorrow  nora her face lighting up is that the truth  broadbent yes thats the truth she gives a sigh of relief youre glad of that  nora up in arms at once glad indeed why should i be glad as weve waited eighteen years for him we can afford to wait a day longer i should think  broadbent if you really feel like that about him there may be a chance for another man yet eh  nora deeply offended i suppose people are different in england mr broadbent so perhaps you dont mean any harm in ireland nobodyd mind what a mand say in fun nor take advantage of what a woman might say in answer to it if a woman couldnt talk to a man for two minutes at their first meeting without being treated the way youre treating me no decent woman would ever talk to a man at all  broadbent i dont understand that i dont admit that i am sincere and my intentions are perfectly honorable i think you will accept the fact that im an englishman as a guarantee that i am not a man to act hastily or romantically though i confess that your voice had such an extraordinary effect on me just now when you asked me so quaintly whether i was making love to you  nora flushing i never thought  broadhhnt quickly of course you didnt im not so stupid as that but i couldnt bear your laughing at the feeling it gave me youagain struggling with a surge of emotion you dont know what i he chokes for a moment and then blurts out with unnatural steadiness will you be my wife  nora promptly deed i wont the idea looking at him more carefully arra come home mr broadbent and get your senses back again i think youre not accustomed to potcheen punch in the evening after your tea  broadbent horrified do you mean to say that iiimy god that i appear drunk to you miss reilly  nora compassionately how many tumblers had you  broadbent helplessly two  nora the flavor of the turf prevented you noticing the strength of it youd better come home to bed  broadbent fearfully agitated but this is such a horrible doubt to put into my mindtotofor heavens sake miss reilly am i really drunk  nora soothingly youll be able to judge better in the morning come on now back with me an think no more about it she takes his arm with motherly solicitude and urges him gently toward the path  broadbent yielding in despair i must be drunkfrightfully drunk for your voice drove me out of my senses he stumbles over a stone no on my word on my most sacred word of honor miss reilly i tripped over that stone it was an accident it was indeed  nora yes of course it was just take my arm mr broadbent while were goin down the path to the road youll be all right then  broadbent submissively taking it i cant sufficiently apologize miss reilly or express my sense of your kindness when i am in such a disgusting state how could i be such a bea he trips again damn the heather my foot caught in it  nora steady now steady come along come he is led down to the road in the character of a convicted drunkard to him there it something divine in the sympathetic indulgence she substitutes for the angry disgust with which one of his own countrywomen would resent his supposed condition and he has no suspicion of the fact or of her ignorance of it that when an englishman is sentimental he behaves very much as an irishman does when he is drunk    act iii  next morning broadbent and larry are sitting at the ends of a breakfast table in the middle of a small grass plot before cornelius doyles house they have finished their meal and are buried in newspapers most of the crockery is crowded upon a large square black tray of japanned metal the teapot is of brown delft ware there is no silver and the butter on a dinner plate is en bloc the background to this breakfast is the house a small white slated building accessible by a halfglazed door a person coming out into the garden by this door would find the table straight in front of him and a gate leading to the road half way down the garden on his right or if he turned sharp to his left he could pass round the end of the house through an unkempt shrubbery the mutilated remnant of a huge planter statue nearly dissolved by the rains of a century and vaguely resembling a majestic female in roman draperies with a wreath in her hand stands neglected amid the laurels such statues though apparently works of art grow naturally in irish gardens their germination is a mystery to the oldest inhabitants to whose means and taste they are totally foreign  there is a rustic bench much roiled by the birds and decorticated and split by the weather near the little gate at the opposite side a basket lies unmolested because it might as well be there as anywhere else an empty chair at the table was lately occupied by cornelius who has finished his breakfast and gone in to the room in which he receives rents and keeps his books and cash known in the household as the office this chair like the two occupied by larry and broadbent has a mahogany frame and is upholstered in black horsehair  larry rises and goes off through the shrubbery with his newspaper hodson comes in through the garden gate disconsolate broadbent who sits facing the gate augurs the worst from his expression  broadbent have you been to the village  hodson no use sir well have to get everything from london by parcel post  broadbent i hope they made you comfortable last night  hodson i was no worse than you were on that sofa sir one expects to rough it here sir  broadbent we shall have to look out for some other arrangement cheering up irrepressibly still its no end of a joke how do you like the irish hodson  hodson well sir theyre all right anywhere but in their own country ive known lots of em in england and generally liked em but here sir i seem simply to hate em the feeling come over me the moment we landed at cork sir its no use my pretendin sir i cant bear em my mind rises up agin their ways somehow they rub me the wrong way all over  broadbent oh their faults are on the surface at heart they are one of the finest races on earth hodson turns away without affecting to respond to his enthusiasm by the way hodson  hodson turning yes sir  broadbent did you notice anything about me last night when i came in with that lady  hodson surprised no sir  broadbent not anyer you may speak frankly  hodson i didnt notice nothing sir what sort of thing ded you mean sir  broadbent wellererwell to put it plainly was i drunk  hodson amazed no sir  broadbent quite sure  hodson well i should a said rather the opposite sir usually when youve been enjoying yourself youre a bit hearty like last night you seemed rather low if anything  broadbent i certainly have no headache did you try the pottine hodson  hodson i just took a mouthful sir it tasted of peat oh something horrid sir the people here call peat turf potcheen and strong porter is what they like sir im sure i dont know how they can stand it give me beer i say  broadbent by the way you told me i couldnt have porridge for breakfast but mr doyle had some  hodson yes sir very sorry sir they call it stirabout sir thats how it was they know no better sir  broadbent all right ill have some tomorrow  hodson goes to the house when he opens the door he finds nora and aunt judy on the threshold he stands aside to let them pass with the air of a well trained servant oppressed by heavy trials then he goes in broadbent rises aunt judy goes to the table and collects the plates and cups on the tray nora goes to the back of the rustic seat and looks out at the gate with the air of a woman accustomed to have nothing to do larry returns from the shrubbery  broadbent good morning miss doyle  aunt judy thinking it absurdly late in the day for such a salutation oh good morning before moving his plate have you done  broadbent quite thank you you must excuse us for not waiting for you the country air tempted us to get up early  aunt judy n dye call this airly god help you  larry aunt judy probably breakfasted about half past six  aunt judy whisht youdraggin the parlor chairs out into the gardn n givin mr broadbent his death over his meals out here in the cold air to broadbent why dye put up with his foolishness mr broadbent  broadbent i assure you i like the open air  aunt judy ah galong how can you like whats not natural i hope you slept well  nora did anything wake yup with a thump at three oclock i thought the house was falling but then im a very light sleeper  larry i seem to recollect that one of the legs of the sofa in the parlor had a way of coming out unexpectedly eighteen years ago was that it tom  broadbent hastily oh it doesnt matter i was not hurtat leaster  aunt judy oh now what a shame an i told patsy farrll to put a nail in it  broadbent he did miss doyle there was a nail certainly  aunt judy dear oh dear  an oldish peasant farmer small leathery peat faced with a deep voice and a surliness that is meant to be aggressive and is in effect patheticthe voice of a man of hard life and many sorrowscomes in at the gate he is old enough to have perhaps worn a long tailed frieze coat and knee breeches in his time but now he is dressed respectably in a black frock coat tall hat and pollard colored trousers and his face is as clean as washing can make it though that is not saying much as the habit is recently acquired and not yet congenial  the newcomer at the gate god save all here he comes a little way into the garden  larry patronizingly speaking across the garden to him is that yourself mat haffigan do you remember me  matthew intentionally rude and blunt no who are you  nora oh im sure you remember him mr haffigan  matthew grudgingly admitting it i suppose hell be young larry doyle that was  larry yes  matthew to larry i hear you done well in america  larry fairly well  matthew i suppose you saw me brother andy out dhere  larry no its such a big place that looking for a man there is like looking for a needle in a bundle of hay they tell me hes a great man out there  matthew so he is god be praised wheres your father  aunt judy hes inside in the office mr haffigan with barney doarn n father dempsey  matthew without wasting further words on the company goes curtly into the house  larry staring after him is anything wrong with old mat  nora no hes the same as ever why  larry hes not the same to me he used to be very civil to master larry a deal too civil i used to think now hes as surly and standoff as a bear  aunt judy oh sure hes bought his farm in the land purchase hes independent now  nora its made a great change larry youd harly know the old tenants now youd think it was a liberty to speak tdhemsome o dhem she goes to the table and helps to take off the cloth which she and aunt judy fold up between them  aunt judy i wonder what he wants to see corny for he hasnt been here since he paid the last of his old rent and then he as good as threw it in cornys face i thought  larry no wonder of course they all hated us like the devil ugh moodily ive seen them in that office telling my father what a fine boy i was and plastering him with compliments with your honor here and your honor there when all the time their fingers were itching to beat his throat  aunt judy deedn why should they want to hurt poor corny it was he that got mat the lease of his farm and stood up for him as an industrious decent man  broadbent was he industrious thats remarkable you know in an irishman  larry industrious that mans industry used to make me sick even as a boy i tell you an irish peasants industry is not human its worse than the industry of a coral insect an englishman has some sense about working he never does more than he can helpand hard enough to get him to do that without scamping it but an irishman will work as if hed die the moment he stopped that man matthew haffigan and his brother andy made a farm out of a patch of stones on the hillsidecleared it and dug it with their own naked hands and bought their first spade out of their first crop of potatoes talk of making two blades of wheat grow where one grew before those two men made a whole field of wheat grow where not even a furze bush had ever got its head up between the stones  broadbent that was magnificent you know only a great race is capable of producing such men  larry such fools you mean what good was it to them the moment theyd done it the landlord put a rent of 5 pounds a year on them and turned them out because they couldnt pay it  aunt judy why couldnt they pay as well as billy byrne that took it after them  larry angrily you know very well that billy byrne never paid it he only offered it to get possession he never paid it  aunt judy that was because andy haffigan hurt him with a brick so that he was never the same again andy had to run away to america for it  broadbent glowing with indignation who can blame him miss doyle who can blame him  larry impatiently oh rubbish whats the good of the man thats starved out of a farm murdering the man thats starved into it would you have done such a thing  broadbent yes iiiistammering with fury i should have shot the confounded landlord and wrung the neck of the damned agent and blown the farm up with dynamite and dublin castle along with it  larry oh yes youd have done great things and a fat lot of good youd have got out of it too thats an englishman all over make bad laws and give away all the land and then when your economic incompetence produces its natural and inevitable results get virtuously indignant and kill the people that carry out your laws  aunt judy sure never mind him mr broadbent it doesnt matter anyhow because theres harly any landlords left and therll soon be none at all  larry on the contrary therll soon be nothing else and the lord help ireland then  aunt judy ah youre never satisfied larry to nora come on alanna an make the paste for the pie we can leave them to their talk they dont want us she takes up the tray and goes into the house  broadbent rising and gallantly protesting oh miss doyle really really  nora following aunt judy with the rolledup cloth in her hands looks at him and strikes him dumb he watches her until she disappears then comes to larry and addresses him with sudden intensity  broadbent larry  larry what is it  broadbent i got drunk last night and proposed to miss reilly  larry you hwat he screams with laughter in the falsetto irish register unused for that purpose in england  broadbent what are you laughing at  larry stopping dead i dont know thats the sort of thing an irishman laughs at has she accepted you  broadbent i shall never forget that with the chivalry of her nation though i was utterly at her mercy she refused me  larry that was extremely improvident of her beginning to reflect but look here when were you drunk you were sober enough when you came back from the round tower with her  broadbent no larry i was drunk i am sorry to say i had two tumblers of punch she had to lead me home you must have noticed it  larry i did not  broadbent she did  larry may i ask how long it took you to come to business you can hardly have known her for more than a couple of hours  broadbent i am afraid it was hardly a couple of minutes she was not here when i arrived and i saw her for the first time at the tower  larry well you are a nice infant to be let loose in this country fancy the potcheen going to your head like that  broadbent not to my head i think i have no headache and i could speak distinctly no potcheen goes to the heart not to the head what ought i to do  larry nothing what need you do  broadbent there is rather a delicate moral question involved the point is was i drunk enough not to be morally responsible for my proposal or was i sober enough to be bound to repeat it now that i am undoubtedly sober  larry i should see a little more of her before deciding  broadbent no no that would not be right that would not be fair i am either under a moral obligation or i am not i wish i knew how drunk i was  larry well you were evidently in a state of blithering sentimentality anyhow  broadbent that is true larry i admit it her voice has a most extraordinary effect on me that irish voice  larry sympathetically yes i know when i first went to london i very nearly proposed to walk out with a waitress in an aerated bread shop because her whitechapel accent was so distinguished so quaintly touching so pretty  broadbent angrily miss reilly is not a waitress is she  larry oh come the waitress was a very nice girl  broadbent you think every englishwoman an angel you really have coarse tastes in that way larry miss reilly is one of the finer types a type rare in england except perhaps in the best of the aristocracy  larry aristocracy be blowed do you know what nora eats  broadbent eats what do you mean  larry breakfast tea and breadandbutter with an occasional rasher and an egg on special occasions say on her birthday dinner in the middle of the day one course and nothing else in the evening tea and breadandbutter again you compare her with your englishwomen who wolf down from three to five meat meals a day and naturally you find her a sylph the difference is not a difference of type its the difference between the woman who eats not wisely but too well and the woman who eats not wisely but too little  broadbent furious larry youyouyou disgust me you are a damned fool he sits down angrily on the rustic seat which sustains the shock with difficulty  larry steady steadeee he laughs and seats himself on the table  cornelius doyle father dempsey barney doran and matthew haffigan come from the house doran is a stout bodied short armed roundheaded redhaired man on the verge of middle age of sanguine temperament with an enormous capacity for derisive obscene blasphemous or merely cruel and senseless fun and a violent and impetuous intolerance of other temperaments and other opinions all this representing energy and capacity wasted and demoralized by want of sufficient training and social pressure to force it into beneficent activity and build a character with it for barney is by no means either stupid or weak he is recklessly untidy as to his person but the worst effects of his neglect are mitigated by a powdering of flour and mill dust and his unbrushed clothes made of a fashionable tailors sackcloth were evidently chosen regardless of expense for the sake of their appearance  matthew haffigan ill at ease coasts the garden shyly on the shrubbery side until he anchors near the basket where he feels least in the way the priest comes to the table and slaps larry on the shoulder larry turning quickly and recognizing father dempsey alights from the table and shakes the priests hand warmly doran comes down the garden between father dempsey and matt and cornelius on the other side of the table turns to broadbent who rises genially  cornelius i think we all met las night  doran i hadnt that pleasure  cornelius to be sure barney i forgot to broadbent introducing barney mr doran he owns that fine mill you noticed from the car  broadbent delighted with them all most happy mr doran very pleased indeed  doran not quite sure whether he is being courted or patronized nods independently  doran hows yourself larry  larry finely thank you no need to ask you doran grins and they shake hands  cornelius give father dempsey a chair larry  matthew haffigan runs to the nearest end of the table and takes the chair from it placing it near the basket but larry has already taken the chair from the other end and placed it in front of the table father dempsey accepts that more central position  cornelius sit down barney will you and you mat  doran takes the chair mat is still offering to the priest and poor matthew outfaced by the miller humbly turns the basket upside down and sits on it cornelius brings his own breakfast chair from the table and sits down on father dempseys right broadbent resumes his seat on the rustic bench larry crosses to the bench and is about to sit down beside him when broadbent holds him off nervously  broadbent do you think it will bear two larry  larry perhaps not dont move ill stand he posts himself behind the bench  they are all now seated except larry and the session assumes a portentous air as if something important were coming  cornelius props youll explain father dempsey  father dempsey no no go on you the church has no politics  cornelius were yever thinkin o goin into parliament at all larry  larry me  father dempsey encouragingly yes you hwy not  larry im afraid my ideas would not be popular enough  cornelius i dont know that do you barney  doran theres too much blatherumskite in irish politics a dale too much  larry but what about your present member is he going to retire  cornelius no i dont know that he is  larry interrogatively well then  matthew breaking out with surly bitterness weve had enough of his foolish talk agen lanlords hwat call has he to talk about the lan that never was outside of a city office in his life  cornelius were tired of him he doesnt know hwere to stop every man cant own land and some men must own it to employ them it was all very well when solid men like doran and me and mat were kep from ownin land but hwat man in his senses ever wanted to give land to patsy farrll an

for more dhan the farm i made wid me own hans tell me that corny doyle and you that knows was i fit for the responsibility or was i not snarling angrily at cornelius am i to be compared to patsy

hwat did you mane be talkin about givin him lan  doran aisy mat aisy youre like a bear with a sore back  matthew trembling with rage an who are you to offer to taitch me manners  father dempsey admonitorily now now now mat none o dhat how often have i told you youre too ready to take offence where none is meant you dont understand corny doyle is saying just what you want to have said to cornelius go on mr doyle and never mind him  matthew rising well if me lan is to be given to patsy and his like im goin oura dhis i  doran with violent impatience arra whos goin to give your lan to

matthew appalled dont say dhat fadher dempsey i never had a thought agen you or the holy church i know im a bit hasty when i think about the lan i ax your pardn for it  father dempsey resuming his seat with dignified reserve very well ill overlook it this time he sits down the others sit down except matthew father dempsey about to ask corny to proceed remembers matthew and turns to him giving him just a crumb of graciousness sit down mat matthew crushed sits down in disgrace and is silent his eyes shifting piteously from one speaker to another in an intensely mistrustful effort to understand them go on mr doyle we can make allowances go on  cornelius well you see how it is larry round about here weve got the land at last and we want no more goverment meddlin we want a new class o man in parliament one dhat knows dhat the farmers the real backbone o the country n doesnt care a snap of his fingers for the shoutn o the riffraff in the towns or for the foolishness of the laborers  doran aye an dhat can afford to live in london and pay his own way until home rule comes instead o wantin subscriptions and the like  father dempsey yes thats a good point barney when too much money goes to politics its the church that has to starve for it a member of parliament ought to be a help to the church instead of a burden on it  larry heres a chance for you tom what do you say  broadbent deprecatory but important and smiling oh i have no claim whatever to the seat besides im a saxon  doran a hwat  broadbent a saxon an englishman  doran an englishman bedad i never heard it called dhat before  matthew cunningly if i might make so bould fadher i wouldnt say but an english prodestn mightnt have a more indepindent mind about the lan an be less afeerd to spake out about it dhan an irish catholic  cornelius but sure larrys as good as english arent you larry  larry you may put me out of your head father once for all  cornelius arra why  larry i have strong opinions which wouldnt suit you  doran rallying him blatantly is it still larry the bould fenian  larry no the bold fenian is now an older and possibly foolisher man  cornelius hwat does it matter to us hwat your opinions are you know that your fathers bought his farm just the same as mat here n barneys mill all we ask now is to be let alone youve nothin against that have you  larry certainly i have i dont believe in letting anybody or anything alone  cornelius losing his temper arra what dye mean you young fool here ive got you the offer of a good seat in parliament n you think yourself mighty smart to stand there and talk foolishness to me will you take it or leave it  larry very well ill take it with pleasure if youll give it to me  cornelius subsiding sulkily well why couldnt you say so at once its a good job youve made up your mind at last  doran suspiciously stop a bit stop a bit  matthew writhing between his dissatisfaction and his fear of the priest its not because hes your son that hes to get the sate fadher dempsey wouldnt you think well to ask him what he manes about the lan  larry coming down on mat promptly ill tell you mat i always thought it was a stupid lazy goodfornothing sort of thing to leave the land in the hands of the old landlords without calling them to a strict account for the use they made of it and the condition of the people on it i could see for myself that they thought of nothing but what they could get out of it to spend in england and that they mortgaged and mortgaged until hardly one of them owned his own property or could have afforded to keep it up decently if hed wanted to but i tell you plump and plain mat that if anybody thinks things will be any better now that the land is handed over to a lot of little men like you without calling you to account either theyre mistaken  matthew sullenly what call have you to look down on me i suppose you think youre everybody because your father was a land agent  larry what call have you to look down on patsy farrell i suppose you think youre everybody because you own a few fields  matthew was patsy farrll ever ill used as i was ill used tell me dhat  larry he will be if ever he gets into your power as you were in the power of your old landlord do you think because youre poor and ignorant and halfcrazy with toiling and moiling morning noon and night that youll be any less greedy and oppressive to them that have no land at all than old nick lestrange who was an educated travelled gentleman that would not have been tempted as hard by a hundred pounds as youd be by five shillings nick was too high above patsy farrell to be jealous of him but you that are only one little step above him would die sooner than let him come up that step and well you know it  matthew black with rage in a low growl lemme oura this he tries to rise but doran catches his coat and drags him down again im goin i say raising his voice leggo me coat barney doran  doran sit down yowl omadhaun you whispering dont you want to stay an vote against him  father dempsey holding up his finger mat mat subsides now now now come come hwats all dhis about patsy farrll hwy need you fall out about him  larry because it was by using patsys poverty to undersell england in the markets of the world that we drove england to ruin ireland and shell ruin us again the moment we lift our heads from the dust if we trade in cheap labor and serve us right too if i get into parliament ill try to get an act to prevent any of you from giving patsy less than a pound a week they all start hardly able to believe their ears or working him harder than youd work a horse that cost you fifty guineas  doran hwat  cornelius aghast a pound agod save us the boys mad  matthew feeling that here is something quite beyond his powers turns openmouthed to the priest as if looking for nothing less than the summary excommunication of larry  larry how is the man to marry and live a decent life on less  father dempsey man alive hwere have you been living all these years and hwat have you been dreaming of why some o dhese honest men here cant make that much out o the land for themselves much less give it to a laborer  larry now thoroughly roused then let them make room for those who can is ireland never to have a chance first she was given to the rich and now that they have gorged on her flesh her bones are to be flung to the poor that can do nothing but suck the marrow out of her if we cant have men of honor own the land lets have men of ability if we cant have men with ability let us at least have men with capital anybodys better than mat who has neither honor nor ability nor capital nor anything but mere brute labor and greed in him heaven help him  doran well were not all foostherin oul doddherers like mat pleasantly to the subject of this description are we mat  larry for modern industrial purposes you might just as well be barney youre all children the big world that i belong to has gone past you and left you anyhow we irishmen were never made to be farmers and well never do any good at it were like the jews the almighty gave us brains and bid us farm them and leave the clay and the worms alone  father dempsey with gentle irony oh is it jews you want to make of us i must catechize you a bit meself i think the next thing youll be proposing is to repeal the disestablishment of the socalled irish church  larry yes why not sensation  matthew rancorously hes a turncoat  larry st peter the rock on which our church was built was crucified head downwards for being a turncoat  father dempsey with a quiet authoritative dignity which checks doran who is on the point of breaking out thats true you hold your tongue as befits your ignorance matthew haffigan and trust your priest to deal with this young man now larry doyle whatever the blessed st peter was crucified for it was not for being a prodestan are you one  larry no i am a catholic intelligent enough to see that the protestants are never more dangerous to us than when they are free from all alliances with the state the socalled irish church is stronger today than ever it was  matthew fadher dempsey will you tell him dhat me mothers ant was shot and kilt dead in the sthreet o rosscullen be a soljer in the tithe war frantically he wants to put the tithes on us again he  larry interrupting him with overbearing contempt put the tithes on you again did the tithes ever come off you was your land any dearer when you paid the tithe to the parson than it was when you paid the same money to nick lestrange as rent and he handed it over to the church sustentation fund will you always be duped by acts of parliament that change nothing but the necktie of the man that picks your pocket ill tell you what id do with you mat haffigan id make you pay tithes to your own church i want the catholic church established in ireland thats what i want do you think that i brought up to regard myself as the son of a great and holy church can bear to see her begging her bread from the ignorance and superstition of men like you i would have her as high above worldly want as i would have her above worldly pride or ambition aye and i would have ireland compete with rome itself for the chair of st peter and the citadel of the church for rome in spite of all the blood of the martyrs is pagan at heart to this day while in ireland the people is the church and the church the people  father dempsey startled but not at all displeased whisht man youre worse than mad pether keegan himself  broadbent who has listened in the greatest astonishment you amaze me larry who would have thought of your coming out like this solemnly but much as i appreciate your really brilliant eloquence i implore you not to desert the great liberal principle of disestablishment  larry i am not a liberal heaven forbid a disestablished church is the worst tyranny a nation can groan under  broadbent making a wry face dont be paradoxical larry it really gives me a pain in my stomach  larry youll soon find out the truth of it here look at father dempsey he is disestablished he has nothing to hope or fear from the state and the result is that hes the most powerful man in rosscullen the member for rosscullen would shake in his shoes if father dempsey looked crooked at him father dempsey smiles by no means averse to this acknowledgment of his authority look at yourself you would defy the established archbishop of canterbury ten times a day but catch you daring to say a word that would shock a nonconformist not you the conservative party today is the only one thats not priestriddenexcuse the expression father father dempsey nods tolerantlycause its the only one that has established its church and can prevent a clergyman becoming a bishop if hes not a statesman as well as a churchman  he stops they stare at him dumbfounded and leave it to the priest to answer him  father dempsey judicially young man youll not be the member for rosscullen but theres more in your head than the comb will take out  larry im sorry to disappoint you father but i told you it would be no use and now i think the candidate had better retire and leave you to discuss his successor he takes a newspaper from the table and goes away through the shrubbery amid dead silence all turning to watch him until he passes out of sight round the corner of the house  doran dazed hwat sort of a fella is he at all at all  father dempsey hes a clever lad theres the making of a man in him yet  matthew in consternation dye mane to say dhat yll put him into parliament to bring back nick lesthrange on me and to put tithes on me and to rob me for the like o patsy farrll because hes corny doyles only son  doran brutally arra hould your

know you mean well an im not angry with you  broadbent surely mr haffigan you can see the simple explanation of all this my friend larry doyle is a most brilliant speaker but hes a tory an ingrained oldfashioned tory  cornelius n how dye make dhat out if i might ask you mr broadbent  broadbent collecting himself for a political deliverance well you know mr doyle theres a strong dash of toryism in the irish character larry himself says that the great duke of wellington was the most typical irishman that ever lived of course thats an absurd paradox but still theres a great deal of truth in it now i am a liberal you know the great principles of the liberal party peace  father dempsey piously hear hear  broadbent encouraged thank you retrenchmenthe waits for further applause  matthew timidly what might rethrenchment mane now  broadbent it means an immense reduction in the burden of the rates and taxes  matthew respectfully approving dhats right dhats right sir  broadbent perfunctorily and of course reform    cornelius        father dempsey conventionally of course   doran           matthew still suspicious hwat does reform mane sir does it mane altherin annythin dhats as it is now  broadbent impressively it means mr haffigan maintaining those reforms which have already been conferred on humanity by the liberal party and trusting for future developments to the free activity of a free people on the basis of those reforms  doran dhats right no more meddlin were all right now all we want is to be let alone  cornelius hwat about home rule  broadbent rising so as to address them more imposingly i really cannot tell you what i feel about home rule without using the language of hyperbole  doran savin fadher dempseys presence eh  broadbent not understanding him quite soeroh yes all i can say is that as an englishman i blush for the union it is the blackest stain on our national history i look forward to the timeand it cannot be far distant gentlemen because humanity is looking forward to it too and insisting on it with no uncertain voicei look forward to the time when an irish legislature shall arise once more on the emerald pasture of college green and the union jackthat detestable symbol of a decadent imperialismbe replaced by a flag as green as the island over which it wavesa flag on which we shall ask for england only a modest quartering in memory of our great party and of the immortal name of our grand old leader  doran enthusiastically dhats the style begob he smites his knee and winks at mat  matthew more power to you sir  broadbent i shall leave you now gentlemen to your deliberations i should like to have enlarged on the services rendered by the liberal party to the religious faith of the great majority of the people of ireland but i shall content myself with saying that in my opinion you should choose no representative whono matter what his personal creed may beis not an ardent supporter of freedom of conscience and is not prepared to prove it by contributions as lavish as his means will allow to the great and beneficent work which you father dempsey father dempsey bows are doing for the people of rosscullen nor should the lighter but still most important question of the sports of the people be forgotten the local cricket club  cornelius the hwat  doran nobody plays bats ball here if dhats what you mean  broadbent well let us say quoits i saw two men i think last nightbut after all these are questions of detail the main thing is that your candidate whoever he may be shall be a man of some means able to help the locality instead of burdening it and if he were a countryman of my own the moral effect on the house of commons would be immense tremendous pardon my saying these few words nobody feels their impertinence more than i do good morning gentlemen  he turns impressively to the gate and trots away congratulating himself with a little twist of his head and cock of his eye on having done a good stroke of political business  haffigan awestruck good morning sir  the rest good morning they watch him vacantly until he is out of earshot  cornelius hwat dye think father dempsey  father dempsey indulgently well he hasnt much sense god help him but for the matter o that neither has our present member  doran arra musha hes good enough for parliament what is there to do there but gas a bit an chivy the goverment an vote wi dh irish party  cornelius ruminatively hes the queerest englishman i ever met when he opened the paper dhis mornin the first thing he saw was that an english expedition had been bet in a battle in inja somewhere an he was as pleased as punch larry told him that if hed been alive when the news o waterloo came hed a died o grief over it bedad i dont think hes quite right in his head  doran divil a matther if he has plenty o money hell do for us right enough  matthew deeply impressed by broadbent and unable to understand their levity concerning him did you mind what he said about rethrenchment that was very good i thought  father dempsey you might find out from larry corny what his means are god forgive us all its poor work spoiling the egyptians though we have good warrant for it so id like to know how much spoil there is before i commit meself he rises they all rise respectfully  cornelius ruefully id set me mind on larry himself for the seat but i suppose it cant be helped  father dempsey consoling him well the boys young yet an he has a head on him goodbye all he goes out through the gate  doran i must be goin too he directs corneliuss attention to what is

still in hand comes back through the shrubbery broadbent returns through the gate  larry well what has happened  broadbent hugely selfsatisfied i think ive done the trick this time i just gave them a bit of straight talk and it went home they were greatly impressed everyone of those men believes in me and will vote for me when the question of selecting a candidate comes up after all whatever you say larry they like an englishman they feel they can trust him i suppose  larry oh theyve transferred the honor to you have they  broadbent complacently well it was a pretty obvious move i should think you know these fellows have plenty of shrewdness in spite of their irish oddity hodson comes from the house larry sits in dorans chair and reads oh by the way hodson  hodson coming between broadbent and larry yes sir  broadbent i want you to be rather particular as to how you treat the people here  hodson i havent treated any of em yet sir if i was to accept all the treats they offer me

broadbent beaming candidatorially i must thank you very particularly mr haffigan for your support this morning i value it because i know that the real heart of a nation is the class you represent the yeomanry  matthew aghast the yeomanry  larry looking up from his paper take care tom in rosscullen a yeoman means a sort of orange bashibazouk in england mat they call a freehold farmer a yeoman  matthew huffily i dont need to be insthructed be you larry doyle some people think no one knows anythin but dhemselves to broadbent deferentially of course i know a gentleman like you would not

hans  broadbent i have heard about it and my blood still boils at the thought calling hodson  hodson behind the corner of the house yes sir he hurries forward  broadbent hodson this gentlemans

bedad if dhat pig gets a howlt o the handle o the machine he shakes his head ominously and drifts away to the pigsty    act iv  the parlor in cornelius doyles house it communicates with the garden by a half glazed door the fireplace is at the other side of the room opposite the door and windows the architect not having been sensitive to draughts the table rescued from the garden is in the middle and at it sits keegan the central figure in a rather crowded apartment  nora sitting with her back to the fire at the end of the table is playing backgammon across its corner with him on his left hand aunt judy a little further back sits facing the fire knitting with her feet on the fender a little to keegans right in front of the table and almost sitting on it is barney doran half a dozen friends of his all men are between him and the open door supported by others outside in the corner behind them is the sofa of mahogany and horsehair made up as a bed for broadbent against the wall behind

on the one nearest the inner door and his stick is leaning against it a third chair also against the wall is near the garden door  there is a strong contrast of emotional atmosphere between the two sides of the room keegan is extraordinarily stern no game of backgammon could possibly make a mans face so grim aunt judy is quietly busy nora it trying to ignore doran and attend to her game  on the other hand doran is reeling in an ecstasy of mischievous mirth which has infected all his friends they are screaming with laughter doubled up leaning on the furniture and against the walls shouting

people  cornelius comes in hastily from the garden pushing his way through the little crowd  cornelius whisht your laughin boys here he is he puts his hat on the sideboard and goes to the fireplace where he posts himself with his back to the chimneypiece  aunt judy remember your behavior now  everybody becomes silent solemn concerned sympathetic broadbent enters roiled and disordered as to his motoring coat immensely important and serious as to himself he makes his way to the end of the table nearest the garden door whilst larry who accompanies him throws his motoring coat on the sofa bed and sits down watching the proceedings  broadbent taking off his leather cap with dignity and placing it on the table i hope you have not been anxious about me  aunt judy deedn we have mr broadbent its a mercy you werent killed  doran kilt its a mercy dheres two bones of you left houldin together how dijjescape at all at all well i never thought id be so glad to see you safe and sound again not a man in the town would say less murmurs of kindly assent wont you come down to doolans and have a dhrop o brandy to take the shock off  broadbent youre all really too kind but the shock has quite passed off  doran jovially never mind come along all the same and tell us about it over a frenly glass  broadbent may i say how deeply i feel the kindness with which i have been overwhelmed since my accident i can truthfully declare that i am glad it happened because it has brought out the kindness and sympathy of the irish character to an extent i had no conception of   several  oh sure youre welcome  present sure its only natural           sure you might have been kilt  a young man on the point of bursting hurries out barney puts an iron constraint on his features  broadbent all i can say is that i wish i could drink the health of everyone of you  doran dhen come an do it  broadbent very solemnly no i am a teetotaller  aunt judy incredulously arra since when  broadbent since this morning miss doyle i have had a lesson he looks at nora significantly that i shall not forget it may be that total abstinence has already saved my life for i was astonished at the steadiness of my nerves when death stared me in the face today so i will ask you to excuse me he collects himself for a speech gentlemen i hope the gravity of the peril through which we have all passedfor i know that the danger to the bystanders was as great as to the occupants of the carwill prove an earnest of closer and more serious relations between us in the future we have had a somewhat agitating day a valuable and innocent animal has lost its life a public building has been wrecked an aged and infirm lady has suffered an impact for which i feel personally responsible though my old friend mr laurence doyle unfortunately incurred the first effects of her very natural resentment i greatly regret the damage to mr patrick farrells fingers and i have of course taken care that he shall not suffer pecuniarily by his mishap murmurs of admiration at his magnanimity and a voice youre a gentleman sir i am glad to say that patsy took it like an irishman and far from expressing any vindictive feeling declared his willingness to break all his fingers and toes for me on the same terms subdued applause and more power to patsy gentlemen i felt at home in ireland from the first rising excitement among his hearers in every irish breast i have found that spirit of liberty a cheery voice hear hear that instinctive mistrust of the government a small pious voice with intense expression god bless you sir that love of independence a defiant voice thats it independence that indignant sympathy with the cause of oppressed nationalities abroad a threatening growl from all the groundswell of patriotic passion and with the resolute assertion of personal rights at home which is all but extinct in my own country if it were legally possible i should become a naturalized irishman and if ever it be my good fortune to represent an irish constituency in parliament it shall be my first care to introduce a bill legalizing such an operation i believe a large section of the liberal party would avail themselves of it momentary scepticism i do convulsive cheering gentlemen i have said enough cries of go on no i have as yet no right to address you at all on political subjects and we must not abuse the warmhearted irish hospitality of miss doyle by turning her sittingroom into a public meeting  doran energetically three cheers for tom broadbent the future member for rosscullen  aunt judy waving a half knitted sock hip hip hurray  the cheers are given with great heartiness as it is by this time for the more humorous spirits present a question of vociferation or internal rupture  broadbent thank you from the bottom of my heart friends  nora whispering to doran take them away mr doran doran nods  doran well good evenin mr broadbent an may you never regret the day you wint dhrivin wid halligans pig they shake hands good evenin miss doyle  general handshaking broadbent shaking hands with everybody effusively he accompanies them to the garden and can be heard outside saying goodnight in every inflexion known to parliamentary candidates nora aunt judy keegan larry and cornelius are left in the parlor larry goes to the threshold and watches the scene in the garden  nora its a shame to make game of him like that hes a gradle more good in him than barney doran  cornelius its all up with his candidature hell be laughed out o the town  larry turning quickly from the doorway oh no he wont hes not an irishman hell never know theyre laughing at him and while theyre laughing hell win the seat  cornelius but he cant prevent the story getting about  larry he wont want to hell tell it himself as one of the most providential episodes in the history of england and ireland  aunt judy sure he wouldnt make a fool of himself like that  larry are you sure hes such a fool after all aunt judy suppose you had a vote which would you rather give it to the man that told the story of haffigans pig barney dorans way or broadbents way  aunt judy faith i wouldnt give it to a man at all its a few women they want in parliament to stop their foolish blather  broadbent bustling into the room and taking off his damaged motoring overcoat which he put down on the sofa well thats over i must apologize for making that speech miss doyle but they like it you know everything helps in electioneering  larry takes the chair near the door draws it near the table and sits astride it with his elbows folded on the back  aunt judy id no notion you were such an orator mr broadbent  broadbent oh its only a knack one picks it up on the platform it stokes up their enthusiasm  aunt judy oh i forgot youve not met mr keegan let me introjooce you  broadbent shaking hands effusively most happy to meet you mr keegan i have heard of you though i have not had the pleasure of shaking your hand before and now may i ask youfor i value no mans opinion morewhat you think of my chances here  keegan coldly your chances sir are excellent you will get into parliament  broadbent delighted i hope so i think so fluctuating you really think so you are sure you are not allowing your enthusiasm for our principles to get the better of your judgment  keegan i have no enthusiasm for your principles sir you will get into parliament because you want to get into it badly enough to be prepared to take the necessary steps to induce the people to vote for you that is how people usually get into that fantastic assembly  broadbent puzzled of course pause quite so pause eryes buoyant again i think they will vote for me eh yes  aunt judy arra why shouldnt they look at the people they do vote for  broadbent encouraged thats true thats very true when i see the windbags the carpetbaggers the charlatans thethethe fools and ignoramuses who corrupt the multitude by their wealth or seduce them by spouting balderdash to them i cannot help thinking that an honest man with no humbug about him who will talk straight common sense and take his stand on the solid ground of principle and public duty must win his way with men of all classes  keegan quietly sir there was a time in my ignorant youth when i should have called you a hypocrite  broadbent reddening a hypocrite  nora hastily oh im sure you dont think anything of the sort mr keegan  broadbent emphatically thank you miss reilly thank you  cornelius gloomily we all have to stretch it a bit in politics hwats the use o pretendin we dont  broadbent stiffly i hope i have said or done nothing that calls for any such observation mr doyle if there is a vice i detestor against which my whole public life has been a protestit is the vice of hypocrisy i would almost rather be inconsistent than insincere  keegan do not be offended sir i know that you are quite sincere there is a saying in the scripture which runsso far as the memory of an oldish man can carry the wordslet not the right side of your brain know what the left side doeth i learnt at oxford that this is the secret of the englishmans strange power of making the best of both worlds  broadbent surely the text refers to our right and left hands i am somewhat surprised to hear a member of your church quote so essentially protestant a document as the bible but at least you might quote it accurately  larry tom with the best intentions youre making an ass of yourself you dont understand mr keegans peculiar vein of humor  broadbent instantly recovering his confidence ah it was only your delightful irish humor mr keegan of course of course how stupid of me im so sorry he pats keegan consolingly on the back john bulls wits are still slow you see besides calling me a hypocrite was too big a joke to swallow all at once you know  keegan you must also allow for the fact that i am mad  nora ah dont talk like that mr keegan  broadbent encouragingly not at all not at all only a whimsical irishman eh  larry are you really mad mr keegan  aunt judy shocked oh larry how could you ask him such a thing  larry i dont think mr keegan minds to keegan whats the true version of the story of that black man you confessed on his deathbed  keegan what story have you heard about that  larry i am informed that when the devil came for the black heathen he took off your head and turned it three times round before putting it on again and that your heads been turned ever since  nora reproachfully larry  keegan blandly that is not quite what occurred he collects himself for a serious utterance they attend involuntarily i heard that a black man was dying and that the people were afraid to go near him when i went to the place i found an elderly hindoo who told me one of those tales of unmerited misfortune of cruel ill luck of relentless persecution by destiny which sometimes wither the commonplaces of consolation on the lips of a priest but this man did not complain of his misfortunes they were brought upon him he said by sins committed in a former existence then without a word of comfort from me he died with a cleareyed resignation that my most earnest exhortations have rarely produced in a christian and left me sitting there by his bedside with the mystery of this world suddenly revealed to me  broadbent that is a remarkable tribute to the liberty of conscience enjoyed by the subjects of our indian empire  larry no doubt but may we venture to ask what is the mystery of this world  keegan this world sir is very clearly a place of torment and penance a place where the fool flourishes and the good and wise are hated and persecuted a place where men and women torture one another in the name of love where children are scourged and enslaved in the name of parental duty and education where the weak in body are poisoned and mutilated in the name of healing and the weak in character are put to the horrible torture of imprisonment not for hours but for years in the name of justice it is a place where the hardest toil is a welcome refuge from the horror and tedium of pleasure and where charity and good works are done only for hire to ransom the souls of the spoiler and the sybarite now sir there is only one place of horror and torment known to my religion and that place is hell therefore it is plain to me that this earth of ours must be hell and that we are all here as the indian revealed to meperhaps he was sent to reveal it to me to expiate crimes committed by us in a former existence  aunt judy awestruck heaven save us what a thing to say  cornelius sighing its a queer world thats certain  broadbent your idea is a very clever one mr keegan really most brilliant i should never have thought of it but it seems to meif i may say sothat you are overlooking the fact that of the evils you describe some are absolutely necessary for the preservation of society and others are encouraged only when the tories are in office  larry i expect you were a tory in a former existence and that is why you are here  broadbent with conviction never larry never but leaving politics out of the question i find the world quite good enough for me rather a jolly place in fact  keegan looking at him with quiet wonder you are satisfied  broadbent as a reasonable man yes i see no evils in the worldexcept of course natural evilsthat cannot be remedied by freedom selfgovernment and english institutions i think so not because i am an englishman but as a matter of common sense  keegan you feel at home in the world then  broadbent of course dont you  keegan from the very depths of his nature no  broadbent breezily try phosphorus pills i always take them when my brain is overworked ill give you the address in oxford street  keegan enigmatically rising miss doyle my wandering fit has come on me will you excuse me  aunt judy to be sure you know you can come in n nout as you like  keegan we can finish the game some other time miss reilly he goes for his hat and stick  nora no im out with you she disarranges the pieces and rises i was too wicked in a former existence to play backgammon with a good man like you  aunt judy whispering to her whisht whisht child dont set him back on that again  keegan to nora when i look at you i think that perhaps ireland is only purgatory after all he passes on to the garden door  nora galong with you  broadbent whispering to cornelius has he a vote  cornelius nodding yes an theres lotsll vote the way he tells them  keegan at the garden door with gentle gravity good evening mr broadbent you have set me thinking thank you  broadbent delighted hurrying across to him to shake hands no really you find that contact with english ideas is stimulating eh  keegan i am never tired of hearing you talk mr broadbent  broadbent modestly remonstrating oh come come  keegan yes i assure you you are an extremely interesting man he goes out  broadbent enthusiastically what a nice chap what an intelligent interesting fellow by the way id better have a wash he takes up his coat and cap and leaves the room through the inner door  nora returns to her chair and shuts up the backgammon board  aunt judy keegans very queer today he has his mad fit on him  cornelius worried and bitter i wouldnt say but hes right after all its a contrairy world to larry why would you be such a fool as to let him take the seat in parliament from you  larry glancing at nora he will take more than that from me before hes done here  cornelius i wish hed never set foot in my house bad luck to his fat face dye think hed lend me 300 pounds on the farm larry when im so hard up it seems a waste o money not to mortgage it now its me own  larry i can lend you 300 pounds on it  cornelius no no i wasnt putn in for that when i die and leave you the farm i should like to be able to feel that it was all me own and not half yours to start with now ill take me oath barney doarns goin to ask broadbent to lend him 500 pounds on the mill to put in a new hweel for the old onell harly hol together an haffigan cant sleep with covetn that corner o land at the foot of his medda that belongs to doolan hell have to mortgage to buy it i may as well be first as last dye think broadbentd len me a little  larry im quite sure he will  cornelius is he as ready as that would he len me five hunderd dye think  larry hell lend you more than the landll ever be worth to you so for heavens sake be prudent  cornelius judicially all right all right me son ill be careful im goin into the office for a bit he withdraws through the inner door obviously to prepare his application to broadbent  aunt judy indignantly as if he hadnt seen enough o borryin when he was an agent without beginnin borryin himself she rises ill bory him so i will she puts her knitting on the table and follows him out with a resolute air that bodes trouble for cornelius  larry and nora are left together for the first time since his arrival she looks at him with a smile that perishes as she sees him aimlessly rocking his chair and reflecting evidently not about her with his lips pursed as if he were whistling with a catch in her throat she takes up aunt judys knitting and makes a pretence of going on with it  nora i suppose it didnt seem very long to you  larry starting eh what didnt  nora the eighteen years youve been away  larry oh that no it seems hardly more than a week ive been so busyhad so little time to think  nora ive had nothin else to do but think  larry that was very bad for you why didnt you give it up why did you stay here  nora because nobody sent for me to go anywhere else i suppose thats why  larry yes one does stick frightfully in the same place unless some external force comes and routs one out he yawns slightly but as she looks up quickly at him he pulls himself together and rises with an air of waking up and getting to work cheerfully to make himself agreeable and how have you been all this time  nora quite well thank you  larry thats right suddenly finding that he has nothing else to say and being ill at ease in consequence he strolls about the room humming a certain tune from offenbachs whittington  nora struggling with her tears is that all you have to say to me larry  larry well what is there to say you see we know each other so well  nora a little consoled yes of course we do he does not reply i wonder you came back at all  larry i couldnt help it she looks up affectionately tom made me she looks down again quickly to conceal the effect of this blow he whistles another stave then resumes i had a sort of dread of returning to ireland i felt somehow that my luck would turn if i came back and now here i am none the worse  nora praps its a little dull for you  larry no i havent exhausted the interest of strolling about the old places and remembering and romancing about them  nora hopefully oh you do remember the places then  larry of course they have associations  nora not doubting that the associations are with her i suppose so  larry myes i can remember particular spots where i had long fits of thinking about the countries i meant to get to when i escaped from ireland america and london and sometimes rome and the east  nora deeply mortified was that all you used to be thinking about  larry well there was precious little else to think about here my dear nora except sometimes at sunset when one got maudlin and called ireland erin and imagined one was remembering the days of old and so forth he whistles let erin remember  nora did jever get a letter i wrote you last february  larry oh yes and i really intended to answer it but i havent had a moment and i knew you wouldnt mind you see i am so afraid of boring you by writing about affairs you dont understand and people you dont know and yet what else have i to write about i begin a letter and then i tear it up again the fact is fond as we are of one another nora we have so little in commoni mean of course the things one can put in a letterthat correspondence is apt to become the hardest of hard work  nora yes its hard for me to know anything about you if you never tell me anything  larry pettishly nora a man cant sit down and write his life day by day when hes tired enough with having lived it  nora im not blaming you  larry looking at her with some concern you seem rather out of spirits going closer to her anxiously and tenderly you havent got neuralgia have you  nora no  larry reassured i get a touch of it sometimes when i am below par absently again strolling about yes yes he begins to hum again and soon breaks into articulate melody      though summer smiles on here for ever     though not a leaf falls from the tree     tell england ill forget her never  nora puts down the knitting and stares at him       o wind that blows across the sea  with much expression      tell england ill forget her neeeever     o wind that blows acrooss  here the melody soars out of his range he continues falsetto but changes the tune to let erin remember im afraid im boring you nora though youre too kind to say so  nora are you wanting to get back to england already  larry not at all not at all  nora thats a queer song to sing to me if youre not  larry the song oh it doesnt mean anything its by a german jew like most english patriotic sentiment never mind me my dear go on with your work and dont let me bore you  nora bitterly rosscullen isnt such a lively place that i am likely to be bored by you at our first talk together after eighteen years though you dont seem to have much to say to me after all  larry eighteen years is a devilish long time nora now if it had been eighteen minutes or even eighteen months we should be able to pick up the interrupted thread and chatter like two magpies but as it is i have simply nothing to say and you seem to have less  nora iher tears choke her but the keeps up appearances desperately  larry quite unconscious of his cruelty in a week or so we shall be quite old friends again meanwhile as i feel that i am not making myself particularly entertaining ill take myself off tell tom ive gone for a stroll over the hill  nora you seem very fond of tom as you call him  larry the triviality going suddenly out of his voice yes im fond of tom  nora oh well dont let me keep you from him  larry i know quite well that my departure will be a relief rather a failure this first meeting after eighteen years eh well never mind these great sentimental events always are failures and now the worst of its over anyhow he goes out through the garden door  nora left alone struggles wildly to save herself from breaking down and then drops her face on the table and gives way to a convulsion of crying her sobs shake her so that she can hear nothing and she has no suspicion that she is no longer alone until her head and breast are raised by broadbent who returning newly washed and combed through the inner door has seen her condition first with surprise and concern and then with an emotional disturbance that quite upsets him  broadbent miss reilly miss reilly whats the matter dont cry i cant stand it you mustnt cry she makes a choked effort to speak so painful that he continues with impulsive sympathy no dont try to speak its all right now have your cry out never mind me trust me gathering her to him and babbling consolatorily cry on my chest the only really comfortable place for a woman to cry is a mans chest a real man a real friend a good broad chest eh not less than fortytwo inchesno dont fuss never mind the conventions were two friends arent we come now come come its all right and comfortable and happy now isnt it  nora through her tears let me go i want me hankerchief  broadbent holding her with one arm and producing a large silk handkerchief from his breast pocket heres a handkerchief let me he dabs her tears dry with it never mind your own its too small its one of those wretched little cambric handkerchiefs  nora sobbing indeed its a common cotton one  broadbent of course its a common cotton onesilly little cotton onenot good enough for the dear eyes of nora cryna  nora spluttering into a hysterical laugh and clutching him convulsively with her fingers while she tries to stifle her laughter against his collar bone oh dont make me laugh please dont make me laugh  broadbent terrified i didnt mean to on my soul what is it what is it  nora nora creena nora creena  broadbent patting her yes yes of course nora creena nora acushla he makes cush rhyme to plush  nora acushla she makes cush rhyme to bush  broadbent oh confound the language nora darlingmy norathe nora i love  nora shocked into propriety you mustnt talk like that to me  broadbent suddenly becoming prodigiously solemn and letting her go no of course not i dont mean itat least i do mean it but i know its premature i had no right to take advantage of your being a little upset but i lost my selfcontrol for a moment  nora wondering at him i think youre a very kindhearted man mr broadbent but you seem to me to have no selfcontrol at all she turns her face away with a keen pang of shame and adds no more than myself  broadbent resolutely oh yes i have you should see me when i am really roused then i have tremendous selfcontrol remember we have been alone together only once before and then i regret to say i was in a disgusting state  nora ah no mr broadbent you werent disgusting  broadbent mercilessly yes i was nothing can excuse it perfectly beastly it must have made a most unfavorable impression on you  nora oh sure its all right say no more about that  broadbent i must miss reilly it is my duty i shall not detain you long may i ask you to sit down he indicates her chair with oppressive solemnity she sits down wondering he then with the same portentous gravity places a chair for himself near her sits down and proceeds to explain first miss reilly may i say that i have tasted nothing of an alcoholic nature today  nora it doesnt seem to make as much difference in you as it would in an irishman somehow  broadbent perhaps not perhaps not i never quite lose myself  nora consolingly well anyhow youre all right now  broadbent fervently thank you miss reilly i am now we shall get along tenderly lowering his voice nora i was in earnest last night nora moves as if to rise no one moment you must not think i am going to press you for an answer before you have known me for 24 hours i am a reasonable man i hope and i am prepared to wait as long as you like provided you will give me some small assurance that the answer will not be unfavorable  nora how could i go back from it if i did i sometimes think youre not quite right in your head mr broadbent you say such funny things  broadbent yes i know i have a strong sense of humor which sometimes makes people doubt whether i am quite serious that is why i have always thought i should like to marry an irishwoman she would always understand my jokes for instance you would understand them eh  nora uneasily mr broadbent i couldnt  broadbent soothingly wait let me break this to you gently miss reilly hear me out i daresay you have noticed that in speaking to you i have been putting a very strong constraint on myself so as to avoid wounding your delicacy by too abrupt an avowal of my feelings well i feel now that the time has come to be open to be frank to be explicit miss reilly you have inspired in me a very strong attachment perhaps with a womans intuition you have already guessed that  nora rising distractedly why do you talk to me in that unfeeling nonsensical way  broadbent rising also much astonished unfeeling nonsensical  nora dont you know that you have said things to me that no man ought to say unlessunlessshe suddenly breaks down again and hides her face on the table as before oh go away from me i wont get married at all what is it but heartbreak and disappointment  broadbent developing the most formidable symptoms of rage and grief do you mean to say that you are going to refuse me that you dont care for me  nora looking at him in consternation oh dont take it to heart mr br  broadbent flushed and almost choking i dont want to be petted and blarneyed with childish rage i love you i want you for my wife in despair i cant help your refusing im helpless i can do nothing you have no right to ruin my whole life youa hysterical convulsion stops him  nora almost awestruck youre not going to cry are you i never thought a man could cry dont  broadbent im not crying iii leave that sort of thing to your damned sentimental irishmen you think i have no feeling because i am a plain unemotional englishman with no powers of expression  nora i dont think you know the sort of man you are at all whatever may be the matter with you its not want of feeling  broadbent hurt and petulant its you who have no feeling youre as heartless as larry  nora what do you expect me to do is it to throw meself at your head the minute the word is out o your mouth  broadbent striking his silly head with his fists oh what a fool what a brute i am its only your irish delicacy of course of course you mean yes eh what yes yes yes  nora i think you might understand that though i might choose to be an old maid i could never marry anybody but you now  broadbent clasping her violently to his breast with a crow of immense relief and triumph ah thats right thats right thats magnificent i knew you would see what a firstrate thing this will be for both of us  nora incommoded and not at all enraptured by his ardor youre dreadfully strong an a gradle too free with your strength an i never thought o whether itd be a good thing for us or not but when you found me here that time i let you be kind to me and cried in your arms because i was too wretched to think of anything but the comfort of it an how could i let any other man touch me after that  broadbent touched now thats very nice of you nora thats really most delicately womanly he kisses her hand chivalrously  nora looking earnestly and a little doubtfully at him surely if you let one woman cry on you like that youd never let another touch you  broadbent conscientiously one should not one ought not my dear girl but the honest truth is if a chap is at all a pleasant sort of chap his chest becomes a fortification that has to stand many assaults at least it is so in england  nora curtly much disgusted then youd better marry an englishwoman  broadbent making a wry face no no the englishwoman is too prosaic for my taste too material too much of the animated beefsteak about her the ideal is what i like now larrys taste is just the opposite he likes em solid and bouncing and rather keen about him its a very convenient difference for weve never been in love with the same woman  nora an dye mean to tell me to me face that youve ever been in love before  broadbent lord yes  nora im not your first love  broadbent first love is only a little foolishness and a lot of curiosity no really selfrespecting woman would take advantage of it no my dear nora ive done with all that long ago love affairs always end in rows were not going to have any rows were going to have a solid foursquare home man and wife comfort and common senseand plenty of affection eh he puts his arm round her with confident proprietorship  nora coldly trying to get away i dont want any other womans leavings  broadbent holding her nobody asked you to maam i never asked any woman to marry me before  nora severely then why didnt you if youre an honorable man  broadbent well to tell you the truth they were mostly married already but never mind there was nothing wrong come dont take a mean advantage of me after all you must have had a fancy or two yourself eh  nora consciencestricken yes i suppose ive no right to be particular  broadbent humbly i know im not good enough for you nora but no man is you know when the woman is a really nice woman  nora oh im no better than yourself i may as well tell you about it  broadbent no no lets have no telling much better not i shant tell you anything dont you tell me anything perfect confidence in one another and no tellings thats the way to avoid rows  nora dont think it was anything i need be ashamed of  broadbent i dont  nora it was only that id never known anybody else that i could care for and i was foolish enough once to think that larry  broadbent disposing of the idea at once larry oh that wouldnt have done at all not at all you dont know larry as i do my dear he has absolutely no capacity for enjoyment he couldnt make any woman happy hes as clever as beblowed but lifes too earthly for him he doesnt really care for anything or anybody  nora ive found that out  broadbent of course you have no my dear take my word for it youre jolly well out of that there swinging her round against his breast thats much more comfortable for you  nora with irish peevishness ah you mustnt go on like that i dont like it  broadbent unabashed youll acquire the taste by degrees you mustnt mind me its an absolute necessity of my nature that i should have somebody to hug occasionally besides its good for you itll plump out your muscles and make em elastic and set up your figure  nora well im sure if this is english manners arent you ashamed to talk about such things  broadbent in the highest feather not a bit by george nora its a tremendous thing to be able to enjoy oneself lets go off for a walk out of this stuffy little room i want the open air to expand in come along cooome along he puts her arm into his and sweeps her out into the garden as an equinoctial gale might sweep a dry leaf  later in the evening the grasshopper is again enjoying the sunset by the great stone on the hill but this time he enjoys neither the stimulus of keegans conversation nor the pleasure of terrifying patsy farrell he is alone until nora and broadbent come up the hill arm in arm broadbent is still breezy and confident but she has her head averted from him and is almost in tears  broadbent stopping to snuff up the hillside air ah i like this spot i like this view this would be a jolly good place for a hotel and a golf links friday to tuesday railway ticket and hotel all inclusive i tell you nora im going to develop this place looking at her hallo whats the matter tired  nora unable to restrain her tears im ashamed out o me life  broadbent astonished ashamed what of  nora oh how could you drag me all round the place like that telling everybody that were going to be married and introjoocing me to the lowest of the low and letting them shake hans with me and encouraging them to make free with us i little thought i should live to be shaken hans with be doolan in broad daylight in the public street of rosscullen  broadbent but my dear doolans a publican a most influential man by the way i asked him if his wife would be at home tomorrow he said she would so you must take the motor car round and call on her  nora aghast is it me call on doolans wife  broadbent yes of course call on all their wives we must get a copy of the register and a supply of canvassing cards no use calling on people who havent votes youll be a great success as a canvasser nora they call you the heiress and theyll be flattered no end by your calling especially as youve never cheapened yourself by speaking to them beforehave you  nora indignantly not likely indeed  broadbent well we mustnt be stiff and standoff you know we must be thoroughly democratic and patronize everybody without distinction of class i tell you im a jolly lucky man nora cryna i get engaged to the most delightful woman in ireland and it turns out that i couldnt have done a smarter stroke of electioneering  nora an would you let me demean meself like that just to get yourself into parliament  broadbent buoyantly aha wait till you find out what an exciting game electioneering is youll be mad to get me in besides youd like people to say that tom broadbents wife had been the making of himthat she got him into parliamentinto the cabinet perhaps eh  nora god knows i dont grudge you me money but to lower meself to the level of common people  broadbent to a members wife nora nobody is common provided hes on the register come my dear its all right do you think id let you do it if it wasnt the best people do it everybody does it  nora who has been biting her lip and looking over the hill disconsolate and unconvinced well praps you know best what they do in england they must have very little respect for themselves i think ill go in now i see larry and mr keegan coming up the hill and im not fit to talk to them  broadbent just wait and say something nice to keegan they tell me he controls nearly as many votes as father dempsey himself  nora you little know peter keegan hed see through me as if i was a pane o glass  broadbent oh he wont like it any the less for that what really flatters a man is that you think him worth flattering not that i would flatter any man dont think that ill just go and meet him he goes down the hill with the eager forward look of a man about to greet a valued acquaintance nora dries her eyes and turns to go as larry strolls up the hill to her  larry nora she turns and looks at him hardly without a word he continues anxiously in his most conciliatory tone when i left you that time i was just as wretched as you i didnt rightly know what i wanted to say and my tongue kept clacking to cover the loss i was at well ive been thinking ever since and now i know what i ought to have said ive come back to say it  nora youve come too late then you thought eighteen years was not long enough and that you might keep me waiting a day longer well you were mistaken im engaged to your friend mr broadbent and im done with you  larry naively but that was the very thing i was going to advise you to do  nora involuntarily oh you brute to tell me that to me face  larry nervously relapsing into his most irish manner nora dear dont you understand that im an irishman and hes an englishman he wants you and he grabs you i want you and i quarrel with you and have to go on wanting you  nora so you may youd better go back to england to the animated beefsteaks youre so fond of  larry amazed nora guessing where she got the metaphor hes been talking about me i see well never mind we must be friends you and i i dont want his marriage to you to be his divorce from me  nora you care more for him than you ever did for me  larry with curt sincerity yes of course i do why should i tell you lies about it nora reilly was a person of very little consequence to me or anyone else outside this miserable little hole but mrs tom broadbent will be a person of very considerable consequence indeed play your new part well and there will be no more neglect no more loneliness no more idle regrettings and vainhopings in the evenings by the round tower but real life and real work and real cares and real joys among real people solid english life in london the very centre of the world you will find your work cut out for you keeping toms house and entertaining toms friends and getting tom into parliament but it will be worth the effort  nora you talk as if i were under an obligation to him for marrying me  larry i talk as i think youve made a very good match let me tell you  nora indeed well some people might say hes not done so badly himself  larry if you mean that you will be a treasure to him he thinks so now and you can keep him thinking so if you like  nora i wasnt thinking o meself at all  larry were you thinking of your money nora  nora i didnt say so  larry your money will not pay your cooks wages in london  nora flaming up if thats trueand the more shame for you to throw it in my face if it is trueat all events itll make us independent for if the worst comes to the worst we can always come back here an live on it an if i have to keep his house for him at all events i can keep you out of it for ive done with you and i wish id never seen you so goodbye to you mister larry doyle she turns her back on him and goes home  larry watching her as she goes goodbye goodbye oh thats so irish irish both of us to the backbone irish irish irish  broadbent arrives conversing energetically with keegan  broadbent nothing pays like a golfing hotel if you hold the land instead of the shares and if the furniture people stand in with you and if you are a good man of business  larry noras gone home  broadbent with conviction you were right this morning larry i must feed up nora shes weak and it makes her fanciful oh by the way did i tell you that were engaged  larry she told me herself  broadbent complacently shes rather full of it as you may imagine poor nora well mr keegan as i said i begin to see my way here i begin to see my way  keegan with a courteous inclination the conquering englishman sir within 24 hours of your arrival you have carried off our only heiress and practically secured the parliamentary seat and you have promised me that when i come here in the evenings to meditate on my madness to watch the shadow of the round tower lengthening in the sunset to break my heart uselessly in the curtained gloaming over the dead heart and blinded soul of the island of the saints you will comfort me with the bustle of a great hotel and the sight of the little children carrying the golf clubs of your tourists as a preparation for the life to come  broadbent quite touched mutely offering him a cigar to console him at which he smiles and shakes his head yes mr keegan youre quite right theres poetry in everything even looking absently into the cigar case in the most modern prosaic things if you know how to extract it he extracts a cigar for himself and offers one to larry who takes it if i was to be shot for it i couldnt extract it myself but thats where you come in you see roguishly waking up from his reverie and bustling keegan goodhumoredly and then i shall wake you up a bit thats where i come in eh dye see eh eh he pats him very pleasantly on the shoulder half admiringly half pityingly just so just so coming back to business by the way i believe i can do better than a light railway here there seems to be no question now that the motor boat has come to stay well look at your magnificent river there going to waste  keegan closing his eyes silent o moyle be the roar of thy waters  broadbent you know the roar of a motor boat is quite pretty  keegan provided it does not drown the angelus  broadbent reassuringly oh no it wont do that not the least danger you know a church bell can make a devil of a noise when it likes  keegan you have an answer for everything sir but your plans leave one question still unanswered how to get butter out of a dogs throat  broadbent eh  keegan you cannot build your golf links and hotels in the air for that you must own our land and how will you drag our acres from the ferrets grip of matthew haffigan how will you persuade cornelius doyle to forego the pride of being a small landowner how will barney dorans millrace agree with your motor boats will doolan help you to get a license for your hotel  broadbent my dear sir to all intents and purposes the syndicate i represent already owns half rosscullen doolans is a tied house and the brewers are in the syndicate as to haffigans farm and dorans mill and mr doyles place and half a dozen others they will be mortgaged to me before a month is out  keegan but pardon me you will not lend them more on their land than the land is worth so they will be able to pay you the interest  broadbent ah you are a poet mr keegan not a man of business  larry we will lend everyone of these men half as much again on their land as it is worth or ever can be worth to them  broadbent you forget sir that we with our capital our knowledge our organization and may i say our english business habits can make or lose ten pounds out of land that haffigan with all his industry could not make or lose ten shillings out of dorans mill is a superannuated folly i shall want it for electric lighting  larry what is the use of giving land to such men they are too small too poor too ignorant too simpleminded to hold it against us you might as well give a dukedom to a crossing sweeper  broadbent yes mr keegan this place may have an industrial future or it may have a residential future i cant tell yet but its not going to be a future in the hands of your dorans and haffigans poor devils  keegan it may have no future at all have you thought of that  broadbent oh im not afraid of that i have faith in ireland great faith mr keegan  keegan and we have none only empty enthusiasms and patriotisms and emptier memories and regrets ah yes you have some excuse for believing that if there be any future it will be yours for our faith seems dead and our hearts cold and cowed an island of dreamers who wake up in your jails of critics and cowards whom you buy and tame for your own service of bold rogues who help you to plunder us that they may plunder you afterwards eh  broadbent a little impatient of this unbusinesslike view yes yes but you know you might say that of any country the fact is there are only two qualities in the world efficiency and inefficiency and only two sorts of people the efficient and the inefficient it dont matter whether theyre english or irish i shall collar this place not because im an englishman and haffigan and co are irishmen but because theyre duffers and i know my way about  keegan have you considered what is to become of haffigan  larry oh well employ him in some capacity or other and probably pay him more than he makes for himself now  broadbent dubiously do you think so no no haffigans too old it really doesnt pay now to take on men over forty even for unskilled labor which i suppose is all haffigan would be good for no haffigan had better go to america or into the union poor old chap hes worked out you know you can see it  keegan poor lost soul so cunningly fenced in with invisible bars  larry haffigan doesnt matter much hell die presently  broadbent shocked oh come larry dont be unfeeling its hard on haffigan its always hard on the inefficient  larry pah what does it matter where an old and broken man spends his last days or whether he has a million at the bank or only the workhouse dole its the young men the able men that matter the real tragedy of haffigan is the tragedy of his wasted youth his stunted mind his drudging over his clods and pigs until he has become a clod and a pig himselfuntil the soul within him has smouldered into nothing but a dull temper that hurts himself and all around him i say let him die and let us have no more of his like and let young ireland take care that it doesnt share his fate instead of making another empty grievance of it let your syndicate come  broadbent your syndicate too old chap you have your bit of the stock  larry yes mine if you like well our syndicate has no conscience it has no more regard for your haffigans and doolans and dorans than it has for a gang of chinese coolies it will use your patriotic blatherskite and balderdash to get parliamentary powers over you as cynically as it would bait a mousetrap with toasted cheese it will plan and organize and find capital while you slave like bees for it and revenge yourselves by paying politicians and penny newspapers out of your small wages to write articles and report speeches against its wickedness and tyranny and to crack up your own irish heroism just as haffigan once paid a witch a penny to put a spell on billy byrnes cow in the end it will grind the nonsense out of you and grind strength and sense into you  broadbent out of patience why cant you say a simple thing simply larry without all that irish exaggeration and talkytalky the syndicate is a perfectly respectable body of responsible men of good position well take ireland in hand and by straightforward business habits teach it efficiency and selfhelp on sound liberal principles you agree with me mr keegan dont you  keegan sir i may even vote for you  broadbent sincerely moved shaking his hand warmly you shall never regret it mr keegan i give you my word for that i shall bring money here i shall raise wages i shall found public institutions a library a polytechnic undenominational of course a gymnasium a cricket club perhaps an art school i shall make a garden city of rosscullen the round tower shall be thoroughly repaired and restored  keegan and our place of torment shall be as clean and orderly as the cleanest and most orderly place i know in ireland which is our poetically named mountjoy prison well perhaps i had better vote for an efficient devil that knows his own mind and his own business than for a foolish patriot who has no mind and no business  broadbent stiffly devil is rather a strong expression in that connexion mr keegan  keegan not from a man who knows that this world is hell but since the word offends you let me soften it and compare you simply to an ass larry whitens with anger  broadbent reddening an ass  keegan gently you may take it without offence from a madman who calls the ass his brotherand a very honest useful and faithful brother too the ass sir is the most efficient of beasts matteroffact hardy friendly when you treat him as a fellowcreature stubborn when you abuse him ridiculous only in love which sets him braying and in politics which move him to roll about in the public road and raise a dust about nothing can you deny these qualities and habits in yourself sir  broadbent goodhumoredly well yes im afraid i do you know  keegan then perhaps you will confess to the asss one fault  broadbent perhaps so what is it  keegan that he wastes all his virtueshis efficiency as you call itin doing the will of his greedy masters instead of doing the will of heaven that is in himself he is efficient in the service of mammon mighty in mischief skilful in ruin heroic in destruction but he comes to browse here without knowing that the soil his hoof touches is holy ground ireland sir for good or evil is like no other place under heaven and no man can touch its sod or breathe its air without becoming better or worse it produces two kinds of men in strange perfection saints and traitors it is called the island of the saints but indeed in these later years it might be more fitly called the island of the traitors for our harvest of these is the fine flower of the worlds crop of infamy but the day may come when these islands shall live by the quality of their men rather than by the abundance of their minerals and then we shall see  larry mr keegan if you are going to be sentimental about ireland i shall bid you good evening we have had enough of that and more than enough of cleverly proving that everybody who is not an irishman is an ass it is neither good sense nor good manners it will not stop the syndicate and it will not interest young ireland so much as my friends gospel of efficiency  broadbent ah yes yes efficiency is the thing i dont in the least mind your chaff mr keegan but larrys right on the main point the world belongs to the efficient  keegan with polished irony i stand rebuked gentlemen but believe me i do every justice to the efficiency of you and your syndicate you are both i am told thoroughly efficient civil engineers and i have no doubt the golf links will be a triumph of your art mr broadbent will get into parliament most efficiently which is more than st patrick could do if he were alive now you may even build the hotel efficiently if you can find enough efficient masons carpenters and plumbers which i rather doubt dropping his irony and beginning to fall into the attitude of the priest rebuking sin when the hotel becomes insolvent broadbent takes his cigar out of his mouth a little taken aback your english business habits will secure the thorough efficiency of the liquidation you will reorganize the scheme efficiently you will liquidate its second bankruptcy efficiently broadbent and larry look quickly at one another for this unless the priest is an old financial hand must be inspiration you will get rid of its original shareholders efficiently after efficiently ruining them and you will finally profit very efficiently by getting that hotel for a few shillings in the pound more and more sternly besides those efficient operations you will foreclose your mortgages most efficiently his rebuking forefinger goes up in spite of himself you will drive haffigan to america very efficiently you will find a use for barney dorans foul mouth and bullying temper by employing him to slavedrive your laborers very efficiently and low and bitter when at last this poor desolate countryside becomes a busy mint in which we shall all slave to make money for you with our polytechnic to teach us how to do it efficiently and our library to fuddle the few imaginations your distilleries will spare and our repaired round tower with admission sixpence and refreshments and pennyintheslot mutoscopes to make it interesting then no doubt your english and american shareholders will spend all the money we make for them very efficiently in shooting and hunting in operations for cancer and appendicitis in gluttony and gambling and you will devote what they save to fresh land development schemes for four wicked centuries the world has dreamed this foolish dream of efficiency and the end is not yet but the end will come  broadbent seriously too true mr keegan only too true and most eloquently put it reminds me of poor ruskina great man you know i sympathize believe me im on your side dont sneer larry i used to read a lot of shelley years ago let us be faithful to the dreams of our youth he wafts a wreath of cigar smoke at large across the hill  keegan come mr doyle is this english sentiment so much more efficient than our irish sentiment after all mr broadbent spends his life inefficiently admiring the thoughts of great men and efficiently serving the cupidity of base money hunters we spend our lives efficiently sneering at him and doing nothing which of us has any right to reproach the other  broadbent coming down the hill again to keegans right hand but you know something must be done  keegan yes when we cease to do we cease to live well what shall we do  broadbent why what lies to our hand  keegan which is the making of golf links and hotels to bring idlers to a country which workers have left in millions because it is a hungry land a naked land an ignorant and oppressed land  broadbent but hang it all the idlers will bring money from england to ireland  keegan just as our idlers have for so many generations taken money from ireland to england has that saved england from poverty and degradation more horrible than we have ever dreamed of when i went to england sir i hated england now i pity it broadbent can hardly conceive an irishman pitying england but as larry intervenes angrily he gives it up and takes to the bill and his cigar again  larry much good your pity will do it  keegan in the accounts kept in heaven mr doyle a heart purified of hatred may be worth more even than a land development syndicate of anglicized irishmen and gladstonized englishmen  larry oh in heaven no doubt i have never been there can you tell me where it is  keegan could you have told me this morning where hell is yet you know now that it is here do not despair of finding heaven it may be no farther off  larry ironically on this holy ground as you call it eh  keegan with fierce intensity yes perhaps even on this holy ground which such irishmen as you have turned into a land of derision  broadbent coming between them take care you will be quarrelling presently oh you irishmen you irishmen toujours ballyhooly eh larry with a shrug half comic half impatient turn away up the hill but presently strolls back on keegans right broadbent adds confidentially to keegan stick to the englishman mr keegan he has a bad name here but at least he can forgive you for being an irishman  keegan sir when you speak to me of english and irish you forget that i am a catholic my country is not ireland nor england but the whole mighty realm of my church for me there are but two countries heaven and hell but two conditions of men salvation and damnation standing here between you the englishman so clever in your foolishness and this irishman so foolish in his cleverness i cannot in my ignorance be sure which of you is the more deeply damned but i should be unfaithful to my calling if i opened the gates of my heart less widely to one than to the other  larry in either case it would be an impertinence mr keegan as your approval is not of the slightest consequence to us what use do you suppose all this drivel is to men with serious practical business in hand  broadbent i dont agree with that larry i think these things cannot be said too often they keep up the moral tone of the community as you know i claim the right to think for myself in religious matters in fact i am ready to avow myself a bit of aof awell i dont care who knows ita bit of a unitarian but if the church of england contained a few men like mr keegan i should certainly join it  keegan you do me too much honor sir with priestly humility to larry mr doyle i am to blame for having unintentionally set your mind somewhat on edge against me i beg your pardon  larry unimpressed and hostile i didnt stand on ceremony with you you neednt stand on it with me fine manners and fine words are cheap in ireland you can keep both for my friend here who is still imposed on by them i know their value  keegan you mean you dont know their value  larry angrily i mean what i say  keegan turning quietly to the englishman you see mr broadbent i only make the hearts of my countrymen harder when i preach to them the gates of hell still prevail against me i shall wish you good evening i am better alone at the round tower dreaming of heaven he goes up the hill  larry aye thats it there you are dreaming dreaming dreaming dreaming  keegan halting and turning to them for the last time every dream is a prophecy every jest is an earnest in the womb of time  broadbent reflectively once when i was a small kid i dreamt i was in heaven they both stare at him it was a sort of pale blue satin place with all the pious old ladies in our congregation sitting as if they were at a service and there was some awful person in the study at the other side of the hall i didnt enjoy it you know what is it like in your dreams  keegan in my dreams it is a country where the state is the church and the church the people three in one and one in three it is a commonwealth in which work is play and play is life three in one and one in three it is a temple in which the priest is the worshipper and the worshipper the worshipped three in one and one in three it is a godhead in which all life is human and all humanity divine three in one and one in three it is in short the dream of a madman he goes away across the hill  broadbent looking after him affectionately what a regular old church and state tory he is hes a character hell be an attraction here really almost equal to ruskin and carlyle  larry yes and much good they did with all their talk  broadbent oh tut tut larry they improved my mind they raised my tone enormously i feel sincerely obliged to keegan he has made me feel a better man distinctly better with sincere elevation i feel now as i never did before that i am right in devoting my life to the cause of ireland come along and help me to choose the site for the hotel
