20792486	the pension beaurepas  by henry james     chapter i    i was not richon the contrary and i had been told the pension beaurepas was cheap  i had moreover been told that a boarding house is a capital place for the study of human nature  i had a fancy for a literary career and a friend of mine had said to me if you mean to write you ought to go and live in a boardinghouse there is no other such place to pick up material  i had read something of this kind in a letter addressed by stendhal to his sister  i have a passionate desire to know human nature and have a great mind to live in a boardinghouse where people cannot conceal their real characters  i was an admirer of la chartreuse de parme and it appeared to me that one could not do better than follow in the footsteps of its author  i remembered too the magnificent boardinghouse in balzacs pere goriotthe pension bourgeoise des deux sexes et autres kept by madame vauquer nee de conflans magnificent i mean as a piece of portraiture the establishment as an establishment was certainly sordid enough and i hoped for better things from the pension beaurepas  this institution was one of the most esteemed in geneva and standing in a little garden of its own not far from the lake had a very homely comfortable sociable aspect  the regular entrance was as one might say at the back which looked upon the street or rather upon a little place adorned like every place in geneva great or small with a fountain  this fact was not prepossessing for on crossing the threshold you found yourself more or less in the kitchen encompassed with culinary odours  this however was no great matter for at the pension beaurepas there was no attempt at gentility or at concealment of the domestic machinery  the latter was of a very simple sort  madame beaurepas was an excellent little old womanshe was very far advanced in life and had been keeping a pension for forty years whose only faults were that she was slightly deaf that she was fond of a surreptitious pinch of snuff and that at the age of seventy three she wore flowers in her cap  there was a tradition in the house that she was not so deaf as she pretended that she feigned this infirmity in order to possess herself of the secrets of her lodgers  but i never subscribed to this theory i am convinced that madame beaurepas had outlived the period of indiscreet curiosity she was a philosopher on a matteroffact basis she had been having lodgers for forty years and all that she asked of them was that they should pay their bills make use of the doormat and fold their napkins  she cared very little for their secrets  jen ai vus de toutes les couleurs she said to me  she had quite ceased to care for individuals she cared only for types for categories  her large observation had made her acquainted with a great number and her mind was a complete collection of heads  she flattered herself that she knew at a glance where to pigeonhole a newcomer and if she made any mistakes her deportment never betrayed them  i think that as regards individuals she had neither likes nor dislikes but she was capable of expressing esteem or contempt for a species  she had her own ways i suppose of manifesting her approval but her manner of indicating the reverse was simple and unvarying  je trouve que cest deplacethis exhausted her view of the matter  if one of her inmates had put arsenic into the potaufeu i believe madame beaurepas would have contented herself with remarking that the proceeding was out of place  the line of misconduct to which she most objected was an undue assumption of gentility she had no patience with boarders who gave themselves airs  when people come chez moi it is not to cut a figure in the world i have never had that illusion i remember hearing her say and when you pay seven francs a day tout compris it comprises everything but the right to look down upon the others  but there are people who the less they pay the more they take themselves au serieux  my most difficult boarders have always been those who have had the little rooms  madame beaurepas had a niece a young woman of some forty odd years and the two ladies with the assistance of a couple of thickwaisted redarmed peasant women kept the house going  if on your exits and entrances you peeped into the kitchen it made very little difference for celestine the cook had no pretension to be an invisible functionary or to deal in occult methods  she was always at your service with a grateful grin she blacked your boots she trudged off to fetch a cab she would have carried your baggage if you had allowed her on her broad little back  she was always tramping in and out between her kitchen and the fountain in the place where it often seemed to me that a large part of the preparation for our dinner went forwardthe wringing out of towels and tablecloths the washing of potatoes and cabbages the scouring of saucepans and cleansing of waterbottles  you enjoyed from the doorstep a perpetual backview of celestine and of her large loose woollen ankles as she craned from the waist over into the fountain and dabbled in her various utensils  this sounds as if life went on in a very makeshift fashion at the pension beaurepasas if the tone of the establishment were sordid  but such was not at all the case we were simply very bourgeois we practised the good old genevese principle of not sacrificing to appearances  this is an excellent principlewhen you have the reality  we had the reality at the pension beaurepas  we had it in the shape of soft short beds equipped with fluffy duvets of admirable coffee served to us in the morning by celestine in person as we lay recumbent on these downy couches of copious wholesome succulent dinners conformable to the best provincial traditions  for myself i thought the pension beaurepas picturesque and this with me at that time was a great word  i was young and ingenuous  i had just come from america  i wished to perfect myself in the french tongue and i innocently believed that it flourished by lake leman  i used to go to lectures at the academy and come home with a violent appetite  i always enjoyed my morning walk across the long bridge there was only one just there in those days which spans the deep blue outgush of the lake and up the dark steep streets of the old calvinistic city  the garden faced this way toward the lake and the old town and this was the pleasantest approach to the house  there was a high wall with a double gate in the middle flanked by a couple of ancient massive posts the big rusty grille contained some oldfashioned ironwork the garden was rather mouldy and weedy tangled and untended but it contained a little thinflowing fountain several green benches a rickety little table of the same complexion and three orangetrees in tubs which were deposited as effectively as possible in front of the windows of the salon    chapter ii    as commonly happens in boardinghouses the rustle of petticoats was at the pension beaurepas the most familiar form of the human tread there was the usual allotment of economical widows and old maids and to maintain the balance of the sexes there were only an old frenchman and a young american  it hardly made the matter easier that the old frenchman came from lausanne  he was a native of that estimable town but he had once spent six months in paris he had tasted of the tree of knowledge he had got beyond lausanne whose resources he pronounced inadequate  lausanne as he said manquait dagrements when obliged for reasons which he never specified to bring his residence in paris to a close he had fallen back on geneva he had broken his fall at the pension beaurepas  geneva was after all more like paris and at a genevese boardinghouse there was sure to be plenty of americans with whom one could talk about the french metropolis  m pigeonneau was a little lean man with a large narrow nose who sat a great deal in the garden reading with the aid of a large magnifying glass a volume from the cabinet de lecture  one day a fortnight after my arrival at the pension beaurepas i came back rather earlier than usual from my academic session it wanted half an hour of the midday breakfast  i went into the salon with the design of possessing myself of the days galignani before one of the little english old maids should have removed it to her virginal bowera privilege to which madame beaurepas frequently alluded as one of the attractions of the establishment  in the salon i found a newcomer a tall gentleman in a high black hat whom i immediately recognised as a compatriot  i had often seen him or his equivalent in the hotel parlours of my native land  he apparently supposed himself to be at the present moment in a hotel parlour his hat was on his head or rather half off itpushed back from his forehead and rather suspended than poised  he stood before a table on which old newspapers were scattered one of which he had taken up and with his eyeglass on his nose was holding out at armslength it was that honourable but extremely diminutive sheet the journal de geneve a newspaper of about the size of a pockethandkerchief  as i drew near looking for my galignani the tall gentleman gave me over the top of his eyeglass a somewhat solemn stare  presently however before i had time to lay my hand on the object of my search he silently offered me the journal de geneve  it appears he said to be the paper of the country  yes i answered i believe its the best  he gazed at it again still holding it at armslength as if it had been a lookingglass  well he said i suppose its natural a small country should have small papers  you could wrap it up mountains and all in one of our dailies  i found my galignani and went off with it into the garden where i seated myself on a bench in the shade  presently i saw the tall gentleman in the hat appear in one of the open windows of the salon and stand there with his hands in his pockets and his legs a little apart  he looked very much bored andi dont know whyi immediately began to feel sorry for him  he was not at all a picturesque personage he looked like a jaded faded man of business but after a little he came into the garden and began to stroll about and then his restless unoccupied carriage and the vague unacquainted manner in which his eyes wandered over the place seemed to make it proper that as an older resident i should exercise a certain hospitality  i said something to him and he came and sat down beside me on my bench clasping one of his long knees in his hands  when is it this big breakfast of theirs comes off he inquired thats what i call itthe little breakfast and the big breakfast i never thought i should live to see the time when i should care to eat two breakfasts  but a mans glad to do anything over here  for myself i observed i find plenty to do  he turned his head and glanced at me with a dry deliberate kind looking eye  youre getting used to the life are you  i like the life very much i answered laughing  how long have you tried it  do you mean in this place  well i mean anywhere  it seems to me pretty much the same all over  i have been in this house only a fortnight i said  well what should you say from what you have seen my companion asked  oh said i you can see all there is immediately  its very simple  sweet simplicity eh  im afraid my two ladies will find it too simple  everything is very good i went on  and madame beaurepas is a charming old woman  and then its very cheap  cheap is it my friend repeated meditatively  doesnt it strike you so i asked  i thought it very possible he had not inquired the terms  but he appeared not to have heard me he sat there clasping his knee and blinking in a contemplative manner at the sunshine  are you from the united states sir he presently demanded turning his head again  yes sir i replied and i mentioned the place of my nativity  i presumed he said that you were american or english  im from the united states myself from new york city  many of our people here  not so many as i believe there have sometimes been  there are two or three ladies  well my interlocutor declared i am very fond of ladies society i think when its superior theres nothing comes up to it  ive got two ladies here myself i must make you acquainted with them  i rejoined that i should be delighted and i inquired of my friend whether he had been long in europe  well it seems precious long he said but my times not up yet we have been here fourteen weeks and a half  are you travelling for pleasure i asked  my companion turned his head again and looked at melooked at me so long in silence that i at last also turned and met his eyes  no sir he said presently  no sir he repeated after a considerable interval  excuse me said i for there was something so solemn in his tone that i feared i had been indiscreet  he took no notice of my ejaculation he simply continued to look at me  im travelling he said at last to please the doctors they seemed to think they would like it  ah they sent you abroad for your health  they sent me abroad because they were so confoundedly muddled they didnt know what else to do  thats often the best thing i ventured to remark  it was a confession of weakness they wanted me to stop plaguing them  they didnt know enough to cure me and thats the way they thought they would get round it  i wanted to be curedi didnt want to be transported  i hadnt done any harm  i assented to the general proposition of the inefficiency of doctors and asked my companion if he had been seriously ill  i didnt sleep he said after some delay  ah thats very annoying  i suppose you were overworked  i didnt eat i took no interest in my food  well i hope you both eat and sleep now i said  i couldnt hold a pen my neighbour went on  i couldnt sit still  i couldnt walk from my house to the carsand its only a little way  i lost my interest in business  you needed a holiday i observed  thats what the doctors said  it wasnt so very smart of them  i had been paying strict attention to business for twentythree years  in all that time you have never had a holiday i exclaimed with horror  my companion waited a little  sundays he said at last  no wonder then you were out of sorts  well sir said my friend i shouldnt have been where i was three years ago if i had spent my time travelling round europe  i was in a very advantageous position  i did a very large business  i was considerably interested in lumber  he paused turned his head and looked at me a moment  have you any business interests yourself i answered that i had none and he went on again slowly softly deliberately  well sir perhaps you are not aware that business in the united states is not what it was a short time since  business interests are very insecure  there seems to be a general falling off  different parties offer different explanations of the fact but so far as i am aware none of their observations have set things going again  i ingeniously intimated that if business was dull the time was good for coming away whereupon my neighbour threw back his head and stretched his legs a while  well sir thats one view of the matter certainly  theres something to be said for that  these things should be looked at all round  thats the ground my wife took  thats the ground he added in a moment that a lady would naturally take and he gave a little dry laugh  you think its slightly illogical i remarked  well sir the ground i took was that the worse a mans business is the more it requires looking after  i shouldnt want to go out to take a walknot even to go to churchif my house was on fire my firm is not doing the business it was its like a sick child it requires nursing  what i wanted the doctors to do was to fix me up so that i could go on at home  id have taken anything theyd have given me and as many times a day  i wanted to be right there i had my reasons i have them still  but i came off all the same said my friend with a melancholy smile  i was a great deal younger than he but there was something so simple and communicative in his tone so expressive of a desire to fraternise and so exempt from any theory of human differences that i quite forgot his seniority and found myself offering him paternal i advice  dont think about all that said i  simply enjoy yourself amuse yourself get well  travel about and see europe  at the end of a year by the time you are ready to go home things will have improved over there and you will be quite well and happy  my friend laid his hand on my knee he looked at me for some moments and i thought he was going to say you are very young but he said presently you have got used to europe any way    chapter iii    at breakfast i encountered his ladieshis wife and daughter  they were placed however at a distance from me and it was not until the pensionnaires had dispersed and some of them according to custom had come out into the garden that he had an opportunity of making me acquainted with them  will you allow me to introduce you to my daughter he said moved apparently by a paternal inclination to provide this young lady with social diversion  she was standing with her mother in one of the paths looking about with no great complacency as i imagined at the homely characteristics of the place and old m pigeonneau was hovering near hesitating apparently between the desire to be urbane and the absence of a pretext  mrs ruckmiss sophy ruck said my friend leading me up  mrs ruck was a large plump lightcoloured person with a smooth fair face a somnolent eye and an elaborate coiffure  miss sophy was a girl of oneandtwenty very small and very prettywhat i suppose would have been called a lively brunette  both of these ladies were attired in black silk dresses very much trimmed they had an air of the highest elegance  do you think highly of this pension inquired mrs ruck after a few preliminaries  its a little rough but it seems to me comfortable i answered  does it take a high rank in geneva mrs ruck pursued  i imagine it enjoys a very fair fame i said smiling  i should never dream of comparing it to a new york boardinghouse said mrs ruck  its quite a different style her daughter observed  miss ruck had folded her arms she was holding her elbows with a pair of white little hands and she was tapping the ground with a pretty little foot  we hardly expected to come to a pension said mrs ruck  but we thought we would try we had heard so much about swiss pensions  i was saying to mr ruck that i wondered whether this was a favourable specimen  i was afraid we might have made a mistake  we knew some people who had been here they thought everything of madame beaurepas said miss sophy  they said she was a real friend  mr and mrs parkerperhaps you have heard her speak of them mrs ruck pursued  madame beaurepas has had a great many americans she is very fond of americans i replied  well i must say i should think she would be if she compares them with some others  mother is always comparing observed miss ruck  of course i am always comparing rejoined the elder lady  i never had a chance till now i never knew my privileges  give me an american  and mrs ruck indulged in a little laugh  well i must say there are some things i like over here said miss sophy with courage  and indeed i could see that she was a young woman of great decision  you like the shopsthats what you like her father affirmed  the young lady addressed herself to me without heeding this remark i suppose you feel quite at home here  oh he likes it he has got used to the life exclaimed mr ruck  i wish youd teach mr ruck said his wife  it seems as if he couldnt get used to anything  im used to you my dear the husband retorted giving me a humorous look  hes intensely restless continued mrs ruck  thats what made me want to come to a pension  i thought he would settle down more  i dont think i am used to you after all said her husband  in view of a possible exchange of conjugal repartee i took refuge in conversation with miss ruck who seemed perfectly able to play her part in any colloquy  i learned from this young lady that with her parents after visiting the british islands she had been spending a month in paris and that she thought she should have died when she left that city  i hung out of the carriage when we left the hotel said miss ruck i assure you i did  and mother did too  out of the other window i hope said i  yes one out of each window she replied promptly  father had hard work i can tell you  we hadnt half finished there were ever so many places we wanted to go to  your father insisted on coming away  yes after we had been there about a month he said he had enough hes fearfully restless hes very much out of health  mother and i said to him that if he was restless in paris he neednt hope for peace anywhere  we dont mean to leave him alone till he takes us back  there was an air of keen resolution in miss rucks pretty face of lucid apprehension of desirable ends which made me as she pronounced these words direct a glance of covert compassion toward her poor recalcitrant father  he had walked away a little with his wife and i saw only his back and his stooping patientlooking shoulders whose air of acute resignation was thrown into relief by the voluminous tranquillity of mrs ruck  he will have to take us back in september any way the young girl pursued he will have to take us back to get some things we have ordered  have you ordered a great many things i asked jocosely  well i guess we have ordered some  of course we wanted to take advantage of being in parisladies always do  we have left the principal things till we go back  of course that is the principal interest for ladies  mother said she should feel so shabby if she just passed through  we have promised all the people to be back in september and i never broke a promise yet  so mr ruck has got to make his plans accordingly  and what are his plans  i dont know he doesnt seem able to make any  his great idea was to get to geneva but now that he has got here he doesnt seem to care  its the effect of ill health  he used to be so bright but now he is quite subdued  its about time he should improve any way we went out last night to look at the jewellers windowsin that street behind the hotel  i had always heard of those jewellers windows  we saw some lovely things but it didnt seem to rouse father  hell get tired of geneva sooner than he did of paris  ah said i there are finer things here than the jewellers windows  we are very near some of the most beautiful scenery in europe  i suppose you mean the mountains  well we have seen plenty of mountains at home  we used to go to the mountains every summer  we are familiar enough with the mountains  arent we mother the young lady demanded appealing to mrs ruck who with her husband had drawn near again  arent we what inquired the elder lady  arent we familiar with the mountains  well i hope so said mrs ruck  mr ruck with his hands in his pockets gave me a sociable wink theres nothing much you can tell them he said  the two ladies stood face to face a few moments surveying each others garments  dont you want to go out the young girl at last inquired of her mother  well i think we had better we have got to go up to that place  to what place asked mr ruck  to that jewellersto that big one  they all seemed big enough they were too big  and mr ruck gave me another wink  that one where we saw the blue cross said his daughter  oh come what do you want of that blue cross poor mr ruck demanded  she wants to hang it on a black velvet ribbon and tie it round her neck said his wife  a black velvet ribbon  no i thank you cried the young lady  do you suppose i would wear that cross on a black velvet ribbon  on a nice little gold chain if you pleasea little narrow gold chain like an oldfashioned watchchain  thats the proper thing for that blue cross  i know the sort of chain i mean im going to look for one  when i want a thing said miss ruck with decision i can generally find it  look here sophy her father urged you dont want that blue cross  i do want iti happen to want it  and sophy glanced at me with a little laugh  her laugh which in itself was pretty suggested that there were various relations in which one might stand to miss ruck but i think i was conscious of a certain satisfaction in not occupying the paternal one  dont worry the poor child said her mother  come on mother said miss ruck  we are going to look about a little explained the elder lady to me by way of taking leave  i know what that means remarked mr ruck as his companions moved away  he stood looking at them a moment while he raised his hand to his head behind and stood rubbing it a little with a movement that displaced his hat  i may remark in parenthesis that i never saw a hat more easily displaced than mr rucks  i supposed he was going to say something querulous but i was mistaken  mr ruck was unhappy but he was very goodnatured  well they want to pick up something he said  thats the principal interest for ladies    chapter iv    mr ruck distinguished me as the french say  he honoured me with his esteem and as the days elapsed with a large portion of his confidence  sometimes he bored me a little for the tone of his conversation was not cheerful tending as it did almost exclusively to a melancholy dirge over the financial prostration of our common country  no sir business in the united states is not what it once was he found occasion to remark several times a day  theres not the same springtheres not the same hopeful feeling  you can see it in all departments  he used to sit by the hour in the little garden of the pension with a roll of american newspapers in his lap and his high hat pushed back swinging one of his long legs and reading the new york herald  he paid a daily visit to the american bankers on the other side of the rhone and remained there a long time turning over the old papers on the green velvet table in the middle of the salon des etrangers and fraternising with chance compatriots  but in spite of these diversions his time hung heavily upon his hands  i used sometimes to propose to him to take a walk but he had a mortal horror of pedestrianism and regarded my own taste for it as a morbid form of activity  youll kill yourself if you dont look out he said walking all over the country  i dont want to walk round that way i aint a postman  briefly speaking mr ruck had few resources  his wife and daughter on the other hand it was to be supposed were possessed of a good many that could not be apparent to an unobtrusive young man  they also sat a great deal in the garden or in the salon side by side with folded hands contemplating material objects and were remarkably independent of most of the usual feminine aids to idlenesslight literature tapestry the use of the piano  they were however much fonder of locomotion than their companion and i often met them in the rue du rhone and on the quays loitering in front of the jewellers windows  they might have had a cavalier in the person of old m pigeonneau who possessed a high appreciation of their charms but who owing to the absence of a common idiom was deprived of the pleasures of intimacy  he knew no english and mrs ruck and her daughter had as it seemed an incurable mistrust of the beautiful tongue which as the old man endeavoured to impress upon them was preeminently the language of conversation  they have a tournure de princessea distinction supreme he said to me  one is surprised to find them in a little pension at seven francs a day  oh they dont come for economy i answered  they must be rich  they dont come for my beaux yeuxfor mine said m pigeonneau sadly  perhaps its for yours young man  je vous recommande la mere  i reflected a moment  they came on account of mr ruckbecause at hotels hes so restless  m pigeonneau gave me a knowing nod  of course he is with such a wife as thata femme superbe  madame ruck is preserved in perfectiona miraculous fraicheur  i like those large fair quiet women they are often dans lintimite the most agreeable  ill warrant you that at heart madame ruck is a finished coquette  i rather doubt it i said  you suppose her cold  ne vous y fiez pas  it is a matter in which i have nothing at stake  you young americans are droll said m pigeonneau you never have anything at stake but the little one for example ill warrant you shes not cold  she is admirably made  she is very pretty  she is very pretty  vous dites cela dun ton  when you pay compliments to mademoiselle ruck i hope thats not the way you do it  i dont pay compliments to mademoiselle ruck  ah decidedly said m pigeonneau you young americans are droll  i should have suspected that these two ladies would not especially commend themselves to madame beaurepas that as a maitresse de salon which she in some degree aspired to be she would have found them wanting in a certain flexibility of deportment  but i should have gone quite wrong madame beaurepas had no fault at all to find with her new pensionnaires  i have no observation whatever to make about them she said to me one evening  i see nothing in those ladies which is at all deplace  they dont complain of anything they dont meddle they take whats given them they leave me tranquil  the americans are often like that  often but not always madame beaurepas pursued  we are to have a specimen tomorrow of a very different sort  an american i inquired  two americainesa mother and a daughter  there are americans and americans  when you are difficiles you are more so than any one and when you have pretensionsah per exemple its serious  i foresee that with this little lady everything will be serious beginning with her cafe au lait  she has been staying at the pension chamoussetmy concurrent you know farther up the street but she is coming away because the coffee is bad  she holds to her coffee it appears  i dont know what liquid madame chamousset may have invented but we will do the best we can for her  only i know she will make me des histoires about something else  she will demand a new lamp for the salon vous alles voir cela  she wishes to pay but eleven francs a day for herself and her daughter tout compris and for their eleven francs they expect to be lodged like princesses but she is very ladylikeisnt that what you call it in english oh pour cela she is ladylike  i caught a glimpse on the morrow of this ladylike person who was arriving at her new residence as i came in from a walk  she had come in a cab with her daughter and her luggage and with an air of perfect softness and serenity she was disputing the fare as she stood among her boxes on the steps  she addressed her cabman in a very english accent but with extreme precision and correctness  i wish to be perfectly reasonable but i dont wish to encourage you in exorbitant demands  with a franc and a half you are sufficiently paid  it is not the custom at geneva to give a pourboire for so short a drive  i have made inquiries and i find it is not the custom even in the best families  i am a stranger yes but i always adopt the custom of the native families  i think it my duty toward the natives  but i am a native too moi said the cabman with an angry laugh  you seem to me to speak with a german accent continued the lady you are probably from basel  a franc and a half is sufficient  i see you have left behind the little red bag which i asked you to hold between your knees you will please to go back to the other house and get it  very well if you are impolite i will make a complaint of you tomorrow at the administration  aurora you will find a pencil in the outer pocket of my embroidered satchel please to write down his number87 do you see it distinctlyin case we should forget it  the young lady addressed as auroraa slight fair girl holding a large parcel of umbrellasstood at hand while this allocution went forward but she apparently gave no heed to it  she stood looking about her in a listless manner at the front of the house at the corridor at celestine tucking up her apron in the doorway at me as i passed in amid the disseminated luggage her mothers parsimonious attitude seeming to produce in miss aurora neither sympathy nor embarrassment  at dinner the two ladies were placed on the same side of the table as myself below mrs ruck and her daughter my own position being on the right of mr ruck  i had therefore little observation of mrs churchsuch i learned to be her namebut i occasionally heard her soft distinct voice  white wine if you please we prefer white wine  there is none on the table  then you will please to get some and to remember to place a bottle of it always here between my daughter and myself  that lady seems to know what she wants said mr ruck and she speaks so i can understand her  i cant understand every one over here  i should like to make that ladys acquaintance  perhaps she knows what i want too it seems hard to find out  but i dont want any of their sour white wine thats one of the things i dont want  i expect shell be an addition to the pension  mr ruck made the acquaintance of mrs church that evening in the parlour being presented to her by his wife who presumed on the rights conferred upon herself by the mutual proximity at table of the two ladies  i suspected that in mrs churchs view mrs ruck presumed too far  the fugitive from the pension chamousset as m pigeonneau called her was a little fresh plump comely woman looking less than her age with a round bright serious face  she was very simply and frugally dressed not at all in the manner of mr rucks companions and she had an air of quiet distinction which was an excellent defensive weapon  she exhibited a polite disposition to listen to what mr ruck might have to say but her manner was equivalent to an intimation that what she valued least in boarding house life was its social opportunities  she had placed herself near a lamp after carefully screwing it and turning it up and she had opened in her lap with the assistance of a large embroidered marker an octavo volume which i perceived to be in german  to mrs ruck and her daughter she was evidently a puzzle with her economical attire and her expensive culture  the two younger ladies however had begun to fraternise very freely and miss ruck presently went wandering out of the room with her arm round the waist of miss church  it was a very warm evening the long windows of the salon stood wide open into the garden and inspired by the balmy darkness m pigeonneau and mademoiselle beaurepas a most obliging little woman who lisped and always wore a huge cravat declared they would organise a fete de nuit  they engaged in this undertaking and the fete developed itself consisting of halfadozen red paper lanterns hung about on the trees and of several glasses of sirop carried on a tray by the stoutarmed celestine  as the festival deepened to its climax i went out into the garden where m pigeonneau was master of ceremonies  but where are those charming young ladies he cried miss ruck and the newcomer laimable transfuge  their absence has been remarked and they are wanting to the brilliancy of the occasion  voyez i have selected a glass of syrupa generous glassfor mademoiselle ruck and i advise you my young friend if you wish to make a good impression to put aside one which you may offer to the other young lady  what is her name  miss church  i see its a singular name there is a church in which i would willingly worship  mr ruck presently came out of the salon having concluded his interview with mrs church  through the open window i saw the latter lady sitting under the lamp with her german octavo while mrs ruck established emptyhanded in an armchair near her gazed at her with an air of fascination  well i told you she would know what i want said mr ruck  she says i want to go up to appenzell wherever that is that i want to drink whey and live in a high latitudewhat did she call ita high altitude  she seemed to think we ought to leave for appenzell to morrow shed got it all fixed  she says this aint a high enough lata high enough altitude  and she says i mustnt go too high either that would be just as bad she seems to know just the right figure  she says shell give me a list of the hotels where we must stop on the way to appenzell  i asked her if she didnt want to go with as but she says shed rather sit still and read  i expect shes a big reader  the daughter of this accomplished woman now reappeared in company with miss ruck with whom she had been strolling through the outlying parts of the garden  well said miss ruck glancing at the red paper lanterns are they trying to stick the flowerpots into the trees  its an illumination in honour of our arrival the other young girl rejoined  its a triumph over madame chamousset  meanwhile at the pension chamousset i ventured to suggest they have put out their lights they are sitting in darkness lamenting your departure  she looked at me smiling she was standing in the light that came from the house  m pigeonneau meanwhile who had been awaiting his chance advanced to miss ruck with his glass of syrup  i have kept it for you mademoiselle he said i have jealously guarded it  it is very delicious  miss ruck looked at him and his syrup without any motion to take the glass  well i guess its sour she said in a moment and she gave a little shake of her head  m pigeonneau stood staring with his syrup in his hand then he slowly turned away  he looked about at the rest of us as if to appeal from miss rucks insensibility and went to deposit his rejected tribute on a bench  wont you give it to me asked miss church in faultless french jadore le sirop moi  m pigeonneau came back with alacrity and presented the glass with a very low bow  i adore good manners murmured the old man  this incident caused me to look at miss church with quickened interest  she was not strikingly pretty but in her charming irregular face there was something brilliant and ardent  like her mother she was very simply dressed  she wants to go to america and her mother wont let her said miss sophy to me explaining her companions situation  i am very sorryfor america i answered laughing  well i dont want to say anything against your mother but i think its shameful miss ruck pursued  mamma has very good reasons she will tell you them all  well im sure i dont want to hear them said miss ruck  you have got a right to go to your own country every one has a right to go to their own country  mamma is not very patriotic said aurora church smiling  well i call that dreadful her companion declared  i have heard that there are some americans like that but i never believed it  there are all sorts of americans i said laughing  auroras one of the right sort rejoined miss ruck who had apparently become very intimate with her new friend  are you very patriotic i asked of the young girl  shes right down homesick said miss sophy shes dying to go  if i were you my mother would have to take me  mamma is going to take me to dresden  well i declare i never heard of anything so dreadful cried miss ruck  its like something in a story  i never heard there was anything very dreadful in dresden i interposed  miss ruck looked at me a moment  well i dont believe you are a good american she replied and i never supposed you were  you had better go in there and talk to mrs church  dresden is really very nice isnt it i asked of her companion  it isnt nice if you happen to prefer new york said miss sophy miss church prefers new york  tell him you are dying to see new york it will make him angry she went on  i have no desire to make him angry said aurora smiling  it is only miss ruck who can do that i rejoined  have you been a long time in europe  always  i call that wicked miss sophy declared  you might be in a worse place i continued  i find europe very interesting  miss ruck gave a little laugh  i was saying that you wanted to pass for a european  yes i want to pass for a dalmatian  miss ruck looked at me a moment  well you had better not come home she said  no one will speak to you  were you born in these countries i asked of her companion  oh no i came to europe when i was a small child  but i remember america a little and it seems delightful  wait till you see it again  its just too lovely said miss sophy  its the grandest country in the world i added  miss ruck began to toss her head  come away my dear she said if theres a creature i despise its a man that tries to say funny things about his own country  dont you think one can be tired of europe aurora asked lingering  possiblyafter many years  father was tired of it after three weeks said miss ruck  i have been here sixteen years her friend went on looking at me with a charming intentness as if she had a purpose in speaking  it used to be for my education  i dont know what its for now  shes beautifully educated said miss ruck  she knows four languages  i am not very sure that i know english  you should go to boston cried miss sophy  they speak splendidly in boston  cest mon reve said aurora still looking at me  have you been all over europe i askedin all the different countries  she hesitated a moment  everywhere that theres a pension  mamma is devoted to pensions  we have lived at one time or another in every pension in europe  well i should think you had seen about enough said miss ruck  its a delightful way of seeing europe aurora rejoined with her brilliant smile  you may imagine how it has attached me to the different countries  i have such charming souvenirs  there is a pension awaiting us now at dresdeneight francs a day without wine  thats rather dear  mamma means to make them give us wine mamma is a great authority on pensions she is known that way all over europe  last winter we were in italy and she discovered one at piacenzafour francs a day  we made economies  your mother doesnt seem to mingle much observed miss ruck glancing through the window at the scholastic attitude of mrs church  no she doesnt mingle except in the native society  though she lives in pensions she detests them  why does she live in them then asked miss sophy rather resentfully  oh because we are so poor its the cheapest way to live  we have tried having a cook but the cook always steals  mamma used to set me to watch her thats the way i passed my jeunessemy belle jeunesse  we are frightfully poor the young girl went on with the same strange franknessa curious mixture of girlish grace and conscious cynicism  nous navons pas le sou  thats one of the reasons we dont go back to america mamma says we cant afford to live there  well any one can see that youre an american girl miss ruck remarked in a consolatory manner  i can tell an american girl a mile off  youve got the american style  im afraid i havent the american toilette said aurora looking at the others superior splendour  well your dress was cut in france any one can see that  yes said aurora with a laugh my dress was cut in franceat avranches  well youve got a lovely figure any way pursued her companion  ah said the young girl at avranches too my figure was admired  and she looked at me askance with a certain coquetry but i was an innocent youth and i only looked back at her wondering  she was a great deal nicer than miss ruck and yet miss ruck would not have said that  i try to be like an american girl she continued i do my best though mamma doesnt at all encourage it  i am very patriotic  i try to copy them though mamma has brought me up a la francaise that is as much as one can in pensions  for instance i have never been out of the house without mamma oh never never  but sometimes i despair american girls are so wonderfully frank  i cant be frank like that  i am always afraid  but i do what i can as you see  excusez du peu  i thought this young lady at least as outspoken as most of her unexpatriated sisters there was something almost comical in her despondency  but she had by no means caught as it seemed to me the american tone  whatever her tone was however it had a fascination there was something dainty about it and yet it was decidedly audacious  the young ladies began to stroll about the garden again and i enjoyed their society until m pigeonneaus festival came to an end    chapter v    mr ruck did not take his departure for appenzell on the morrow in spite of the eagerness to witness such an event which he had attributed to mrs church  he continued on the contrary for many days after to hang about the garden to wander up to the bankers and back again to engage in desultory conversation with his fellow boarders and to endeavour to assuage his constitutional restlessness by perusal of the american journals  but on the morrow i had the honour of making mrs churchs acquaintance  she came into the salon after the midday breakfast with her german octavo under her arm and she appealed to me for assistance in selecting a quiet corner  would you very kindly she said move that large fauteuil a little more this way  not the largest the one with the little cushion the fauteuils here are very insufficient i must ask madame beaurepas for another  thank you a little more to the left please that will do  are you particularly engaged she inquired after she had seated herself  if not i should like to have some conversation with you  it is some time since i have met a young american of your what shall i call ityour affiliations  i have learned your name from madame beaurepas i think i used to know some of your people  i dont know what has become of all my friends  i used to have a charming little circle at home but now i meet no one i know  dont you think there is a great difference between the people one meets and the people one would like to meet  fortunately sometimes added my interlocutress graciously its quite the same  i suppose you are a specimen a favourable specimen she went on of young america  tell me now what is young america thinking of in these days of ours  what are its feelings its opinions its aspirations what is its ideal  i had seated myself near mrs church and she had pointed this interrogation with the gaze of her bright little eyes  i felt it embarrassing to be treated as a favourable specimen of young america and to be expected to answer for the great republic  observing my hesitation mrs church clasped her hands on the open page of her book and gave an intense melancholy smile has it an ideal she softly asked  well we must talk of this she went on without insisting  speak for the present for yourself simply  have you come to europe with any special design  nothing to boast of i said  i am studying a little  ah i am glad to hear that  you are gathering up a little european culture thats what we lack you know at home  no individual can do much of coarse  but you must not be discouraged every little counts  i see that you at least are doing your part i rejoined gallantly dropping my eyes on my companions learned volume  yes i frankly admit that i am fond of study  there is no one after all like the germans  that is for facts  for opinions i by no means always go with them  i form my opinions myself  i am sorry to say however mrs church continued that i can hardly pretend to diffuse my acquisitions  i am afraid i am sadly selfish i do little to irrigate the soil  i belongi frankly confess itto the class of absentees  i had the pleasure last evening i said of making the acquaintance of your daughter  she told me you had been a long time in europe  mrs church smiled benignantly  can one ever be too long  we shall never leave it  your daughter wont like that i said smiling too  has she been taking you into her confidence  she is a more sensible young lady than she sometimes appears  i have taken great pains with her she is reallyi may be permitted to say itsuperbly educated  she seemed to me a very charming girl i rejoined  and i learned that she speaks four languages  it is not only that said mrs church in a tone which suggested that this might be a very superficial species of culture  she has made what we call de fortes etudessuch as i suppose you are making now  she is familiar with the results of modern science she keeps pace with the new historical school  ah said i she has gone much farther than i  you doubtless think i exaggerate and you force me therefore to mention the fact that i am able to speak of such matters with a certain intelligence  that is very evident i said  but your daughter thinks you ought to take her home  i began to fear as soon as i had uttered these words that they savoured of treachery to the young lady but i was reassured by seeing that they produced on her mothers placid countenance no symptom whatever of irritation  my daughter has her little theories mrs church observed she has i may say her illusions  and what wonder what would youth be without its illusions  aurora has a theory that she would be happier in new york in boston in philadelphia than in one of the charming old cities in which our lot is cast  but she is mistaken that is all  we must allow our children their illusions must we not  but we must watch over them  although she herself seemed proof against discomposure i found something vaguely irritating in her soft sweet positiveness  american cities i said are the paradise of young girls  do you mean asked mrs church that the young girls who come from those places are angels  yes i said resolutely  this young ladywhat is her odd namewith whom my daughter has formed a somewhat precipitate acquaintance  is miss ruck an angel but i wont force you to say anything uncivil  it would be too cruel to make a single exception  well said i at any rate in america young girls have an easier lot  they have much more liberty  my companion laid her hand for an instant on my arm  my dear young friend i know america i know the conditions of life there so well there is perhaps no subject on which i have reflected more than on our national idiosyncrasies  i am afraid you dont approve of them said i a little brutally  brutal indeed my proposition was and mrs church was not prepared to assent to it in this rough shape  she dropped her eyes on her book with an air of acute meditation  then raising them we are very crude she softly observedwe are very crude  lest even this delicatelyuttered statement should seem to savour of the vice that she deprecated she went on to explain  there are two classes of minds you knowthose that hold back and those that push forward my daughter and i are not pushers we move with little steps  we like the old trodden paths we like the old old world  ah said i you know what you like there is a great virtue in that  yes we like europe we prefer it  we like the opportunities of europe we like the rest  there is so much in that you know  the world seems to me to be hurrying pressing forward so fiercely without knowing where it is going  whither i often ask in my little quiet way  but i have yet to learn that any one can tell me  youre a great conservative i observed while i wondered whether i myself could answer this inquiry  mrs church gave me a smile which was equivalent to a confession  i wish to retain a littlejust a little  surely we have done so much we might rest a while we might pause  that is all my feeling just to stop a little to wait i have seen so many changes  i wish to draw in to draw into hold back to hold back  you shouldnt hold your daughter back i answered laughing and getting up  i got up not by way of terminating our interview for i perceived mrs churchs exposition of her views to be by no means complete but in order to offer a chair to miss aurora who at this moment drew near  she thanked me and remained standing but without at first as i noticed meeting her mothers eye  you have been engaged with your new acquaintance my dear this lady inquired  yes mamma dear said the young girl gently  do you find her very edifying  aurora was silent a moment then she looked at her mother  i dont know mamma she is very fresh  i ventured to indulge in a respectful laugh  your mother has another word for that  but i must not i added be crude  ah vous men voulez inquired mrs church  and yet i cant pretend i said it in jest  i feel it too much  we have been having a little social discussion she said to her daughter  there is still so much to be said  and i wish she continued turning to me that i could give you our point of view  dont you wish aurora that we could give him our point of view  yes mamma said aurora  we consider ourselves very fortunate in our point of view dont we dearest mamma demanded  very fortunate indeed mamma  you see we have acquired an insight into european life the elder lady pursued  we have our place at many a european fireside  we find so much to esteemso much to enjoy  do we not my daughter  so very much mamma the young girl went on with a sort of inscrutable submissiveness  i wondered at it it offered so strange a contrast to the mocking freedom of her tone the night before but while i wondered i was careful not to let my perplexity take precedence of my good manners  i dont know what you ladies may have found at european firesides i said but there can be very little doubt what you have left there  mrs church got up to acknowledge my compliment  we have spent some charming hours  and that reminds me that we have just now such an occasion in prospect  we are to call upon some genevese friends the family of the pasteur galopin  they are to go with us to the old library at the hotel de ville where there are some very interesting documents of the period of the reformation we are promised a glimpse of some manuscripts of poor servetus the antagonist and victim you know of calvin  here of course one can only speak of calvin under ones breath but some day when we are more private and mrs church looked round the room i will give you my view of him  i think it has a touch of originality  aurora is familiar with are you not my daughter familiar with my view of calvin  yes mamma said aurora with docility while the two ladies went to prepare for their visit to the pasteur galopin    chapter vi    she has demanded a new lamp i told you she would  this communication was made me by madame beaurepas a couple of days later and she has asked for a new tapis de lit and she has requested me to provide celestine with a pair of light shoes  i told her that as a general thing cooks are not shod with satin  that poor celestine  mrs church may be exacting i said but she is a clever little woman  a lady who pays but five francs and a half shouldnt be too clever cest deplace  i dont like the type  what type do you call mrs churchs  mon dieu said madame beaurepas cest une de ces mamans comme vous en avez qui promenent leur fille  she is trying to marry her daughter  i dont think shes of that sort  but madame beaurepas shrewdly held to her idea  she is trying it in her own way she does it very quietly  she doesnt want an american she wants a foreigner  and she wants a mari serieux  but she is travelling over europe in search of one  she would like a magistrate  a magistrate  a gros bonnet of some kind a professor or a deputy  i am very sorry for the poor girl i said laughing  you neednt pity her too much shes a sly thing  ah for that no i exclaimed  shes a charming girl  madame beaurepas gave an elderly grin  she has hooked you eh  but the mother wont have you  i developed my idea without heeding this insinuation  shes a charming girl but she is a little odd  its a necessity of her position  she is less submissive to her mother than she has to pretend to be  thats in selfdefence its to make her life possible  she wishes to get away from her mother continued madame beaurepas she wishes to courir les champs  she wishes to go to america her native country  precisely  and she will certainly go  i hope so i rejoined  some fine morningor eveningshe will go off with a young man probably with a young american  allons donc said i with disgust  that will be quite america enough pursued my cynical hostess  i have kept a boardinghouse for forty years  i have seen that type  have such things as that happened chez vous i asked  everything has happened chez moi  but nothing has happened more than once  therefore this wont happen here  it will be at the next place they go to or the next  besides here there is no young american pour la partienone except you monsieur  you are susceptible but you are too reasonable  its lucky for you i am reasonable i answered  its thanks to that fact that you escape a scolding  one morning about this time instead of coming back to breakfast at the pension after my lectures at the academy i went to partake of this meal with a fellowstudent at an ancient eatinghouse in the collegiate quarter  on separating from my friend i took my way along that charming public walk known in geneva as the treille a shady terrace of immense elevation overhanging a portion of the lower town  there are spreading trees and wellworn benches and over the tiles and chimneys of the ville basse there is a view of the snowcrested alps  on the other side as you turn your back to the view the promenade is overlooked by a row of tall soberfaced hotels the dwellings of the local aristocracy  i was very fond of the place and often resorted to it to stimulate my sense of the picturesque  presently as i lingered there on this occasion i became aware that a gentleman was seated not far from where i stood with his back to the alpine chain which this morning was brilliant and distinct and a newspaper unfolded in his lap  he was not reading however he was staring before him in gloomy contemplation i dont know whether i recognised first the newspaper or its proprietor one in either case would have helped me to identify the other  one was the new york herald the other of course was mr ruck  as i drew nearer he transferred his eyes from the stony highfeatured masks of the gray old houses on the other side of the terrace and i knew by the expression of his face just how he had been feeling about these distinguished abodes  he had made up his mind that their proprietors were a dusky narrowminded unsociable company plunging their roots into a superfluous past  i endeavoured therefore as i sat down beside him to suggest something more impersonal  thats a beautiful view of the alps i observed  yes said mr ruck without moving ive examined it  fine thing in its wayfine thing  beauties of naturethat sort of thing  we came up on purpose to look at it  your ladies then have been with you  yes they are just walking round  theyre awfully restless  they keep saying im restless but im as quiet as a sleeping child to them  it takes he added in a moment drily the form of shopping  are they shopping now  well if they aint theyre trying to  they told me to sit here a while and theyd just walk round  i generally know what that means but thats the principal interest for ladies he added retracting his irony  we thought wed come up here and see the cathedral mrs church seemed to think it a dead loss that we shouldnt see the cathedral especially as we hadnt seen many yet  and i had to come up to the bankers any way  well we certainly saw the cathedral  i dont know as we are any the better for it and i dont know as i should know it again  but we saw it any way  i dont know as i should want to go there regularly but i suppose it will give us in conversation a kind of hold on mrs church eh  i guess we want something of that kind  well mr ruck continued i stepped in at the bankers to see if there wasnt something and they handed me out a herald  i hope the herald is full of good news i said  cant say it is  dd bad news  political i inquired or commercial  oh hang politics  its business sir  there aint any business its all gone toand mr ruck became profane  nine failures in one day  what do you sayto that  i hope they havent injured you i said  well they havent helped me much  so many houses on fire thats all  if they happen to take place in your own street they dont increase the value of your property  when mine catches i suppose theyll write and tell meone of these days when theyve got nothing else to do  i didnt get a blessed letter this morning i suppose they think im having such a good time over here its a pity to disturb me  if i could attend to business for about half an hour id find out something  but i cant and its no use talking  the state of my health was never so unsatisfactory as it was about five oclock this morning  i am very sorry to hear that i said and i recommend you strongly not to think of business  i dont mr ruck replied  im thinking of cathedrals im thinking of the beauties of nature  come he went on turning round on the bench and leaning his elbow on the parapet ill think of those mountains over there they are pretty certainly  cant you get over there  over where  over to those hills  dont they run a train right up  you can go to chamouni i said  you can go to grindelwald and zermatt and fifty other places  you cant go by rail but you can drive  all right well driveand not in a onehorse concern either yes chamouni is one of the places we put down  i hope there are a few nice shops in chamouni  mr ruck spoke with a certain quickened emphasis and in a tone more explicitly humorous than he commonly employed  i thought he was excited and yet he had not the appearance of excitement  he looked like a man who has simply taken in the face of disaster a sudden somewhat imaginative resolution not to worry  he presently twisted himself about on his bench again and began to watch for his companions  well they are walking round he resumed i guess theyve hit on something somewhere and theyve got a carriage waiting outside of that archway too  they seem to do a big business in archways here dont they  they like to have a carriage to carry home the thingsthose ladies of mine  then theyre sure theyve got them  the ladies after this to do them justice were not very long in appearing  they came toward us from under the archway to which mr ruck had somewhat invidiously alluded slowly and with a rather exhausted step and expression  my companion looked at them a moment as they advanced  theyre tired he said softly  when theyre tired like that its very expensive  well said mrs ruck im glad youve had some company  her husband looked at her in silence through narrowed eyelids and i suspected that this gracious observation on the ladys part was prompted by a restless conscience  miss sophy glanced at me with her little straightforward air of defiance  it would have been more proper if we had had the company why didnt you come after us instead of sitting there she asked of mr rucks companion  i was told by your father i explained that you were engaged in sacred rites  miss ruck was not gracious though i doubt whether it was because her conscience was better than her mothers  well for a gentleman there is nothing so sacred as ladies society replied miss ruck in the manner of a person accustomed to giving neat retorts  i suppose you refer to the cathedral said her mother  well i must say we didnt go back there  i dont know what it may be of a sunday but it gave me a chill  we discovered the loveliest little laceshop observed the young girl with a serenity that was superior to bravado  her father looked at her a while then turned about again leaning on the parapet and gazed away at the hills  well it was certainly cheap said mrs ruck also contemplating the alps  we are going to chamouni said her husband  you havent any occasion for lace at chamouni  well im glad to hear you have decided to go somewhere rejoined his wife  i dont want to be a fixture at a boardinghouse  you can wear lace anywhere said miss ruck if you pat it on right  thats the great thing with lace  i dont think they know how to wear lace in europe  i know how i mean to wear mine but i mean to keep it till i get home  her father transferred his melancholy gaze to her elaborately appointed little person there was a great deal of very newlooking detail in miss rucks appearance  then in a tone of voice quite out of consonance with his facial despondency have you purchased a great deal he inquired  i have purchased enough for you to make a fuss about  he cant make a fuss about that said mrs ruck  well youll see declared the young girl with a little sharp laugh  but her father went on in the same tone  have you got it in your pocket  why dont you put it onwhy dont you hang it round you  ill hang it round you if you dont look out cried miss sophy  dont you want to show it to this gentleman mr ruck continued  mercy how you do talk about that lace said his wife  well i want to be lively  theres every reason for it were going to chamouni  youre restless thats whats the matter with you  and mrs ruck got up  no i aint said her husband  i never felt so quiet i feel as peaceful as a little child  mrs ruck who had no sense whatever of humour looked at her daughter and at me  well i hope youll improve she said  send in the bills mr ruck went on rising to his feet  dont hesitate sophy  i dont care what you do now  in for a penny in for a pound  miss ruck joined her mother with a little toss of her head and we followed the ladies to the carriage  in your place said miss sophy to her father i wouldnt talk so much about pennies and pounds before strangers  poor mr ruck appeared to feel the force of this observation which in the consciousness of a man who had never been mean could hardly fail to strike a responsive chord  he coloured a little and he was silent his companions got into their vehicle the front seat of which was adorned with a large parcel  mr ruck gave the parcel a little poke with his umbrella and then turning to me with a rather grimly penitential smile after all he said for the ladies thats the principal interest    chapter vii    old m pigeonneau had more than once proposed to me to take a walk but i had hitherto been unable to respond to so alluring an invitation  it befell however one afternoon that i perceived him going forth upon a desultory stroll with a certain lonesomeness of demeanour that attracted my sympathy  i hastily overtook him and passed my hand into his venerable arm a proceeding which produced in the good old man so jovial a sense of comradeship that he ardently proposed we should bend our steps to the english garden no locality less festive was worthy of the occasion  to the english garden accordingly we went it lay beyond the bridge beside the lake  it was very pretty and very animated there was a band playing in the middle and a considerable number of persons sitting under the small trees on benches and little chairs or strolling beside the blue water  we joined the strollers we observed our companions and conversed on obvious topics  some of these last of course were the pretty women who embellished the scene and who in the light of m pigeonneaus comprehensive criticism appeared surprisingly numerous he seemed bent upon our making up our minds as to which was the prettiest and as this was an innocent game i consented to play at it  suddenly m pigeonneau stopped pressing my arm with the liveliest emotion  la voila la voila the prettiest he quickly murmured coming toward us in a blue dress with the other  it was at the other i was looking for the other to my surprise was our interesting fellowpensioner the daughter of a vigilant mother  m pigeonneau meanwhile had redoubled his exclamations he had recognised miss sophy ruck  oh la belle rencontre nos aimables convives the prettiest girl in the world in effect  we immediately greeted and joined the young ladies who like ourselves were walking arm in arm and enjoying the scene  i was citing you with admiration to my friend even before i had recognised you said m pigeonneau to miss ruck  i dont believe in french compliments remarked this young lady presenting her back to the smiling old man  are you and miss ruck walking alone i asked of her companion you had better accept of m pigeonneaus gallant protection and of mine  aurora church had taken her hand out of miss rucks arm she looked at me smiling with her head a little inclined while upon her shoulder she made her open parasol revolve  which is most improperto walk alone or to walk with gentlemen  i wish to do what is most improper  what mysterious logic governs your conduct i inquired  he thinks you cant understand him when he talks like that said miss ruck  but i do understand you always  so i have always ventured to hope my dear miss ruck  well if i didnt it wouldnt be much loss rejoined this young lady  allons en marche cried m pigeonneau smiling still and undiscouraged by her inhumanity  let as make together the tour of the garden  and he imposed his society upon miss ruck with a respectful elderly grace which was evidently unable to see anything in her reluctance but modesty and was sublimely conscious of a mission to place modesty at its ease  this illassorted couple walked in front while aurora church and i strolled along together  i am sure this is more improper said my companion this is delightfully improper  i dont say that as a compliment to you she added  i would say it to any man no matter how stupid  oh i am very stupid i answered but this doesnt seem to me wrong  not for you no only for me  there is nothing that a man can do that is wrong is there  en morale you know i mean  ah yes he can steal but i think there is nothing else is there  i dont know  one doesnt know those things until after one has done them  then one is enlightened  and you mean that you have never been enlightened  you make yourself out very good  that is better than making ones self out bad as you do  the young girl glanced at me a moment and then with her charming smile thats one of the consequences of a false position  is your position false i inquired smiling too at this large formula  distinctly so  in what way  oh in every way  for instance i have to pretend to be a jeune fille  i am not a jeune fille no american girl is a jeune fille an american girl is an intelligent responsible creature  i have to pretend to be very innocent but i am not very innocent  you dont pretend to be very innocent you pretend to bewhat shall i call itvery wise  thats no pretence  i am wise  you are not an american girl i ventured to observe  my companion almost stopped looking at me there was a little flush in her cheek  voila she said  theres my false position  i want to be an american girl and im not  do you want me to tell you i went on  an american girl wouldnt talk as you are talking now  please tell me said aurora church with expressive eagerness how would she talk  i cant tell you all the things an american girl would say but i think i can tell you the things she wouldnt say  she wouldnt reason out her conduct as you seem to me to do  aurora gave me the most flattering attention  i see  she would be simpler  to do very simple things that are not at all simplethat is the american girl  i permitted myself a small explosion of hilarity  i dont know whether you are a french girl or what you are i said but you are very witty  ah you mean that i strike false notes cried aurora church sadly thats just what i want to avoid  i wish you would always tell me  the conversational union between miss ruck and her neighbour in front of us had evidently not become a close one  the young lady suddenly turned round to us with a question  dont you want some icecream  she doesnt strike false notes i murmured  there was a kind of pavilion or kiosk which served as a cafe and at which the delicacies procurable at such an establishment were dispensed  miss ruck pointed to the little green tables and chairs which were set out on the gravel m pigeonneau fluttering with a sense of dissipation seconded the proposal and we presently sat down and gave our order to a nimble attendant  i managed again to place myself next to aurora church our companions were on the other side of the table  my neighbour was delighted with our situation  this is best of all she said  i never believed i should come to a cafe with two strange men now you cant persuade me this isnt wrong  to make it wrong we ought to see your mother coming down that path  ah my mother makes everything wrong said the young girl attacking with a little spoon in the shape of a spade the apex of a pink ice  and then she returned to her idea of a moment before you must promise to tell meto warn me in some waywhenever i strike a false note  you must give a little cough like thatahem  you will keep me very busy and people will think i am in a consumption  voyons she continued why have you never talked to me more  is that a false note  why havent you been attentive  thats what american girls call it thats what miss ruck calls it  i assured myself that our companions were out of earshot and that miss ruck was much occupied with a large vanilla cream  because you are always entwined with that young lady  there is no getting near you  aurora looked at her friend while the latter devoted herself to her ice  you wonder why i like her so much i suppose  so does mamma elle sy perd  i dont like her particularly je nen suis pas folle  but she gives me information she tells me about america mamma has always tried to prevent my knowing anything about it and i am all the more curious  and then miss ruck is very fresh  i may not be so fresh as miss ruck i said but in future when you want information i recommend you to come to me for it  our friend offers to take me to america she invites me to go back with her to stay with her  you couldnt do that could you and the young girl looked at me a moment  bon a false note i can see it by your face you remind me of a maitre de piano  you overdo the characterthe poor american girl i said  are you going to stay with that delightful family  i will go and stay with any one that will take me or ask me  its a real nostalgie  she says that in new yorkin thirtyseventh street i should have the most lovely time  i have no doubt you would enjoy it  absolute liberty to begin with  it seems to me you have a certain liberty here i rejoined  ah this  oh i shall pay for this  i shall be punished by mamma and i shall be lectured by madame galopin  the wife of the pasteur  his digne epouse  madame galopin for mamma is the incarnation of european opinion  thats what vexes me with mamma her thinking so much of people like madame galopin  going to see madame galopin mamma calls that being in european society  european society  im so sick of that expression i have heard it since i was six years old  who is madame galopinwho thinks anything of her here  she is nobody she is perfectly thirdrate  if i like america better than mamma i also know europe better  but your mother certainly i objected a trifle timidly for my young lady was excited and had a charming little passion in her eye your mother has a great many social relations all over the continent  she thinks so but half the people dont care for us  they are not so good as we and they know itill do them that justiceand they wonder why we should care for them  when we are polite to them they think the less of us there are plenty of people like that  mamma thinks so much of them simply because they are foreigners  if i could tell you all the dull stupid secondrate people i have had to talk to for no better reason than that they were de leur pays germans french italians turks everything  when i complain mamma always says that at any rate its practice in the language  and she makes so much of the english too i dont know what thats practice in  before i had time to suggest an hypothesis as regards this latter point i saw something that made me rise with a certain solemnity from my chair  this was nothing less than the neat little figure of mrs churcha perfect model of the femme comme il fautapproaching our table with an impatient step and followed most unexpectedly in her advance by the preeminent form of mr ruck  she had evidently come in quest of her daughter and if she had commanded this gentlemans attendance it had been on no softer ground than that of his unenvied paternity to her guilty childs accomplice  my movement had given the alarm and aurora church and m pigeonneau got up miss ruck alone did not in the local phrase derange herself  mrs church beneath her modest little bonnet looked very serious but not at all fluttered she came straight to her daughter who received her with a smile and then she looked all round at the rest of us very fixedly and tranquilly without bowing  i must do both these ladies the justice to mention that neither of them made the least little scene  i have come for you dearest said the mother  yes dear mamma  come for youcome for you mrs church repeated looking down at the relics of our little feast  i was obliged to ask mr rucks assistance  i was puzzled i thought a long time  well mrs church i was glad to see you puzzled once in your life said mr ruck with friendly jocosity  but you came pretty straight for all that  i had hard work to keep up with you  we will take a cab aurora mrs church went on without heeding this pleasantrya closed one  come my daughter  yes dear mamma  the young girl was blushing yet she was still smiling she looked round at us all and as her eyes met mine i thought she was beautiful  goodbye she said to us  i have had a lovely time  we must not linger said her mother it is five oclock  we are to dine you know with madame galopin  i had quite forgotten aurora declared  that will be charming  do you want me to assist you to carry her back ma am asked mr ruck  mrs church hesitated a moment with her serene little gaze  do you prefer then to leave your daughter to finish the evening with these gentlemen  mr ruck pushed back his hat and scratched the top of his head well i dont know  how would you like that sophy  well i never exclaimed sophy as mrs church marched off with her daughter    chapter viii    i had half expected that mrs church would make me feel the weight of her disapproval of my own share in that little act of revelry in the english garden  but she maintained her claim to being a highly reasonable womani could not but admire the justice of this pretensionby recognising my irresponsibility  i had taken her daughter as i found her which was according to mrs churchs view in a very equivocal position  the natural instinct of a young man in such a situation is not to protest but to profit and it was clear to mrs church that i had had nothing to do with miss auroras appearing in public under the insufficient chaperonage of miss ruck besides she liked to converse and she apparently did me the honour to believe that of all the members of the pension beaurepas i had the most cultivated understanding  i found her in the salon a couple of evenings after the incident i have just narrated and i approached her with a view of making my peace with her if this should prove necessary  but mrs church was as gracious as i could have desired she put her marker into her book and folded her plump little hands on the cover  she made no specific allusion to the english garden she embarked rather upon those general considerations in which her refined intellect was so much at home  always at your studies mrs church i ventured to observe  que voulezvous  to say studies is to say too much one doesnt study in the parlour of a boardinghouse  but i do what i can i have always done what i can  that is all i have ever claimed  no one can do more and you seem to have done a great deal  do you know my secret she asked with an air of brightening confidence  and she paused a moment before she imparted her secret to care only for the best  to do the best to know the bestto have to desire to recognise only the best  thats what i have always done in my quiet little way  i have gone through europe on my devoted little errand seeking seeing heeding only the best and it has not been for myself alone it has been for my daughter my daughter has had the best  we are not rich but i can say that  she has had you madam i rejoined finely  certainly such as i am i have been devoted  we have got something everywhere a little here a little there  thats the real secret to get something everywhere you always can if you are devoted sometimes it has been a little music sometimes a little deeper insight into the history of art every little counts you know sometimes it has been just a glimpse a view a lovely landscape an impression  we have always been on the lookout  sometimes it has been a valued friendship a delightful social tie  here comes the european society the poor daughters bugbear i said to myself  certainly i remarked aloudi admit rather perverselyif you have lived a great deal in pensions you must have got acquainted with lots of people  mrs church dropped her eyes a moment and then with considerable gravity i think the european pension system in many respects remarkable and in some satisfactory  but of the friendships that we have formed few have been contracted in establishments of this kind  i am sorry to hear that i said laughing  i dont say it for you though i might say it for some others  we have been interested in european homes  oh i see  we have the entree of the old genevese society i like its tone  i prefer it to that of mr ruck added mrs church calmly to that of mrs ruck and miss ruckof miss ruck especially  ah the poor rucks havent any tone at all i said dont take them more seriously than they take themselves  tell me this my companion rejoined are they fair examples  examples of what  of our american tendencies  tendencies is a big word dear lady tendencies are difficult to calculate  and you shouldnt abuse those good rucks who have been very kind to your daughter  they have invited her to go and stay with them in thirtyseventh street  aurora has told me  it might be very serious  it might be very droll i said  to me declared mrs church it is simply terrible  i think we shall have to leave the pension beaurepas  i shall go back to madame chamousset  on account of the rucks i asked  pray why dont they go themselves  i have given them some excellent addresseswritten down the very hours of the trains  they were going to appenzell i thought it was arranged  they talk of chamouni now i said but they are very helpless and undecided  i will give them some chamouni addresses  mrs ruck will send a chaise a porteurs i will give her the name of a man who lets them lower than you get them at the hotels  after that they must go  well i doubt i observed whether mr ruck will ever really be seen on the mer de glacein a high hat  hes not like you he doesnt value his european privileges  he takes no interest  he regrets wall street acutely  as his wife says he is very restless but he has no curiosity about chamouni  so you must not depend too much on the effect of your addresses  is it a frequent type asked mrs church with an air of self control  i am afraid so  mr ruck is a brokendown man of business  he is broken down in health and i suspect he is broken down in fortune he has spent his whole life in buying and selling he knows how to do nothing else  his wife and daughter have spent their lives not in selling but in buying and they on their side know how to do nothing else  to get something in a shop that they can put on their backsthat is their one idea they havent another in their heads of course they spend no end of money and they do it with an implacable persistence with a mixture of audacity and of cunning they do it in his teeth and they do it behind his back the mother protects the daughter and the daughter eggs on the mother  between them they are bleeding him to death  ah what a picture murmured mrs church  i am afraid they are veryuncultivated  i share your fears  they are perfectly ignorant they have no resources  the vision of fine clothes occupies their whole imagination  they have not an ideaeven a worse oneto compete with it  poor mr ruck who is extremely goodnatured and soft seems to me a really tragic figure  he is getting bad news every day from home his business is going to the dogs  he is unable to stop it he has to stand and watch his fortunes ebb  he has been used to doing things in a big way and he feels mean if he makes a fuss about bills  so the ladies keep sending them in  but havent they common sense  dont they know they are ruining themselves  they dont believe it  the duty of an american husband and father is to keep them going  if he asks them how thats his own affair so by way of not being mean of being a good american husband and father poor ruck stands staring at bankruptcy  mrs church looked at me a moment in quickened meditation  why if aurora were to go to stay with them she might not even be properly fed  i dont on the whole recommend i said laughing that your daughter should pay a visit to thirtyseventh street  why should i be subjected to such trialsso sadly eprouvee  why should a daughter of mine like that dreadful girl  does she like her  pray do you mean asked my companion softly that aurora is a hypocrite  i hesitated a moment  a little since you ask me  i think you have forced her to be  mrs church answered this possibly presumptuous charge with a tranquil candid exultation  i never force my daughter  she is nevertheless in a false position i rejoined  she hungers and thirsts to go back to her own country she wants to come out in new york which is certainly socially speaking the el dorado of young ladies  she likes any one for the moment who will talk to her of that and serve as a connectinglink with her native shores miss ruck performs this agreeable office  your idea is then that if she were to go with miss ruck to america she would drop her afterwards  i complimented mrs church upon her logical mind but i repudiated this cynical supposition  i cant imagine herwhen it should come to the pointembarking with the famille ruck  but i wish she might go nevertheless  mrs church shook her head serenely and smiled at my inappropriate zeal  i trust my poor child may never be guilty of so fatal a mistake  she is completely in error she is wholly unadapted to the peculiar conditions of american life  it would not please her  she would not sympathise  my daughters ideal is not the ideal of the class of young women to which miss ruck belongs  i fear they are very numerous they give the tonethey give the tone  it is you that are mistaken i said go home for six months and see  i have not unfortunately the means to make costly experiments  my daughter has had great advantagesrare advantagesand i should be very sorry to believe that au fond she does not appreciate them  one thing is certain  i must remove her from this pernicious influence we must part company with this deplorable family  if mr ruck and his ladies cannot be induced to go to chamounia journey that no traveller with the smallest selfrespect would omitmy daughter and i shall be obliged to retire  we shall go to dresden  to dresden  the capital of saxony  i had arranged to go there for the autumn but it will be simpler to go immediately  there are several works in the gallery with which my daughter has not i think sufficiently familiarised herself it is especially strong in the seventeenth century schools  as my companion offered me this information i perceived mr ruck come lounging in with his hands in his pockets and his elbows making acute angles  he had his usual anomalous appearance of both seeking and avoiding society and he wandered obliquely toward mrs church whose last words he had overheard  the seventeenth century schools he said slowly as if he were weighing some very small object in a very largepair of scales  now do you suppose they had schools at that period  mrs church rose with a good deal of precision making no answer to this incongruous jest  she clasped her large volume to her neat little bosom and she fixed a gentle serious eye upon mr ruck  i had a letter this morning from chamouni she said  well replied mr ruck i suppose youve got friends all over  i have friends at chamouni but they are leaving  to their great regret  i had got up too i listened to this statement and i wondered  i am almost ashamed to mention the subject of my agitation  i asked myself whether this was a sudden improvisation consecrated by maternal devotion but this point has never been elucidated  they are giving up some charming rooms perhaps you would like them  i would suggest your telegraphing  the weather is glorious continued mrs church and the highest peaks are now perceived with extraordinary distinctness  mr ruck listened as he always listened respectfully  well he said i dont know as i want to go up mount blank  thats the principal attraction isnt it  there are many others  i thought i would offer you anan exceptional opportunity  well said mr ruck youre right down friendly  but i seem to have more opportunities than i know what to do with  i dont seem able to take hold  it only needs a little decision remarked mrs church with an air which was an admirable example of this virtue  i wish you good night sir  and she moved noiselessly away  mr ruck with his long legs apart stood staring after her then he transferred his perfectly quiet eyes to me  does she own a hotel over there he asked  has she got any stock in mount blank    chapter ix    the next day madame beaurepas handed me with her own elderly fingers a missive which proved to be a telegram  after glancing at it i informed her that it was apparently a signal for my departure my brother had arrived in england and proposed to me to meet him there he had come on business and was to spend but three weeks in europe  but my house empties itself cried the old woman  the famille ruck talks of leaving me and madame church nous fait la reverence  mrs church is going away  she is packing her trunk she is a very extraordinary person  do you know what she asked me this morning  to invent some combination by which the famille ruck should move away  i informed her that i was not an inventor  that poor famille ruck  oblige me by getting rid of them said madame church as she would have asked celestine to remove a dish of cabbage  she speaks as if the world were made for madame church  i intimated to her that if she objected to the company there was a very simple remedy and at present elle fait ses paquets  she really asked you to get the rucks out of the house  she asked me to tell them that their rooms had been let three months ago to another family  she has an aplomb  mrs churchs aplomb caused me considerable diversion i am not sure that it was not in some degree to laugh over it at my leisure that i went out into the garden that evening to smoke a cigar  the night was dark and not particularly balmy and most of my fellow pensioners after dinner had remained indoors  a long straight walk conducted from the door of the house to the ancient grille that i have described and i stood here for some time looking through the iron bars at the silent empty street  the prospect was not entertaining and i presently turned away  at this moment i saw in the distance the door of the house open and throw a shaft of lamplight into the darkness  into the lamplight there stepped the figure of a female who presently closed the door behind her  she disappeared in the dusk of the garden and i had seen her but for an instant but i remained under the impression that aurora church on the eve of her departure had come out for a meditative stroll  i lingered near the gate keeping the red tip of my cigar turned toward the house and before long a young lady emerged from among the shadows of the trees and encountered the light of a lamp that stood just outside the gate  it was in fact aurora church but she seemed more bent upon conversation than upon meditation  she stood a moment looking at me and then she said   ought i to retireto return to the house  if you ought i should be very sorry to tell you so i answered  but we are all alone there is no one else in the garden  it is not the first time that i have been alone with a young lady i am not at all terrified  ah but i said the young girl  i have never been alone then quickly she interrupted herself  good theres another false note  yes i am obliged to admit that one is very false  she stood looking at me  i am going away tomorrow after that there will be no one to tell me    chapter x    that will matter little i presently replied  telling you will do no good  ah why do you say that murmured aurora church  i said it partly because it was true but i said it for other reasons as well which it was hard to define  standing there bareheaded in the night air in the vague light this young lady looked extremely interesting and the interest of her appearance was not diminished by a suspicion on my own part that she had come into the garden knowing me to be there  i thought her a charming girl and i felt very sorry for her but as i looked at her the terms in which madame beaurepas had ventured to characterise her recurred to me with a certain force i had professed a contempt for them at the time but it now came into my head that perhaps this unfortunately situated this insidiously mutinous young creature was looking out for a preserver  she was certainly not a girl to throw herself at a mans head but it was possible that in her intenseher almost morbiddesire to put into effect an ideal which was perhaps after all charged with as many fallacies as her mother affirmed she might do something reckless and irregularsomething in which a sympathetic compatriot as yet unknown would find his profit  the image unshaped though it was of this sympathetic compatriot filled me with a sort of envy  for some moments i was silent conscious of these things and then i answered her question  because some thingssome differences are felt not learned  to you liberty is not natural you are like a person who has bought a repeater and in his satisfaction is constantly making it sound  to a real american girl her liberty is a very vulgarlyticking old clock  ah you mean then said the poor girl that my mother has ruined me  ruined you  she has so perverted my mind that when i try to be natural i am necessarily immodest  that again is a false note i said laughing  she turned away  i think you are cruel  by no means i declared because for my own taste i prefer you asas  i hesitated and she turned back  as what  as you are  she looked at me a while again and then she said in a little reasoning voice that reminded me of her mothers only that it was conscious and studied i was not aware that i am under any particular obligation to please you  and then she gave a clear laugh quite at variance with her voice  oh there is no obligation i said but one has preferences  i am very sorry you are going away  what does it matter to you  you are going yourself  as i am going in a different direction that makes all the greater separation  she answered nothing she stood looking through the bars of the tall gate at the empty dusky street  this grille is like a cage she said at last  fortunately it is a cage that will open  and i laid my hand on the lock  dont open it and she pressed the gate back  if you should open it i would go outand never return  where should you go  to america  straight away  somehow or other  i would go to the american consul  i would beg him to give me moneyto help me  i received this assertion without a smile i was not in a smiling humour  on the contrary i felt singularly excited and i kept my hand on the lock of the gate  i believed or i thought i believed what my companion said and i hadabsurd as it may appearan irritated vision of her throwing herself upon consular sympathy  it seemed to me for a moment that to pass out of that gate with this yearning straining young creature would be to pass into some mysterious felicity  if i were only a hero of romance i would offer myself to take her to america  in a moment more perhaps i should have persuaded myself that i was one but at this juncture i heard a sound that was not romantic  it proved to be the very realistic tread of celestine the cook who stood grinning at us as we turned about from our colloquy  i ask bien pardon said celestine  the mother of mademoiselle desires that mademoiselle should come in immediately  m le pasteur galopin has come to make his adieux to ces dames  aurora gave me only one glance but it was a touching one  then she slowly departed with celestine  the next morning on coming into the garden i found that mrs church and her daughter had departed  i was informed of this fact by old m pigeonneau who sat there under a tree having his coffee at a little green table  i have nothing to envy you he said i had the last glimpse of that charming miss aurora  i had a very late glimpse i answered and it was all i could possibly desire  i have always noticed rejoined m pigeonneau that your desires are more moderate than mine  que voulezvous  i am of the old school  je crois que la race se perd  i regret the departure of that young girl  she had an enchanting smile  ce sera une femme desprit  for the mother i can console myself  i am not sure that she was a femme desprit though she wished to pass for one  round rosy potelee she yet had not the temperament of her appearance she was a femme austere  i have often noticed that contradiction in american ladies  you see a plump little woman with a speaking eye and the contour and complexion of a ripe peach and if you venture to conduct yourself in the smallest degree in accordance with these indices you discover a species of methodistof what do you call itof quakeress  on the other hand you encounter a tall lean angular person without colour without grace all elbows and knees and you find its a nature of the tropics the women of duty look like coquettes and the others look like alpenstocks however we have still the handsome madame rucka real femme de rubens celle la  it is very true that to talk to her one must know the flemish tongue  i had determined in accordance with my brothers telegram to go away in the afternoon so that having various duties to perform i left m pigeonneau to his international comparisons  among other things i went in the course of the morning to the bankers to draw money for my journey and there i found mr ruck with a pile of crumpled letters in his lap his chair tipped back and his eyes gloomily fixed on the fringe of the green plush tablecloth  i timidly expressed the hope that he had got better news from home whereupon he gave me a look in which considering his provocation the absence of irritation was conspicuous  he took up his letters in his large hand and crushing them together held it out to me  that epistolary matter he said is worth about five cents  but i guess he added rising i have taken it in by this time  when i had drawn my money i asked him to come and breakfast with me at the little brasserie much favoured by students to which i used to resort in the old town  i couldnt eat sir he said icouldnt eat  bad news takes away the appetite  but i guess ill go with you so that i neednt go to table down there at the pension  the old woman down there is always accusing me of turning up my nose at her food  well i guess i shant turn up my nose at anything now  we went to the little brasserie where poor mr ruck made the lightest possible breakfast  but if he ate very little he talked a great deal he talked about business going into a hundred details in which i was quite unable to follow him  his talk was not angry nor bitter it was a long meditative melancholy monologue if it had been a trifle less incoherent i should almost have called it philosophic  i was very sorry for him i wanted to do something for him but the only thing i could do was when we had breakfasted to see him safely back to the pension beaurepas  we went across the treille and down the corraterie out of which we turned into the rue du rhone  in this latter street as all the world knows are many of those brilliant jewellers shops for which geneva is famous  i always admired their glittering windows and never passed them without a lingering glance  even on this occasion preoccupied as i was with my impending departure and with my companions troubles i suffered my eyes to wander along the precious tiers that flashed and twinkled behind the huge clear plates of glass  thanks to this inveterate habit i made a discovery  in the largest and most brilliant of these establishments i perceived two ladies seated before the counter with an air of absorption which sufficiently proclaimed their identity  i hoped my companion would not see them but as we came abreast of the door a little beyond we found it open to the warm summer air  mr ruck happened to glance in and he immediately recognised his wife and daughter  he slowly stopped looking at them i wondered what he would do  the salesman was holding up a bracelet before them on its velvet cushion and flashing it about in an irresistible manner  mr ruck said nothing but he presently went in and i did the same  it will be an opportunity i remarked as cheerfully as possible for me to bid goodbye to the ladies  they turned round when mr ruck came in and looked at him without confusion  well you had better go home to breakfast remarked his wife  miss sophy made no remark but she took the bracelet from the attendant and gazed at it very fixedly  mr ruck seated himself on an empty stool and looked round the shop  well you have been here before said his wife you were here the first day we came  miss ruck extended the precious object in her hands towards me dont you think that sweet she inquired  i looked at it a moment  no i think its ugly  she glanced at me a moment incredulous  well i dont believe you have any taste  why sir its just lovely said mrs ruck  youll see it some day on me any way her daughter declared  no he wont said mr ruck quietly  it will be his own fault then miss sophy observed  well if we are going to chamouni we want to get something here said mrs ruck  we may not have another chance  mr ruck was still looking round the shop whistling in a very low tone  we aint going to chamouni  we are going to new york city straight  well im glad to hear that said mrs ruck  dont you suppose we want to take something home  if we are going straight back i must have that bracelet her daughter declared only i dont want a velvet case i want a satin case  i must bid you goodbye i said to the ladies  i am leaving geneva in an hour or two  take a good look at that bracelet so youll know it when you see it said miss sophy  shes bound to have something remarked her mother almost proudly  mr ruck was still vaguely inspecting the shop he was still whistling a little  i am afraid he is not at all well i said softly to his wife  she twisted her head a little and glanced at him  well i wish hed improve she exclaimed  a satin case and a nice one said miss ruck to the shopman  i bade mr ruck goodbye  dont wait for me he said sitting there on his stool and not meeting my eye  ive got to see this thing through  i went back to the pension beaurepas and when an hour later i left it with my luggage the family had not returned
