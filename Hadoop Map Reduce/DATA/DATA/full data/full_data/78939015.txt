but you must be there for the last half at least i would excuse you altogether if i could for i know you must be dead tired up all night that way on the train but mrs miller is one of those people who never can listen to reason and she would take deadly offence if you missed her musicale and wouldnt forgive us the longest day she lived so you see mrs roberts addresses herself to her husband in the library of their apartment in hotel bellingham at boston as she stands before the fire pulling on a long glove and looking at him across his desk where he has sunk into a weary heap in his swivel chair you are dreadfully used up edward and i think its cruel to make you go out but what can i do if it was anybody but mrs miller i wouldnt think of having you go im sure i never want to have her about anyway but thats just the kind of people that youre a perfect slave to now dear ive let the two girls go out and you must remember that youre in the place alone with the children but you neednt be troubled because nobody will come after this hour till willis does and the girls will be back before that willis is to come and get you on his way to the millers and its all been arranged for you and you neednt think of a thing till willis comes youll have to dress of course but you neednt begin that at once and you can just sit here in your chair and rest mr roberts stretches his arms wildly abroad and throwing back his head permits himself a yawn that eclipses his whole face mrs roberts lets both her arms fall at her side in token of extreme despair edward if you should go to sleep  roberts pulling himself together with a gigantic effort no no you neednt be afraid my dear but oh what wouldnt i give for a chance to  mrs roberts who sinks into a chair and regards the unhappy man with a look of tender compassion you poor thing ive almost a mind to let you  roberts heroically no it wouldnt do agnes i mustow ugh owgo ugh ow ugh he abandons himself to a succession of abysmal yawns in which the sequence of his ideas is altogether lost  mrs roberts well then i shall have to trust you she gathers her train up for departure and moves slowly towards the door i dont think ive forgotten anything let me see fan handkerchief both gloves pins because youre never sure that theyve put enough and you dont know where youll come apart head scarf yes ive got that on fur boots ive got them on i really believe im all here but i shouldnt be edward if it were not for the system i put into everything and i do wish dear that youd try it once just to please me  roberts very drowsily try what agnes  mrs roberts why getting what you have to do by heart and repeating it over if you could only bring yourself to say both girls out me alone with the children willis at ten mustnt go to sleep last half anyway mrs miller awfully angry there if you could say that after me i could go feeling so much easier wont you do it edward i know it has a ridiculous sound but  roberts yawning how am i to dress  mrs roberts edward well i always will say that youre perfectly inspired to think of my forgetting the most important thing after all oh i do believe there is an overruling providence i dont care what the agnostics pretend why its to be evening dress for the men of course mrs miller would do it to be different from mrs curwen who let you come in your cutaways even if it wasnt the regular thing and shes gone around ever since saying it was the most rowdy bohemian thing she ever heard of and she might as well have had beer at once  roberts who  mrs roberts why mrs miller  roberts mrs miller going to have beer  mrs roberts oh edward i dont see how you can be sobut there i wont blame you dearest i know youre just literally expiring for want of sleep and it seems to me i must be the cruellest thing in the world to make you go and if youll say the word ill smash off a note now at the eleventh hourthough its two hours of eleven yetand just tell mrs miller that youve got home down sick and ive had to stay and take care of you will you  roberts oh no agnes it wouldnt be the truth  mrs roberts in a rapture of admiration and affection oh who cares for the truth in such a cause you poor heroic angel you well if you insist upon going i suppose we must and now the only way is for you to keep everything clearly in mind youd better say it over backward now and begin with evening dress because thats the most important now evening dress mrs miller awfully angry last half anyway mustnt go to sleep willis at ten me alone with the children both girls out now do you thinkoweee a ring at the door extorts a shriek from mrs roberts who simultaneously gathers her robes about her in order to fall with decency in the event of burglars or fire while her husband rises and goes to open the apartment door who can it be at this hour oh amy  mrs willis campbell in the doorway oh amy indeed how d y do edward glad to see you back alive and just in time for agnes to kill you with mrs millers musicale may i ask agnes how long you expected me to freeze to death down in that coupé before you came  mrs roberts oh amy dear you must forgive me i was just staying to give edward his chargesyou know hes so terribly forgetfuland i forgot all about you  mrs campbell then i wish the next time hed give you some charges my dear but come now do we shall be rather late anyway and that simpleton will be perfectly furious  mrs roberts yes thats just what i was saying to edward shell never forgive you if it was anybody else i shouldnt think of dragging him out tonight  mrs campbell the worst of a bore like her is that shes sure to come to all your things and you cant get off from one of hers willis declares hes going to strike and i couldnt have got him out tonight if i hadnt told him you were going to make edward go  mrs roberts oh isnt it perfectly wicked amy i know hes just going to have the grippe see how drowsy he is thats one of the first symptoms  mrs campbell its one of the symptoms of having passed the night on a sleepingcar too  mrs roberts thats true and thank you amy i forgot all about that but now edward dear you will remember wont you if i could only stay with you  roberts who has been drowsily drooping in his chair during the exchange of these ideas between the ladies oh im all right agnes orow ugh owi should be if i had a cup of tea  mrs roberts there i knew it if i had been worth anything at all as a wife i should have had you a cup of tea long ago oh how heartless and ive let both the girls go and the fires all out in the range anyway but ill go and start it with my own hands  mrs campbell in those gloves youre crazy agnes edward ill tell you what willis does when hes out of sorts a little he takes a taste of whiskeyandwater he says nothing freshens him up like it  roberts thats a good idea  mrs roberts bustling into the diningroom and reappearing with a tumbler and a decanter the very thing amy and thank you so much trying to make edward remember seems to put everything out of my head i might have thought of whiskey though if its only loss of sleep it will wake him up and if its grippe its the most nourishing thing in the world  roberts im not going to have the grippe agnes  mrs roberts edward dont boast you may be stricken down in an instant i heard of one person who was taken so suddenly she hadnt time to get her things off and tumbled right on the bed you must put some water in it of course and hot water is very soothing you can use some out of the pipes its perfectly good  mrs campbell agnes are you never coming  roberts yes go along agnes do i shall get on quite well now you neednt wait  mrs roberts oh if i could only stay and think for you dearest but i cant and you must do the best you can do keep repeating it all over its the only way  mrs campbell from the door agnes  mrs roberts amy im coming instantly  mrs campbell i declare i shall go without you  mrs roberts and i shouldnt blame you a bit amy and if it turns out to be the grippe edward dont lose an instant send for the doctor as fast as the district messenger can fly give him his car fare and let one come for me and jump into bed and cover up warm and keep up the nourishment with the whiskey theres another bottle in the sideboard and perhaps youd better break a raw egg in it i heard of one person that they gave three dozen raw eggs a day to in typhoid fever and even then he died so you must nourish yourself all you can and  mrs campbell agnes im going  mrs roberts im coming edward  roberts well  mrs roberts there is something else very important and i cant think of it  roberts liebigs extract of beef  mrs roberts distractedly no no and it wasnt oysters either though theyre very nourishing too oh dear what  mrs campbell going agnes  mrs roberts coming amy try to think of something else that i ought to remember edward  roberts some word to the girls when they come in  mrs roberts no  roberts about the children something  mrs roberts no no  roberts willis then what amy wants him to do  mrs roberts oh no no i shall surely die if i cant think of it  mrs campbell at the door of the apartment gone  mrs roberts flying after her as the door closes with a bang oh amy how can you be so heartless shes driven it quite out of my head     ii   mr willis campbell hello hello hello oh hello hello hello wake up in there roberts wake up sound the loud timbrel fire murder and sudden death wake up monday morning you know heres tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday all gone and nothing done come arouse

heres mcilheny out here wants to know why you took his wife for a cook hurry up he cant wait wake up you old sevenbynine sleeper you or mrs millers musicale will just simply expire on the spot come its after ten oclock now or it will be in about five minutes hurry up hello hello hello campbell accompanies his appeals with a tempest of knocks thumps and bangs on the outside of robertss chamber door within roberts is discovered at first stretched on his bed in profound repose which becomes less and less perfect as campbells blows and cries penetrate to his consciousness he moves groans drops back into slumber groans again coughs sits up on the bed where he has thrown himself with all his clothes on and listens i say arent you going to mrs millers if you are youd better get out of bed some time before the last call for breakfast now ready in the diningcar  roberts leaping out of bed and flinging open the door why ive been to mrs millers  campbell entering with his hat on and his overcoat on his arm oh no you havent you poor suffering creature that was a heavenly dream why good gracious man youre not dressed campbell is himself in perfectly appointed eveningdress and he stares in dismay at the travellingsuit which roberts still wears you cant go in that figure you know you might to mrs curwens but youd give mrs miller deadly offence shed think the curwen had put you up to it didnt agnes tell you id be here at ten for you what have you been doing with yourself i supposed i should find you walking up and down here fuming with impatience  roberts i was dead tired and after agnes went i just threw myself down here for a moments rest and i was off before i knew it  campbell well then hustle theres no time to lose we shall be late but i guess we can get there in time to save agness life if we hump ourselves are you shaved  roberts yes i thought id better shave before i lay down  campbell well then thats half the battle and you ought to be into your dresssuit in five minutes but youre an intellectual man and your fingers are all thumbs and so ill give you ten minutes hello whats this in speaking of shaving campbell has mechanically cast his eye towards the bureau and has gradually become aware of the halftumbler of water and the decanter of whiskey which roberts has left standing there he pounces upon the decanter pulls out the stopple and applies his nose to the mouth ah ha this is the milk in the cocoanut is it no wonder you slept soundly and had sweet dreams well roberts  roberts no no willis i solemnly assure you i havent touched a drop of it  campbell oh yes i know thats what they always say  roberts but i tell you willis  campbell oh all right my boy i dont blame you you have never fallen before probably but youre down this time old man you have every appearance of being grossly intoxicated as the reporters say at this instant look how red your eyes are  roberts its loss of sleep i tell you i havent tasted the whiskey  campbell but its half gone he lifts the decanter and shows well i hope agnes may never know it and your poor children roberts  roberts nonsense agnes knows all about it she brought me the decanter herself she and amy thought it would freshen me up but i distrusted it i was afraid the effect would be soporific  campbell and it seems you were perfectly right events have proved it but come now dont sit there all night old fellow roberts has sunk upon the edge of the bed weve got to be off to this scene of maddening gayety at mrs millers want a wet towel round your head nothing like it you know  roberts with dignity thank you i dont need any wet towel and ill be with you in a few moments if youll kindly wait he moves towards the door of his dressingroom  campbell cheerfully oh ill stay by roberts you neednt be afraid theres nothing mean about me and youll want somebody to pull you together now and then and i know just what to do ive been through this kind of thing with lots of fellows in california i know the haughty and selfhelpful stage youre all right roberts but dont lose time whats the matter now roberts has come back from his dressingroom and is staring vacantly at campbell  roberts i was trying to think where id put my dresssuit  campbell triumphantly exactly and now do you expect me to believe you havent been at that decanter where do you suppose you put it  roberts where i always do on a hook in my closet  campbell you hang up your dresssuit why it must look like a butlers you ought to fold your clothes and lay them in a bureau drawer dont you know that very likely agnes has got onto that while youve been away and put them in here he looks towards the bureau and roberts tries to pull open one drawer after another  roberts this seems locked i never lock my drawers  campbell then thats proof positive that your dresssuit is in there agnes has put it in and locked it up so as to keep it nice and fresh for you wheres your key  roberts i dont know i always leave it in the keyhole of one of the drawers havent you got a keyring willis  campbell ive got a keyring but i havent got it about me as artemus ward said of his gift for public speaking its in my other trousers pockets havent you got a collection of keys amy has a halfbushel and she keeps them in a handbag in the bathroom closet she says agnes does  roberts so she does ill just look while he is gone campbell lays down his hat and overcoat and tries the bureau drawers roberts returns to find him at this work no she must have put them somewhere else i know she always used to put them there  campbell well then weve got to pick the locks have you got a bootbuttoner theres nothing like a bootbuttoner to pick locks or hold on a minute weve got to go about this thing systematically now i dont think you can tell in your condition whether your dresscoats in your closet or not roberts we must bring your clothes all out here and lay them on the bed and see that dresssuit may turn up yet you probably thought it was something like an ulster i know how a mans ideas get mixed after a little too much freshening up  roberts unmindful of his joke youre right willis i may have overlooked it ill bring out everything he disappears and reappears with a businesssuit of black diagonal which he throws on the bed that isnt it  campbell inspecting it no but it isnt so far off some of the young chaps have their dresscoats made of diagonal try again roberts youll fetch it yet roberts disappears and reappears with a frockcoat of blue and checked trousers oh that wont do roberts dont give way like that who ever saw a man in eveningdress with check trousers on now what have we next as roberts goes and comes campbell receives his burdens and verifies them a velvet jacket wont do either unless youre a travelling englishman three pairs of summer pantaloons are all very well in their way but theyre out of season and stripes are not the thing for evening wear any more beautiful bath gown but more adapted for amateur dramatics than for a musicale two waistcoats and a norfolk jacket mean well but are not adapted to the purpose exemplary light overcoat but still not quite the thing doublebreasted reefer and canada homespun trousers admirably fitted for a seavoyage and camping out armload of semidetached waistcoats and pantaloons very suggestive but not instantly available pajamas not at all the thing elderly pair of doeskin trousers and lowcut waistcoatwhy hello roberts heres part of your dresssuit now wheres the coat  roberts dropping into a chair and wiping his forehead while he surveys the tangled heap of garments on the bed given away got too small for me three years ago agnes kept the waistcoat and trousers for the sake of association because i told her i wore them at the party where we first met they wont go half round me now  campbell scrutinizing them critically as he holds them well look here roberts we may have to come to these yet stand up old fellow roberts mechanically stands up and campbell tries the top of the trousers against his waistband may need a little slitting down the back so as to let them out a third or two thirds or so but i guess well try an icepick first he flings the clothes on the bed and touches the electric bell  roberts icepick  campbell yes nothing like it for prying open bureau drawers to bella the maid who appears at the door in answer to his ring the icepick please  bella icepick sir  campbell yes theicepickherequick  bella vanishing with a gesture of wonder at the pile of clothing on the bed all right sir  roberts but willis wont it bruise and deface the bureau agnes is very careful of this bu  campbell not at all you just set the pick in here over the lock and pry i shant leave a scratch they stoop down together in front of the bureau and campbell shows him how but what are you going to do youve got to have your clothes if youre going to the musicale ah here we are thanks as bella comes with the icepick which he pushes in over the lock of the lowest drawer well begin with the lowest because thats where amy keeps mine and if agnes has got onto it through her shell be sure to do exactly the same now then i just scratch the bolt down with my knife and open sesame what do you say to bruising your old bureau now  roberts as campbell pulls out the drawer and sets it on a chair perfect onlyhe lifts the things from the drawer and places them on another chairthere dont seem to be anything here but underclothes  campbell well then we must get the next out no time to lose come keep shoving the pick in and ill scratch the bolt down with my knife see its nothing they pull the drawer out and set it on the floor and roberts ruefully contemplates it  roberts nothing but shirts collars cuffs and neckties  campbell ah i dont know that its a deep drawerhe begins taking the linen out and laying it on the floorand the dresssuit may be at the bottom no nothing here youre right roberts well now for the top drawer and the last if wed taken that out first we neednt have taken out the second we could have seen it in place you ought to have thought of that roberts  roberts with injury you suggested taking out the lowest first yourself willis you said agnes would be sure to have put them there  campbell did i well i knew i must have a reason for it but come along now roberts and push the icepick in after a season of experiment with the pick and the penknife the bolt wont scratch down what are you going to do now roberts  roberts i dont know  campbell but youve got to do something you know we cant just give it up where are those dresstrousers and waistcoat he begins tumbling the things on the bed laying some on chairs letting others drop to the floor ah here they are now ill tell you what roberts youve got to wear these go into your dressingroom there and put them on and then we can tell how much they have to be slit up the back  roberts but wheres the coat even if i could get the other things on  campbell well think about that later we havent got any time to lose in talk we can pin back the skirts of your frockcoat as the travelling americans used to do when they went to the opera in london hurry up he gives roberts the garments and pushes him into the door of his dressingroom and walks impatiently up and down amidst the chaos of clothing till roberts reappears why that isnt bad  roberts bad i cant breathe i feel as if i were being cut in two  campbell nonsense thats the way every woman feels when shes laced it gives you a beautiful waist roberts ah ha ha ha ha ha ha o lord oh mercy ah ha ha ha  roberts now look here willis  campbell turning him round and surveying him from different points no no dont mind me its just my way you know i dont mean anything by it i think these things look firstrate on you theres no mistake about their giving you a youthful figure we can just let them out a few stitches and youll be perfectly comfortable the only thing now is the coat im afraid that pinning back wouldnt do wed better try something else ill tell you send down and borrow merricks coat hes still on the floor below you i suppose  roberts yes but hes so thin  campbell the very thing those thin fellows always have their things made roomy  roberts but hes tall  campbell thats all right if you keep these things on youve got to give in some direction and youre probably going to stretch he rings the bell  roberts but its very late he must be in bed  campbell ill fix that to bella as she appears bella i want you to go down to the gentleman under here and ask him if he wont lend mr roberts his dresscoat tell him mrs roberts has gone off to a party and mr roberts doesnt know where to find his coat  roberts oh do you think shed better tell him that willis  campbell why certainly you must account for the request in some way itll appeal to his sympathy and put him into a goodhumor if he happens to have to get out of bed to oblige you  bella theyre all up yet sir i saw their cook on the back stairs when i came in theyve been giving a dinner  campbell well run then to roberts as bella vanishes merrick can take it right off his back but whilst shes gone well just give this lock another chance they work jointly at the bureau drawer no it wont scrape down its probably rusted in you must get this lock oiled roberts as bella returns with a dresscoat in her hand ah here we are thats very nice of merrick what did he say  bella i didnt see him sir the girl brought it  campbell well thats all bella he shakes out the coat as she goes and looks down at it i suppose it amused merrick hes got a good deal of humor merrick has i hope he wont give it to the press  roberts good heavens willis you dont  campbell oh he wouldnt give real names merricks too much of a gentleman for that come try it on weve got to hurry now roberts backs towards him with extended arms and campbell slips the coatsleeves on them easy easy it may be a little narrow for you in the backno sir it fits you like a glove he stands off and surveys roberts after smoothing the coat across the shoulders yes sir like a glovea glove that the pretty shopgirl has put on for you after shes peppered it full of that white stuff to make it go on and told you that you could easily wear a size smaller he begins to laugh as he lifts each of robertss limp arms with the sleeves dangling below his hands and touches the skirt which descends to the calf of his leg the most youthful figure i ever saw looks like a boy in his fathers coat merrick is a tall fellow id no idea  roberts looking ruefully over his shoulder you see it wont do willis  campbell no no i dont say that quite but perhaps wed better try something else whos overhead now  roberts desperately baker and hes short and fat  campbell short and fat isnt at all bad touching the annunciator hes probably had his coat made rather long and snug itll be the very thing for you we mustnt leave a stone unturned or a coat untried to bella appearing at the door and putting her apron up to control herself at sight of mr robertss figure do you know whether mr bakers people have gone to bed  bella no sir i heard their second girl saying on the stairs that mrs baker was up with a bad toothache  campbell what a piece of luck run right up will you and borrow mr bakers dresscoat to roberts on bellas disappearance bakers coat will be all right but still wed better work away at this bureau drawer again drive the icepick in a little farther now they struggle with lock as before until bella returns roberts absentmindedly keeping merricks coat on and from time to time taking a turn about the room to rest his back  roberts lets give it up willis we cant get it open its no use  campbell desisting well well leave that to the last then but ive the liveliest confidence in bakers coat ah here it is saved saved he takes the garment from bella at the threshold now then the great thing is to get merricks coat off in one piece i thought i heard a ripping sound in the back of it when you were straining at that drawer but i guess it was merely fancy easy easy he helps roberts get the coat off and examines it  roberts anxiously is it all right  campbell yes its perfectly sound you may have started the seams a little but its nothing that merrick will ever notice now for baker there goes on like an old shoe he retires a few steps and surveys robertss back which roberts is craning his neck round to get a view of in the glass theres space gives you a mighty fine portly figure roberts it looks grand on you it does indeed i call that the back of a leading citizen in very comfortable circumstances something magisterial about it perhaps its a little full but thats a good fault it must set awfully easy sleeves are a trifle short maybe but not too much to show your cuffbuttons i hate a coat that dont do that yes i should call that a very nice fit  roberts tearing off the coat and flinging it on the bed you know it wont do willis and now i must give the whole thing up youd better hurry off and explain to agnes why i could not come  campbell oh no i cant leave you in the lurch that way my dear fellow besides it would break agnes all up we must do something i think either one of those coats would go perfectly well but if youre so particular about your personal appearance theres only one thing left we must get this drawer open look here well shove the icepick in a little farther sos to give the bolt the slightest possible catch and then well both pull you on one handle and i on the other it wont hurt the bureau and besides its the only chance left i suppose these coats dont look as if they were made for you what do you say  illustration the sleeves are a trifle short maybe  roberts disconsolately oh i suppose wed better try it cant be much worse he casts a hopeless glance around the confused and tumbled room  campbell absently yes might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb you know agnes wont be able to express her feelings anyway when she sees this room it looks as if a small cyclone had been joking round here but shell like your devotion in doing your utmost  roberts do you think so im not so sure but well try it he pushes the icepick in with all his strength  campbell thats it now then they each grasp a handle of the drawer and pull one two threepull once morepull now the third timepull and out she comes the bolt suddenly gives and the drawer drops violently to the floor scattering its contents in every direction while the two men totter backward and cling to each other to keep their balance at the same moment the voices of mrs roberts and mrs campbell make themselves heard without in vague cries of astonishment question and apprehension mounting into a wild shriek as the drawer crashes to the floor     iii   mrs roberts without oh edward is it a burglar  mrs campbell without is it a mouse willis  mrs roberts ring for the district telegraphcall for a policeman edward press the ratchet down three times  mrs campbell dont kill him willis dont you dare to kill him take him up with the tongs and fling him out of the window  mrs roberts dont trust him edward get willis to hold him and press the ratchet quick  mrs campbell keep him from getting back into his hole for then you never can tell whether hes there or not  mrs roberts why dont you answer edward oh dear perhaps hes garroted edward i know he has  mrs campbell willis if this is any of your tricksif its one of your miserable practical jokes  mrs roberts oh i wonder what theyre keeping so quiet for edward are you safe do you need me if you do just speak and i willgo for a policeman myself  mrs campbell if you dont answer willis whimpering oh he just wants to make me take my life in my hand he wouldnt like anything better the two men during this rapid colloquy remain silently aghast staring at each other and at the scene of confusion around them  mrs roberts well then do it amy you have so much more courage than i have and you have no children and if youll only go to the door and peep in ill stay here and keep screaming as loud as ever i can ill begin now  roberts no no dont call out agnes its all right weve just had a little accident with one of the bureau drawers its perfectly safe but dont come in till we he dashes madly about the room trying to put it in shape both ladies instantly show themselves at the door  mrs roberts in dismay at the spectacle why what in the world has happened edward  mrs campbell its something willis has put him up to i knew it was from the way he kept so still where is he  campbell coming boldly forward out of robertss dressingroom where he had previously taken refuge ive saved robertss life if it hadnt been for me he couldnt have moved hand or foot he was dead asleep when i came here and ive been helping him look for his dresssuit at these words mrs roberts abandons herself to despair in one of the chairs overflowing with clothes hello whats the matter with agnes  mrs roberts i never can look any one in the face again to think of my doing such a thing when ive always prided myself on being so thoughtful and remembering things so perfectly and here ive been reproaching edward and poor willis the whole evening for not coming to that horrid musicale and accusing them of all kinds of things and all the time i knew id forgotten something and couldnt think what it was oh dear i shall simply never forgive myself but it was all because i wanted him to look so nice in it and i got it pressed while he was away and i folded it up in the tissuepaper myself and took the greatest care of it and then to have it turn out the way it has  campbell what in the world are you talking about  mrs roberts why edwards dresssuit of course  mrs campbell of course she is but you always have to have things put in words of one syllable for you  campbell no irrelevant insults mrs campbell if you please now agnes try to collect yourself when you had folded his dresssuit in tissuepaper so nicely what did you do with it  mrs roberts why i wrapped it in my white chuddah shawl and put it away back on the top shelf in his closet and i forgot to tell him where it was visible sensation on all sides and if edward were to say now that he couldnt forgive me i should just simply fall down and worship him  campbell he can forgive you probably but he cannot forget we must leave that to women and here we were searching every nook and corner of the house and every hole and cranny for that dresssuit which youd poked away in tissuepaper and chuddah while you were enjoying yourself at mrs millers  mrs campbell we werent enjoying ourselves it was the deadliest thing that ever was and you were very lucky to escape  campbell that is all very well but the credit of that belongs entirely to a merciful providence what i want to know is how agnes is going to excuse herself for hiding her husbands clothes so that if this musicale had been the most delightful affair of the season he would have missed it just the same  mrs roberts regarding her husbands strange figure in the youthful waistcoat and trousers why edward dear what in the world have you got on  campbell she doesnt even remember the dresssuit in which poor roberts first met her well agnes youre a pretty wife and mother look at that man he takes roberts by the elbow and turns him round did you ever see devotion like that hes buttoned in so tight that he cant draw a full breath to save him but he would have gone to the party if he had expired to slow music after he got there only he couldnt find the coat youd given that away  mrs campbell fishing up a garment from the tempestuous sea of clothes why heres a dresscoat now  campbell yes thats merricks it was rather snug for roberts  mrs roberts and heres another  campbell yes thats bakers it was rather roomy for roberts  mrs roberts but how did you get them  campbell lightly oh we sent and borrowed them  roberts less lightly we had to do something agnes i knew you would be terribly anxious if i didnt come  mrs roberts with abject contrition oh dont speak a word you poor suffering martyr  campbell we should have borrowed every coat in the block if you hadnt got back  mrs campbell yes and ive no doubt youd have taken a perfectly fiendish enjoyment in every failure  campbell with a wild spluttering laugh well the disappointments certainly had their compensations roberts just let them see how well you look in merricks coat or no try bakers first i think bakers is a little more swell on you if anything  bella at the door supper is served mrs roberts  campbell supper  mrs roberts oh yes mrs miller never gives you anything but icecream and i thought we should all need something hot when we got back and so i had a fewbut i forgot all about the supper  campbell im glad bella didnt better let bella put robertss clothes away after this  mrs roberts in extreme dejection yes i think i really had willis im not fit to be edwards wife if i behave that way to him  campbell well well he must have a divorce then but not till after supper  mrs campbell yes never mind now agnes its all turned out well as it is edward has been spared a fearful bore and nobody will ever be any the wiser about your putting away his evening dress  campbell oh indeed wont they when baker and merrick meet at the club and exchange notes about agnes locking up robertss clothes  mrs roberts with horror edward you didnt send that word to them  roberts whywhyim afraid we did something like it my dear we had to explain our request somehow  mrs roberts relaxing into a chair then i simply never can hold up my head again she lets it fall in typical despair  mrs campbell pressing the annunciator with the energy of a lioness at bay i dont believe its as bad as that it simply cant be it would be too abominable as bella appears in answer to the bell did you tell the gentlemen when you went to borrow the coats for mr roberts that mrs roberts had locked up his dresssuit  bella why thats what mr campbell said to say maam but i didnt believe mrs roberts would quite like it maam and so i said she hesitates and mrs roberts springs to her feet with arms outstretched to her  mrs roberts what bella  bella why you know maam i couldnt help thinking how things fly about a house like this  mrs roberts yes yes  mrs campbell go on  bella i didnt believe the gentlemen would have sent word like that themselves if theyd thought of it and so  illustration that little supper  mrs roberts and so  mrs campbell so  bella i know you like to have me always speak the truth and so i do to you maam and every lady i ever lived with but i wasnt going to have that young waitress of mrs bakers and that nasty cook of mrs merricks laughing at us  campbell well and what did you do  mrs roberts yes bella  bella i told mrs merricks cook that the gentlemen were getting up some charades and i told mr bakers second girl that the tailor hadnt sent mr robertss coat home  mrs campbell well you were inspired bella  mrs roberts to bella oh youangel  campbell well that isnt quite what they call the father of them who was the father of what but we wont dispute about terms the great thing now is to get at that little supper come on roberts  mrs roberts yes edward take out amy  roberts putting himself in evidence but dont you see my dear i cant draw a full breath now and if i were to eat anything  mrs roberts oh well go and change them at once we wont wait for you dear but ill see to keeping it hot for you  campbell as he follows the ladies out of one door while roberts vanishes into his dressingroom through the other yes just slip on anything that will fit you its so near morning now that we wont insist on evening dress  the end
