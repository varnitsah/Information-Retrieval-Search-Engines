69280869	a wonderbook for girls and boys                       by nathaniel hawthorne                       the paradise of children    contents    tanglewood playroomintroductory to the paradise of children   the paradise of children   tanglewood playroomafter the story     tanglewood playroom  the golden days of october passed away as so many other octobers have and brown november likewise and the greater part of chill december too  at last came merry christmas and eustace bright along with it making it all the merrier by his presence  and the day after his arrival from college there came a mighty snowstorm  up to this time the winter had held back and had given us a good many mild days which were like smiles upon its wrinkled visage  the grass had kept itself green in sheltered places such as the nooks of southern hillslopes and along the lee of the stone fences  it was but a week or two ago and since the beginning of the month that the children had found a dandelion in bloom on the margin of shadow brook where it glides out of the dell  but no more green grass and dandelions now  this was such a snowstorm twenty miles of it might have been visible at once between the windows of tanglewood and the dome of taconic had it been possible to see so far among the eddying drifts that whitened all the atmosphere  it seemed as if the hills were giants and were flinging monstrous handfuls of snow at one another in their enormous sport  so thick were the fluttering snowflakes that even the trees midway down the valley were hidden by them the greater part of the time  sometimes it is true the little prisoners of tanglewood could discern a dim outline of monument mountain and the smooth whiteness of the frozen lake at its base and the black or gray tracts of woodland in the nearer landscape but these were merely peeps through the tempest  nevertheless the children rejoiced greatly in the snowstorm  they had already made acquaintance with it by tumbling heels over head into its highest drifts and flinging snow at one another as we have just fancied the berkshire mountains to be doing  and now they had come back to their spacious playroom which was as big as the great drawingroom and was lumbered with all sorts of playthings large and small  the biggest was a rockinghorse that looked like a real pony and there was a whole family of wooden waxen plaster and china dolls besides ragbabies and blocks enough to build bunker hill monument and ninepins and balls and hummingtops and battledores and gracesticks and skippingropes and more of such valuable property than i could tell of in a printed page  but the children liked the snowstorm better than them all  it suggested so many brisk enjoyments for tomorrow and all the remainder of the winter  the sleighride the slides down hill into the valley the snowimages that were to be shaped out the snowfortresses that were to be built and the snowballing to be carried on  so the little folks blessed the snowstorm and were glad to see it come thicker and thicker and watched hopefully the long drift that was piling itself up in the avenue and was already higher than any of their heads  why we shall be blocked up till spring cried they with the hugest delight  what a pity that the house is too high to be quite covered up  the little red house down yonder will be buried up to its eaves  you silly children what do you want of more snow asked eustace who tired of some novel that he was skimming through had strolled into the playroom  it has done mischief enough already by spoiling the only skating that i could hope for through the winter  we shall see nothing more of the lake till april and this was to have been my first day upon it  dont you pity me primrose  o to be sure answered primrose laughing  but for your comfort we will listen to another of your old stories such as you told us under the porch and down in the hollow by shadow brook  perhaps i shall like them better now when there is nothing to do than while there were nuts to be gathered and beautiful weather to enjoy  hereupon periwinkle clover sweet fern and as many others of the little fraternity and cousinhood as were still at tanglewood gathered about eustace and earnestly besought him for a story  the student yawned stretched himself and then to the vast admiration of the small people skipped three times hack and forth over the top of a chair in order as he explained to them to set his wits in motion  well well children said he after these preliminaries since you insist and primrose has set her heart upon it i will see what can be done for you  and that you may know what happy days there were before snowstorms came into fashion i will tell you a story of the oldest of all old times when the world was as new as sweet ferns brannew hummingtop  there was then but one season in the year and that was the delightful summer and but one age for mortals and that was childhood  i never heard of that before said primrose  of course you never did answered eustace  it shall be a story of what nobody but myself ever dreamed ofa paradise of childrenand how by the naughtiness of just such a little imp as primrose here it all came to nothing  so eustace bright sat down in the chair which he had just been skipping over took cowslip upon his knee ordered silence throughout the auditory and began a story about a sad naughty child whose name was pandora and about her playfellow epimetheus  you may read it word for word in the pages that come next    the paradise of children  long long ago when this old world was in its tender infancy there was a child named epimetheus who never had either father or mother and that he might not be lonely another child fatherless and motherless like himself was sent from a far country to live with him and be his playfellow and helpmate  her name was pandora  the first thing that pandora saw when she entered the cottage where epimetheus dwelt was a great box  and almost the first question which she put to him after crossing the threshold was this  epimetheus what have you in that box  my dear little pandora answered epimetheus that is a secret and you must be kind enough not to ask any questions about it  the box was left here to be kept safely and i do not myself know what it contains  but who gave it to you  asked pandora  and where did it come from  that is a secret too replied epimetheus  how provoking exclaimed pandora pouting her lip  i wish the great ugly box were out of the way  o come dont think of it any more cried epimetheus  let us run out of doors and have some nice play with the other children  it is thousands of years since epimetheus and pandora were alive and the world nowadays is a very different sort of thing from what it was in their time  then everybody was a child  there needed no fathers and mothers to take care of the children because there was no danger nor trouble of any kind and no clothes to be mended and there was always plenty to eat and drink  whenever a child wanted his dinner he found it growing on a tree and if he looked at the tree in the morning he could see the expanding blossom of that nights supper or at eventide he saw the tender bud of tomorrows breakfast  it was a very pleasant life indeed  no labor to be done no tasks to be studied nothing but sports and dances and sweet voices of children talking or carolling like birds or gushing out in merry laughter throughout the livelong day  what was most wonderful of all the children never quarrelled among themselves neither had they any crying fits nor since time first began had a single one of these little mortals ever gone apart into a corner and sulked  o what a good time was that to be alive in  the truth is those ugly little winged monsters called troubles which are now almost as numerous as mosquitoes had never yet been seen on the earth  it is probable that the very greatest disquietude which a child had ever experienced was pandoras vexation at not being able to discover the secret of the mysterious box  this was at first only the faint shadow of a trouble but every day it grew more and more substantial until before a great while the cottage of epimetheus and pandora was less sunshiny than those of the other children  whence can the box have come pandora continually kept saying to herself and to epimetheus  and what in the world can be inside of it  always talking about this box said epimetheus at last for he had grown extremely tired of the subject  i wish dear pandora you would try to talk of something else  come let us go and gather some ripe figs and eat them under the trees for our supper  and i know a vine that has the sweetest and juiciest grapes you ever tasted  always talking about grapes and figs cried pandora pettishly  well then said epimetheus who was a very goodtempered child like a multitude of children in those days let us run out and have a merry time with our playmates  i am tired of merry times and dont care if i never have any more answered our pettish little pandora  and besides i never do have any  this ugly box  i am so taken up with thinking about it all the time  i insist upon your telling me what is inside of it  as i have already said fifty times over i do not know replied epimetheus getting a little vexed  how then can i tell you what is inside  you might open it said pandora looking sideways at epimetheus and then we could see for ourselves  pandora what are you thinking of exclaimed epimetheus  and his face expressed so much horror at the idea of looking into a box which had been confided to him on the condition of his never opening it that pandora thought it best not to suggest it any more  still however she could not help thinking and talking about the box  at least said she you can tell me how it came here  it was left at the door replied epimetheus just before you came by a person who looked very smiling and intelligent and who could hardly forbear laughing as he put it down  he was dressed in anodd kind of a cloak and had on a cap that seemed to be made partly of feathers so that it looked almost as if it had wings  what sort of a staff had he asked pandora  o the most curious staff you ever saw  cried epimetheus  it was like two serpents twisting around a stick and was carved so naturally that i at first bought the serpents were alive  i know him said pandora thoughtfully  nobody else has such a staff  it was quicksilver and he brought one hither as well as the box  no doubt he intended it for me and most probably it contains pretty dresses for me to wear or toys for you and me to play with or something very nice for us both to eat  perhaps so answered epimetheus turning away  but until quicksilver comes back and tells us so we have neither of us any right to lift the lid of the box  what a dull boy he is  muttered pandora as epimetheus left the cottage  i do wish he had a little more enterprise  for the first time since her arrival epimetheus had gone out without asking pandora to accompany him  he went to gather figs and grapes by himself or to seek whatever amusement he could find in other society than his little playfellows  he was tired to death of hearing about the box and heartily wished that quicksilver or whatever was the messengers name had left it at some other childs door where pandora would never have set eyes on it  so perseveringly as she did babble about this one thing  the box the box and nothing but the box  it seemed as if the box were bewitched and as if the cottage were not big enough to hold it without pandoras continually stumbling over it and making epimetheus stumble over it likewise and bruising all four of their shins  well it was really hard that poor epimetheus should have a box in his ears from morning till night especially as the little people of the earth were so unaccustomed to vexations in those happy days that they knew not how to deal with them  thus a small vexation made as much disturbance then as a far bigger one would in our own times  after epimetheus was gone pandora stood gazing at the box  she had called it ugly above a hundred times but in spite of all that she had said against it it was positively a very handsome article of furniture and would have been quite an ornament to any room in which it should be placed  it was made of a beautiful kind of wood with dark and rich veins spreading over its surface which was so highly polished that little pandora could see her face in it  as the child had no other lookingglass it is odd that she did not value the box merely on this account  the edges and corners of the box were carved with most wonderful skill around the margin there were figures of graceful men and women and the prettiest children ever seen reclining or sporting amid a profusion of flowers and foliage and these various objects were so exquisitely represented and were wrought together in such harmony that flowers foliage and human beings seemed to combine into a wreath of mingled beauty  but here and there peeping forth from behind the carved foliage pandora once or twice fancied that she saw a face not so lovely or something or other that was disagreeable and which stole the beauty out of all the rest  nevertheless on looking more closely and touching the spot with her finger she could discover nothing of the kind  some face that was really beautiful had been made to look ugly by her catching a sideway glimpse at it  the most beautiful face of all was done in what is called high relief in the centre of the lid  there was nothing else save the dark smooth richness of the polished wood and this one face in the centre with a garland of flowers about its brow  pandora had looked at this face a great many times and imagined that the mouth could smile if it liked or be grave when it chose the same as any living mouth  the features indeed all wore a very lively and rather mischievous expression which looked almost as if it needs must burst out of the carved lips and utter itself in words  had the mouth spoken it would probably have been something like this  do not be afraid pandora  what harm can there be in opening the box never mind that poor simple epimetheus  you are wiser than he and have ten times as much spirit  open the box and see if you do not find something very pretty  the box i had almost forgotten to say was fastened not by a lock nor by any other such contrivance but by a very intricate knot of gold cord  there appeared to be no end to this knot and no beginning never was a knot so cunningly twisted nor with so many ins and outs which roguishly defied the skilfullest fingers to disentangle them  and yet by the very difficulty that there was in it pandora was the more tempted to examine the knot and just see how it was made  two or three times already she had stooped over the box and taken the knot between her thumb and forefinger but without positively trying to undo it  i really believe said she to herself that i begin to see how it was done  nay perhaps i could tie it up again after undoing it  there would be no harm in that surely  even epimetheus would not blame me for that  i need not open the box and should not of course without the foolish boys consent even if the knot were untied  it might have been better for pandora if she had had a little work to do or anything to employ her mind upon so as not to be so constantly thinking of this one subject  but children led so easy a life before any troubles came into the world that they had really a great deal too much leisure  they could not be forever playing at hideandseek among the flowershrubs or at blindmansbuff with garlands over their eyes or at whatever other games had been found out while mother earth was in her babyhood  when life is all sport toil is the real play  there was absolutely nothing to do  a little sweeping and dusting about the cottage i suppose and the gathering of fresh flowers which were only too abundant everywhere and arranging them in vasesand poor little pandoras days work was over  and then for the rest of the day there was the box  after all i am not quite sure that the box was not a blessing to her in its way  it supplied her with such a variety of ideas to think of and to talk about whenever she had anybody to listen  when she was in good humor she could admire the bright polish of its sides and the rich border of beautiful faces and foliage that ran all around it  or if she chanced to be illtempered she could give it a push or kick it with her naughty little foot  and many a kick did the boxbut it was a mischievous box as we shall see and deserved all it gotmany a kick did it receive  but certain it is if it had not been for the box our activeminded little pandora would not have known half so well how to spend her time as she now did  for it was really an endless employment to guess what was inside  what could it be indeed  just imagine my little hearers how busy your wits would be if there were a great box in the house which as you might have reason to suppose contained something new and pretty for your christmas or newyears gifts  do you think that you should be less curious than pandora  if you were left alone with the box might you not feel a little tempted to lift the lid  but you would not do it o fie  no no  only if you thought there were toys in it it would be so very hard to let slip an opportunity of taking just one peep  i know not whether pandora expected any toys for none had yet begun to be made probably in those days when the world itself was one great plaything for the children that dwelt upon it  but pandora was convinced that there was something very beautiful and valuable in the box and therefore she felt just as anxious to take a peep as any of these little girls here around me would have felt  and possibly a little more so but of that i am not quite so certain  on this particular day however which we have so long been talking about her curiosity grew so much greater than it usually was that at last she approached the box  she was more than half determined to open it if she could  ah naughty pandora  first however she tried to lift it  it was heavy quite too heavy for the slender strength of a child like pandora  she raised one end of the box a few inches from the floor and let it fall again with a pretty loud thump  a moment afterwards she almost fancied that she heard something stir inside of the box  she applied her ear as closely as possible and listened positively there did seem to be a kind of stifled murmur within  or was it merely the singing in pandoras ears or could it be the beating of her heart  the child could not quite satisfy herself whether she had heard anything or no  but at all events her curiosity was stronger than ever  as she drew back her head her eyes fell upon the knot of gold cord  it must have been a very ingenious person who tied this knot said pandora to herself  but i think i could untie it nevertheless  i am resolved at least to find the two ends of the cord  so she took the golden knot in her fingers and pried into its intricacies as sharply as she could  almost without intending it or quite knowing what she was about she was soon busily engaged in attempting to undo it  meanwhile the bright sunshine came through the open window as did likewise the merry voices of the children playing at a distance and perhaps the voice of epimetheus among then  pandora stopped to listen  what a beautiful day it was  would it not be wiser if she were to let the troublesome knot alone and think no more about the box but run and join her little playfellows and be happy  all this time however her fingers were half unconsciously busy with the knot and happening to glance at the flowerwreathed face on the lid of the enchanted box she seemed to perceive it slyly grinning at her  that face looks very mischievous thought pandora  i wonder whether it smiles because i am doing wrong  i have the greatest mind in the world to run away  but just then by the merest accident she gave the knot a kind of a twist which produced a wonderful result  the gold cord untwined itself as if by magic and left the box without a fastening  this is the strangest thing i ever knew said pandora  what will epimetheus say  and how can i possibly tie it up again  she made one or two attempts to restore the knot but soon found it quite beyond her skill  it had disentangled itself so suddenly that she could not in the least remember how the strings had been doubled into one another and when she tried to recollect the shape and appearance of the knot it seemed to have gone entirely out of her mind  nothing was to be done therefore but to let the box remain as it was until epimetheus should come in  but said pandora when he finds the knot untied he will know that i have done it  how shall i make him believe that i have not looked into the box  and then the thought came into her naughty little heart that since she would be suspected of having looked into the box she might just as well do so at once  o very naughty and very foolish pandora  you should have thought only of doing what was right and of leaving undone what was wrong and not of what your playfellow epimetheus would have said or believed  and so perhaps she might if the enchanted face on the lid of the box had not looked so bewitchingly persuasive at her and if she had not seemed to hear more distinctly than before the murmur of small voices within  she could not tell whether it was fancy or no but there was quite a little tumult of whispers in her earor else it was her curiosity that whispered  let us out dear pandorapray let us out  we will be such nice pretty playfellows for you  only let us out  what can it be thought pandora  is there something alive in the box  wellyesi am resolved to take just one peep  only one peep and then the lid shall be shut down as safely as ever  there cannot possibly be any harm in just one little peep  but it is now time for us to see what epimetheus was doing  this was the first time since his little playmate had come to dwell with him that he had attempted to enjoy any pleasure in which she did not partake  but nothing went right nor was he nearly so happy as on other days  he could not find a sweet grape or a ripe fig if epimetheus had a fault it was a little too much fondness for figs or if ripe at all they were overripe and so sweet as to be cloying there was no mirth in his heart such as usually made his voice gush out of its own accord and swell the merriment of his companions  in short he grew so uneasy and discontented that the other children could not imagine what was the matter with epimetheus  neither did he himself know what ailed him any better than they did  for you must recollect that at the time we are speaking of it was everybodys nature and constant habit to be happy  the world had not yet learned to be otherwise  not a single soul or body since these children were first sent to enjoy themselves on the beautiful earth had ever been sick or out of sorts  at length discovering that somehow or other he put a stop to all the play epimetheus judged it best to go back to pandora who was in a humor better suited to his own  but with a hope of giving her pleasure he gathered some flowers and made them into a wreath which he meant to put upon her head  the flowers were very lovelyroses and lilies and orangeblossoms and a great many more which left a trail of fragrance behind as epimetheus carried them along and the wreath was put together with as much skill as could reasonably be expected of a boy  the fingers of little girls it has always appeared to me are the fittest to twine flowerwreaths but boys could do it in those days rather better than they can now  and here i must mention that a great black cloud had been gathering in the sky for some time past although it had not yet overspread the sun but just as epimetheus reached the cottage door this cloud began to intercept the sunshine and thus to make a sudden and sad obscurity  he entered softly for he meant if possible to steal behind pandora and fling the wreath of flowers over her head before she should be aware of his approach  but as it happened there was no need of his treading so very lightly  he might have trod as heavily as he pleasedas heavily as a grown manas heavily i was going to say as an elephantwithout much probability of pandoras hearing his footsteps she was too intent upon her purpose  at the moment of his entering the cottage the naughty child had put her hand to the lid and was on the point of opening the mysterious box  epimetheus beheld her  if he had cried out pandora would probably have withdrawn her hand and the fatal mystery of the box might never have been known  but epimetheus himself although he said very little about it had his own share of curiosity to know what was inside  perceiving that pandora was resolved to find out the secret he determined that his playfellow should not be the only wise person in the cottage  and if there were anything pretty or valuable in the box he meant to take half of it to himself  thus after all his sage speeches to pandora about restraining her curiosity epimetheus turned out to be quite as foolish and nearly as much in fault as she  so whenever we blame pandora for what happened we must not forget to shake our heads at epimetheus likewise  as pandora raised the lid the cottage grew very dark and dismal for the black cloud had now swept quite over the sun and seemed to have buried it alive  there had for a little while past been a low growling and muttering which all at once broke into a heavy peal of thunder  but pandora heeding nothing of all this lifted the lid nearly upright and looked inside  it seemed as if a sudden swarm of winged creatures brushed past her taking flight out of the box while at the same instant she heard the voice of epimetheus with a lamentable tone as if he were in pain  o i am stung cried he  i am stung  naughty pandora  why have you opened this wicked box  pandora let fall the lid and starting up looked about her to see what had befallen epimetheus  the thundercloud had so darkened the room that she could not very clearly discern what was in it  but she heard a disagreeable buzzing as if a great many huge flies or gigantic mosquitoes or those insects which we call dorbugs and pinchingdogs were darting about  and as her eyes grew more accustomed to the imperfect light she saw a crowd of ugly little shapes with bats wings looking abominably spiteful and armed with terribly long stings in their tails  it was one of these that had stung epimetheus  nor was it a great while before pandora herself began to scream in no less pain and affright than her playfellow and making a vast deal more hubbub about it  an odious little monster had settled on her forehead and would have stung her i know not how deeply if epimetheus had not run and brushed it away  now if you wish to know what these ugly things might be which had made their escape out of the box i must tell you that they were the whole family of earthly troubles  there were evil passions there were a great many species of cares there were more than a hundred and fifty sorrows there were diseases in a vast number of miserable and painful shapes there were more kinds of naughtiness than it would be of any use to talk about  in short everything that has since afflicted the souls and bodies of mankind had been shut up in the mysterious box and given to epimetheus and pandora to be kept safely in order that the happy children of the world might never be molested by them  had they been faithful to their trust all would have gone well  no grown person would ever have been sad nor any child have had cause to shed a single tear from that hour until this moment  butand you may see by this how a wrong act of any one mortal is a calamity to the whole worldby pandoras lifting the lid of that miserable box and by the fault of epimetheus too in not preventing her these troubles have obtained a foothold among us and do not seem very likely to be driven away in a hurry  for it was impossible as you will easily guess that the two children should keep the ugly swarm in their own little cottage  on the contrary the first thing that they did was to fling open the doors and windows in hopes of getting rid of them and sure enough away flew the winged troubles all abroad and so pestered and tormented the small people everywhere about that none of them so much as smiled for many days afterwards  and what was very singular all the flowers and dewy blossoms on earth not one of which had hitherto faded now began to droop and shed their leaves after a day or two  the children moreover who before seemed immortal in their childhood now grew older day by day and came soon to be youths and maidens and men and women by and by and aged people before they dreamed of such a thing  meanwhile the naughty pandora and hardly less naughty epimetheus remained in their cottage  both of them had been grievously stung and were in a good deal of pain which seemed the more intolerable to them because it was the very first pain that had ever been felt since the world began  of course they were entirely unaccustomed to it and could have no idea what it meant  besides all this they were in exceedingly bad humor both with themselves and with one another  in order to indulge it to the utmost epimetheus sat down sullenly in a corner with his back towards pandora while pandora flung herself upon the floor and rested her head on the fatal and abominable box  she was crying bitterly and sobbing as if her heart would break  suddenly there was a gentle little tap on the inside of the lid  what can that be cried pandora lifting her head  but either epimetheus had not heard the tap or was too much out of humor to notice it  at any rate he made no answer  you are very unkind said pandora sobbing anew not to speak to me  again the tap  it sounded like the tiny knuckles of a fairys hand knocking lightly and playfully on the inside of the box  who are you  asked pandora with a little of her former curiosity who are you inside of this naughty box  a sweet little voice spoke from within  only lift the lid and you shall see  no no answered pandora again beginning to sob i have had enough of lifting the lid  you are inside of the box naughty creature and there you shall stay  there are plenty of your ugly brothers and sisters already flying about the world  you need never think that i shall be so foolish as to let you out  she looked towards epimetheus as she spoke perhaps expecting that he would commend her for her wisdom  but the sullen boy only muttered that she was wise a little too late  ah said the sweet little voice again you had much better let me out  i am not like those naughty creatures that have stings in their tails  they are no brothers and sisters of mine as you would see at once if you were only to get a glimpse of me  come come my pretty pandora  i am sure you will let me out  and indeed there was a kind of cheerful witchery in the tone that made it almost impossible to refuse anything which this little voice asked  pandoras heart had insensibly grown lighter at every word that came from within the box  epimetheus too though still in the corner had turned half round and seemed to be in rather better spirits than before  my dear epimetheus cried pandora have you heard this little voice  yes to be sure i have answered he but in no very goodhumor as yet and what of it  shall i lift the lid again asked pandora  just as you please said epimetheus  you have done so much mischief already that perhaps you may as well do a little more  one other trouble in such a swarm as you have set adrift about the world can make no very great difference  you might speak a little more kindly murmured pandora wiping her eyes  ah naughty boy cried the little voice within the box in an arch and laughing tone  he knows he is longing to see me  come my dear pandora lift up the lid  i am in a great hurry to comfort you  only let me have some fresh air and you shall soon see that matters are not quite so dismal as you think them  epimetheus exclaimed pandora come what may i am resolved to open the box  and as the lid seems very heavy cried epimetheus running across the room i will help you  so with one consent the two children again lifted the lid  out flew a sunny and smiling little personage and hovered about the room throwing a light wherever she went  have you never made the sunshine dance into dark corners by reflecting it from a bit of lookingglass  well so looked the winged cheerfulness of this fairylike stranger amid the gloom of the cottage  she flew to epimetheus and laid the least touch of her finger on the inflamed spot where the trouble had stung him and immediately the anguish of it was gone  then she kissed pandora on the forehead and her hurt was cured likewise  after performing these good offices the bright stranger fluttered sportively over the childrens heads and looked so sweetly at them that they both began to think it not so very much amiss to have opened the box since otherwise their cheery guest must have been kept a prisoner among those naughty imps with stings in their tails  pray who are you beautiful creature inquired pandora  i am to be called hope answered the sunshiny figure  and because i am such a cheery little body i was packed into the box to make amends to the human race for that swarm of ugly troubles which was destined to be let loose among them  never fear we shall do pretty well in spite of them all  your wings are colored like the rainbow  exclaimed pandora  how very beautiful  yes they are like the rainbow said hope because glad as my nature is i am partly made of tears as well as smiles  and will you stay with us asked epimetheus for ever and ever  as long as you need me said hope with her pleasant smileand that will be as long as you live in the worldi promise never to desert you  there may come times and seasons now and then when you will think that i have utterly vanished  but again and again and again when perhaps you least dream of it you shall see the glimmer of my wings on the ceiling of your cottage  yes my dear children and i know something very good and beautiful that is to be given you hereafter  o tell us they exclaimedtell us what it is  do not ask me replied hope putting her finger on her rosy mouth but do not despair even if it should never happen while you live on this earth  trust in my promise for it is true  we do trust you cried epimetheus and pandora both in one breath  and so they did and not only they but so has everybody trusted hope that has since been alive  and to tell you the truth i cannot help being gladthough to be sure it was an uncommonly naughty thing for her to dobut i cannot help being glad that our foolish pandora peeped into the box  no doubtno doubtthe troubles are still flying about the world and have increased in multitude rather than lessened and are a very ugly set of imps and carry most venomous stings in their tails  i have felt them already and expect to feel them more as i grow older  but then that lovely and lightsome little figure of hope what in the world could we do without her  hope spiritualizes the earth hope makes it always new and even in the earths best and brightest aspect hope shows it to be only the shadow of an infinite bliss hereafter    tanglewood playroom  after the story  primrose asked eustace pinching her ear how do you like my little pandora  dont you think her the exact picture of yourself  but you would not have hesitated half so long about opening the box  then i should have been well punished for my naughtiness retorted primrose smartly for the first thing to pop out after the lid was lifted would have been mr eustace bright in the shape of a trouble  cousin eustace said sweet fern did the box hold all the trouble that has ever come into the world  every mite of it  answered eustace  this very snowstorm which has spoiled my skating was packed up there  and how big was the box asked sweet fern  why perhaps three feet long said eustace two feet wide and two feet and a half high  ah said the child you are making fun of me cousin eustace  i know there is not trouble enough in the world to fill such a great box as that  as for the snowstorm it is no trouble at all but a pleasure so it could not have been in the box  hear the child cried primrose with an
