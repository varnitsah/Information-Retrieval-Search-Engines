4928354	mornings in florence  by  john ruskin ma     mornings in florence  the first morning santa croce   if there is one artist more than another whose work it is desirable that you should examine in florence supposing that you care for old art at all it is giotto you can indeed also see work of his at assisi but it is not likely you will stop there to any purpose at padua there is much but only of one period at florence which is his birthplace you can see pictures by him of every date and every kind but you had surely better see first what is of his best time and of the best kind he painted very small pictures and very largepainted from the age of twelve to sixtypainted some subjects carelessly which he had little interest insome carefully with all his heart you would surely like and it would certainly be wise to see him first in his strong and earnest workto see a painting by him if possible of large size and wrought with his full strength and of a subject pleasing to him and if it were also a subject interesting to yourselfbetter still  now if indeed you are interested in old art you cannot but know the power of the thirteenth century you know that the character of it was concentrated in and to the full expressed by its best king st louis you know st louis was a franciscan and that the franciscans for whom giotto was continually painting under dantes advice were prouder of him than of any other of their royal brethren or sisters if giotto ever would imagine anybody with care and delight it would be st louis if it chanced that anywhere he had st louis to paint  also you know that he was appointed to build the campanile of the duomo because he was then the best master of sculpture painting and architecture in florence and supposed to be without superior in the world footnote cum in universe orbe non reperiri dicatur quenquam qui sufficientior sit in his et aliis multis artibus magistro giotto bondonis de florentia pictore et accipiendus sit in patriâ velut magnus magisterdecree of his appointment quoted by lord lindsay vol ii p 247  and that this commission was given him late in life of course he could not have designed the campanile when he was a boy so therefore if you find any of his figures painted under pure campanile architecture and the architecture by his hand you know without other evidence that the painting must be of his strongest time  so if one wanted to find anything of his to begin with especially and could choose what it should be one would say a fresco life size with campanile architecture behind it painted in an important place and if one might choose ones subject perhaps the most interesting saint of all saintsfor him to do for uswould be st louis  wait then for an entirely bright morning rise with the sun and go to santa croce with a good operaglass in your pocket with which you shall for once at any rate see an opus and if you have time several opera walk straight to the chapel on the right of the choir k in your murrays guide when you first get into it you will see nothing but a modern window of glaring glass with a redhot cardinal in one panewhich piece of modern manufacture takes away at least seveneighths of the light little enough before by which you might have seen what is worth sight wait patiently till you get used to the gloom then guarding your eyes from the accursed modern window as best you may take your operaglass and look to the right at the uppermost of the two figures beside it it is st louis under campanile architecture painted bygiotto or the last florentine painter who wanted a jobover giotto that is the first question you have to determine as you will have henceforward in every case in which you look at a fresco  sometimes there will be no question at all these two grey frescos at the bottom of the walls on the right and left for instance have been entirely got up for your better satisfaction in the last year or two over giottos halfeffaced lines but that st louis repainted or not it is a lovely thingthere can be no question about that and we must look at it after some preliminary knowledge gained not inattentively  your murrays guide tells you that this chapel of the bardi della libertà in which you stand is covered with frescos by giotto that they were whitewashed and only laid bare in 1853 that they were painted between 1296 and 1304 that they represent scenes in the life of st francis and that on each side of the window are paintings of st louis of toulouse st louis king of france st elizabeth of hungary and st claireall much restored and repainted under such recommendation the frescos are not likely to be much sought after and accordingly as i was at work in the chapel this morning sunday 6th september 1874 two nicelooking englishmen under guard of their valet de place passed the chapel without so much as looking in  you will perhaps stay a little longer in it with me good reader and find out gradually where you are namely in the most interesting and perfect little gothic chapel in all italyso far as i know or can hear there is no other of the great time which has all its frescos in their place the arena though far larger is of earlier datenot pure gothic nor showing giottos full force the lower chapel at assisi is not gothic at all and is still only of giottos middle time you have here developed gothic with giotto in his consummate strength and nothing lost in form of the complete design  by restorationjudicious restoration as mr murray usually calls it there is no saying how much you have lost putting the question of restoration out of your mind however for a while think where you are and what you have got to look at  you are in the chapel next the high altar of the great franciscan church of florence a few hundred yards west of you within ten minutes walk is the baptistery of florence and five minutes walk west of that is the great dominican church of florence santa maria novella  get this little bit of geography and architectural fact well into your mind there is the little octagon baptistery in the middle here ten minutes walk east of it the franciscan church of the holy cross there five minutes walk west of it the dominican church of st mary  now that little octagon baptistery stood where it now stands and was finished though the roof has been altered since in the eighth century it is the central building of etrurian christianityof european christianity  from the day it was finished christianity went on doing her best in etruria and elsewhere for four hundred yearsand her best seemed to have come to very littlewhen there rose up two men who vowed to god it should come to more and they made it come to more forthwith of which the immediate sign in florence was that she resolved to have a fine new crossshaped cathedral instead of her quaint old little octagon one and a tower beside it that should beat babelwhich two buildings you have also within sight  but your business is not at present with them but with these two earlier churches of holy cross and st mary the two men who were the effectual builders of these were the two great religious powers and reformers of the thirteenth centuryst francis who taught christian men how they should behave and st dominic who taught christian men what they should think in brief one the apostle of works the other of faith each sent his little company of disciples to teach and to preach in florence st francis in 1212 st dominic in 1220  the little companies were settledone ten minutes walk east of the old baptistery the other five minutes walk west of it and after they had stayed quietly in such lodgings as were given them preaching and teaching through most of the century and had got florence as it were heated through she burst out into christian poetry and architecture of which you have heard much talkburst into bloom of arnolfo giotto dante orcagna and the like persons whose works you profess to have come to florence that you may see and understand  florence then thus heated through first helped her teachers to build finer churches the dominicans or white friars the teachers of faith began their church of st marys in 1279 the franciscans or black friars the teachers of works laid the first stone of this church of the holy cross in 1294 and the whole city laid the foundations of its new cathedral in 1298 the dominicans designed their own building but for the franciscans and the town worked the first great master of gothic art arnolfo with giotto at his side and dante looking on and whispering sometimes a word to both  and here you stand beside the high altar of the franciscans church under a vault of arnolfos building with at least some of giottos colour on it still fresh and in front of you over the little altar is the only reportedly authentic portrait of st francis taken from life by giottos master yet i can hardly blame my two english friends for never looking in except in the early morning light not one touch of all this art can be seen and in any light unless you understand the relations of giotto to st francis and of st francis to humanity it will be of little interest  observe then the special character of giotto among the great painters of italy is his being a practical person whatever other men dreamed of he did he could work in mosaic he could work in marble he could paint and he could build and all thoroughly a man of supreme faculty supreme common sense accordingly he ranges himself at once among the disciples of the apostle of works and spends most of his time in the same apostleship  now the gospel of works according to st francis lay in three things you must work without money and be poor you must work without pleasure and be chaste you must work according to orders and be obedient  those are st franciss three articles of italian opera by which grew the many pretty things you have come to see here  and now if you will take your operaglass and look up to the roof above arnolfos building you will see it is a pretty gothic cross vault in four quarters each with a circular medallion painted by giotto that over the altar has the picture of st francis himself the three others of his commanding angels in front of him over the entrance arch poverty on his right hand obedience on his left chastity  poverty in a red patched dress with grey wings and a square nimbus of glory above her head is flying from a black hound whose head is seen at the corner of the medallion  chastity veiled is imprisoned in a tower while angels watch her  obedience bears a yoke on her shoulders and lays her hand on a book  now this same quatrefoil of st francis and his three commanding angels was also painted but much more elaborately by giotto on the cross vault of the lower church of assisi and it is a question of interest which of the two roofs was painted first  your murrays guide tells you the frescos in this chapel were painted between 1296 and 1304 but as they represent among other personages st louis of toulouse who was not canonized till 1317 that statement is not altogether tenable also as the first stone of the church was only laid in 1294 when giotto was a youth of eighteen it is little likely that either it would have been ready to be painted or he ready with his scheme of practical divinity two years later  farther arnolfo the builder of the main body of the church died in 1310 and as st louis of toulouse was not a saint till seven years afterwards and the frescos therefore beside the window not painted in arnolfos day it becomes another question whether arnolfo left the chapels or the church at all in their present form  on which pointnow that i have shown you where giottos st louis is i will ask you to think awhile until you are interested and then i will try to satisfy your curiosity there fore please leave the little chapel for the moment and walk down the nave till you come to two sepulchral slabs near the west end and then look about you and see what sort of a church santa croce is  without looking about you at all you may find in your murray the useful information that it is a church which consists of a very wide nave and lateral aisles separated by seven fine pointed arches and as you will beunder ordinary conditions of tourist hurryglad to learn so much without looking it is little likely to occur to you that this nave and two rich aisles required also for your complete present comfort walls at both ends and a roof on the top it is just possible indeed you may have been struck on entering by the curious disposition of painted glass at the east endmore remotely possible that in returning down the nave you may this moment have noticed the extremely small circular window at the west end but the chances are a thousand to one that after being pulled from tomb to tomb round the aisles and chapels you should take so extraordinary an additional amount of pains as to look up at the roofunless you do it now quietly it will have had its effect upon you even if you dont without your knowledge you will return home with a general impression that santa croce is somehow the ugliest gothic church you ever were in well that is really so and now will you take the pains to see why  there are two features on which more than on any others the grace and delight of a fine gothic building depends one is the springing of its vaultings the other the proportion and fantasy of its traceries this church of santa croce has no vaultings at all but the roof of a farmhouse barn and its windows are all of the same patternthe exceedingly prosaic one of two pointed arches with a round hole above between them  and to make the simplicity of the roof more conspicuous the aisles are successive sheds built at every arch in the aisles of the campo santo of pisco the unbroken flat roof leaves the eye free to look to the traceries but here a succession of upanddown sloping beam and lath gives the impression of a line of stabling rather than a church aisle and lastly while in fine gothic buildings the entire perspective concludes itself gloriously in the high and distant apse here the nave is cut across sharply by a line of ten chapels the apse being only a tall recess in the midst of them so that strictly speaking the church is not of the form of a cross but of a letter t  can this clumsy and ungraceful arrangement be indeed the design of the renowned arnolfo  yes this is purest arnolfogothic not beautiful by any means but deserving nevertheless our thoughtfullest examination we will trace its complete character another day just now we are only concerned with this prechristian form of the letter t insisted upon in the lines of chapels  respecting which you are to observe that the first christian churches in the catacombs took the form of a blunt cross naturally a square chamber having a vaulted recess on each side then the byzantine churches were structurally built in the form of an equal cross while the heraldic and other ornamental equalarmed crosses are partly signs of glory and victory partly of light and divine spiritual presence footnote see on this subject generally mr r st j tyrwhitts artteaching of the primitive church s p b k 1874  but the franciscans and dominicans saw in the cross no sign of triumph but of trialfootnote i have never obtained time for any right study of early christian churchdisciplinenor am i sure to how many other causes the choice of the form of the basilica may be occasionally attributed or by what other communities it may be made symbolism for instance has most power with the franciscans and convenience for preaching with the dominicans but in all cases and in all places the transition from the close tribune to the brightlylighted apse indicates the change in christian feeling between regarding a church as a place for public judgment or teaching or a place for private prayer and congregational praise the following passage from the dean of westminsters perfect history of his abbey ought to be read also in the florentine churchthe nearest approach to westminster abbey in this aspect is the church of santa croce at florence there as here the present destination of the building was no part of the original design but was the result of various converging causes as the church of one of the two great preaching orders it had a nave large beyond all proportion to its choir that order being the franciscan bound by vows of poverty the simplicity of the worship preserved the whole space clear from any adventitious ornaments the popularity of the franciscans especially in a convent hallowed by a visit from st francis himself drew to it not only the chief civic festivals but also the numerous families who gave alms to the friars and whose connection with their church was for this reason in turn encouraged by them in those graves piled with standards und achievements of the noble families of florence were successively interrednot because of their eminence but as members or friends of those familiessome of the most illustrious personages of the fifteenth century thus it came to pass as if by accident that in the vault of the buonarotti was laid michael angelo in the vault of the viviani the preceptor of one of their house galileo from those two burials the church gradually be same the recognized shrine of italian genius the wounds of their master were to be their inheritance so their first aim was to make what image to the cross their church might present distinctly that of the actual instrument of death  and they did this most effectually by using the form of the letter t that of the furca or gibbetnot the sign of peace  also their churches were meant for use not show nor selfglorification nor townglorification they wanted places for preaching prayer sacrifice burial and had no intention of showing how high they could build towers or how widely they could arch vaults strong walls and the roof of a barnthese your franciscan asks of his arnolfo these arnolfo givesthoroughly and wisely built the successions of gable roof being a new device for strength much praised in its day  this stern humor did not last long arnolfo himself had other notions much more cimabue and giotto most of all nature and heaven something else had to be taught about christ than that he was wounded to death nevertheless look how grand this stern form would be restored to its simplicity it is not the old church which is in itself unimpressive it is the old church defaced by vasari by michael angelo and by modern florence see those huge tombs on your right hand and left at the sides of the aisles with their alternate gable and round tops and their paltriest of all possible sculpture trying to be grand by bigness and pathetic by expense tear them all down in your imagination fancy the vast hall with its massive pillarsnot painted calomelpill colour as now but of their native stone with a rough true wood for roofand a people praying beneath them strong in abiding and pure in life as their rocks and olive forests that was arnolfos santa croce nor did his work remain long without grace  that very line of chapels in which we found our st louis shows signs of change in temper they have no penthouse roofs but true gothic vaults we found our foursquare type of franciscan law on one of them  it is probable then that these chapels may be later than the rest even in their stonework in their decoration they are so assuredly belonging already to the time when the story of st francis was becoming a passionate tradition told and painted everywhere with delight  and that high recess taking the place of apse in the centresee how noble it is in the coloured shade surrounding and joining the glow of its windows though their form be so simple you are not to be amused here by patterns in balanced stone as a french or english architect would amuse you says arnolfo you are to read and think under these severe walls of mine immortal hands will write upon them we will go back therefore into this line of manuscript chapels presently but first look at the two sepulchral slabs by which you are standing that farther of the two from the west end is one of the most beautiful pieces of fourteenth century sculpture in this world and it contains simple elements of excellence by your understanding of which you may test your power of understanding the more difficult ones you will have to deal with presently  it represents an old man in the high deeplyfolded cap worn by scholars and gentlemen in florence from 13001500 lying dead with a book in his breast over which his hands are folded at his feet is this inscription temporibus hic suis phylosophye atq medicine culmen fuit galileus de galileis olim bonajutis qui etiam summo in magistratu miro quodam modo rempublicam dilexit cujus sancte memorie bene acte vite pie benedictus filius hunc tumulum patri sibi suisq posteris edidit  mr murray tells you that the effigies in low relief alas yes low enough nowworn mostly into flat stones with a trace only of the deeper lines left but originally in very bold relief with which the floor of santa croce is inlaid of which this by which you stand is characteristic are interesting from the costume but that except in the case of john ketterick bishop of st davids few of the other names have any interest beyond the walls of florence as however you are at present within the walls of florence you may perhaps condescend to take some interest in this ancestor or relation of the galileo whom florence indeed left to be externally interesting and would not allow to enter in her walls  footnote                 seven years a prisoner at the city gate                  let in but his graveclothes                                      rogers italy  i am not sure if i rightly place or construe the phrase in the above inscription cujus sancte memorie bene acte but in main purport the legend runs thus this galileo of the galilei was in his times the head of philosophy and medicine who also in the highest magistracy loved the republic marvellously whose son blessed in inheritance of his holy memory and wellpassed and pious life appointed this tomb for his father for himself and for his posterity  there is no date but the slab immediately behind it nearer the western door is of the same style but of later and inferior work and bears datei forget now of what early year in the fifteenth century  but florence was still in her pride and you may observe in this epitaph on what it was based that her philosophy was studied together with useful arts and as a part of them that the masters in these became naturally the masters in public affairs that in such magistracy they loved the state and neither cringed to it nor robbed it that the sons honoured their fathers and received their fathers honour as the most blessed inheritance remember the phrase vite pie bene dictus filius to be compared with the nos nequiores of the declining days of all stateschiefly now in florence france and england  thus much for the local interest of name next for the universal interest of the art of this tomb  it is the crowning virtue of all great art that however little is left of it by the injuries of time that little will be lovely as long as you can see anything you can seealmost allso much the hand of the master will suggest of his soul  and here you are well quit for once of restoration no one cares for this sculpture and if florence would only thus put all her old sculpture and painting under her feet and simply use them for gravestones and oilcloth she would be more merciful to them than she is now here at least what little is left is true  and if you look long you will find it is not so little that worn face is still a perfect portrait of the old man though like one struck out at a venture with a few rough touches of a masters chisel and that falling drapery of his cap is in its few lines faultless and subtle beyond description  and now here is a simple but most useful test of your capacity for understanding florentine sculpture or painting if you can see that the lines of that cap are both right and lovely that the choice of the folds is exquisite in its ornamental relations of line and that the softness and ease of them is completethough only sketched with a few dark touchesthen you can understand giottos drawing and botticellisdonatellos carving and lucas but if you see nothing in this sculpture you will see nothing in theirs of theirs where they choose to imitate flesh or silk or to play any vulgar modern trick with marbleand they often dowhatever in a word is french or american or cockney in their work you can see but what is florentine and for ever greatunless you can see also the beauty of this old man in his citizens capyou will see never  there is more in this sculpture however than its simple portraiture and noble drapery the old man lies on a piece of embroidered carpet and protected by the higher relief many of the finer lines of this are almost uninjured in particular its exquisitelywrought fringe and tassels are nearly perfect and if you will kneel down and look long at the tassels of the cushion under the head and the way they fill the angles of the stone you willor mayknow from this example alone what noble decorative sculpture is and was and must be from the days of earliest greece to those of latest italy  exquisitely sculptured fringe and you have just been abusing sculptors who play tricks with marble yes and you cannot find a better example in all the museums of europe of the work of a man who does not play tricks with itthan this tomb try to understand the difference it is a point of quite cardinal importance to all your future study of sculpture  i told you observe that the old galileo was lying on a piece of embroidered carpet i dont think if i had not told you that you would have found it out for yourself it is not so like a carpet as all that comes to  but had it been a modern tricksculpture the moment you came to the tomb you would have said dear me how wonderfully that carpet is doneit doesnt look like stone in the leastone longs to take it up and beat it to get the dust off  now whenever you feel inclined to speak so of a sculptured drapery be assured without more ado the sculpture is base and bad you will merely waste your time and corrupt your taste by looking at it nothing is so easy as to imitate drapery in marble you may cast a piece any day and carve it with such subtlety that the marble shall be an absolute image of the folds but that is not sculpture that is mechanical manufacture  no great sculptor from the beginning of art to the end of it has ever carved or ever will a deceptive drapery he has neither time nor will to do it his masons lad may do that if he likes a man who can carve a limb or a face never finishes inferior parts but either with a hasty and scornful chisel or with such grave and strict selection of their lines as you know at once to be imaginative not imitative  but if as in this case he wants to oppose the simplicity of his central subject with a rich backgrounda labyrinth of ornamental lines to relieve the severity of expressive oneshe will carve you a carpet or a tree or a rose thicket with their fringes and leaves and thorns elaborated as richly as natural ones but always for the sake of the ornamental form never of the imitation yet seizing the natural character in the lines he gives with twenty times the precision and clearness of sight that the mere imitator has examine the tassels of the cushion and the way they blend with the fringe thoroughly you cannot possibly see finer ornamental sculpture then look at the same tassels in the same place of the slab next the west end of the church and you will see a scholars rude imitation of a masters hand though in a fine school notice however the folds of the drapery at the feet of this figure they are cut so as to show the hem of the robe within as well as without and are fine then as you go back to giottos chapel keep to the left and just beyond the north door in the aisle is the much celebrated tomb of c marsuppini by desiderio of settignano it is very fine of its kind but there the drapery is chiefly done to cheat you and chased delicately to show how finely the sculptor could chisel it it is wholly vulgar and mean in cast of fold under your feet as you look at it you will tread another tomb of the fine time which looking last at you will recognize the difference between the false and true art as far as there is capacity in you at present to do so and if you really and honestly like the lowlying stones and see more beauty in them you have also the power of enjoying giotto into whose chapel we will return tomorrownot today for the light must have left it by this time and now that you have been looking at these sculptures on the floor you had better traverse nave and aisle across and across and get some idea of that sacred field of stone in the north transept you will find a beautiful knight the finest in chiselling of all these tombs except one by the same hand in the south aisle just where it enters the south transept  examine the lines of the gothic niches traced above them and what is left of arabesque on their armour they are far more beautiful and tender in chivalric conception than donatellos st george which is merely a piece of vigorous naturalism founded on these older tombs if you will drive in the evening to the chartreuse in val dema you may see there an uninjured example of this slabtomb by donatello himself very beautiful but not so perfect as the earlier ones on which it is founded and you may see some fading light and shade of monastic life among which if you stay till the fireflies come out in the twilight and thus get to sleep when you come home you will be better prepared for tomorrow mornings walkif you will take another with methan if you go to a party to talk sentiment about italy and hear the last news from london and new york     the second morning  the golden gate   today as early as you please and at all events before doing anything else let us go to giottos own parishchurch santa maria novella if walking from the strozzi palace you look on your right for the way of the beautiful ladies it will take you quickly there  do not let anything in the way of acquaintance sacristan or chance sight stop you in doing what i tell you walk straight up to the church into the apse of ityou may let your eyes rest as you walk on the glow of its glass only mind the step half wayand lift the curtain and go in behind the grand marble altar giving anybody who follows you anything they want to hold their tongues or go away  you know most probably already that the frescos on each side of you are ghirlandajos you have been told they are very fine and if you know anything of painting you know the portraits in them are so nevertheless somehow you dont really enjoy these frescos nor come often here do you  the reason of which is that if you are a nice person they are not nice enough for you and if a vulgar person not vulgar enough but if you are a nice person i want you to look carefully today at the two lowest next the windows for a few minutes that you may better feel the art you are really to study by its contrast with these  on your left hand is represented the birth of the virgin on your right her meeting with elizabeth  you cant easily see better piecesnowhere more pompous piecesof flat goldsmiths work ghirlandajo was to the end of his life a mere goldsmith with a gift of portraiture and here he has done his best and has put a long wall in wonderful perspective and the whole city of florence behind elizabeths house in the hill country and a splendid basrelief in the style of luca della robbia in st annes bedroom and he has carved all the pilasters and embroidered all the dresses and flourished and trumpeted into every corner and it is all done within just a point as well as it can be done and quite as well as ghirlandajo could do it but the point in which it just misses being as well as it can be done is the vital point and it is all simplygood for nothing  extricate yourself from the goldsmiths rubbish of it and look full at the salutation you will say perhaps at first what grand and graceful figures are you sure they are graceful look again and you will see their draperies hang from them exactly as they would from two clothespegs now fine drapery really well drawn as it hangs from a clothespeg is always rather impressive especially if it be disposed in large breadths and deep folds but that is the only grace of their figures  secondly look at the madonna carefully you will find she is not the least meekonly stupidas all the other women in the picture are  st elizabeth you think is nice yes and she says whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me really with a great deal of serious feeling yes with a great deal well you have looked enough at those two nowjust for another minutelook at the birth of the virgin a most graceful group your murrays guide tells you in the attendant servants extremely so also the one holding the child is rather pretty also the servant pouring out the water does it from a great height without splashing most cleverly also the lady coming to ask for st anne and see the baby walks majestically and is very finely dressed and as for that basrelief in the style of luca della robbia you might really almost think it was luca the very best plated goods master ghirlandajo no doubtalways on hand at your shop  well now you must ask for the sacristan who is civil and nice enough and get him to let you into the green cloister and then go into the less cloister opening out of it on the right as you go down the steps and you must ask for the tomb of the marcheza stiozzi ridolfi and in the recess behind the marchezas tombvery close to the ground and in excellent light if the day is fineyou will see two small frescos only about four feet wide each in oddshaped bits of wallquarters of circles representingthat on the left the meeting of joachim and anna at the golden gate and that on the right the birth of the virgin  no flourish of trumpets here at any rate you think no gold on the gate and for the birth of the virginis this all goodnessnothing to be seen whatever of basreliefs nor fine dresses nor graceful pourings out of water nor processions of visitors  no theres but one thing you can see here which you didnt in ghirlandajos fresco unless you were very clever and looked hard for itthe baby and you are never likely to see a more true piece of giottos work in this world  a roundfaced smalleyed little thing tied up in a bundle  yes giotto was of opinion she must have appeared really not much else than that but look at the servant who has just finished dressing her awestruck full of love and wonder putting her hand softly on the childs head who has never cried the nurse who has just taken her isthe nurse and no more tidy in the extreme and greatly proud and pleased but would be as much so with any other child  ghirlandajos st anne i ought to have told you to notice thatyou can afterwards is sitting strongly up in bed watching if not directing all that is going on giottos lying down on the pillow leans her face on her hand partly exhausted partly in deep thought she knows that all will be well done for the child either by the servants or god she need not look after anything  at the foot of the bed is the midwife and a servant who has brought drink for st anne the servant stops seeing her so quiet asking the midwife shall i give it her now the midwife her hands lifted under her robe in the attitude of thanksgiving with giotto distinguishable always though one doesnt know how from that of prayer answers with her look let beshe does not want anything  at the door a single acquaintance is coming in to see the child of ornament there is only the entirely simple outline of the vase which the servant carries of colour two or three masses of sober red and pure white with brown and gray  that is all and if you can be pleased with this you can see florence but if not by all means amuse yourself there if you find it amusing as long as you like you can never see it  but if indeed you are pleased ever so little with this fresco think what that pleasure means i brought you on purpose round through the richest overture and farrago of tweedledum and tweedledee i could find in florence and here is a tune of four notes on a shepherds pipe played by the picture of nobody and yet you like it you know what music is then here is another little tune by the same player and sweeter i let you hear the simplest first  the fresco on the left hand with the bright blue sky and the rosy figures why anybody might like that  yes but alas all the blue sky is repainted it was blue always however and bright too and i dare say when the fresco was first done anybody did like it  you know the story of joachim and anna i hope not that i do myself quite in the ins and outs and if you dont im not going to keep you waiting while i tell it all you need know and you scarcely before this fresco need know so much is that here are an old husband and old wife meeting again by surprise after losing each other and being each in great fearmeeting at the place where they were told by god each to go without knowing what was to happen there  so they rushed into one anothers arms and kissed each other  no says giottonot that  they advanced to meet in a manner conformable to the strictest laws of composition and with their draperies cast into folds which no one until raphael could have arranged better  no says giottonot that  st anne has moved quickest her dress just falls into folds sloping backwards enough to tell you so much she has caught st joachim by his mantle and draws him to her softly by that st joachim lays his hand under her arm seeing she is like to faint and holds her up they do not kiss each otheronly look into each others eyes and gods angel lays his hand on their heads  behind them there are two rough figures busied with their own affairstwo of joachims shepherds one bare headed the other wearing the wide florentine cap with the falling point behind which is exactly like the tube of a larkspur or violet both carrying game and talking to each other aboutgreasy joan and her pot or the like not at all the sort of persons whom you would have thought in harmony with the sceneby the laws of the drama according to racine or voltaire  no but according to shakespeare or giotto these are just the kind of persons likely to be there as much as the angel is likely to be there also though you will be told nowadays that giotto was absurd for putting him into the sky of which an apothecary can always produce the similar blue in a bottle and now that you have had shakespeare and sundry other men of head and heart following the track of this shepherd lad you can forgive him his grotesques in the corner but that he should have forgiven them to himself after the training he had this is the wonder we have seen simple pictures enough in our day and therefore we think that of course shepherd boys will sketch shepherds what wonder is there in that  i can show you how in this shepherd boy it was very wonderful indeed if you will walk for five minutes back into the church with me and up into the chapel at the end of the south transeptat least if the day is bright and you get the sacristan to undraw the windowcurtain in the transept itself for then the light of it will be enough to show you the entirely authentic and most renowned work of giottos master and you will see through what schooling the lad had gone  a good and brave master he was if ever boy had one and as you will find when you know really who the great men are the master is half their life and well they know italways naming themselves from their master rather than their families see then what kind of work giotto had been first put to there is literally not a square inch of all that panelsome ten feet high by six or seven widewhich is not wrought in gold and colour with the fineness of a greek manuscript there is not such an elaborate piece of ornamentation in the first page of any gothic kings missal as you will find in that madonnas thronethe madonna herself is meant to be grave and noble only and to be attended only by angels  and here is this saucy imp of a lad declares his people must do without gold and without thrones nay that the golden gate itself shall have no gilding that st joachim and st anne shall have only one angel between them and their servants shall have their joke and nobody say them nay  it is most wonderful and would have been impossible had cimabue been a common man though ever so great in his own way nor could i in any of my former thinking understand how it was till i saw cimabues own work at assisi in which he shows himself at heart as independent of his gold as giottoeven more intense capable of higher things than giotto though of none perhaps so keen or sweet but to this day among all the mater dolorosas of christianity cimabues at assisi is the noblest nor did any painter after him add one link to the chain of thought with which he summed the creation of the earth and preached its redemption  he evidently never checked the boy from the first day he found him showed him all he knew talked with him of many things he felt himself unable to paint made him a workman and a gentlemanabove all a christianyet left hima shepherd and heaven had made him such a painter that at his height the words of his epitaph are in nowise overwrought ille ego sum per quem pictura extincta revixit  a word or two now about the repainting by which this pictura extincta has been revived to meet existing taste the sky is entirely daubed over with fresh blue yet it leaves with unusual care the original outline of the descending angel and of the white clouds about his body this idea of the angel laying his hands on the two headsas a bishop at confirmation does in a hurry and ive seen one sweep four together like arnold de winkeliedpartly in blessing partly as a symbol of their being brought together to the same place by godwas afterwards repeated again and again there is one beautiful little echo of it among the old pictures in the schools of oxford this is the first occurrence of it that i know in pure italian painting but the idea is etruscangreek and is used by the etruscan sculptors of the door of the baptistery of pisa of the evil angel who lays the heads together of two very different persons from theseherodias and her daughter  joachim and the shepherd with the larkspur cap are both quite safe the other shepherd a little reinforced the black bunches of grass hanging about are retouches they were once bunches of plants drawn with perfect delicacy and care you may see one left faint with heartshaped leaves on the highest ridge of rock above the shepherds the whole landscape is however quite undecipherably changed and spoiled  you will be apt to think at first that if anything has been restored surely the ugly shepherds uglier feet have no not at all restored feet are always drawn with entirely orthodox and academical toes like the apollo belvideres you would have admired them very much these are giottos own doing every bit and a precious business he has had of it trying again and againin vain even hands were difficult enough to him at this time but feet and bare legs well hell have a try he thinks and gets really a fair line at last when you are close to it but laying the light on the ground afterwards he dare not touch this precious and dearbought outline stops all round it a quarter of an inch off footnote perhaps it is only the restorers white on the ground that stops but i think a restorer would never have been so wise but have gone right up to the outline and spoiled all with such effect as you see but if you want to know what sort of legs and feet he can draw look at our lambs in the corner of the fresco under the arch on your left  and there is one on your right though more repaintedthe little virgin presenting herself at the templeabout which i could also say much the stooping figure kissing the hem of her robe without her knowing is as far as i remember first in this fresco the origin itself of the main design in all the others you know so well and with its steps by the way in better perspective already than most of them  this the original one you will be inclined to exclaim if you have any general knowledge of the subsequent art this giotto why its a cheap rechauffé of titian no my friend the boy who tried so hard to draw those steps in perspective had been carried down others to his grave two hundred years before titian ran alone at cadore but as surely as venice looks on the sea titian looked upon this and caught the reflected light of it forever  what kind of boy is this think you who can make titian his copyist dante his friend what new power is here which is to change the heart of italycan you see it feel it writing before you these words on the faded wall  you shall see thingsas they are  and the least with the greatest because god made them  and the greatest with the least because god made you and gave you eyes and a heart  i you shall see thingsas they are so easy a matter that you think so much more difficult and sublime to paint grand processions and golden thrones than st anne faint on her pillow and her servant at pause  easy or not it is all the sight that is required of you in this worldto see things and men and yourselfas they are  ii and the least with the greatest because god made themshepherd and flock and grass of the field no less than the golden gate  iii but also the golden gate of heaven itself open and the angels of god coming down from it  these three things giotto taught and men believed in his day of which faith you shall next see brighter work only before we leave the cloister i want to sum for you one or two of the instant and evident technical changes produced in the school of florence by this teaching  one of quite the first results of giottos simply looking at things as they were was his finding out that a red thing was red and a brown thing brown and a white thing whiteall over  the greeks had painted anything anyhowgods black horses red lips and cheeks white and when the etruscan vase expanded into a cimabue picture or a tafi mosaic stillexcept that the madonna was to have a blue dress and everything else as much gold on it as could be managedthere was very little advance in notions of colour suddenly giotto threw aside all the glitter and all the conventionalism and declared that he saw the sky blue the tablecloth white and angels when he dreamed of them rosy and he simply founded the schools of colour in italyvenetian and all as i will show you tomorrow morning if it is fine and what is more nobody discovered much about colour after him  but a deeper result of his resolve to look at things as they were was his getting so heartily interested in them that he couldnt miss their decisive moment there is a decisive instant in all matters and if you look languidly you are sure to miss it nature seems always somehow trying to make you miss it i will see that through you must say with out turning my head or you wont see the trick of it at all and the most significant thing in all his work you will find hereafter is his choice of moments i will give you at once two instances in a picture which for other reasons you should quickly compare with these frescos return by the via delle belle donne keep the casa strozzi on your right and go straight on through the market the florentines think themselves so civilized forsooth for building a nuovo lungarno and three manufactory chimneys opposite it and yet sell butchers meat dripping red peaches and anchovies side by side it is a sight to be seen much more luca della robbias madonna in the circle above the chapel door never pass near the market without looking at it and glance from the vegetables underneath to lucas leaves and lilies that you may see how honestly he was trying to make his clay like the gardenstuff but today you may pass quickly on to the uffizii which will be just open and when you enter the great gallery turn to the right and there the first picture you come at will be no 6 giottos agony in the garden  i used to think it so dull that i could not believe it was giottos that is partly from its dead colour which is the boys way of telling you it is nightmore from the subject being one quite beyond his age and which he felt no pleasure in trying at you may see he was still a boy for he not only cannot draw feet yet in the least and scrupulously hides them therefore but is very hard put to it for the hands being obliged to draw them mostly in the same positionall the four fingers together but in the careful bunches of grass and weeds you will see what the fresco foregrounds were before they got spoiled and there are some things he can understand already even about that agony thinking of it in his own fixed way some thingsnot altogether to be explained by the old symbol of the angel with the cup he will try if he cannot explain them better in those two little pictures below which nobody ever looks at the great roman sarcophagus being put in front of them and the light glancing on the new varnish so that you must twist about like a lizard to see anything nevertheless you may make out what giotto meant  the cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink it in what was its bitternessthought the boy crucifixionwell it hurts doubtless but the thieves had to bear it too and many poor human wretches have to bear worse on our battlefields butand he thinks and thinks and then he paints his two little pictures for the predella  they represent of course the sequence of the time in gethsemane but see what choice the youth made of his moments having two panels to fill plenty of choice for himin pain the flagellationthe mocking the bearing of the crossall habitually given by the margheritones and their school as extremes of pain  no thinks giotto there was worse than all that many a good man has been mocked spitefully entreated spitted on slain but who was ever so betrayed who ever saw such a sword thrust in his mothers heart  he paints first the laying hands on him in the garden but with only two principal figuresjudas and peter of course judas and peter were always principal in the old byzantine compositionjudas giving the kisspeter cutting off the servants ear but the two are here not merely principal but almost alone in sight all the other figures thrown back and peter is not at all concerned about the servant or his struggle with him he has got him downbut looks back suddenly at judas giving the kiss whatyou are the traitor thenyou  yes says giotto and you also in an hour more  the other picture is more deeply felt still it is of christ brought to the foot of the cross there is no wringing of hands or lamenting crowdno haggard signs of fainting or pain in his body scourging or fainting feeble knee and torn woundhe thinks scorn of all that this shepherdboy one executioner is hammering the wedges of the cross harder down the othernot ungentlyis taking christs red robe off his shoulders and st john a few yards off is keeping his mother from coming nearer she looks down not at christ but tries to come  and now you may go on for your days seeings through the rest of the gallery if you willfornarina and the wonderful cobbler and all the rest of it i dont want you any more till tomorrow morning  but if meantime you will sit downsay before sandro botticellis fortitude which i shall want you to look at one of these days no 1299 innermost room from the tribune and there read this following piece of one of my oxford lectures on the relation of cimabue to giotto you will be better prepared for our work tomorrow morning in santa croce and may find something to consider of in the room you are in where by the way observe that no 1288 is a most true early lionardo of extreme interest and the savants who doubt it arenever mind what but sit down at present at the feet of fortitude and read  those of my readers who have been unfortunate enough to interest themselves in that most profitless of studiesthe philosophy of art have been at various times teased or amused by disputes respecting the relative dignity of the contemplative and dramatic schools  contemplative of course being the term attached to the system of painting things only for the sake of their own nicenessa lady because she is pretty or a lion because he is strong and the dramatic school being that which cannot be satisfied unless it sees something going on which cant paint a pretty lady unless she is being made love to or being murdered and cant paint a stag or a lion unless they are being hunted or shot or the one eating the other  you have always heard meor if not will expect by the very tone of this sentence to hear me now on the whole recommend you to prefer the contemplative school but the comparison is always an imperfect and unjust one unless quite other terms are introduced  the real greatness or smallness of schools is not in their preference of inactivity to action nor of action to inactivity it is in their preference of worthy things to unworthy in rest and of kind action to unkind in business  a dutchman can be just as solemnly and entirely contemplative of a lemon pip and a cheese paring as an italian of the virgin in glory an english squire has pictures purely contemplative of his favorite horseand a parisian lady pictures purely contemplative of the back and front of the last dress proposed to her in la mode artistique all these works belong to the same school of silent admirationthe vital question concerning them is what do you admire  now therefore when you hear me so often saying that the northern racesnorman and lombardare active or dramatic in their art and that the southern racesgreek and arabianare contemplative you ought instantly to ask farther active in what contemplative of what and the answer is the active artlombardicrejoices in hunting and fighting the contemplative artbyzantinecontemplates the mysteries of the christian faith  and at first on such answer one would be apt at once to concludeall grossness must be in the lombard all good in the byzantine but again we should be wrongand extremely wrong for the hunting and fighting did practically produce strong and often virtuous men while the perpetual and inactive contemplation of what it was impossible to understand did not on the whole render the contemplative persons stronger wiser or even more amiable so that in the twelfth century while the northern art was only in need of direction the southern was in need of life the north was indeed spending its valour and virtue on ignoble objects but the south disgracing the noblest objects by its want of valour and virtue  central stood etruscan florenceher root in the earth bound with iron and brasswet with the dew of heaven agriculture in occupation religious in thought she accepted like good ground the good refused like the rock of fesole the evil directed the industry of the northman into the arts of peace kindled the dreams of the byzantine with the fire of charity child of her peace and exponent of her passion her cimabue became the interpreter to mankind of the meaning of the birth of christ  we hear constantly and think naturally of him as of a man whose peculiar genius in painting suddenly reformed its principles who suddenly painted out of his own gifted imagination beautiful instead of rude pictures and taught his scholar giotto to carry on the impulse which we suppose thenceforward to have enlarged the resources and bettered the achievements of painting continually up to our own timewhen the triumphs of art having been completed and its uses ended something higher is offered to the ambition of mankind and watt and faraday initiate the age of manufacture and science as cimabue and giotto instituted that of art and imagination  in this conception of the history of mental and physical culture we much overrate the influence though we cannot overrate the power of the men by whom the change seems to have been effected we cannot overrate their powerfor the greatest men of any age those who become its leaders when there is a great march to be begun are indeed separated from the average intellects of their day by a distance which is immeasurable in any ordinary terms of wonder  but we far overrate their influence because the apparently sudden result of their labour or invention is only the manifested fruit of the toil and thought of many who preceded them and of whose names we have never heard the skill of cimabue cannot be extolled too highly but no madonna by his hand could ever have rejoiced the soul of italy unless for a thousand years before many a nameless greek and nameless goth had adorned the traditions and lived in the love of the virgin  in like manner it is impossible to overrate the sagacity patience or precision of the masters in modern mechanical and scientific discovery but their sudden triumph and the unbalancing of all the world by their words may not in any wise be attributed to their own power or even to that of the facts they have ascertained they owe their habits and methods of industry to the paternal example no less than the inherited energy of men who long ago prosecuted the truths of nature through the rage of war and the adversity of superstition and the universal and overwhelming consequences of the facts which their followers have now proclaimed indicate only the crisis of a rapture produced by the offering of new objects of curiosity to nations who had nothing to look at and of the amusement of novel motion and action to nations who had nothing to do  nothing to look at that is indeedyou will find if you consider of itour sorrowful case the vast extent of the advertising frescos of london daily refreshed into brighter and larger frescos by its billstickers cannot somehow sufficiently entertain the popular eyes the great mrs allen with her flowing hair and equally flowing promises palls upon repetition and that madonna of the nineteenth century smiles in vain above many a borgo unrejoiced even the excitement of the shopwindow with its unattainable splendours or too easily attainable impostures cannot maintain itself in the wearying mind of the populace and i find my charitable friends inviting the children whom the streets educate only into vicious misery to entertainments of scientific vision in microscope or magic lantern thus giving them something to look at such as it isfleas mostly and the stomachs of various vermin and people with their heads cut off and set on againstill something to look at  the fame of cimabue rests and justly on a similar charity he gave the populace of his day something to look at and satisfied their curiosity with science of something they had long desired to know we have continually imagined in our carelessness that his triumph consisted only in a new pictorial skill recent critical writers unable to comprehend how any street populace could take pleasure in painting have ended by denying his triumph altogether and insisted that he gave no joy to florence and that the joyful quarter was accidentally so namedor at least from no other festivity than that of the procession attending charles of anjou i proved to you in a former lecture that the old tradition was true and the delight of the people unquestionable but that delight was not merely in the revelation of an art they had not known how to practise it was delight in the revelation of a madonna whom they had not known how to love  again what was revelation to themwe suppose farther and as unwisely to have been only art in him that in better laying of coloursin better tracing of perspectivesin recovery of principles of classic compositionhe had manufactured as our gothic firms now manufacture to order a madonnain whom he believed no more than they  not so first of the florentines first of european menhe attained in thought and saw with spiritual eyes exercised to discern good from evilthe face of her who was blessed among women and with his following hand made visible the magnificat of his heart  he magnified the maid and florence rejoiced in her queen but it was left for giotto to make the queenship better beloved in its sweet humiliation  you had the etruscan stock in florencechristian or at least semi christian the statue of mars still in its streets but with its central temple built for baptism in the name of christ it was a race living by agriculture gentle thoughtful and exquisitely fine in handiwork the straw bonnet of tuscanythe leghornis pure etruscan art young ladiesonly plaited gold of gods harvest instead of the plaited gold of his earth  you had then the norman and lombard races coming down on this kings and hunterssplendid in warinsatiable of action you had the greek and arabian races flowing from the east bringing with them the law of the city and the dream of the desert  cimabueetruscan born gave we saw the life of the norman to the tradition of the greek eager action to holy contemplation and what more is left for his favourite shepherd boy giotto to do than this except to paint with everincreasing skill we fancy he only surpassed cimabueeclipsed by greater brightness  not so the sudden and new applause of italy would never have been won by mere increase of the alreadykindled light giotto had wholly another work to do the meeting of the norman race with the byzantine is not merely that of action with reposenot merely that of war with religionit is the meeting of domestic life with monastic and of practical household sense with unpractical desert insanity  i have no other word to use than this last i use it reverently meaning a very noble thing i do not know how far i ought to sayeven a divine thing decide that for yourselves compare the northern farmer with st francis the palm hardened by stubbing thornaby waste with the palm softened by the imagination of the wounds of christ to my own thoughts both are divine decide that for yourselves but assuredly and without possibility of other decision one is humanly speaking healthy the other unhealthy one sane the otherinsane  to reconcile drama with dream cimabues task was comparatively an easy one but to reconcile sense withi still use even this following word reverentlynonsense is not so easy and he who did it firstno wonder he has a name in the world  i must lean however still more distinctly on the word domestic for it is not rationalism and commercial competitionmr stuart mills other career for woman than that of wife and mother which are reconcilable by giotto or by anybody else with divine vision but household wisdom labour of love toil upon earth according to the law of heaventhese are reconcilable in one code of glory with revelation in cave or island with the endurance of desolate and loveless days with the repose of folded hands that wait heavens time  domestic and monastic he was the first of italiansthe first of christianswho equally knew the virtue of both lives and who was able to show it in the sight of men of all ranksfrom the prince to the shepherd and of all powersfrom the wisest philosopher to the simplest child  for note the way in which the new gift of painting bequeathed to him by his great master strengthened his hands before cimabue no beautiful rendering of human form was possible and the rude or formal types of the lombard and byzantine though they would serve in the tumult of the chase or as the recognized symbols of creed could not represent personal and domestic character faces with goggling eyes and rigid lips might be endured with ready help of imagination for gods angels saints or huntersor for anybody else in scenes of recognized legend but would not serve for pleasant portraiture of ones own self or of the incidents of gentle actual life and even cimabue did not venture to leave the sphere of conventionally reverenced dignity he still paintedthough beautifullyonly the madonna and the st joseph and the christ these he made livingflorence asked no more and credette cimabue nella pintura tener lo campo  but giotto came from the field and saw with his simple eyes a lowlier worth and he paintedthe madonna and st joseph and the christyes by all means if you choose to call them so but essentiallymamma papa and the baby and all italy threw up its capora ha giotto il grido  for he defines explains and exalts every sweet incident of human nature and makes dear to daily life every mystic imagination of natures greater than our own he reconciles while he intensifies every virtue of domestic and monastic thought he makes the simplest household duties sacred and the highest religious passions serviceable and just     the third morning  before the soldan   i promised some note of sandros fortitude before whom i asked you to sit and read the end of my last letter and ive lost my own notes about her and forget now whether she has a sword or a maceit does not matter what is chiefly notable in her isthat you would not if you had to guess who she was take her for fortitude at all everybody elses fortitudes announce themselves clearly and proudly they have towerlike shields and lionlike helmetsand stand firm astride on their legsand are confidently ready for all comers yes that is your common fortitude very grand though common but not the highest by any means  ready for all comers and a match for themthinks the universal fortitudeno thanks to her for standing so steady then  but botticellis fortitude is no match it may be for any that are coming worn somewhat and not a little weary instead of standing ready for all comers she is sittingapparently in reverie her fingers playing restlessly and idlynay i thinkeven nervously about the hilt of her sword  for her battle is not to begin today nor did it begin yesterday many a morn and eve have passed since it beganand nowis this to be the ending day of it and if thisby what manner of end  that is what sandros fortitude is thinking and the playing fingers about the swordhilt would fain let it fall if it might be and yet how swiftly and gladly will they close on it when the faroff trumpet blows which she will hear through all her reverie  there is yet another picture of sandros here which you must look at before going back to giotto the small judith in the room next the tribune as you return from this outer one it is just under lionardos medusa she is returning to the camp of her israel followed by her maid carrying the head of holofernes and she walks in one of botticellis light dancing actions her drapery all on flutter and her hand like fortitudes light on the swordhilt but daintilynot nervously the little finger laid over the cross of it  and at the first glanceyou will think the figure merely a piece of fifteenthcentury affectation judith indeedsay rather the daughter of herodias at her mincingest  well yesbotticelli is affected in the way that all men in that century necessarily were much euphuism much studied grace of manner much formal assertion of scholarship mingling with his force of imagination and he likes twisting the fingers of hands about just as correggio does but he never does it like correggio without cause  look at judith againat her face not her draperyand remember that when a man is base at the heart he blights his virtues into weaknesses but when he is true at the heart he sanctifies his weaknesses into virtues it is a weakness of botticellis this love of dancing motion and waved drapery but why has he given it full flight here  do you happen to know anything about judith yourself except that she cut off holofernes head and has been made the high light of about a million of vile pictures ever since in which the painters thought they could surely attract the public to the double show of an execution and a pretty womanespecially with the added pleasure of hinting at previously ignoble sin  when you go home today take the pains to write out for yourself in the connection i here place them the verses underneath numbered from the book of judith you will probably think of their meaning more carefully as you write  begin thus  now at that time judith heard thereof which was the daughter of merari  the son of simeon the son of israel and then write out consecutively these pieces  chapter viii verses 2 to 8 always inclusive and read the whole chapter  chapter ix verses 1 and 5 to 7 beginning this piece with the previous sentence oh god oh my god hear me also a widow  chapter ix verses 11 to 14 chapter x verses  1 to 5 chapter xiii verses 6 to 10 chapter xv verses 11 to 13 chapter xvi verses 1 to 6 chapter xvi verses 11 to 15 chapter xvi verses 18 and 19 chapter xvi verses 23 to 25  now as in many other cases of noble history apocryphal and other i do not in the least care how far the literal facts are true the conception of facts and the idea of jewish womanhood are there grand and real as a marble statuepossession for all ages and you will feel after you have read this piece of history or epic poetry with honourable care that there is somewhat more to be thought of and pictured in judith than painters have mostly found it in them to show you that she is not merely the jewish delilah to the assyrian samson but the mightiest purest brightest type of high passion in severe womanhood offered to our human memory sandros picture is but slight but it is true to her and the only one i know that is and after writing out these verses you will see why he gives her that swift peaceful motion while you read in her face only sweet solemnity of dreaming thought my people delivered and by my hand and god has been gracious to his handmaid the triumph of miriam over a fallen host the fire of exulting mortal life in an immortal hour the purity and severity of a guardian angelall are here and as her servant follows carrying indeed the head but invisiblea mere thing to be carriedno more to be so much as thought ofshe looks only at her mistress with intense servile watchful love faithful not in these days of fear only but hitherto in all her life and afterwards forever  after you have seen it enough look also for a little while at angelicos marriage and death of the virgin in the same room you may afterwards associate the three pictures always together in your mind and looking at nothing else today in the uffizi let us go back to giottos chapel  we must begin with this work on our left hand the death of st francis for it is the key to all the rest let us hear first what mr crowe directs us to think of it in the composition of this scene giotto produced a masterpiece which served as a model but too often feebly imitated by his successors good arrangement variety of character and expression in the heads unity and harmony in the whole make this an exceptional work of its kind as a composition worthy of the fourteenth century ghirlandajo and benedetto da majano both imitated without being able to improve it no painter ever produced its equal except raphael nor could a better be created except in so far as regards improvement in the mere rendering of form  to these inspiring observations by the rapturous crowe more cautious cavalcasella footnote i venture to attribute the wiser note to signor cavalcasella because i have every reason to put real confidence in his judgment but it was impossible for any man engaged as he is to go over all the ground covered by so extensive a piece of critical work as these three volumes contain with effective attention appends a refrigerating note saying the st francis in the glory is new but the angels are in part preserved the rest has all been more or less retouched and no judgment can be given as to the colour of thisor any other of these works  you are thereforeinstructed readercalled upon to admire a piece of art which no painter ever produced the equal of except raphael but it is unhappily deficient according to crowe in the mere rendering of form and according to signor cavalcasella no opinion can be given as to its colour  warned thus of the extensive places where the ice is dangerous and forbidden to look here either for form or colour you are to admire the variety of character and expression in the heads i do not myself know how these are to be given without form or colour but there appears to me in my innocence to be only one head in the whole picture drawn up and down in different positions  the unity and harmony of the wholewhich make this an exceptional work of its kindmean i suppose its general look of having been painted out of a scavengers cart and so we are reduced to the last article of our creed according to crowe  in the composition of this scene giotto produced a masterpiece  well possibly the question is what you mean by composition which putting modern criticism now out of our way i will ask the reader to think in front of this wreck of giotto with some care  was it in the first place to giotto think you the composition of a scene or the conception of a fact you probably if a fashionable person have seen the apotheosis of margaret in faust you know what care is taken nightly in the composition of that scenehow the draperies are arranged for it the lights turned off and on the fiddlestrings taxed for their utmost tenderness the bassoons exhorted to a grievous solemnity  you dont believe however that any real soul of a margaret ever appeared to any mortal in that manner  here is an apotheosis also composedyes figures high on the right and left low in the middle etc etc etc  but the important questions seem to me was there ever a st francis did he ever receive stigmatadidhis soul go up to heavendid any monk see it risingand did giotto mean to tell us so if you will be good enough to settle these few small points in your mind first the composition will take a wholly different aspect to you according to your answer  nor does it seem doubtful to me what your answer after investigation made must be  there assuredly was a st francis whose life and works you had better study than either todays galignani or whatever this year may supply the place of the tichborne case in public interest  his reception of the stigmata is perhaps a marvellous instance of the power of imagination over physical conditions perhaps an equally marvellous instance of the swift change of metaphor into tradition but assuredly and beyond dispute one of the most influential significant and instructive traditions possessed by the church of christ and that if ever soul rose to heaven from the dead body his soul did so rise is equally sure  and finally giotto believed that all he was called on to represent concerning st francis really had taken place just as surely as you if you are a christian believe that christ died and rose again and he represents it with all fidelity and passion but as i just now said he is a man of supreme common sensehas as much humour and clearness of sight as chaucer and as much dislike of falsehood in clergy or in professedly pious people and in his gravest moments he will still see and say truly that what is fat is fatand what is lean leanand what is hollow empty  his great point however in this fresco is the assertion of the reality of the stigmata against all question there is not only one st thomas to be convinced there are fiveone to each wound of these four are intent only on satisfying their curiosity and are peering or probing one only kisses the hand he has lifted the rest of the picture never was much more than a grey drawing of a noble burial service of all concerned in which one monk only is worthy to see the soul taken up to heaven and he is evidently just the monk whom nobody in the convent thought anything of his face is all repainted but one can gather this much or little out of it yet  of the composition or unity and harmony of the whole as a burial service we may better judge after we have looked at the brighter picture of st franciss birthbirth spiritual that is to say to his native heaven the uppermost namely of the three subjects on this side of the chapel it is entirely characteristic of giotto much of it by his handall of it beautiful all important matters to be known of giotto you may know from this fresco  but we cant see it even with our operaglasses but all foreshortened and spoiled what is the use of lecturing us on this  that is precisely the first point which is essentially giottesque in it its being so out of the way it is this which makes it a perfect specimen of the master i will tell you next something about a work of his which you can see perfectly just behind you on the opposite side of the wall but that you have half to break your neck to look at this one is the very first thing i want you to feel  it is a characteristicas far as i know quite a universal oneof the greatest masters that they never expect you to look at them seem always rather surprised if you want to and not overpleased tell them you are going to hang their picture at the upper end of the table at the next great city dinner and that mr so and so will make a speech about it you produce no impression upon them whatever or an unfavourable one the chances are ten to one they send you the most rubbishy thing they can find in their lumberroom but send for one of them in a hurry and tell him the rats have gnawed a nasty hole behind the parlor door and you want it plastered and painted overand he does you a masterpiece which the world will peep behind your door to look at for ever  i have no time to tell you why this is so nor do i know why altogether but so it is  giotto then is sent for to paint this high chapel i am not sure if he chose his own subjects from the life of st francis i think sobut of course cant reason on the guess securely at all events he would have much of his own way in the matter  now you must observe that painting a gothic chapel rightly is just the same thing as painting a greek vase rightly the chapel is merely the vase turned upsidedown and outsidein the principles of decoration are exactly the same your decoration is to be proportioned to the size of your vase to be together delightful when you look at the cup or chapel as a whole to be various and entertaining when you turn the cup round you turn yourself round in the chapel and to bend its heads and necks of figures about as it best can over the hollows and ins and outs so that anyhow whether too long or too shortpossible or impossiblethey may be living and full of grace you will also please take it on my word todayin another morning walk you shall have proof of itthat giotto was a pure etruscangreek of the thirteenth century converted indeed to worship st francis instead of heracles but as far as vasepainting goes precisely the etruscan he was before this is nothing else than a large beautiful coloured etruscan vase you have got inverted over your heads like a divingbell footnote i observe that recent criticism is engaged in proving all etruscan vases to be of late manufacture in imitation of archaic greek and i therefore must briefly anticipate a statement which i shall have to enforce in following letters etruscan art remains in its own italian valleys of the arno and upper tiber in one unbroken series of work from the seventh century before christ to this hour when the country whitewasher still scratches his plaster in etruscan patterns all florentine work of the finest kindluca della robbias ghibertis donatellos filippo lippis botticellis fra angelicosis absolutely pure etruscan merely changing its subjects and representing the virgin instead of athena and christ instead of jupiter every line of the florentine chisel in the fifteenth century is based on national principles of art which existed in the seventh century before christ and angelico in his convent of st dominic at the foot of the hill of fésole is as true an etruscan as the builder who laid the rude stones of the wall along its crestof which modern civilization has used the only arch that remained for cheap building stone luckily i sketched it in 1845 but alas too carelesslynever conceiving of the brutalities of modem italy as possible  accordingly after the quatrefoil ornamentation of the top of the bell you get two spaces at the sides under arches very difficult to cramp ones picture into if it is to be a picture only but entirely provocative of our old etruscan instinct of ornament and spurred by the difficulty and pleased by the national character of it we put our best work into these arches utterly neglectful of the public below who will see the white and red and blue spaces at any rate which is all they will want to see thinks giotto if he ever looks down from his scaffold  take the highest compartment then on the left looking towards the window it was wholly impossible to get the arch filled with figures unless they stood on each others heads so giotto ekes it out with a piece of fine architecture raphael in the sposalizio does the same for pleasure  then he puts two dainty little white figures bending on each flank to stop up his corners but he puts the taller inside on the right and outside on the left and he puts his greek chorus of observant and moralizing persons on each side of his main action  then he puts one choragusor leader of chorus supporting the main actionon each side then he puts the main action in the middlewhich is a quarrel about that white bone of contention in the centre choragus on the right who sees that the bishop is going to have the best of it backs him serenely choragus on the left who sees that his impetuous friend is going to get the worst of it is pulling him back and trying to keep him quiet the subject of the picture which after you are quite sure it is good as a decoration but not till then you may be allowed to understand is the following one of st franciss three great virtues being obedience he begins his spiritual life by quarreling with his father he i suppose in modern terms i should say commercially invests some of his fathers goods in charity his father objects to that investment on which st francis runs away taking what he can find about the house along with him his father follows to claim his property but finds it is all gone already and that st francis has made friends with the bishop of assisi his father flies into an indecent passion and declares he will disinherit him on which st francis then and there takes all his clothes off throws them frantically in his fathers face and says he has nothing more to do with clothes or father the good bishop in tears of admiration embraces st francis and covers him with his own mantle  i have read the picture to you as if mr spurgeon knew anything about art mr spurgeon would read itthat is to say from the plain common sense protestant side if you are content with that view of it you may leave the chapel and as far as any study of history is concerned florence also for you can never know anything either about giotto or her  yet do not be afraid of my rereading it to you from the mystic nonsensical and papistical side i am going to read it to youif after many and many a year of thought i am ableas giotto meant it giotto being as far as we know then the man of strongest brain and hand in florence the best friend of the best religious poet of the world and widely differing as his friend did also in his views of the world from either mr spurgeon or pius ix  the first duty of a child is to obey its father and mother as the first duty of a citizen to obey the laws of his state and this duty is so strict that i believe the only limits to it are those fixed by isaac and iphigenia on the other hand the father and mother have also a fixed duty to the childnot to provoke it to wrath i have never heard this text explained to fathers and mothers from the pulpit which is curious for it appears to me that god will expect the parents to understand their duty to their children better even than children can be expected to know their duty to their parents  but farther a childs duty is to obey its parents it is never said anywhere in the bible and never was yet said in any good or wise book that a mans or womans is when precisely a child becomes a man or a woman it can no more be said than when it should first stand on its legs but a time assuredly comes when it should in great states children are always trying to remain children and the parents wanting to make men and women of them in vile states the children are always wanting to be men and women and the parents to keep them children it may beand happy the house in which it is so that the fathers at least equal intellect and older experience may remain to the end of his life a law to his children not of force but of perfect guidance with perfect love rarely it is so not often possible it is as natural for the old to be prejudiced as for the young to be presumptuous and in the change of centuries each generation has something to judge of for itself  but this scene on which giotto has dwelt with so great force represents not the childs assertion of his independence but his adoption of another father  you must not confuse the desire of this boy of assisi to obey god rather than man with the desire of your young cockney hopeful to have a latchkey and a separate allowance  no point of duty has been more miserably warped and perverted by false priests in all churches than this duty of the young to choose whom they will serve but the duty itself does not the less exist and if there be any truth in christianity at all there will come for all true disciples a time when they have to take that saying to heart he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me  lovethobserve there is no talk of disobeying fathers or mothers whom you do not love or of running away from a home where you would rather not stay but to leave the home which is your peace and to be at enmity with those who are most dear to youthis if there be meaning in christs words one day or other will be demanded of his true followers  and there is meaning in christs words whatever misuse may have been made of themwhatever false prophetsand heaven knows there have been manyhave called the young children to them not to bless but to curse the assured fact remains that if you will obey god there will come a moment when the voice of man will be raised with all its holiest natural authority against you the friend and the wise adviserthe brother and the sisterthe father and the masterthe entire voice of your prudent and keensighted acquaintancethe entire weight of the scornful stupidity of the vulgar worldfor once they will be against you all at one you have to obey god rather than man the human race with all its wisdom and love all its indignation and folly on one sidegod alone on the other you have to choose  that is the meaning of st franciss renouncing his inheritance and it is the beginning of giottos gospel of works unless this hardest of deeds be done firstthis inheritance of mammon and the world cast awayall other deeds are useless you cannot serve cannot obey god and mammon no charities no obediences no selfdenials are of any use while you are still at heart in conformity with the world you go to church because the world goes you keep sunday because your neighbours keep it but you dress ridiculously because your neighbours ask it and you dare not do a rough piece of work because your neighbours despise it you must renounce your neighbour in his riches and pride and remember him in his distress that is st franciss disobedience  and now you can understand the relation of subjects throughout the chapel and giottos choice of them  the roof has the symbols of the three virtues of labourpoverty chastity obedience  a highest on the left side looking to the window the life of st francis begins in his renunciation of the world  b highest on the right side his new life is approved and ordained by the authority of the church  c central on the left side he preaches to his own disciples  d central on the right side he preaches to the heathen  e lowest on the left side his burial  f lowest on the right side his power after death  besides these six subjects there are on the sides of the window the four great franciscan saints st louis of france st louis of toulouse st clare and st elizabeth of hungary  so that you have in the whole series this much given you to think of first the law of st franciss conscience then his own adoption of it then the ratification of it by the christian church then his preaching it in life then his preaching it in death and then the fruits of it in his disciples  i have only been able myself to examine or in any right sense to see of this code of subjects the first second fourth and the st louis and elizabeth i will ask you only to look at two more of them namely st francis before the soldan midmost on your right and st louis  the soldan with an ordinary operaglass you may see clearly enough and i think it will be first well to notice some technical points in it  if the little virgin on the stairs of the temple reminded you of one composition of titians this soldan should i think remind you of all that is greatest in titian so forcibly indeed that for my own part if i had been told that a careful early fresco by titian had been recovered in santa croce i could have believed both report and my own eyes more quickly than i have been able to admit that this is indeed by giotto it is so great thathad its principles been understoodthere was in reality nothing more to be taught of art in italy nothing to be invented afterwards except dutch effects of light  that there is no effect of light here arrived at i beg you at once to observe as a most important lesson the subject is st francis challenging the soldans magifireworshippersto pass with him through the fire which is blazing red at his feet it is so hot that the two magi on the other side of the throne shield their faces but it is represented simply as a red mass of writhing forms of flame and casts no firelight whatever there is no ruby colour on anybodys nose there are no black shadows under anybodys chin there are no rembrandtesque gradations of gloom or glitterings of swordhilt and armour  is this ignorance think you in giotto and pure artlessness he was now a man in middle life having passed all his days in painting and professedly and almost contentiously painting things as he saw them do you suppose he never saw fire cast firelightand he the friend of dante who of all poets is the most subtle in his sense of every kind of effect of lightthough he has been thought by the public to know that of fire only again and again his ghosts wonder that there is no shadow cast by dantes body and is the poets friend because a painter likely therefore not to have known that mortal substance casts shadow and terrestrial flame light nay the passage in the purgatorio where the shadows from the morning sunshine make the flames redder reaches the accuracy of newtonian science and does giotto think you all the while see nothing of the sort  the fact was he saw light so intensely that he never for an instant thought of painting it he knew that to paint the sun was as impossible as to stop it and he was no trickster trying to find out ways of seeming to do what he did not i can paint a roseyes and i will i cant paint a redhot coal and i wont try to nor seem to this was just as natural and certain a process of thinking with him as the honesty of it and true science were impossible to the false painters of the sixteenth century  nevertheless what his art can honestly do to make you feel as much as he wants you to feel about this fire he will do and that studiously that the fire be luminous or not is no matter just now but that the fire is hot he would have you to know now will you notice what colours he has used in the whole picture first the blue background necessary to unite it with the other three subjects is reduced to the smallest possible space st francis must be in grey for that is his dress also the attendant of one of the magi is in grey but so warm that if you saw it by itself you would call it brown the shadow behind the throne which giotto knows he can paint and therefore does is grey also the rest of the picture footnote the floor has been repainted but though its grey is now heavy and cold it cannot kill the splendour of the rest in at least sixsevenths of its areais either crimson gold orange purple or white all as warm as giotto could paint them and set off by minute spaces only of intense blackthe soldans fillet at the shoulders his eyes beard and the points necessary in the golden pattern behind and the whole picture is one glow  a single glance round at the other subjects will convince you of the special character in this but you will recognize also that the four upper subjects in which st franciss life and zeal are shown are all in comparatively warm colours while the two lower onesof the death and the visions after ithave been kept as definitely sad and cold  necessarily you might think being full of monks dresses not so was there any need for giotto to have put the priest at the foot of the dead body with the black banner stooped over it in the shape of a grave might he not had he chosen in either fresco have made the celestial visions brighter might not st francis have appeared in the centre of a celestial glory to the dreaming pope or his soul been seen of the poor monk rising through more radiant clouds look however how radiant in the small space allowed out of the blue they are in reality you cannot anywhere see a lovelier piece of giottesque colour though here you have to mourn over the smallness of the piece and its isolation for the face of st francis himself is repainted and all the blue sky but the clouds and four sustaining angels are hardly retouched at all and their iridescent and exquisitely graceful wings are left with really very tender and delicate care by the restorer of the sky and no one but giotto or turner could have painted them  for in all his use of opalescent and warm colour giotto is exactly like turner as in his swift expressional power he is like gainsborough all the other italian religious painters work out their expression with toil he only can give it with a touch all the other great italian colourists see only the beauty of colour but giotto also its brightness and none of the others except tintoret understood to the full its symbolic power but with thosegiotto and tintoretthere is always not only a colour harmony but a colour secret it is not merely to make the picture glow but to remind you that st francis preaches to a fireworshipping king that giotto covers the wall with purple and scarletand above in the dispute at assisi the angry father is dressed in red varying like passion and the robe with which his protector embraces st francis blue symbolizing the peace of heaven of course certain conventional colours were traditionally employed by all painters but only giotto and tintoret invent a symbolism of their own for every picture thus in tintorets picture of the fall of the manna the figure of god the father is entirely robed in white contrary to all received custom in that of moses striking the rock it is surrounded by a rainbow of giottos symbolism in colour at assisi i have given account elsewhere footnote fors clavigera for september 1874  you are not to think therefore the difference between the colour of the upper and lower frescos unintentional the life of st francis was always full of joy and triumph his death in great suffering weariness and extreme humility the tradition of him reverses that of elijah living he is seen in the chariot of fire dying he submits to more than the common sorrow of death  there is however much more than a difference in colour between the upper and lower frescos there is a difference in manner which i cannot account for and above all a very singular difference in skillindicating it seems to me that the two lower were done long before the others and afterwards united and harmonized with them it is of no interest to the general reader to pursue this question but one point he can notice quickly that the lower frescos depend much on a mere black or brown outline of the features while the faces above are evenly and completely painted in the most accomplished venetian mannerand another respecting the management of the draperies contains much interest for us  giotto never succeeded to the very end of his days in representing a figure lying down and at ease it is one of the most curious points in all his character just the thing which he could study from nature without the smallest hindrance is the thing he never can paint while subtleties of form and gesture which depend absolutely on their momentariness and actions in which no model can stay for an instant he seizes with infallible accuracy  not only has the sleeping pope in the right hand lower fresco his head laid uncomfortably on his pillow but all the clothes on him are in awkward angles even giottos instinct for lines of drapery failing him altogether when he has to lay it on a reposing figure but look at the folds of the soldans robe over his knees none could be more beautiful or right and it is to me wholly inconceivable that the two paintings should be within even twenty years of each other in datethe skill in the upper one is so supremely greater we shall find however more than mere truth in its casts of drapery if we examine them  they are so simply right in the figure of the soldan that we do not think of themwe see him only not his dress but we see dress first in the figures of the discomfited magi very fully draped personages these indeedwith trains it appears four yards long and bearers of them  the one nearest the soldan has done his devoir as bravely as he could would fain go up to the fire but cannot is forced to shield his face though he has not turned back giotto gives him full sweeping breadth of fold what dignity he cana man faithful to his profession at all events  the next one has no such courage collapsed altogether he has nothing more to say for himself or his creed giotto hangs the cloak upon him in ghirlandajos fashion as from a peg but with ludicrous narrowness of fold literally he is a shutup magusclosed like a fan he turns his head away hopelessly and the last magus shows nothing but his back disappearing through the door  opposed to them in a modern work you would have had a st francis standing as high as he could in his sandals contemptuous denunciatory magnificently showing the magi the door no such thing says giotto a somewhat mean man disappointing enough in presenceeven in feature i do not understand his gesture pointing to his forehead perhaps meaning my life or my head upon the truth of this the attendant monk behind him is terrorstruck but will follow his master the dark moorish servants of the magi show no emotionwill arrange their masters trains as usual and decorously sustain their retreat  lastly for the soldan himself in a modern work you would assuredly have had him staring at st francis with his eyebrows up or frowning thunderously at his magi with them bent as far down as they would go neither of these aspects does he bear according to giotto a perfect gentleman and king he looks on his magi with quiet eyes of decision he is much the noblest person in the roomthough an infidel the true hero of the scene far more than st francis it is evidently the soldan whom giotto wants you to think of mainly in this picture of christian missionary work  he does not altogether take the view of the heathen which you would get in an exeter hall meeting does not expatiate on their ignorance their blackness or their nakedness does not at all think of the florentine islington and pentonville as inhabited by persons in every respect superior to the kings of the east nor does he imagine every other religion but his own to be logworship probably the people who really worship logswhether in persia or pentonvillewill be left to worship logs to their hearts content thinks giotto but to those who worship god and who have obeyed the laws of heaven written in their hearts and numbered the stars of it visible to themto these a nearer star may rise and a higher god be revealed  you are to note therefore that giottos soldan is the type of all noblest religion and law in countries where the name of christ has not been preached there was no doubt what king or people should be chosen the country of the three magi had already been indicated by the miracle of bethlehem and the religion and morality of zoroaster were the purest and in spirit the oldest in the heathen world therefore when dante in the nineteenth and twentieth books of the paradise gives his final interpretation of the law of human and divine justice in relation to the gospel of christthe lower and enslaved body of the heathen being represented by st philips convert christians like these the ethiop shall condemnthe noblest state of heathenism is at once chosen as by giotto what may the persians say unto your kings compare also milton                        at the soldans chair                 defied the best of paynim chivalry  and now the time is come for you to look at giottos st louis who is the type of a christian king  you would i suppose never have seen it at all unless i had dragged you here on purpose it was enough in the dark originallyis trebly darkened by the modern painted glassand dismissed to its oblivion contentedly by mr murrays four saints all much restored and repainted and messrs crowe and cavalcasellas serene the st louis is quite new  now i am the last person to call any restoration whatever judicious of all destructive manias that of restoration is the frightfullest and foolishest nevertheless what good in its miserable way it can bring the poor art scholar must now apply his common sense to take there is no use because a great work has been restored in now passing it by altogether not even looking for what instruction we still may find in its design which will be more intelligible if the restorer has had any conscience at all to the ordinary spectator than it would have been in the faded work when indeed mr murrays guide tells you that a building has been magnificently restored you may pass the building by in resigned despair for that means that every bit of the old sculpture has been destroyed and modern vulgar copies put up in its place but a restored picture or fresco will often be to you more useful than a pure one and in all probabilityif an important piece of artit will have been spared in many places cautiously completed in others and still assert itself in a mysterious wayas leonardos cenacolo doesthrough every phase of reproduction footnote for a test of your feeling in the matter having looked well at these two lower frescos in this chapel walk round into the next and examine the lower one on your left hand as you enter that you will find in your murray that the frescos in this chapel were also till lately 1862 covered with whitewash but i happen to have a long critique of this particular picture written in the year 1845 and i see no change in it since then mr murrays critic also tells you to observe in it that the daughter of herodias playing on a violin is not unlike peruginos treatment of similar subjects by which mr murrays critic means that the male musician playing on a violin whom without looking either at his dress or at the rest of the fresco he took for the daughter of herodias has a broad face allowing you the full benefit of this criticismthere is still a point or two more to be observed this is the only fresco near the ground in which giottos work is untouched at least by the modern restorer so felicitously safe it is that you may learn from it at once and for ever what good fresco painting ishow quiethow delicately clearhow little coarsely or vulgarly attractivehow capable of the most tender light and shade and of the most exquisite and enduring colour  in this latter respect this fresco stands almost alone among the works of giotto the striped curtain behind the table being wrought with a variety and fantasy of playing colour which paul veronese could not better at his best  you will find without difficulty in spite of the faint tints the daughter of herodias in the middle of the pictureslowly moving not dancing to the violin musicshe herself playing on a lyre in the farther corner of the picture she gives st johns head to her mother the face of herodias is almost entirely faded which may be a farther guarantee to you of the safety of the rest the subject of the apocalypse highest on the right is one of the most interesting mythic pictures in florence nor do i know any other so completely rendering the meaning of the scene between the woman in the wilderness and the dragon enemy but it cannot be seen from the floor level and i have no power of showing its beauty in words  but i can assure you in the first place that st louis is by no means altogether new i have been up at it and found most lovely and true colour left in many parts the crown which you will find after our mornings at the spanish chapel is of importance nearly untouched the lines of the features and hair though all more or less reproduced still of definite and notable character and the junction throughout of added colour so careful that the harmony of the whole if not delicate with its old tenderness is at least in its coarser way solemn and unbroken such as the figure remains it still possesses extreme beautyprofoundest interest and as you can see it from below with your glass it leaves little to be desired and may be dwelt upon with more profit than nine out of ten of the renowned pictures of the tribune or the pitti you will enter into the spirit of it better if i first translate for you a little piece from the fioretti di san francesco  how st louis king of france went personally in the guise of a pilgrim to perugia to visit the holy brother gilesst louis king of france went on pilgrimage to visit the sanctuaries of the world and hearing the most great fame of the holiness of brother giles who had been among the first companions of st francis put it in his heart and determined assuredly that he would visit him personally wherefore he came to perugia where was then staying the said brother and coming to the gate of the place of the brothers with few companions and being unknown he asked with great earnestness for brother giles telling nothing to the porter who he was that asked the porter therefore goes to brother giles and says that there is a pilgrim asking for him at the gate and by god it was inspired in him and revealed that it was the king of france whereupon quickly with great fervour he left his cell and ran to the gate and without any question asked or ever having seen each other before kneeling down together with greatest devotion they embraced and kissed each other with as much familiarity as if for a long time they had held great friendship but all the while neither the one nor the other spoke but stayed so embraced with such signs of charitable love in silence and so having remained for a great while they parted from one another and st louis went on his way and brother giles returned to his cell and the king being gone one of the brethren asked of his companion who he was who answered that he was the king of france of which the other brothers being told were in the greatest melancholy because brother giles had never said a word to him and murmuring at it they said oh brother giles wherefore hadst thou so country manners that to so holy a king who had come from france to see thee and hear from thee some good word thou hast spoken nothing  answered brother giles dearest brothers wonder not ye at this that neither i to him nor he to me could speak a word for so soon as we had embraced the light of the divine wisdom revealed and manifested to me his heart and to him mine and so by divine operation we looked each in the others heart on what we would have said to one another and knew it better far than if we had spoken with the mouth and with more consolation because of the defect of the human tongue which cannot clearly express the secrets of god and would have been for discomfort rather than comfort and know therefore that the king parted from me marvellously content and comforted in his mind  of all which story not a word of course is credible by any rational person  certainly not the spirit nevertheless which created the story is an entirely indisputable fact in the history of italy and of mankind whether st louis and brother giles ever knelt together in the street of perugia matters not a whit that a king and a poor monk could be conceived to have thoughts of each other which no words could speak and that indeed the kings tenderness and humility made such a tale credible to the peoplethis is what you have to meditate on here  nor is there any better spot in the worldwhencesoever your pilgrim feet may have journeyed to it wherein to make up so much mind as you have in you for the making concerning the nature of kinghood and princedom generally and of the forgeries and mockeries of both which are too often manifested in their room for it happens that this christian and this persian king are better painted here by giotto than elsewhere by any one so as to give you the best attainable conception of the christian and heathen powers which have both received in the book which christians profess to reverence the same epithet as the king of the jews himself anointed or christosand as the most perfect christian kinghood was exhibited in the life partly real partly traditional of st louis so the most perfect heathen kinghood was exemplified in the life partly real partly traditional of cyrus of persia and in the laws for human government and education which had chief force in his dynasty and before the images of these two kings i think therefore it will be well that you should read the charge to cyrus written by isaiah the second clause of it if not all will here become memorable to youliterally illustrating as it does the very manner of the defeat of the zoroastrian magi on which giotto founds his triumph of faith i write the leading sentences continuously what i omit is only their amplification which you can easily refer to at home isaiah xliv 24 to xlv 13  thus saith the lord thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i the lord that maketh all that stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth alone that turneth wise men backward and maketh their knowledge foolish that confirmeth the word of his servant and fulfilleth the counsel of his messengers that saith of cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to jerusalem thou shalt be built and to the temple thy foundations shall be laid  thus saith the lord to his christto cyrus whose right hand i have holden to subdue nations before him and i will loose the loins of kings  i will go before thee and make the crooked places straight i will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut in sunder the bars of iron and i will give thee the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places that thou mayest know that i the lord which call thee by thy name am the god of israel  for jacob my servants sake and israel mine elect i have even called thee by thy name i have surnamed thee though thou hast not known me  i am the lord and there is none else there is no god beside me i girded thee though thou hast not known me that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none beside me i am the lord and there is none else i form the light and create darkness i make peace and create evil i the lord do all these things  i have raised him up in righteousness and will direct all his ways he shall build my city and let go my captives not for price nor reward saith the lord of nations  to this last verse add the ordinance of cyrus in fulfilling it that you may understand what is meant by a kings being raised up in righteousness and notice with respect to the picture under which you stand the persian kings thought of the jewish temple  in the first year of the reign of cyrus footnote 1st esdras vi 24 king cyrus commanded that the house of the lord at jerusalem should be built again where they do service with perpetual fire the italicized sentence is dariuss quoting cyruss decree the decree itself worded thus thus saith cyrus king of persia footnote ezra i 3 and 2nd esdras ii 3 the lord god of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he hath charged me to build him an house at jerusalem  who is there among you of all his peoplehis god be with him and let him go up to jerusalem which is in judah and let the men of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods and with beasts  between which bringing the prisoners out of captivity and modern liberty free trade and antislavery eloquence there is no small interval  to these two ideals of kinghood then the boy has reached since the day he was drawing the lamb on the stone as cimabue passed by you will not find two other such that i know of in the west of europe and yet there has been many a try at the painting of crowned headsand king george iii and queen charlotte by sir joshua reynolds are very fine no doubt also your blackmuzzled kings of velasquez and vandykes longhaired and whitehanded ones and rubens ridersin those handsome boots pass such shadows of them as you can summon rapidly before your memorythen look at this st louis  his facegentle resolute glacialpure thincheeked so sharp at the chin that the entire head is almost of the form of a knights shieldthe hair short on the forehead falling on each side in the old greeketruscan curves of simplest line to the neck i dont know if you can see without being nearer the difference in the arrangement of it on the two sidesthe mass of it on the right shoulder bending inwards while that on the left falls straight it is one of the pretty changes which a modern workman would never dream ofand which assures me the restorer has followed the old lines rightly  he wears a crown formed by an hexagonal pyramid beaded with pearls on the edges and walled round above the brow with a vertical fortressparapet as it were rising into sharp pointed spines at the angles it is chasing of gold with pearlbeautiful in the remaining work of it the soldan wears a crown of the same general form the hexagonal outline signifying all order strength and royal economy we shall see farther symbolism of this kind soon by simon memmi in the spanish chapel  i cannot tell you anything definite of the two other frescosfor i can only examine one or two pictures in a day and never begin with one till i have done with another and i had to leave florence without looking at theseeven so far as to be quite sure of their subjects the central one on the left is either the twelfth subject of assisist francis in ecstacy footnote represented next to st francis before the soldan at assisi as seen one night by the brethren praying elevated from the ground his hands extended like the cross and surrounded by a shining cloudlord lindsay or the eighteenth the apparition of st francis at arles footnote st anthony of padua was preaching at a general chapter of the order held at arles in 1224 when st francis appeared in the midst his arms extended and in an attitude of benedictionlord lindsay while the lowest on the right may admit choice between two subjects in each half of it my own reading of them would bethat they are the twentyfirst and twentyfifth subjects of assisi the dying friar footnote a brother of the order lying on his deathbed saw the spirit of st francis rising to heaven and springing forward cried tarry father i come with thee and fell back dead lord lindsay and vision of pope gregory ix footnote he hesitated before canonizing st francis doubting the celestial infliction of the stigmata st francis appeared to him in a vision and with a severe countenance reproving his unbelief opened his robe and exposing the wound in his side filled a vial with the blood that flowed from it and gave it to the pope who awoke and found it in his handlord lindsay but crowe and cavalcasella may be right in their different interpretation footnote as st francis was carried on his bed of sickness to st maria degli angeli he stopped at an hospital on the roadside and ordering his attendants to turn his head in the direction of assisi he rose in his litter and said blessed be thou amongst cities may the blessing of god cling to thee oh holy place for by thee shall many souls be saved and having said this he lay down and was carried on to st maria degli angeli on the evening of the 4th of october his death was revealed at the very hour to the bishop of assisi on mount sarzanacrowe and cavalcasella in any case the meaning of the entire system of work remains unchanged as i have given it above     the fourth morning  the vaulted book   as early as may be this morning let us look for a minute or two into the cathedrali was going to say entering by one of the side doors of the aislesbut we cant do anything else which perhaps might not strike you unless you were thinking specially of it there are no transept doors and one never wanders round to the desolate front from either of the side doors a few paces will bring you to the middle of the nave and to the point opposite the middle of the third arch from the west end where you will find yourselfif well in the midwavestanding on a circular slab of green porphyry which marks the former place of the grave of the bishop zenobius the larger inscription on the wide circle of the floor outside of you records the translation of his body the smaller one round the stone at your feetquiescimus domum hanc quum adimus ultimamis a painful truth i suppose to travellers like us who never rest anywhere now if we can help it  resting here at any rate for a few minutes look up to the whitewashed vaulting of the compartment of the roof next the west end  you will see nothing whatever in it worth looking at nevertheless look a little longer  but the longer you look the less you will understand why i tell you to look it is nothing but a whitewashed ceiling vaulted indeedbut so is many a tailors garret window for that matter indeed now that you have looked steadily for a minute or so and are used to the form of the arch it seems to become so small that you can almost fancy it the ceiling of a goodsized lumberroom in an attic  having attained to this modest conception of it carry your eyes back to the similar vault of the second compartment nearer you very little further contemplation will reduce that also to the similitude of a moderatelysized attic and then resolving to bear if possiblefor it is worth whilethe cramp in your neck for another quarter of a minute look right up to the third vault over your head which if not in the said quarter of a minute reducible in imagination to a tailors garret will at least sink like the two others into the semblance of a common arched ceiling of no serious magnitude or majesty  then glance quickly down from it to the floor and round at the space included between the four pillars which that vault covers it is sixty feet squarefootnote approximately thinking i could find the dimensions of the duomo anywhere i only paced it myselfand cannot at this moment lay my hand on english measurements of itfour hundred square yards of pavementand i believe you will have to look up again more than once or twice before you can convince yourself that the meanlooking roof is swept indeed over all that twelfth part of an acre and still less if i mistake not will you without slow proof believe when you turn yourself round towards the east end that the narrow niche it really looks scarcely more than a niche which occupies beyond the dome the position of our northern choirs is indeed the unnarrowed elongation of the nave whose breadth extends round you like a frozen lake from which experiments and comparisons your conclusion i think will be and i am sure it ought to be that the most studious ingenuity could not produce a design for the interior of a building which should more completely hide its extent and throw away every common advantage of its magnitude than this of the duomo of florence  having arrived at this i assure you quite securely tenable conclusion we will quit the cathedral by the western door for once and as quickly as we can walk return to the green cloister of sta maria novella and place ourselves on the south side of it so as to see as much as we can of the entrance on the opposite side to the socalled spanish chapel  there is indeed within the opposite cloister an arch of entrance plain enough but no chapel whatever externally manifesting itself as worth entering no walls or gable or dome raised above the rest of the outbuildingsonly two windows with traceries opening into the cloister and one story of inconspicuous building above you cant conceive there should be any effect of magnitude produced in the interior however it has been vaulted or decorated it may be pretty but it cannot possibly look large  entering it nevertheless you will be surprised at the effect of height and disposed to fancy that the circular window cannot surely be the same you saw outside looking so low i had to go out again myself to make sure that it was  and gradually as you let the eye follow the sweep of the vaulting arches from the small central keystoneboss with the lamp carved on it to the broad capitals of the hexagonal pillars at the anglesthere will form itself in your mind i think some impression not only of vastness in the building but of great daring in the builder and at last after closely following out the lines of a fresco or two and looking up and up again to the coloured vaults it will become to you literally one of the grandest places you ever entered roofed without a central pillar you will begin to wonder that human daring ever achieved anything so magnificent  but just go out again into the cloister and recover knowledge of the facts it is nothing like so large as the blank arch which at home we filled with brickbats or leased for a ginshop under the last railway we made to carry coals to newcastle and if you pace the floor it covers you will find it is three feet less one way and thirty feet less the other than that single square of the cathedral which was roofed like a tailors loftaccurately for i did measure here myself the floor of the spanish chapel is fiftyseven feet by thirtytwo  i hope after this experience that you will need no farther conviction of the first law of noble building that grandeur depends on proportion and designnot except in a quite secondary degree on magnitude mere size has indeed under all disadvantage some definite value and so has mere splendour disappointed as you may be or at least ought to be at first by st peters in the end you will feel its sizeand its brightness these are all you can feel in itit is nothing more than the pumproom at leamington built biggerbut the bigness tells at last and corinthian pillars whose capitals alone are ten feet high and their acanthus leaves three feet six long give you a serious conviction of the infallibility of the pope and the fallibility of the wretched corinthians who invented the style indeed but built with capitals no bigger than handbaskets  vastness has thus its value but the glory of architecture is to bewhatever you wish it to belovely or grand or comfortableon such terms as it can easily obtain grand by proportionlovely by imaginationcomfortable by ingenuitysecure by honesty with such materials and in such space as you have got to give it  grandby proportion i said but ought to have said by disproportion beauty is given by the relation of partssize by their comparison the first secret in getting the impression of size in this chapel is the disproportion between pillar and arch you take the pillar for grantedit is thick strong and fairly high above your head you look to the vault springing from itand it soars away nobody knows where  another great but more subtle secret is in the inequality and immeasurability of the curved lines and the hiding of the form by the colour  to begin the room i said is fiftyseven feet wide and only thirtytwo deep it is thus nearly onethird larger in the direction across the line of entrance which gives to every arch pointed and round throughout the roof a different spring from its neighbours  the vaulting ribs have the simplest of all profilesthat of a chamfered beam i call it simpler than even that of a square beam for in barking a log you cheaply get your chamfer and nobody cares whether the level is alike on each side but you must take a larger tree and use much more work to get a square and it is the same with stone  and this profile isfix the conditions of it therefore in your mindvenerable in the history of mankind as the origin of all gothic tracerymouldings venerable in the history of the christian church as that of the roof ribs both of the lower church of assisi bearing the scroll of the precepts of st francis and here at florence bearing the scroll of the faith of st dominic if you cut it out in paper and cut the corners off farther and farther at every cut you will produce a sharper profile of rib connected in architectural use with differently treated styles but the entirely venerable form is the massive one in which the angle of the beam is merely as it were secured and completed in stability by removing its too sharp edge  well the vaulting ribs as in giottos vault then have here under their painting this rude profile but do not suppose the vaults are simply the shells cast over them look how the ornamental borders fall on the capitals the plaster receives all sorts of indescribably accommodating shapesthe painter contracting and stopping his design upon it as it happens to be convenient you cant measure anything you cant exhaust you cant graspexcept one simple ruling idea which a child can grasp if it is interested and intelligent namely that the room has four sides with four tales told upon them and the roof four quarters with another four tales told on those and each history in the sides has its correspondent history in the roof generally in good italian decoration the roof represents constant or essential facts the walls consecutive histories arising out of them or leading up to them thus here the roof represents in front of you in its main quarter the resurrectionthe cardinal fact of christianity opposite above behind you the ascension on your left hand the descent of the holy spirit on your right christs perpetual presence with his church symbolized by his appearance on the sea of galilee to the disciples in the storm  the correspondent walls represent under the first quarter the resurrection the story of the crucifixion under the second quarter the ascension the preaching after that departure that christ will returnsymbolized here in the dominican church by the consecration of st dominic under the third quarter the descent of the holy spirit the disciplining power of human virtue and wisdom under the fourth quarter st peters ship the authority and government of the state and church  the order of these subjects chosen by the dominican monks themselves was sufficiently comprehensive to leave boundless room for the invention of the painter the execution of it was first intrusted to taddeo gaddi the best architectural master of giottos school who painted the four quarters of the roof entirely but with no great brilliancy of invention and was beginning to go down one of the sides when luckily a man of stronger brain his friend came from siena taddeo thankfully yielded the room to him he joined his own work to that of his less able friend in an exquisitely pretty and complimentary way throwing his own greater strength into it not competitively but gradually and helpfully when however he had once got himself well joined and softly to the more simple work he put his own force on with a will and produced the most noble piece of pictorial philosophy footnote there is no philosophy taught either by the school of athens or michael angelos last judgment and the disputa is merely a graceful assemblage of authorities the effects of such authority not being shown and divinity existing in italy  this pretty and according to all evidence by me attainable entirely true tradition has been all but lost among the ruins of fair old florence by the industry of modern masoncriticswho without exception labouring under the primal and necessarily unconscious disadvantage of not knowing good work from bad and never therefore knowing a man by his hand or his thoughts would be in any case sorrowfully at the mercy of mistakes in a document but are tenfold more deceived by their own vanity and delight in overthrowing a received idea if they can  farther as every fresco of this early date has been retouched again and again and often painted half overand as if there has been the least care or respect for the old work in the restorer he will now and then follow the old lines and match the old colours carefully in some places while he puts in clearly recognizable work of his own in otherstwo critics of whom one knows the first mans work well and the other the lasts will contradict each other to almost any extent on the securest grounds and there is then no safe refuge for an uninitiated person but in the old tradition which if not literally true is founded assuredly on some root of fact which you are likely to get at if ever through it only so that my general directions to all young people going to florence or rome would be very short know your first volume of vasari and your two first books of livy look about you and dont talk nor listen to talking  on those terms you may know entering this chapel that in michael angelos time all florence attributed these frescos to taddeo gaddi and simon memmi  i have studied neither of these artists myself with any speciality of care and cannot tell you positively anything about them or their works but i know good work from bad as a cobbler knows leather and i can tell you positively the quality of these frescos and their relation to contemporary panel pictures whether authentically ascribed to gaddi memmi or any one else it is for the florentine academy to decide  the roof and the north side down to the feet of the horizontal line of sitting figures were originally thirdrate work of the school of giotto the rest of the chapel was originally and most of it is still magnificent work of the school of siena the roof and north side have been heavily repainted in many places the rest is faded and injured but not destroyed in its most essential qualities and now farther you must bear with just a little bit of tormenting history of painters  there were two gaddis father and sontaddeo and angelo and there were two memmis brotherssimon and philip  i daresay you will find in the modern books that simons real name was peter and philips real name was bartholomew and angelos real name was taddeo and taddeos real name was angelo and memmis real name was gaddi and gaddis real name was memmi you may find out all that at your leisure afterwards if you like what it is important for you to know here in the spanish chapel is only this much that followsthere were certainly two persons once called gaddi both rather stupid in religious matters and high art but one of them i dont know or care which a true decorative painter of the most exquisite skill a perfect architect an amiable person and a great lover of pretty domestic life vasari says this was the father taddeo he built the ponte vecchio and the old stones of itwhich if you ever look at anything on the ponte vecchio but the shops you may still see above those wooden penthouses with the florentine shieldwere so laid by him that they are unshaken to this day  he painted an exquisite series of frescos at assisi from the life of christ in whichjust to show you what the mans nature iswhen the madonna has given christ into simeons arms she cant help holding out her own arms to him and saying visibly wont you come back to mamma the child laughs his answeri love you mamma but im quite happy just now  well he or he and his son together painted these four quarters of the roof of the spanish chapel they were very probably much retouched afterwards by antonio veneziano or whomsoever messrs crowe and cavalcasella please but that architecture in the descent of the holy ghost is by the man who painted the north transept of assisi and there need be no more talk about the matterfor you never catch a restorer doing his old architecture right again and farther the ornamentation of the vaulting ribs is by the man who painted the entombment no 31 in the galerie des grands tableaux in the catalogue of the academy for 1874 whether that picture is taddeo gaddis or not as stated in the catalogue i do not know but i know the vaulting ribs of the spanish chapel are painted by the same hand  again of the two brothers memmi one or other i dont know or care which had an ugly way of turning the eyes of his figures up and their mouths down of which you may see an entirely disgusting example in the four saints attributed to filippo memmi on the cross wall of the north called always in murrays guide the south because he didnt notice the way the church was built transept of assisi you may however also see the way the mouth goes down in the much repainted but still characteristic no 9 in the uffizii footnote this picture bears the inscription i quote from the french catalogue not having verified it myself simon martini et lippus memmi de senis me pinxerunt i have no doubt whatever myself that the two brothers worked together on these frescoes of the spanish chapel but that most of the limbo is philips and the paradise scarcely with his interference simons  now i catch the wring and verjuice of this brother again and again among the minor heads of the lower frescoes in this spanish chapel the head of the queen beneath noah in the limbosee below is unmistakable  farther one of the two brothers i dont care which had a way of painting leaves of which you may see a notable example in the rod in the hand of gabriel in that same picture of the annunciation in the uffizii no florentine painter or any other ever painted leaves as well as that till you get down to sandro botticelli who did them much better but the man who painted that rod in the hand of gabriel painted the rod in the right hand of logic in the spanish chapeland nobody else in florence or the world could  farther and this is the last of the antiquarian business you see that the frescoes on the roof are on the whole dark with much blue and red in them the white spaces coming out strongly this is the characteristic colouring of the partially defunct school of giotto becoming merely decorative and passing into a colourist school which connected itself afterwards with the venetians there is an exquisite example of all its specialities in the little annunciation in the uffizii no 14 attributed to angelo gaddi in which you see the madonna is stupid and the angel stupid but the colour of the whole as a piece of painted glass lovely and the execution exquisiteat once a painters and jewellers with subtle sense of chiaroscuro underneath note the delicate shadow of the madonnas arm across her breast  the head of this school was according to vasari taddeo gaddi and henceforward without further discussion i shall speak of him as the painter of the roof of the spanish chapelnot without suspicion however that his son angelo may hereafter turn out to have been the better decorator and the painter of the frescoes from the life of christ in the north transept of assisiwith such assistance as his son or scholars might giveand such change or destruction as time antonio veneziano or the last operations of the tuscan railroad company may have effected on them  on the other hand you see that the frescos on the walls are of paler colours the blacks coming out of these clearly rather than the whites but the pale colours especially for instance the whole of the duomo of florence in that on your right very tender and lovely also you may feel a tendency to express much with outline and draw more than paint in the most interesting parts while in the duller ones nasty green and yellow tones come out which prevent the effect of the whole from being very pleasant these characteristics belong on the whole to the school of siena and they indicate here the work assuredly of a man of vast power and most refined education whom i shall call without further discussion during the rest of this and the following mornings study simon memmi  and of the grace and subtlety with which he joined his work to that of the gaddis you may judge at once by comparing the christ standing on the fallen gate of the limbo with the christ in the resurrection above memmi has retained the dress and imitated the general effect of the figure in the roof so faithfully that you suspect no difference of mastershipnay he has even raised the foot in the same awkward way but you will find memmis foot delicately drawntaddeos hard and rude and all the folds of memmis drapery cast with unbroken grace and complete gradations of shade while taddeos are rigid and meagre also in the heads generally taddeos type of face is square in feature with massive and inelegant clusters or volutes of hair and beard but memmis delicate and long in feature with much divided and flowing hair often arranged with exquisite precision as in the finest greek coins examine successively in this respect only the heads of adam abel methuselah and abraham in the limbo and you will not confuse the two designers any more i have not had time to make out more than the principal figures in the limbo of which indeed the entire dramatic power is centred in the adam and eve the latter dressed as a nun in her fixed gaze on christ with her hands clasped is of extreme beauty and however feeble the work of any early painter may be in its decent and grave inoffensiveness it guides the imagination unerringly to a certain point how far you are yourself capable of filling up what is left untold and conceiving as a reality eves first look on this her child depends on no painters skill but on your own understanding just above eve is abel bearing the lamb and behind him noah between his wife and shem behind them abraham between isaac and ishmael turning from ishmael to isaac behind these moses between aaron and david i have not identified the others though i find the whitebearded figure behind eve called methuselah in my notes i know not on what authority looking up from these groups however to the roof painting you will at once feel the imperfect grouping and ruder features of all the figures and the greater depth of colour we will dismiss these comparatively inferior paintings at once  the roof and walls must be read together each segment of the roof forming an introduction to or portion of the subject on the wall below but the roof must first be looked at alone as the work of taddeo gaddi for the artistic qualities and failures of it  i in front as you enter is the compartment with the subject of the resurrection it is the traditional byzantine composition the guards sleeping and the two angels in white saying to the women he is not here while christ is seen rising with the flag of the cross  but it would be difficult to find another example of the subject so coldly treatedso entirely without passion or action the faces are expressionless the gestures powerless evidently the painter is not making the slightest effort to conceive what really happened but merely repeating and spoiling what he could remember of old design or himself supply of commonplace for immediate need the noli me tangere on the right is spoiled from giotto and others before him a peacock woefully plumeless and colourless a fountain an ill drawn toyhorse and two toychildren gathering flowers are emaciate remains of greek symbols he has taken pains with the vegetation but in vain yet taddeo gaddi was a true painter a very beautiful designer and a very amiable person how comes he to do that resurrection so badly  in the first place he was probably tired of a subject which was a great strain to his feeble imagination and gave it up as impossible doing simply the required figures in the required positions in the second he was probably at the time despondent and feeble because of his masters death see lord lindsay ii 273 where also it is pointed out that in the effect of the light proceeding from the figure of christ taddeo gaddi indeed was the first of the giottisti who showed true sense of light and shade but until lionardos time the innovation did not materially affect florentine art  ii the ascension opposite the resurrection and not worth looking at except for the sake of making more sure our conclusions from the first fresco the madonna is fixed in byzantine stiffness without byzantine dignity  iii the descent of the holy ghost on the left hand the madonna and disciples are gathered in an upper chamber underneath are the parthians medes elamites etc who hear them speak in their own tongues  three dogs are in the foregroundtheir mythic purpose the same as that of the two verses which affirm the fellowship of the dog in the journey and return of tobias namely to mark the share of the lower animals in the gentleness given by the outpouring of the spirit of christ  iv the church sailing on the sea of the world st peter coming to christ on the water  i was too little interested in the vague symbolism of this fresco to examine it with carethe rather that the subject beneath the literal contest of the church with the world needed more time for study in itself alone than i had for all florence  on this and the opposite side of the chapel are represented by simon memmis hand the teaching power of the spirit of god and the saving power of the christ of god in the world according to the understanding of florence in his time  we will take the side of intellect first beneath the pouring forth of the holy spirit  in the point of the arch beneath are the three evangelical virtues without these says florence you can have no science without love faith and hopeno intelligence  under these are the four cardinal virtues the entire group being thus arranged                           a                       b     c                    d   e   f   g  a charity flames issuing from her head and hands b faith holds cross and shield quenching fiery darts this symbol so frequent in modern adaptation from st pauls address to personal faith is rare in older art c hope with a branch of lilies d temperance bridles a black fish on which she stands e prudence with a book f justice with crown and baton g fortitude with tower and sword  under these are the great prophets and apostles on the leftfootnote i cant find my note of the first one on the left answering to solomon opposite david st paul st mark st john on the right st matthew st luke moses isaiah solomon in the midst of the evangelists st thomas aquinas seated on a gothic throne  now observe this throne with all the canopies below it and the complete representation of the duomo of florence opposite are of finished gothic of orecagnas schoollater than giottos gothic but the building in which the apostles are gathered at the pentecost is of the early romanesque mosaic school with a wheel window from the duomo of assisi and square windows from the baptistery of florence and this is always the type of architecture used by taddeo gaddi while the finished gothic could not possibly have been drawn by him but is absolute evidence of the later hand  under the line of prophets as powers summoned by their voices are the mythic figures of the seven theological or spiritual and the seven geological or natural sciences and under the feet of each of them the figure of its captainteacher to the world  i had better perhaps give you the names of this entire series of figures from left to right at once you will see presently why they are numbered in a reverse order                                 beneath

system of manly education supposed in old florence to be that necessarily instituted in great earthly kingdoms or republics animated by the spirit shed down upon the world at pentecost how long do you think it will take you or ought to take to see such a picture we were to get to work this morning as early as might be you have probably allowed half an hour for santa maria novella half an hour for san lorenzo an hour for the museum of sculpture at the bargello an hour for shopping and then it will be lunch time and you mustnt be late because you are to leave by the afternoon train and must positively be in rome tomorrow morning well of your halfhour for santa maria novellaafter ghirlandajos choir orcagnas transept and cimabues madonna and the painted windows have been seen properly there will remain suppose at the utmost a quarter of an hour for the spanish chapel that will give you two minutes and a half for each side two for the ceiling and three for studying murrays explanations or mine two minutes and a half you have got thenand i observed during my five weeks work in the chapel that english visitors seldom gave so muchto read this scheme given you by simon memmi of human spiritual education in order to understand the purport of it in any the smallest degree you must summon to your memory in the course of these two minutes and a half what you happen to be acquainted with of the doctrines and characters of pythagoras zoroaster aristotle dionysius the areopagite st augustine and the emperor justinian and having further observed the expressions and actions attributed by the painter to these personages judge how far he has succeeded in reaching a true and worthy ideal of them and how large or how subordinate a part in his general scheme of human learning he supposes their peculiar doctrines properly to occupy for myself being to my much sorrow now an old person and to my much pride an oldfashioned one i have not found my powers either of reading or memory in the least increased by any of mr stephensons or mr wheatstones inventions and though indeed i came here from lucca in three hours instead of a day which it used to take i do not think myself able on that account to see any picture in florence in less time than it took formerly or even obliged to hurry myself in any investigations connected with it  accordingly i have myself taken five weeks to see the quarter of this picture of simon memmis and can give you a fairly good account of that quarter and some partial account of a fragment or two of those on the other walls but alas only of their pictorial qualities in either case for i dont myself know anything whatever worth trusting to about pythagoras or dionysius the areopagite and have not had and never shall have probably any time to learn much of them while in the very feeblest light onlyin what the french would express by their excellent word lueuri am able to understand something of the characters of zoroaster aristotle and justinian but this only increases in me the reverence with which i ought to stand before the work of a painter who was not only a master of his own craft but so profound a scholar and theologian as to be able to conceive this scheme of picture and write the divine law by which florence was to live which law written in the northern page of this vaulted book we will begin quiet interpretation of if you care to return hither tomorrow morning     the fifth morning  the strait gate   as you return this morning to st marys you may as well observethe matter before us being concerning gatesthat the western façade of the church is of two periods your murray refers it all to the latest of these i forget when and do not carein which the largest flanking columns and the entire effective mass of the walls with their riband mosaics and high pediment were built in front of and above what the barbarian renaissance designer chose to leave of the pure old dominican church you may see his ungainly jointings at the pedestals of the great columns running through the pretty particoloured base which with the strait gothic doors and the entire lines of the fronting and flanking tombs where not restored by the devilbegotten brood of modern florence is of pure and exquisitely severe and refined fourteenth century gothic with superbly carved bearings on its shields the small detached line of tombs on the left untouched in its sweet colour and living weed ornament i would fain have painted stone by stone but one can never draw in front of a church in these republican days for all the blackguard children of the neighbourhood come to howl and throw stones on the steps and the ball or stone play against these sculptured tombs as a dead wall adapted for that purpose only is incessant in the fine days when i could have worked  if you enter by the door most to the left or north and turn immediately to the right on the interior of the wall of the façade is an annunciation visible enough because well preserved though in the dark and extremely pretty in its wayof the decorated and ornamental school following giottoi cant guess by whom nor does it much matter but it is well to look at it by way of contrast with the delicate intense slightly decorated design of memmiin which when you return into the spanish chapel you will feel the dependence for its effect on broad masses of white and pale amber where the decorative school would have had mosaic of red blue and gold  our first business this morning must be to read and understand the writing on the book held open by st thomas aquinas for that informs us of the meaning of the whole picture  it is this text from the book of wisdom vii 6              optavi et datus est mihi sensus              invocavi et venit in me spiritus sapientiae              et preposui illam regnis et sedibus              i willed and sense was given me              i prayed and the spirit of wisdom came upon me              and i set her before preferred her to kingdoms              and thrones  the common translation in our english apocrypha loses the entire meaning of this passage whichnot only as the statement of the experience of florence in her own education but as universally descriptive of the process of all noble education whateverwe had better take pains to understand  first says florence i willed in sense of resolutely desiring and sense was given me you must begin your education with the distinct resolution to know what is true and choice of the strait and rough road to such knowledge this choice is offered to every youth and maid at some moment of their lifechoice between the easy downward road so broad that we can dance down it in companies and the steep narrow way which we must enter alone then and for many a day afterwards they need that form of persistent option and will but day by day the sense of the rightness of what they have done deepens on them not in consequence of the effort but by gift granted in reward of it and the sense of difference between right and wrong and between beautiful and unbeautiful things is confirmed in the heroic and fulfilled in the industrious soul  that is the process of education in the earthly sciences and the morality connected with them reward given to faithful volition  next when moral and physical senses are perfect comes the desire for education in the higher world where the senses are no more our teachers but the maker of the senses and that teaching we cannot get by labour but only by petition  invocavi et venit in me spiritus sapientiaei prayed and the spirit of wisdom not you observe was given footnote i in careless error wrote was given in fors clavigera but came upon me the personal power of wisdom the greek sophia or santa sophia to whom the first great christian temple was dedicated this higher wisdom governing by her presence all earthly conduct and by her teaching all earthly art florence tells you she obtained only by prayer  and these two earthly and divine sciences are expressed beneath in the symbols of their divided powersseven terrestrial seven celestial whose names have been already indicated to youin which figures i must point out one or two technical matters before touching their interpretation they are all by simon memmi originally but repainted many of them all over some hundred years latercertainly after the discovery of america as you will seeby an artist of considerable power and some feeling for the general action of the figures but of no refinement or carelessness he dashes massive paint in huge spaces over the subtle old work puts in his own chiarooscuro where all had been shadeless and his own violent colour where all had been pale and repaints the faces so as to make them to his notion prettier and more human some of this upper work has however come away since and the original outline at least is traceable while in the face of the logic the music and one or two others the original work is very pure being most interested myself in the earthly sciences i had a scaffolding put up made on a level with them and examined them inch by inch and the following report will be found accurate until next repainting  for interpretation of them you must always take the central figure of the science with the little medallion above it and the figure below all together which i proceed to do reading first from left to right for the earthly sciences and then from right to left the heavenly ones to the centre where their two highest powers sit side by side  we begin then with the first in the list given above vaulted book page 75grammar in the corner farthest from the window  1 grammar more properly grammaticë grammatic act the art of letters or literature or using the word which to some english ears will carry most weight with itscripture and its use the art of faithfully reading what has been written for our learning and of clearly writing what we would make immortal of our thoughts power which consists first in recognizing letters secondly in forming them thirdly in the understanding and choice of words which errorless shall express our thought severe exercises all reachingvery few living persons know how far beginning properly in childhood then only to be truly acquired it is wholly impossiblethis i say from too sorrowful experienceto conquer by any effort or time habits of the hand much more of head and soul with which the vase of flesh has been formed and filled in youththe law of god being that parents shall compel the child in the day of its obedience into habits of hand and eye and soul which when it is old shall not by any strength or any weakness be departed from  enter ye in therefore says grammaticë at the strait gate she points through it with her rod holding a fruit for reward in her left hand the gate is very strait indeedher own waist no less so her hair fastened close she had once a white veil binding it which is lost not a gushing form of literature thisor in any wise disposed to subscribe to mudies my english friendsor even patronize tauchnitz editions ofwhat is the last new novel you see ticketed up today in mr goodbans window she looks kindly down nevertheless to the three children whom she is teachingtwo boys and a girl qy does this mean that one girl out of every two should not be able to read or write i am quite willing to accept that inference for my own partshould perhaps even say two girls out of three this girl is of the highest classes crowned her golden hair falling behind her the florentine girdle round her hipsnot waist the object being to leave the lungs full play but to keep the dress always well down in dancing or running the boys are of good birth also the nearest one with luxuriant curly haironly the profile of the farther one seen all reverent and eager above the medallion is of a figure looking at a fountain underneath lord lindsay says priscian and is i doubt not right  technical pointsthe figure is said by crowe to be entirely repainted the dress is so throughoutboth the hands also and the fruit and rod but the eyes mouth hair above the forehead and outline of the rest with the faded veil and happily the traces left of the children are genuine the strait gate perfectly so in the colour underneath though reinforced and the action of the entire figure is well preserved but there is a curious question about both the rod and fruit seen close the former perfectly assumes the shape of folds of dress gathered up over the raised right arm and i am not absolutely sure that the restorer has not mistaken the foldsat the same time changing a pen or style into a rod the fruit also i have doubts of as fruit is not so rare at florence that it should be made a reward it is entirely and roughly repainted and is oval in shape in giottos charity luckily not restored at assisi the guidebooks have always mistaken the heart she holds for an appleand my own belief is that originally the grammaticë of simon memmi made with her right hand the sign which said enter ye in at the strait gate and with her left the sign which said my son give me thine heart  ii rhetoric next to learning how to read and write you are to learn to speak and young ladies and gentlemen observeto speak as little as possible it is farther implied till you have learned  in the streets of florence at this day you may hear much of what some people call rhetoricvery passionate speaking indeed and quite from the heartsuch hearts as the people have got that is to say you never hear a word uttered but in a rage either just ready to burst or for the most part explosive instantly everybodyman woman or childroaring out their incontinent foolish infinitely contemptible opinions and wills on every smallest occasion with flashing eyes hoarsely shrieking and wasted voicesinsane hope to drag by vociferation whatever they would have out of man and god  now consider simon memmis rhetoric the science of speaking primarily of making oneself heard therefore which is not to be done by shouting she alone of all the sciences carries a scroll and being a speaker gives you something to read it is not thrust forward at you at all but held quietly down with her beautiful depressed right hand her left hand set coolly and strongly on her side  and you will find that thus she alone of all the sciences needs no use of her hands all the others have some important business for them she none she can do all with her lips holding scroll or bridle or what you will with her right hand her left on her side  again look at the talkers in the streets of florence and see how being essentially unable to talk they try to make lips of their fingers how they poke wave flourish point jerk shake finger and fist at their antagonistsdumb essentially all the while if they knew it unpersuasive and ineffectual as the shaking of tree branches in the wind  you will at first think her figure ungainly and stiff it is so partly the dress being more coarsely repainted than in any other of the series but she is meant to be both stout and strong what she has to say is indeed to persuade you if possible but assuredly to overpower you and she has not the florentine girdle for she does not want to move she has her girdle broad at the waistof all the sciences you would at first have thought the one that most needed breath no says simon memmi you want breath to run or dance or fight with but to speakif you know how you can do your work with few words very little of this pure florentine air will be enough if you shape it rightly  note also that calm setting of her hand against her side you think rhetoric should be glowing fervid impetuous no says simon memmi above all thingscool  and now let us read what is written on her scrollmulceo dum loquor varios induta colores  her chief function to melt make soft thaw the hearts of men with kind fire to overpower with peace and bring rest with rainbow colours the chief mission of all words that they should be of comfort  you think the function of words is to excite why a red rag will do that or a blast through a brass pipe but to give calm and gentle heat to be as the south wind and the iridescent rain to all bitterness of frost and bring at once strength and healing this is the work of human lips taught of god  one farther and final lesson is given in the medallion above aristotle and too many modern rhetoricians of his school thought there could be good speaking in a false cause but above simon memmis rhetoric is truth with her mirror  there is a curious feeling almost innate in men that though they are bound to speak truth in speaking to a single person they may lie as much as they please provided they lie to two or more people at once there is the same feeling about killing most people would shrink from shooting one innocent man but will fire a mitrailleuse contentedly into an innocent regiment  when you look down from the figure of the science to that of cicero beneath you will at first think it entirely overthrows my conclusion that rhetoric has no need of her hands for cicero it appears has three instead of two  the uppermost at his chin is the only genuine one that raised with the finger up is entirely false that on the book is repainted so as to defy conjecture of its original action  but observe how the gesture of the true one confirms instead of overthrowing what i have said above cicero is not speaking at all but profoundly thinking before he speaks it is the most abstractedly thoughtful face to be found among all the philosophers and very beautiful the whole is under solomon in the line of prophets  technical pointsthese two figures have suffered from restoration more than any others but the right hand of rhetoric is still entirely genuine and the left except the ends of the fingers the ear and hair just above it are quite safe the head well set on its original line but the crown of leaves rudely retouched and then faded all the lower part of the figure of cicero has been not only repainted but changed the face is genuinei believe retouched but so cautiously and skilfully that it is probably now more beautiful than at first  iii logic the science of reasoning or more accurately reason herself or pure intelligence  science to be gained after that of expression says simon memmi so young people it appears that though you must not speak before you have been taught how to speak you may yet properly speak before you have been taught how to think  for indeed it is only by frank speaking that you can learn how to think and it is no matter how wrong the first thoughts you have may be provided you express them clearlyand are willing to have them put right  fortunately nearly all of this beautiful figure is practically safe the outlines pure everywhere and the face perfect the prettiest as far as i know which exists in italian art of this early date it is subtle to the extreme in gradations of colour the eyebrows drawn not with a sweep of the brush but with separate cross touches in the line of their growthexquisitely pure in arch the nose straight and fine the lipsplayful slightly proud unerringly cut the hair flowing in sequent waves ordered as if in musical time head perfectly upright on the shoulders the height of the brow completed by a crimson frontlet set with pearls surmounted by a fleurdelys  her shoulders were exquisitely drawn her white jacket fitting close to soft yet scarcely rising breasts her arms singularly strong at perfect rest her hands exquisitely delicate in her right she holds a branching and leafbearing rod the syllogism in her left a scorpion with double sting the dilemmamore generally the powers of rational construction and dissolution  beneath her aristotleintense keenness of search in his halfclosed eyes  medallion above less expressive than usual a man writing with his head stooped  the whole under isaiah in the line of prophets  technical pointsthe only parts of this figure which have suffered seriously in repainting are the leaves of the rod and the scorpion i have no idea as i said above what the background once was it is now a mere mess of scrabbled grey carried over the vestiges still with care much redeemable of the richly ornamental extremity of the rod which was a cluster of green leaves on a black ground but the scorpion is indecipherably injured most of it confused repainting mixed with the white of the dress the double sting emphatic enough still but not on the first lines  the aristotle is very genuine throughout except his hat and i think that must be pretty nearly on the old lines through i cannot trace them they are good lines new or old  iv music after you have learned to reason young people of course you will be very grave if not dull you think no says simon memmi by no means anything of the kind after learning to reason you will learn to sing for you will want to there is so much reason for singing in the sweet world when one thinks rightly of it none for grumbling provided always you have entered in at the strait gate you will sing all along the road then in a little while in a manner pleasant for other people to hear  this figure has been one of the loveliest in the series an extreme refinement and tender severity being aimed at throughout she is crowned not with laurel but with small leavesi am not sure what they are being too much injured the face thin abstracted wistful the lips not far open in their low singing the hair rippling softly on the shoulders she plays on a small organ richly ornamented with gothic tracery the down slope of it set with crockets like those of santa maria del fiore simon memmi means that all music must be sacred not that you are never to sing anything but hymns but that whatever is rightly called music or work of the muses is divine in help and healing  the actions of both hands are singularly sweet the right is one of the loveliest things i ever saw done in painting she is keeping down one note only with her third finger seen under the raised fourth the thumb just passing under all the curves of the fingers exquisite and the pale light and shade of the rosy flesh relieved against the ivory white and brown of the notes only the thumb and end of the forefinger are seen of the left hand but they indicate enough its light pressure on the bellows fortunately all these portions of the fresco are absolutely intact  underneath tubalcain not jubal as you would expect jubal is the inventor of musical instruments tubalcain thought the old florentines invented harmony they the best smiths in the world knew the differences in tones of hammer strokes on anvil curiously enough the only piece of true partsinging done beautifully and joyfully which i have heard this year in italy being south of alps exactly six months and ranging from genoa to palermo was out of a busy smithy at perugia of bestial howling and entirely frantic vomiting up of hopelessly damned souls through their still carnal throats i have heard more than please god i will ever endure the hearing of again in one of his summers  you think tubalcain very ugly yes much like a shaggy baboon not accidentally but with most scientific understanding of baboon character men must have looked like that before they had invented harmony or felt that one note differed from another says and knows simon memmi darwinism like all widely popular and widely mischievous fallacies has many a curious gleam and grain of truth in its tissue  under moses  medallion a youth drinking otherwise you might have thought only church music meant and not feast music also  technical pointsthe tubalcain one of the most entirely pure and precious remnants of the old painting nothing lost nothing but the redder ends of his beard retouched green dress of music in the body and over limbs entirely repainted it was once beautifully embroidered sleeves partly genuine hands perfect face and hair nearly so leaf crown faded and broken away but not retouched  v astronomy properly astrology as theology the knowledge of so much of the stars as we can know wisely not the attempt to define their laws for them not that it is unbecoming of us to find out if we can that they move in ellipses and so on but it is no business of ours what effects their rising and setting have on man and beast and leaf what their times and changes are seen and felt in this world it is our business to know passing our nights if wakefully by that divine candlelight and no other  she wears a dark purple robe holds in her left hand the hollow globe with golden zodiac and meridians lifts her right hand in noble awe  when i consider the heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained  crowned with gold her dark hair in elliptic waves bound with glittering chains of pearl her eyes dark lifted  beneath her zoroasterfootnote atlas according to poor vasari and sundry modern guides i find vasaris mistakes usually of this brightly blundering kind in matters needing research after a while i find he is right usually entirely noble and beautiful the delicate persian head made softer still by the elaborately wreathed silken hair twisted into the pointed beard and into tapering plaits falling on his shoulders the head entirely thrown back he looks up with no distortion of the delicately arched brow writing as he gazes  for the association of the religion of the magi with their own in the mind of the florentines of this time see before the soldan  the dress must always have been white because of its beautiful opposition to the purple above and that of tubalcain beside it but it has been too much repainted to be trusted anywhere nothing left but a fold or two in the sleeves the cast of it from the knees down is entirely beautiful and i suppose on the old lines but the restorer could throw a fold well when he chose the warm light which relieves the purple of zoroaster above is laid in by him i dont know if i should have liked it better flat as it was against the dark purple it seems to me quite beautiful now the full red flush on the face of the astronomy is the restorers doing also she was much paler if not quite pale  under st luke  medallion a stern man with sickle and spade for the flowers and for us when stars have risen and set such and such timesremember  technical pointsleft hand globe most of the important folds of the purple dress eyes mouth hair in great part and crown genuine golden tracery on border of dress lost extremity of falling folds from left sleeve altered and confused but the confusion prettily got out of right hand and much of face and body of dress repainted  zoroasters head quite pure dress repainted but carefully leaving the hair untouched right hand and pen now a common feathered quill entirely repainted but dexterously and with feeling the hand was once slightly different in position and held most probably a reed  vi geometry you have now learned young ladies and gentlemen to read to speak to think to sing and to see you are getting old and will have soon to think of being married you must learn to build your house therefore here is your carpenters square for you and you may safely and wisely contemplate the ground a little and the measures and laws relating to that seeing you have got to abide upon itand that you have properly looked at the stars not before then lest had you studied the ground first you might perchance never have raised your heads from it this is properly the science of all laws of practical labour issuing in beauty  she looks down a little puzzled greatly interested holding her carpenters square in her left hand not wanting that but for practical work following a diagram with her right  her beauty altogether soft and in curves i commend to your notice as the exact opposite of what a vulgar designer would have imagined for her note the wreath of hair at the back of her head which though fastened by a spiral fillet escapes at last and flies off loose in a sweeping curve contemplative theology is the only other of the sciences who has such wavy hair  beneath her euclid in white turban very fine and original work throughout but nothing of special interest in him  under st matthew  medallion a soldier with a straight sword best for science of defence octagon shield helmet like the beehive of canton vaud as the secondary use of music in feasting so the secondary use of geometry in warher noble art being all in sweetest peaceis shown in the medallion  technical pointsit is more than fortunate that in nearly every figure the original outline of the hair is safe geometrys has scarcely been retouched at all except at the ends once in single knots now in confused double ones the hands girdle most of her dress and her black carpenters square are original face and breast repainted  vii arithmetic having built your house young people and understanding the light of heaven and the measures of earth you may marryand cant do better and here is now your conclusive science which you will have to apply all your days to all your affairs  the science of number infinite in solemnity of use in italy at this time including of course whatever was known of the higher abstract mathematics and mysteries of numbers but reverenced especially in its vital necessity to the prosperity of families and kingdoms and first fully so understood here in commercial florence  her hand lifted with two fingers bent two straight solemnly enforcing on your attention her primal lawtwo and two arefour you observenot five as those accursed usurers think  under her pythagoras  above medallion of king with sceptre and globe counting money have you ever chanced to read carefully carlyles account of the foundation of the existing prussian empire in economy  you can at all events consider with yourself a little what empire this queen of the terrestrial sciences must hold over the rest if they are to be put to good use or what depth and breadth of application there is in the brief parables of the counted cost of power and number of armies  to give a very minor but characteristic instance i have always felt that with my intense love of the alps i ought to have been able to make a drawing of chamouni or the vale of cluse which should give people more pleasure than a photograph but i always wanted to do it as i saw it and engrave pine for pine and crag for crag like albert dürer i broke my strength down for many a year always tiring of my work or finding the leaves drop off or the snow come on before i had well begun what i meant to do if i had only counted my pines first and calculated the number of hours necessary to do them in the manner of dürer i should have saved the available drawing time of some five years spent in vain effort  but turner counted his pines and did all that could be done for them and rested content with that  so in all the affairs of life the arithmetical part of the business is the dominant one how many and how much have we how many and how much do we want how constantly does noble arithmetic of the finite lose itself in base avarice of the infinite and in blind imagination of it in counting of minutes is our arithmetic ever solicitous enough in counting our days is she ever severe enough how we shrink from putting in their decades the diminished store of them and if we ever pray the solemn prayer that we may be taught to number them do we even try to do it after praying  technical pointsthe pythagoras almost entirely genuine the upper figures from this inclusive to the outer wall i have not been able to examine thoroughly my scaffolding not extending beyond the geometry  here then we have the sum of sciencesseven according to the florentine mindnecessary to the secular education of man and woman of these the modern average respectable english gentleman and gentlewoman know usually only a little of the last and entirely hate the prudent applications of that being unacquainted except as they chance here and there to pick up a broken piece of information with either grammar rhetoric music footnote being able to play the piano and admire mendelssohn is not knowing music astronomy or geometry and are not only unacquainted with logic or the use of reason themselves but instinctively antagonistic to its use by anybody else  we are now to read the series of the divine sciences beginning at the opposite side next the window  viii civil law civil or of citizens not only as distinguished from ecclesiastical but from local law she is the universal justice of the peaceful relations of men throughout the world therefore holds the globe with its three quarters white as being justly governed in her left hand  she is also the law of eternal equity not erring statute therefore holds her sword level across her breast she is the foundation of all other divine science to know anything whatever about god you must begin by being just  dressed in red which in these frescoes is always a sign of power or zeal but her face very calm gentle and beautiful her hair bound close and crowned by the royal circlet of gold with pure thirteenth century strawberry leaf ornament  under her the emperor justinian in blue with conical mitre of white and gold the face in profile very beautiful the imperial staff in his right hand the institutes in his left  medallion a figure apparently in distress appealing for justice trajans suppliant widow  technical pointsthe three divisions of the globe in her hand were originally inscribed asia africa europe the restorer has ingeniously changed af into america faces both of the science and emperor little retouched nor any of the rest altered  ix christian law after the justice which rules men comes that which rules the church of christ the distinction is not between secular law and ecclesiastical authority but between the equity of humanity and the law of christian discipline  in full straightfalling golden robe with white mantle over it a church in her left hand her right raised with the forefinger lifted indicating heavenly source of all christian law or warning  headdress a white veil floating into folds in the air you will find nothing in these frescoes without significance and as the escaping hair of geometry indicates the infinite conditions of lines of the higher orders so the floating veil here indicates that the higher relations of christian justice are indefinable so her golden mantle indicates that it is a glorious and excellent justice beyond that which unchristian men conceive while the severely falling lines of the folds which form a kind of gabled niche for the head of the pope beneath correspond with the strictness of true church discipline firmer as well as more luminous statute  beneath pope clement v in red lifting his hand not in the position of benediction but i suppose of injunctiononly the forefinger straight the second a little bent the two last quite note the strict level of the book and the vertical directness of the key  the medallion puzzles me it looks like a figure counting money  technical pointsfairly well preserved but the face of the science retouched the grotesquely false perspective of the popes tiara one of the most curiously naïve examples of the entirely ignorant feeling after merely scientific truth of form which still characterized italian art  type of church interesting in its extreme simplicity no idea of transept campanile or dome  x practical theology the beginning of the knowledge of god being human justice and its elements defined by christian law the application of the law so defined follows first with respect to man then with respect to god  render unto caesar the things that are caesarsand to god the things that are gods  we have therefore now two sciences one of our dutyto men the other to their maker  this is the first duty to men she holds a circular medallion representing christ preaching on the mount and points with her right hand to the earth  the sermon on the mount is perfectly expressed by the craggy pinnacle in front of christ and the high dark horizon there is curious evidence throughout all these frescos of simon memmis having read the gospels with a quite clear understanding of their innermost meaning  i have called this science practical theologythe instructive knowledge that is to say of what god would have us do personally in any given human relation and the speaking his gospel therefore by act let your light so shine before men  she wears a green dress like music her hair in the arabian arch with jewelled diadem  under david medallion almsgiving beneath her peter lombard  technical pointsit is curious that while the instinct of perspective was not strong enough to enable any painter at this time to foreshorten a foot it yet suggested to them the expression of elevation by raising the horizon  i have not examined the retouching the hair and diadem at least are genuine the face is dignified and compassionate and much on the old lines  xi devotional theologygiving glory to god or more accurately whatever feelings he desires us to have towards him whether of affection or awe  this is the science or method of devotion for christians universally just as the practical theology is their science or method of action  in blue and red a narrow black rod still traceable in the left hand i am not sure of its meaning thy rod and thy staff they comfort me the other hand open in admiration like astronomys but devotions is held at her breast her head very characteristic of memmi with upturned eyes and arab arch in hair under her dionysius the areopagitemending his pen but i am doubtful of lord lindsays identification of this figure and the action is curiously common and meaningless it may have meant that meditative theology is essentially a writer not a preacher  the medallion on the other hand is as ingenious a mother lifting her hands in delight at her childs beginning to take notice  under st paul  technical pointsboth figures very genuine the lower one almost entirely so the painting of the red book is quite exemplary in fresco style  xii dogmatic theologyafter action and worship thought becoming too wide and difficult the need of dogma becomes felt the assertion that is within limited range of the things that are to be believed  since whatever pride and folly pollute christian scholarship naturally delight in dogma the science itself cannot but be in a kind of disgrace among sensible men nevertheless it would be difficult to overvalue the peace and security which have been given to humble persons by forms of creed and it is evident that either there is no such thing as theology or some of its knowledge must be thus if not expressible at least reducible within certain limits of expression so as to be protected from misinterpretation  in redagain the sign of powercrowned with a black once golden triple crown emblematic of the trinity the left hand holding a scoop for winnowing corn the other points upwards prove all thingshold fast that which is good or of god  beneath her boethius under st mark medallion female figure laying hands on breast  technical pointsthe boethius entirely genuine and the painting of his black book as of the red one beside it again worth notice showing how pleasant and interesting the commonest things become when well painted  i have not examined the upper figure  xiii mystic theology footnote blunderingly in the guidebooks called faith monastic science above dogma and attaining to new revelation by reaching higher spiritual states  in white robes her left hand gloved i dont know whyholding chalice she wears a nuns veil fastened under her chin her hair fastened close like grammars showing her necessary monastic life all states of mystic spiritual life involving retreat from much that is allowable in the material and practical world  there is no possibility of denying this fact infinite as the evils are which have arisen from misuse of it they have been chiefly induced by persons who falsely pretended to lead monastic life and led it without having natural faculty for it but many more lamentable errors have arisen from the pride of really noble persons who have thought it would be a more pleasing thing to god to be a sibyl or a witch than a useful housewife pride is always somewhat involved even in the true effort the scarlet headdress in the form of a horn on the forehead in the fresco indicates this both here and in the contemplative theology  under st john  medallion unintelligible to me a woman laying hands on the shoulders of two small figures  technical pointsmore of the minute folds of the white dress left than in any other of the repainted draperies it is curious that minute division has always in drapery more or less been understood as an expression of spiritual life from the delicate folds of athenas peplus down to the rippled edges of modern priests white robes titians breadth of fold on the other hand meaning for the most part bodily power the relation of the two modes of composition was lost by michael angelo who thought to express spirit by making flesh colossal  for the rest the figure is not of any interest memmis own mind being intellectual rather than mystic  xiv polemic theologyfootnote blunderingly called charity in the guidebooks  who goes forth conquering and to conquer for we war not with flesh and blood etc  in red as sign of power but not in armour because she is herself invulnerable a close red cap with cross for crest instead of helmet bow in left hand long arrow in right  she partly means aggressive logic compare the set of her shoulders and arms with logics  she is placed the last of the divine sciences not as their culminating power but as the last which can be rightly learned you must know all the others before you go out to battle whereas the general principle of modern christendom is to go out to battle without knowing any one of the others one of the reasons for this error the prince of errors being the vulgar notion that truth may be ascertained by debate truth is never learned in any department of industry by arguing but by working and observing and when you have got good hold of one truth for certain two others will grow out of it in a beautifully dicotyledonous fashion which as before noticed is the meaning of the branch in logics right hand then when you have got so much true knowledge as is worth fighting for you are bound to fight for it but not to debate about it any more  there is however one further reason for polemic theology being put beside mystic it is only in some approach to mystic science that any man becomes aware of what st paul means by spiritual wickedness in heavenly footnote with cowardly intentional fallacy translated high in the english bible places or in any true sense knows the enemies of god and of man  beneath st augustine showing you the proper method of controversy perfectly firm perfectly gentle  you are to distinguish of course controversy from rebuke the assertion of truth is to be always gentle the chastisement of wilful falsehood may bevery much the contrary indeed christs sermon on the mount is full of polemic theology yet perfectly gentleye have heard that it hath been saidbut i say unto youand if ye salute your brethren only what do ye more than others and the like but his ye fools and blind for whether is greater is not merely the exposure of error but rebuke of the avarice which made that error possible  under the throne of st thomas and next to arithmetic of the terrestrial sciences  medallion a soldier but not interesting  technical pointsvery genuine and beautiful throughout note the use of st augustines red bands to connect him with the full red of the upper figures and compare the niche formed by the dress of canon law above the pope for different artistic methods of attaining the same objectunity of composition  but lunch time is near my friends and you have that shopping to do you know     the sixth morning  the shepherds tower   i am obliged to interrupt my account of the spanish chapel by the following notes on the sculptures of giottos campanile first because i find that inaccurate accounts of those sculptures are in course of publication and chiefly because i cannot finish my work in the spanish chapel until one of my good oxford helpers mr caird has completed some investigations he has undertaken for me upon the history connected with it i had written my own analysis of the fourth side believing that in every scene of it the figure of st dominic was repeated mr caird first suggested and has shown me already good grounds for his belieffootnote he wrote thus to me on 11th november last the three preachers are certainly different the first is dominic the second peter martyr whom i have identified from his martyrdom on the other wall and the third aquinas that the preaching monks represented are in each scene intended for a different person i am informed also of several careless mistakes which have got into my description of the fresco of the sciences and finally another of my young helpers mr charles f murrayone however whose help is given much in the form of antagonisminforms me of various critical discoveries lately made both by himself and by industrious germans of points respecting the authenticity of this and that which will require notice from me more especially he tells me of certification that the picture in the uffizii of which i accepted the ordinary attribution to giotto is by lorenzo monacowhich indeed may well be without in the least diminishing the use to you of what i have written of its predella and without in the least if you think rightly of the matter diminishing your confidence in what i tell you of giotto generally there is one kind of knowledge of pictures which is the artists and another which is the antiquarys and the picturedealers the latter especially acute and founded on very secure and wide knowledge of canvas pigment and tricks of touch without necessarily involving any knowledge whatever of the qualities of art itself there are few practised dealers in the great cities of europe whose opinion would not be more trustworthy than mine if you could get it mind you on points of actual authenticity but they could only tell you whether the picture was by such and such a master and not at all what either the master or his work were good for thus i have before now taken drawings by varley and by cousins for early studies by turner and have been convinced by the dealers that they knew better than i as far as regarded the authenticity of those drawings but the dealers dont know turner or the worth of him so well as i for all that so also you may find me again and again mistaken among the much more confused work of the early giottesque schools as to the authenticity of this work or the other but you will find and i say it with far more sorrow than pride that i am simply the only person who can at present tell you the real worth of any you will find that whenever i tell you to look at a picture it is worth your pains and whenever i tell you the character of a painter that it is his character discerned by me faithfully in spite of all confusion of work falsely attributed to him in which similar character may exist thus when i mistook cousins for turner i was looking at a piece of subtlety in the sky of which the dealer had no consciousness whatever which was essentially turneresque but which another man might sometimes equal whereas the dealer might be only looking at the quality of whatmans paper which cousins used and turner did not  not in the meanwhile to leave you quite guideless as to the main subject of the fourth fresco in the spanish chapelthe pilgrims progress of florencehere is a brief map of it  on the right in lowest angle st dominic preaches to the group of infidels in the next group towards the left he or some one very like him preaches to the heretics the heretics proving obstinate he sets his dogs at them as at the fatallest of wolves who being driven away the rescued lambs are gathered at the feet of the pope i have copied the head of the very pious but slightly weakminded little lamb in the centre to compare with my rough cumberland ones who have had no such grave experiences the whole group with the pope above the niche of the duomo joining with and enriching the decorative power of his mitre is a quite delicious piece of design  the church being thus pacified is seen in worldly honour under the powers of the spiritual and temporal rulers the pope with cardinal and bishop descending in order on his right the emperor with king and baron descending in order on his left the ecclesiastical body of the whole church on the right side and the laitychiefly its poets and artists on the left  then the redeemed church nevertheless giving itself up to the vanities and temptations of the world its forgetful saints are seen feasting with their children dancing before them the seven mortal sins say some commentators but the wisehearted of them confess their sins to another ghost of st dominic and confessed becoming as little children enter hand in hand the gate of the eternal paradise crowned with flowers by the waiting angels and admitted by st peter among the serenely joyful crowd of all the saints above whom the white madonna stands reverently before the throne there is so far as i know throughout all the schools of christian art no other so perfect statement of the noble policy and religion of men  i had intended to give the best account of it in my power but when at florence lost all time for writing that i might copy the group of the pope and emperor for the schools of oxford and the work since done by mr caird has informed me of so much and given me in some of its suggestions so much to think of that i believe it will be best and most just to print at once his account of the fresco as a supplement to these essays of mine merely indicating any points on which i have objections to raise and so leave matters till fors lets me see florence once more  perhaps she may in kindness forbid my ever seeing it more the wreck of it being now too ghastly and heartbreaking to any human soul that remembers the days of old forty years ago there was assuredly no spot of ground out of palestine in all the round world on which if you knew even but a little the true course of that worlds history you saw with so much joyful reverence the dawn of morning as at the foot of the tower of giotto for there the traditions of faith and hope of both the gentile and jewish races met for their beautiful labour the baptistery of florence is the last building raised on the earth by the descendants of the workmen taught by dædalus and the tower of giotto is the loveliest of those raised on earth under the inspiration of the men who lifted up the tabernacle in the wilderness of living greek work there is none after the florentine baptistery of living christian work none so perfect as the tower of giotto and under the gleam and shadow of their marbles the morning light was haunted by the ghosts of the father of natural science galileo of sacred art angelico and the master of sacred song which spot of ground the modern florentine has made his principal hackneycoach stand and omnibus station the hackney coaches with their more or less farmyardlike litter of occasional hay and smell of variously mixed horsemanure are yet in more permissible harmony with the place than the ordinary populace of a fashionable promenade would be with its cigars spitting and harlot planned fineries but the omnibus place of call being in front of the door of the tower renders it impossible to stand for a moment near it to look at the sculptures either of the eastern or southern side while the north side is enclosed with an iron railing and usually encumbered with lumber as well not a soul in florence ever caring now for sight of any piece of its old artists work and the mass of strangers being on the whole intent on nothing but getting the omnibus to go by steam and so seeing the cathedral in one swift circuit by glimpses between the puffs of it  the front of notre dame of paris was similarly turned into a coachoffice when i last saw it1872 footnote see fors clavigera in that year within fifty yards of me as i write the oratory of the holy ghost is used for a tobaccostore and in fine over all europe mere caliban bestiality and satyric ravage staggering drunk and desperate into every once enchanted cell where the prosperity of kingdoms ruled and the miraculous ness of beauty was shrined in peace  deluge of profanity drowning dome and tower in stygian pool of vilest thoughtnothing now left sacred in the places where oncenothing was profane  for that is indeed the teaching if you could receive it of the tower of giotto as of all christian art in its day next to declaration of the facts of the gospel its purpose often in actual work the eagerest was to show the power of the gospel history of christ in due place yes history of all he did and how he died but then and often as i say with more animated imagination the showing of his risen presence in granting the harvests and guiding the labour of the year all sun and rain and length or decline of days received from his hand all joy and grief and strength or cessation of labour indulged or endured as in his sight and to his glory and the familiar employments of the seasons the homely toils of the peasant the lowliest skills of the craftsman are signed always on the stones of the church as the first and truest condition of sacrifice and offering  of these representations of human art under heavenly guidance the series of basreliefs which stud the base of this tower of giottos must be held certainly the chief in europe footnote for account of the series on the main archivolt of st marks see my sketch of the schools of venetian sculpture in third forthcoming number of st marks rest at first you may be surprised at the smallness of their scale in proportion to their masonry but this smallness of scale enabled the master workmen of the tower to execute them with their own hands and for the rest in the very finest architecture the decoration of most precious kind is usually thought of as a jewel and set with space round itas the jewels of a crown or the clasp of a girdle it is in general not possible for a great workman to carve himself a greatly conspicuous series of ornament nay even his energy fails him in design when the basrelief extends itself into incrustation or involves the treatment of great masses of stone if his own does not the spectators will it would be the work of a long summers day to examine the overloaded sculptures of the certosa of pavia and yet in the tired last hour you would be emptyhearted read but these inlaid jewels of giottos once with patient following and your hours study will give you strength for all your life so far as you can examine them of course on the spot but to know them thoroughly you must have their photographs the subdued colour of the old marble fortunately keeps the lights subdued so that the photograph may be made more tender in the shadows than is usual in its renderings of sculpture and there are few pieces of art which may now be so well known as these in quiet homes far away  we begin on the western side there are seven sculptures on the western southern and northern sides six on the eastern counting the lamb over the entrance door of the tower which divides the complete series into two groups of eighteen and eight itself between them being the introduction to the following eight you must count it as the first of the terminal group you then have the whole twentyseven sculptures divided into eighteen and nine  thus lettering the groups on each side for west south east and north we have                           w  s  e  n                          7  7  6  7  27 or                           w  s  e                          7  7  4      18 and                                   e  n                                  2  7  9  there is a very special reason for this division by nines but for convenience sake i shall number the whole from 1 to 27 straightforwardly and if you will have patience with me i should like to go round the tower once and again first observing the general meaning and connection of the subjects and then going back to examine the technical points in each and such minor specialties as it may be well at the first time to pass over  1 the series begins then on the west side with the creation of man it is not the beginning of the story of genesis but the simple assertion that god made us and breathed and still breathes into our nostrils the breath of life  this giotto tells you to believe as the beginning of all knowledge and all power footnote so also the masterbuilder of the ducal palace of venice see fors clavigera for june of this year this he tells you to believe as a thing which he himself knows  he will tell you nothing but what he does know  2 therefore though giovanna pisano and his fellow sculptors had given literally the taking of the rib out of adams side giotto merely gives the mythic expression of the truth he knowsthey two shall be one flesh  3 and though all the theologians and poets of his time would have expected if not demanded that his next assertion after that of the creation of man should be of the fall of man he asserts nothing of the kind he knows nothing of what man was what he is he knows best of living men at that hour and proceeds to say the next sculpture is of eve spinning and adam hewing the ground into clods not digging you cannot usually dig but in ground already dug the native earth you must hew  they are not clothed in skins what would have been the use of eve spinning if she could not weave they wear each one simple piece of drapery adams knotted behind him eves fastened around her neck with a rude brooch  above them are an oak and an appletree into the appletree a little bear is trying to climb  the meaning of which entire myth is as i read it that men and women must both eat their bread with toil that the first duty of man is to feed his family and the first duty of the woman to clothe it that the trees of the field are given us for strength and for delight and that the wild beasts of the field must have their share with us footnote the oak and apple boughs are placed with the same meaning by sandro botticelli in the lap of zipporah the figure of the bear is again represented by jacopo della quercia on the north door of the cathedral of florence i am not sure of its complete meaning  4 the fourth sculpture forming the centrepiece of the series on the west side is nomad pastoral life  jabal the father of such as dwell in tents and of such as have cattle lifts the curtain of his tent to look out upon his flock his dog watches it  5 jubal the father of all such as handle the harp and organ  that is to say stringed and wind instrumentsthe lyre and reed the first arts with the jew and greek of the shepherd david and shepherd apollo  giotto has given him the long level trumpet afterwards adopted so grandly in the sculptures of la robbia and donatello it is i think intended to be of wood as now the long swiss horn and a long and shorter tube are bound together  6 tubal cain the instructor of every artificer in brass and iron  giotto represents him as sitting fully robed turning a wedge of bronze on the anvil with extreme watchfulness  these last three sculptures observe represent the life of the race of cain of those who are wanderers and have no home nomad pastoral life nomad artistic life wandering willie yonder organ man whom you want to send the policeman after and the gipsy who is mending the old schoolmistresss kettle on the grass which the squire has wanted so long to take into his park from the roadside  7 then the last sculpture of the seven begins the story of the race of seth and of home life the father of it lying drunk under his trellised vine such the general image of civilized society in the abstract thinks giotto  with several other meanings universally known to the catholic world of that daytoo many to be spoken of here  the second side of the tower represents after this introduction the sciences and arts of civilized or home life  8 astronomy in nomad life you may serve yourself of the guidance of the stars but to know the laws of their nomadic life your own must be fixed  the astronomer with his sextant revolving on a fixed pivot looks up to the vault of the heavens and beholds their zodiac prescient of what else with optic glass the tuscan artist viewed at evening from the top of fésole  above the dome of heaven as yet unseen are the lord of the worlds and his angels today the dawn and the daystar tomorrow the daystar arising in the heart  9 defensive architecture the building of the watchtower the beginning of security in possession  10 pottery the making of pot cup and platter the first civilized furniture the means of heating liquid and serving drink and meat with decency and economy  11 riding the subduing of animals to domestic service  12 weaving the making of clothes with swiftness and in precision of structure by help of the loom  13 law revealed as directly from heaven  14 dædalus not icarus but the father trying the wings the conquest of the element of air  as the seventh subject of the first group introduced the arts of home after those of the savage wanderer this seventh of the second group introduces the arts of the missionary or civilized and giftbringing wanderer  15 the conquest of the sea the helmsman and two rowers rowing as venetians face to bow  16 the conquest of the earth hercules victor over antæus beneficent strength of civilization crushing the savageness of inhumanity  17 agriculture the oxen and plough  18 trade the cart and horses  19 and now the sculpture over the door of the tower the lamb of god expresses the law of sacrifice and door of ascent to heaven and then follow the fraternal arts of the christian world  20 geometry again the angle sculpture introductory to the following series we shall see presently why this science must be the foundation of the rest  21 sculpture  22 painting  23 grammar  24 arithmetic the laws of number weight and measures of capacity  25 music the laws of number weight or force and measure applied to sound  26 logic the laws of number and measure applied to thought  27 the invention of harmony  you see nowby taking first the great division of prechristian and christian arts marked by the door of the tower and then the divisions into four successive historical periods marked by its anglesthat you have a perfect plan of human civilization the first side is of the nomad life learning how to assert its supremacy over other wandering creatures herbs and beasts then the second side is the fixed home life developing race and country then the third side the human intercourse between stranger races then the fourth side the harmonious arts of all who are gathered into the fold of christ  now let us return to the first angle and examine piece by piece with care  1 creation of man  scarcely disengaged from the clods of the earth he opens his eyes to the face of christ like all the rest of the sculptures it is less the representation of a past fact than of a constant one it is the continual state of man of the earth yet seeing god  christ holds the book of his lawthe law of lifein his left hand  the trees of the garden above arecentral above christ palm immortal life above adam oak human life pear and fig and a largeleaved ground fruit what complete the myth of the food of life  as decorative sculpture these trees are especially to be noticed with those in the two next subjects and the noahs vine as differing in treatment from giottos foliage of which perfect examples are seen in 16 and 17 giottos branches are set in close sheaflike clusters and every mass disposed with extreme formality of radiation the leaves of these first on the contrary are arranged with careful concealment of their ornamental system so as to look inartificial this is done so studiously as to become by excess a little unnaturalnature herself is more decorative and formal in grouping but the occult design is very noble and every leaf modulated with loving dignified exactly right and sufficient finish not done to show skill nor with mean forgetfulness of main subject but in tender completion and harmony with it  look at the subdivisions of the palm leaves with your magnifying glass the others are less finished in this than in the next subject man himself incomplete the leaves that are created with him for his life must not be so  are not his fingers yet short growing  2 creation of woman  far in its essential qualities the transcendent sculpture of this subject ghibertis is only a dainty elaboration and beautification of it losing its solemnity and simplicity in a flutter of feminine grace the older sculptor thinks of the uses of womanhood and of its dangers and sins before he thinks of its beauty but were the arm not lost the quiet naturalness of this head and breast of eve and the bending grace of the submissive rendering of soul and body to perpetual guidance by the hand of christgrasping the arm note for full supportwould be felt to be far beyond ghibertis in beauty as in mythic truth  the line of her body joins with that of the serpentivy round the tree trunk above her a double mythof her fall and her support afterwards by her husbands strength thy desire shall be to thy husband the fruit of the treedoubleset filbert telling nevertheless the happy equality  the leaves in this piece are finished with consummate poetical care and precision above adam laurel a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband the filbert for the two together the fig for fruitful household joy under thy vine and figtree footnote compare fors clavigera february 1877but vine properly the masculine joy and the fruit taken by christ for type of all naturally growing food in his own hunger  examine with lens the ribbing of these leaves and the insertion on their stem of the three laurel leaves on extreme right and observe that in all cases the sculptor works the moulding with his own part of the design look how he breaks variously deeper into it beginning from the foot of christ and going up to the left into full depth above the shoulder  3 original labour  much poorer and intentionally so for the myth of the creation of humanity the sculptor uses his best strength and shows supremely the grace of womanhood but in representing the first peasant state of life makes the grace of woman by no means her conspicuous quality she even walks awkwardly some feebleness in foreshortening the foot also embarrassing the sculptor he knows its form perfectlybut its perspective not quite yet  the trees stiff and stuntedthey also needing culture their fruit dropping at present only into beasts mouths  4 jabal  if you have looked long enough and carefully enough at the three previous sculptures you cannot but feel that the hand here is utterly changed the drapery sweeps in broader softer but less true folds the handling is far more delicate exquisitely sensitive to gradation over broad surfacesscarcely using an incision of any depth but in outline studiously reserved in appliance of shadow as a thing precious and locallook at it above the puppys head and under the tent  this is assuredly painters work not mere sculptors i have no doubt whatever it is by the own hand of the shepherdboy of fésole cimabue had found him drawing more probably scratching with etrurian point one of his sheep upon a stone these on the central foundationstone of his tower he engraves looking back on the fields of life the time soon near for him to draw the curtains of his tent  i know no dog like this in method of drawing and in skill of giving the living form without one touch of chisel for hair or incision for eye except the dog barking at poverty in the great fresco of assisi  take the lens and look at every piece of the work from corner to cornernote especially as a thing which would only have been enjoyed by a painter and which all great painters do intensely enjoythe fringe of the tent footnote i think jabals tent is made of leather the relaxed intervals between the tentpegs show a curved ragged edge like leather near the ground mr caird the edge of the opening is still more characteristic i think and precise insertion of its point in the angle of the hexagon prepared for by the archaic masonry indicated in the oblique joint above footnote prints of these photographs which do not show the masonry all round the hexagon are quite valueless for study architect and painter thinking at once and doing as they thought  i gave a lecture to the eton boys a year or two ago on little more than the shepherds dog which is yet more wonderful in magnified scale of photograph the lecture is partly publishedsomewhere but i cant refer to it  5 jubal  still giottos though a little less delighted in but with exquisite introduction of the gothic of his own tower see the light surface sculpture of a mosaic design in the horizontal moulding  note also the painters freehand working of the complex mouldings of the tablealso resolvedly oblong not square see central flower  6 tubal cain  still giottos and entirely exquisite finished with no less care than the shepherd to mark the vitality of this art to humanity the spade and hoeits heraldic bearinghung on the hinged door footnote pointed out to me by mr caird who adds farther i saw a forge identical with this one at pelago the other daythe anvil resting on a treestump the same fire bellows and implements the door in two parts the upper part like a shutter and used for the exposition of finished work as a sign of the craft and i saw upon it the same finished work of the same shape as in the basreliefa spade and a hoe for subtlety of execution note the texture of wooden block under anvil and of its iron hoop  the workmans face is the best sermon on the dignity of labour yet spoken by thoughtful man liberal parliaments and fraternal reformers have nothing essential to say more  7 noah  andrea pisanos again more or less imitative of giottos work  8 astronomy  we have a new hand here altogether the hair and drapery bad the face expressive but blunt in cutting the small upper heads necessarily little more than blocked out on the small scale but not suggestive of grace in completion the minor detail worked with great mechanical precision but little feeling the lions head with leaves in its ears is quite ugly and by comparing the work of the small cusped arch at the bottom with giottos soft handling of the mouldings of his in 5 you may for ever know common masons work from fine gothic the zodiacal signs are quite hard and common in the method of basrelief but quaint enough in design capricorn aquarius and pisces on the broad heavenly belt taurus upside down gemini and cancer on the small globe  i think the whole a restoration of the original panel or else an inferior workmans rendering of giottos design which the next piece is with less question  9 building  the larger figure i am disposed finally to think represents civic power as in lorenzettis fresco at siena the extreme rudeness of the minor figures may be guarantee of their originality it is the smoothness of mass and hard edge work that make me suspect the 8th for a restoration  10 pottery  very grand with much painters feeling and fine mouldings again the tiled roof projecting in the shadow above protects the first ceramicushome i think the women are meant to be carrying some kind of wicker or reedbound watervessel the potters servant explains to them the extreme advantages of the new invention i cant make any conjecture about the author of this piece  11 riding  again andrea pisanos it seems to me compare the tossing up of the dress behind the shoulders in 3 and 2 the head is grand having nearly an athenian profile the loss of the horses foreleg prevents me from rightly judging of the entire action i must leave riders to say  12 weaving  andreas again and of extreme loveliness the stooping face of the woman at the loom is more like a leonardo drawing than sculpture the action of throwing the large shuttle and all the structure of the loom and its threads distinguishing rude or smooth surface are quite wonderful the figure on the right shows the use and grace of finely woven tissue under and upperthat over the bosom so delicate that the line of separation from the flesh of the neck is unseen  if you hide with your hand the carved masonry at the bottom the composition separates itself into two pieces one disagreeably rectangular the still more severely rectangular masonry throws out by contrast all that is curved and rounded in the loom and unites the whole composition that is its aesthetic function its historical one is to show that weaving is queens work not peasants for this is palace masonry  13 the giving of law  more strictly of the book of gods law the only one which can ultimately be obeyed footnote mr caird convinced me of the real meaning of this sculpture i had taken it for the giving of a book writing further of it as follows  all books rightly so called are books of law and all scripture is given by inspiration of god what we now mostly call a book the infinite reduplication and vibratory echo of a lie is not given but belched up out of volcanic clay by the inspiration of the devil on the bookgivers right hand the students in cell restrained by the lifted right hand  silent you till you know then perhaps you also  on the left the men of the world kneeling receive the gift  recommendable seal this for mr mudie  mr caird says the book is written law which is given by justice to the inferiors that they may know the laws regulating their relations to their superiorswho are also under the hand of law the vassal is protected by the accessibility of formularized law the superior is restrained by the right hand of power   the authorship of this is very embarrassing to me the face of the central figure is most noble and all the work good but not delicate it is like original work of the master whose design no 8 might be a restoration  14 dædalus  andrea pisano again the head superb founded on greek models feathers of wings wrought with extreme care but with no precision of arrangement or feeling how far intentional in awkwardness i cannot say but note the good mechanism of the whole plan with strong standing board for the feet  15 navigation  an intensely puzzling one coarse perhaps unfinished in work and done by a man who could not row the plaited bands used for rowlocks being pulled the wrong way right had the rowers been rowing englishwise but the water at the boats head shows its motion forwards the way the oarsmen look i cannot make out the action of the figure at the stern it ought to be steering with the stern oar  the water seems quite unfinished meant i suppose for surface and section of sea with slimy rock at the bottom but all stupid and inefficient  16 hercules and antæus  the earth power half hidden by the earth its hair and hand becoming roots the strength of its life passing through the ground into the oak tree with cercyon but first named plato laws book vii 796 antæus is the master of contest without usegreek philoneikias achrestouand is generally the power of pure selfishness and its various inflation to insolence and degradation to cowardicefinding its strength only in fall back to its earthhe is the master in a word of all such kind of persons as have been writing lately about the interests of england he is therefore the power invoked by dante to place virgil and him in the lowest circle of hellalcides whilom feltthat grapple straitened sore etc the antæus in the sculpture is very grand but the authorship puzzles me as of the next piece by the same hand i believe both giottos design  17 ploughing  the sword in its christian form magnificent the grandest expression of the power of man over the earth and its strongest creatures that i remember in early sculptureor for that matter in late it is the subduing of the bull which the sculptor thinks most of the plough though large is of wood and the handle slight but the pawing and bellowing labourer he has bound to ithere is victory  18 the chariot  the horse also subdued to draughtachilles chariot in its first and to be its last simplicity the face has probably been grandthe figure is so still andreas i think by the flying drapery  19 the lamb with the symbol of resurrection  over the door i am the doorby me if any man enter in etc put to the right of the tower you see fearlessly for the convenience of staircase ascent all external symmetry being subject with the great builders to interior use and then out of the rightly ordained infraction of formal law comes perfect beauty and when as here the spirit of heaven is working with the designer his thoughts are suggested in truer order by the concession to use after this sculpture comes the christian artsthose which necessarily imply the conviction of immortality astronomy without christianity only reaches as far asthou hast made him a little lower than the angelsand put all things under his feetchristianity says beyond thisknow ye not that we shall judge angels as also the lower creatures shall judge us footnote in the deep sense of this truth which underlies all the bright fantasy and humour of mr courthopes paradise of birds that rhyme of the risen spirit of aristophanes may well be read under the tower of giotto beside his watchdog of the fold the series of sculptures now beginning show the arts which can only be accomplished through belief in christ  20 geometry  not mathematics they have been implied long ago in astronomy and architecture but the due measuring of the earth and all that is on it actually done only by christian faithfirst inspiration of the great earthmeasurers your prince henry of spain your columbus your captain cook whose tomb with the bright artistic invention and religious tenderness which are so peculiarly the gifts of the nineteenth century we have just provided a fence for of old cannon openmouthed straight up towards heavenyour modern method of symbolizing the only appeal to heaven of which the nineteenth century has left itself capablethe voice of thy brothers blood crieth to meyour outworn cannon now silently agape but sonorous in the ears of angels with that appealfirst inspiration i say of these constant inspiration of all who set true landmarks and hold to them knowing their measure the devil interfering i observe lately in his own way with the geometry of yorkshire where the landed proprietors footnote i mean no accusation against any class probably the onefielded statesman is more eager for his little gain of fifty yards of grass than the squire for his bite and sup out of the gypsys part of the roadside but it is notable enough to the passing traveller to find himself shut into a narrow road between high stone dykes which he can neither see over nor climb over i always deliberately pitch them down myself wherever i need a gap instead of on a broad road between low grey walls with all the moor beyondand the power of leaping over when he chooses in innocent trespass for herb or view or splinter of grey rock when the neglected walls by the roadside tumble down benevolently repair the same with better stonework outside always of the fallen heapswhich the wall being thus built on what was the public road absorb themselves with help of moss and time into the heaving swells of the rocky fieldand behold gain of a couple of feetalong so much of the road as needs repairing operations  this then is the first of the christian sciences division of land rightly and the general law of measuring between wiselyheld compass points the type of mensuration circle in square on his desk i use for my first exercise in the laws of fésole  21 sculpture  the first piece of the closing series on the north side of the campanile of which some general points must be first noted before any special examination  the two initial ones sculpture and painting are by tradition the only ones attributed to giottos own hand the fifth song is known and recognizable in its magnificence to be by luca della robbia the remaining four are all of lucas schoollater work therefore all these five than any we have been hitherto examining entirely different in manner and with late flowerwork beneath them instead of our hitherto severe gothic arches and it becomes of course instantly a vital questiondid giotto die leaving the series incomplete only its subjects chosen and are these two basreliefs of sculpture and painting among his last works or was the series ever completed and these later basreliefs substituted for the earlier ones under lucas influence by way of conducting the whole to a grander close and making their order more representative of florentine art in its fulness of power  i must repeat once more and with greater insistence respecting sculpture than painting that i do not in the least set myself up for a critic of authenticitybut only of absolute goodness my readers may trust me to tell them what is well done or ill but by whom is quite a separate question needing for any certainty in this school of muchassociated masters and pupils extremest attention to minute particulars not at all bearing on my objects in teaching  of this closing group of sculptures then all i can tell you is that the fifth is a quite magnificent piece of work and recognizably to my extreme conviction luca della robbias that the last harmonia is also fine work that those attributed to giotto are fine in a different wayand the other three in reality the poorest pieces in the series though done with much more advanced sculptural dexterity  but i am chiefly puzzled by the two attributed to giotto because they are much coarser than those which seem to me so plainly his on the west side and slightly different in workmanshipwith much that is common to both however in the casting of drapery and mode of introduction of details the difference may be accounted for partly by haste or failing power partly by the artists less deep feeling of the importance of these merely symbolic figures as compared with those of the fathers of the arts but it is very notable and embarrassing notwithstanding complicated as it is with extreme resemblance in other particulars  you cannot compare the subjects on the tower itself but of my series of photographs take 6 and 21 and put them side by side  i need not dwell on the conditions of resemblance which are instantly visible but the difference in the treatment of the heads is incomprehensible that of the tubal cain is exquisitely finished and with a painters touch every lock of the hair laid with studied flow as in the most beautiful drawing in the sculpture it is struck out with ordinary tricks of rapid sculptor trade entirely unfinished and with offensively frank use of the drill hole to give picturesque rustication to the beard  next put 22 and 5 back to back you see again the resemblance in the earnestness of both figures in the unbroken arcs of their backs in the breaking of the octagon moulding by the pointed angles and here even also in the general conception of the heads but again in the one of painting the hair is struck with more vulgar indenting and drilling and the gothic of the picture frame is less precise in touch and later in style observe howeverand this may perhaps give us some definite hint for clearing the questiona pictureframe would be less precise in making and later in style properly than cusped arches to be put under the feet of the inventor of all musical sound by breath of man and if you will now compare finally the eager tilting of the workmans seat in 22 and 6 and the working of the wood in the painters low table for his pots of colour and his threelegged stool with that of tubal cains anvil block and the way in which the lines of the forge and upper triptych are in each composition used to set off the rounding of the head i believe you will have little hesitation in accepting my own view of the matternamely that the three pieces of the fathers of the arts were wrought with giottos extremest care for the most precious stones of his tower that also being a sculptor and painter he did the other two but with quite definite and wilful resolve that they should be as mere symbols of his own two trades wholly inferior to the other subjects of the patriarchs that he made the sculpture picturesque and bold as you see it is and showed all a sculptors tricks in the work of it and a sculptors greek subject bacchus for the model of it that he wrought the painting as the higher art with more care still keeping it subordinate to the primal subjects but showed for a lesson to all the generations of painters for evermorethis one lesson like his circle of pure line containing all othersyour soul and body must be all in every touch  i cant resist the expression of a little piece of personal exultation in noticing that he holds his pencil as i do myself no writing master and no effort at one time very steady for many months having ever cured me of that way of holding both pen and pencil between my fore and second finger the third and fourth resting the backs of them on my paper  as i finally arrange these notes for press i am further confirmed in my opinion by discovering little finishings in the two later pieces which i was not before aware of i beg the masters of high art and sublime generalization to take a good magnifying glass to the sculpture and look at the way giotto has cut the compasses the edges of the chisels and the keyhole of the lock of the toolbox   for the rest nothing could be more probable in the confused and perpetually false mass of florentine tradition than the preservation of the memory of giottos carving his own two trades and the forgetfulness or quite as likely ignorance of the part he took with andrea pisano in the initial sculptures   i now take up the series of subjects at the point where we broke off to trace their chain of philosophy to its close to geometry which gives to every man his possession of house and land succeed 21 sculpture and 22 painting the adornments of permanent habitation and then the great arts of education in a christian home first  23 grammar or more properly literature altogether of which we have already seen the ancient power in the spanish chapel series then  24 arithmetic central here as also in the spanish chapel for the same reasons here more impatiently asserting with both hands that two on the right you observeand two on the leftdo indeed and for ever make four keep your accounts you with your book of double entry on that principle and you will be safe in this world and the next in your stewards office but by no means so if you ever admit the usurers gospel of arithmetic that two and two make five   you see by the rich hem of his robe that the asserter of this economical first principle is a man well to do in the world  25 logic   the art of demonstration vulgarest of the whole series far too expressive of the mode in which argument is conducted by those who are not masters of its reins  26 song  the essential power of music in animal life orpheus the symbol of it all the inventor properly of music the law of kindness as dædalus of music the law of construction hence the orphic life is one of ideal mercy vegetarianplato laws book vi 782and he is named first after dædalus and in balance to him as head of the school of harmonists in book iii 677 steph look for the two singing birds clapping their wings in the tree above him then the five mystic beastsclosest to his feet the irredeemable boar then lion and bear tiger unicorn and fiery dragon closest to his head the flames of its mouth mingling with his breath as he sings the audient eagle alas has lost the beak and is only recognizable by his proud holding of himself the duck sleepily delighted after muddy dinner close to his shoulder is a true conquest hoopoe or indefinite bird of crested race behind of the other three no clear certainty the leafage throughout such as only luca could do and the whole consummate in skill and understanding  27 harmony  music of song in the full power of it meaning perfect education in all art of the muses and of civilized life the mystery of its concord is taken for the symbol of that of a perfect state one day doubtless of the perfect world so prophesies the last corner stone of the shepherds tower
