87193032	deep waters  by ww jacobs     husbandry  dealing with a man said the nightwatchman thoughtfully is as easy as a teetotaller walking along a nice wide pavement dealing with a woman is like the same teetotaller arter four or five whiskies trying to get up a step that aint there  if a man cant get is own way he eases is mind with a little nasty language and then forgets all about it if a woman cant get er own way she flies into a temper and reminds you of something you oughtnt to ha done ten years ago  wot a woman would do whose usband had never done anything wrong i cant think  i remember a young feller telling me about a row he ad with is wife once  he adnt been married long and he talked as if the way she carried on was unusual  fust of all he said she spoke to im in a cooing sort o voice and pulled his moustache then when he wouldnt give way she worked herself up into a temper and said things about is sister arter which she went out o the room and banged the door so hard it blew down a vase off the fireplace  four times she came back to tell im other things she ad thought of and then she got so upset she ad to go up to bed and lay down instead of getting his tea  when that didnt do no good she refused her food and when e took her up toast and tea she wouldnt look at it  said she wanted to die  he got quite uneasy till e came ome the next night and found the best part of a loaf o bread a quarter o butter and a couple o chops he ad got in for is supper had gorn and then when he said e was glad she ad got er appetite back she turned round and said that he grudged er the food she ate  and no woman ever owned up as ow she was wrong and the more you try and prove it to em the louder they talk about something else  i know wot im talking about because a woman made a mistake about me once and though she was proved to be in the wrong and it was years ago my missus shakes her ead about it to this day  it was about eight years arter i ad left off going to sea and took up nightwatching  a beautiful summer evening it was and i was sitting by the gate smoking a pipe till it should be time to light up when i noticed a woman who ad just passed turn back and stand staring at me ive ad that sort o thing before and i went on smoking and looking straight in front of me  fat middleaged woman she was wot ad lost her good looks and found others  she stood there staring and staring and by and by she tries a little cough  i got up very slow then and arter looking all round at the evening without seeing er i was just going to step inside and shut the wicket when she came closer  bill she ses in a choking sort o voice  bill  i gave her a look that made her catch er breath and i was just stepping through the wicket when she laid hold of my coat and tried to hold me back  do you know wot youre adoing of  i ses turning on her  oh bill dear she ses dont talk to me like that  do you want to break my art  arter all these years  she pulled out a dirtcoloured pocketankercher and stood there dabbing her eyes with it  one eye at a time she dabbed while she looked at me reproachful with the other  and arter eight dabs four to each eye she began to sob as if her art would break  go away i ses very slow  you cant stand making that noise outside my wharf  go away and give somebody else a treat  afore she could say anything the potman from the tiger a nasty ginger aired little chap that nobody liked come by and stopped to pat her on the back  there there dont take on mother he ses  wots he been adoing to you  you get off ome i ses losing my temper  wot dye mean trying to drag me into it  ive never seen the woman afore in my life  oh bill ses the woman sobbing louder than ever  oh oh oh  ow does she know your name then ses the little beast of a potman  i didnt answer him  i might have told im that theres about five million bills in england but i didnt  i stood there with my arms folded acrost my chest and looked at him superior  where ave you been all this long long time she ses between her sobs  why did you leave your happy ome and your children wot loved you  the potman let off a whistle that you could have eard acrost the river and as for me i thought i should ha dropped  to have a woman standing sobbing and taking my character away like that was amost more than i could bear  did he run away from you  ses the potman  yeyeyes she ses  he went off on a vyge to china over nine years ago and thats the last i saw of im till tonight  a lady friend o mine thought she reckernized im yesterday and told me  i shouldnt cry over im ses the potman shaking his ead he aint worth it  if i was you i should just give im a bang or two over the ead with my umberella and then give im in charge  i stepped inside the wicketbackwardsand then i slammed it in their faces and putting the key in my pocket walked up the wharf  i knew it was no good standing out there argufying  i felt sorry for the pore thing in a way  if she really thought i was her usband and she ad lost me  i put one or two things straight and then for the sake of distracting my mind i ad a word or two with the skipper of the john henry who was leaning against the side of his ship smoking  wots that tapping noise he ses all of a sudden  ark  i knew wot it was  it was the handle of that umberella ammering on the gate  i went cold all over and then when i thought that the potman was most likely encouraging er to do it i began to boil  somebody at the gate ses the skipper  aye aye i ses  i know all about it  i went on talking until at last the skipper asked me whether he was wandering in is mind or whether i was  the mate came up from the cabin just then and o course he ad to tell me there was somebody knocking at the gate  aint you going to open it  ses the skipper staring at me  let em ring i ses offhand  the words was ardly out of my mouth afore they did ring and if they ad been selling muffins they couldnt ha kept it up harder  and all the time the umberella was doing ratatat tats on the gate while a voice much too loud for the potmansstarted calling out watchman ahoy  theyre calling you bill ses the skipper  i aint deaf i ses very cold  well i wish i was ses the skipper  its fair making my ear ache why the blazes dont you do your dooty and open the gate  you mind your bisness and ill mind mine i ses  i know wot im doing  its just some silly fools aving a game with me and im not going to encourage em  game with you ses the skipper  aint they got anything better than that to play with  look ere if you dont open that gate i will  its nothing to do with you i ses  you look arter your ship and ill look arter my wharf  see  if you dont like the noise go down in the cabin and stick your ead in a biscuitbag  to my surprise he took the mate by the arm and went and i was just thinking wot a good thing it was to be a bit firm with people sometimes when they came back dressed up in their coats and bowlerhats and climbed on to the wharf  watchman ses the skipper in a hoitytoity sort o voice me and the mate is going as far as aldgate for a breath o fresh air  open the gate  i gave him a look that might ha melted a art of stone and all it done to im was to make im laugh  hurry up he ses  it amost seems to me that theres somebody ringing the bell and you can let them in same time as you let us out  is it the bell or is it my fancy joe  he ses turning to the mate  they marched on in front of me with their noses cocked in the air and all the time the noise at the gate got worse and worse  so far as i could make out there was quite a crowd outside and i stood there with the key in the lock trembling all over  then i unlocked it very careful and put my hand on the skippers arm  nip out quick i ses in a whisper  im in no hurry ses the skipper  here  halloa wots up  it was like opening the door at a theatre and the fust one through was that woman shoved behind by the potman  arter im came a carman two big ulking brewers draymen a little scrap of a woman with er bonnet cocked over one eye and a couple of dirty little boys  wot is it ses the skipper shutting the wicket behind em  a beanfeast  this lady wants her usband ses the potman pointing at me  he run away from her nine years ago and now he says he as never seen er before  he ought to be ung  bill ses the skipper shaking his silly ead at me  i can ardly believe it  its all a pack o silly lies i ses firing up  shes made a mistake  she made a mistake when she married you ses the thin little woman if i was in er shoes id take old of you and tear you limb from limb  i dont want to hurt im maam ses the other woman  i ony want him to come ome to me and my five  why hes never seen the youngest little annie  shes as like im as two peas  pore little devil ses the carman  look here i ses you clear off  all of you  ow dare you come on to my wharf  if you arent gone in two minutes ill give you all in charge  who to ses one of the draymen sticking his face into mine  you go ome to your wife and kids  go on now afore i put up my ands to you  thats the way to talk to im ses the potman nodding at em  they all began to talk to me then and tell me wot i was to do and wot they would do if i didnt  i couldnt get a word in edgeways  when i reminded the mate that when he was up in london e always passed himself off as a single man e wouldnt listen and when i asked the skipper whether is pore missus was blind he ony went on shouting at the top of is voice  it ony showed me ow anxious most people are that everybody else should be good  i thought they was never going to stop and if it adnt been for a fit of coughing i dont believe that the scraggy little woman could ha stopped  arter one o the draymen ad saved her life and spoilt er temper by patting er on the back with a hand the size of a leg o mutton the carman turned to me and told me to tell the truth if it choked me  i have told you the truth i ses  she ses im her usband and i say i aint  ows she going to prove it  why should you believe her and not me  shes got a truthful face ses the carman  look here ses the skipper speaking very slow ive got an idea wotll settle it praps  you get outside he ses turning sharp on the two little boys  one o the draymen elped em to go out and arf a minute arterwards a stone came over the gate and cut the potmans lip open  boys will be boys  now ses the skipper turning to the woman and smiling with conceitedness  had your usband got any marks on im  birthmark or moles or anything of that sort  im sure he is my usband ses the woman dabbing her eyes  yes yes ses the skipper but answer my question  if you can tell us any marks your usband had we can take bill down into my cabin and  youll do wot  i ses in a loud voice  you speak when youre spoke to ses the carman  its got nothing to do with you  no he aint got no birthmarks ses the woman speaking very slowand i could see she was afraid of making a mistake and losing mebut hes got tattoo marks  hes got a mermaid tattooed on im  where ses the skipper amost jumping  i eld my breath  five sailormen out of ten have been tattooed with mermaids and i was one of em  when she spoke agin i thought i should ha dropped  on is right arm she ses unless hes ad it rubbed off  you cant rub out tattoo marks ses the skipper  they all stood looking at me as if they was waiting for something  i folded my armstightand stared back at em  if you aint this ladys usband ses the skipper turning to me you can take off your coat and prove it  and if you dont well take it off for you ses the carman coming a bit closer  arter that things appened so quick i hardly knew whether i was standing on my cad or my heels  both i think  they was all on top o me at once and the next thing i can remember is sitting on the ground in my shirtsleeves listening to the potman who was making a fearful fuss because somebody ad bit his ear arf off  my coat was ripped up the back and one of the draymen was holding up my arm and showing them all the mermaid while the other struck matches so as they could see better  thats your usband right enough he ses to the woman  take im  praps shell carry im ome i ses very fierce and sarcastic  and we dont want none of your lip ses the carman who was in a bad temper because he ad got a fearful kick on the shin from somewhere  i got up very slow and began to put my coat on again and twice i ad to tell that silly woman that when i wanted her elp id let er know  then i eard slow heavy footsteps in the road outside and afore any of em could stop me i was calling for the police  i dont like policemen as a rule theyre too inquisitive but when the wicket was pushed open and i saw a face with a helmet on it peeping in i felt quite a liking for em  wots up  ses the policeman staring ard at my little party  they all started telling im at once and i should think if the potman showed him is ear once he showed it to im twenty times  he lost his temper and pushed it away at last and the potman gave a owl that set my teeth on edge  i waited till they was all finished and the policeman trying to get is hearing back and then i spoke up in a quiet way and told im to clear them all off of my wharf  theyre trespassing i ses all except the skipper and mate here they belong to a little washtub thats laying alongside and theyre both as armless as they look  its wonderful wot a uniform will do  the policeman just jerked his ead and said outside and the men went out like a flock of sheep  the ony man that said a word was the carman who was in such a hurry that e knocked his bad shin against my foot as e went by  the thin little woman was passed out by the policeman in the middle of a speech she was making and he was just going for the other when the skipper stopped im  this lady is coming on my ship he ses puffing out is chest  i looked at im and then i turned to the policeman  so long as she goes off my wharf i dont mind where she goes i ses  the skippers goingson ave got nothing to do with me  then she can foller him ome in the morning ses the skipper  good night watchman  him and the mate elped the silly old thing to the ship and arter i ad been round to the bears head and fetched a pint for the policeman i locked up and sat down to think things out and the more i thought the worse they seemed  ive eard people say that if you have a clear conscience nothing can hurt you  they didnt know my missus  i got up at last and walked on to the jetty and the woman wot was sitting on the deck of the john henry kept calling out bill like a sick baalamb crying for its ma  i went back and ad four pints at the bears head but it didnt seem to do me any good and at last i went and sat down in the office to wait for morning  it came at last a lovely morning with a beautiful sunrise and that woman sitting up wide awake waiting to foller me ome  when i opened the gate at six oclock she was there with the mate and the skipper waiting and when i left at five minutes past she was trotting along beside me  twice i stopped and spoke to er but it was no good  other people stopped too and i ad to move on agin and every step was bringing me nearer to my house and the missus  i turned into our street arter passing it three times and the first thing i saw was my missus standing on the doorstep aving a few words with the lady next door  then she appened to look up and see us just as that silly woman was trying to walk arminarm  twice i knocked her and away and then right afore my wife and the party next door she put her arm round my waist  by the time i got to the ouse my legs was trembling so i could hardly stand and when i got into the passage i ad to lean up against the wall for a bit  illustration right afore my wife and the party next door she put her arm round my waist  keep er out i ses  wot do you want  ses my missus trembling with passion  wot do you think youre doing  i want my usband bill ses the woman  my missus put her and to her throat and came in without a word and the woman follered er  if i hadnt kept my presence o mind and shut the door two or three more would ave come in too  i went into the kitchen about ten minutes arterwards to see ow they was getting on  besides which they was both calling for me  now then  ses my missus who was leaning up against the dresser with er arms folded wot ave you got to say for yourself walking in as bold as brass with this hussy  bill ses the woman did you hear wot she called me  she spoke to me like that afore my wife and in two minutes they was at it hammer and tongs  fust of all they spoke about each other and then my missus started speaking about me  shes got a better memory than most people because she can remember things that never appened and every time i coughed she turned on me like a tiger  and as for you she ses turning to the woman if you did marry im you should ha made sure that he adnt got a wife already  he married me fust ses the woman  when ses my wife  wot was the date  wot was the date you married im  ses the other one  they stood looking at each other like a couple o gamecocks and i could see as plain as a pikestaff ow frightened both of em was o losing me  look here  i ses at last to my missus talk sense  ow could i be married to er  when i was at sea i was at sea and when i was ashore i was with you  did you use to go down to the ship to see im off ses the woman  no ses my wife  id something better to do  neither did i ses the woman  praps thats where we both made a mistake  you get out of my ouse ses my missus very sudden  go on afore i put you out  not without my bill ses the woman  if you lay a finger on me ill scream the house down  you brought her ere ses my wife turning to me now you can take er away  i didnt bring er i ses  she follered me  well she can foller you agin she ses  go on she ses trembling all over  git out afore i start on you  i was in such a temper that i darent trust myself to stop  i just gave er one look and then i drew myself up and went out  alf the fools in our street was standing in front of the ouse umming like bees but i took no notice  i held my ead up and walked through them with that woman trailing arter me  i was in such a state of mind that i went on like a man in a dream  if it had ha been a dream i should ha pushed er under an omnibus but you cant do things like that in real life  penny for your thoughts bill she ses  i didnt answer her  why dont you speak to me  she ses  you dont know wot youre asking for i ses  i was hungry and sleepy and ow i was going to get through the day i couldnt think  i went into a pub and ad a couple o pints o stout and a crust o bread and cheese for brekfuss  i dont know wot she ad but when the barman tried to take for it out o my money i surprised im  we walked about till i was ready to drop  then we got to victoria park and i ad no sooner got on to the grass than i laid down and went straight off to sleep  it was two oclock when i woke and arter a couple o porkpies and a pint or two i sat on a seat in the park smoking while she kep dabbing er eyes agin and asking me to come ome  at five oclock i got up to go back to the wharf and taking no notice of er i walked into the street and jumped on a bus that was passing she jumped too and arter the conductor had elped er up off of er knees and taken her arms away from his waist im blest if he didnt turn on me and ask me why i adnt left her at ome  we got to the wharf just afore six  the john henry ad gorn but the skipper ad done all the arm he could afore he sailed and if i adnt kept my temper i should ha murdered arf a dozen of em  the woman wanted to come on to the wharf but i ad a word or two with one o the foremen who owed me arfadollar and he made that all right  we all ave our faults bill he ses as e went out and i suppose she was better looking once upon a time  i didnt answer im  i shut the wicket arter im quick and turned the key and then i went on with my work  for a long time everything was as quiet as the grave and then there came just one little pull at the bell five minutes arterwards there was another  i thought it was that woman but i ad to make sure  when it came the third time i crept up to the gate  halloa i ses  who is it  me darling ses a voice i reckernized as the potmans  your missus wants to come in and sit down  i could ear several people talking and it seemed to me there was quite a crowd out there and by and by that bell was going like mad  then people started kicking the gate and shouting but i took no notice until presently it left off all of a sudden and i eard a loud voice asking what it was all about  i suppose there was about fifty of em all telling it at once and then there was the sound of a fist on the gate  who is it  i ses  police ses the voice  i opened the wicket then and looked out  a couple o policemen was standing by the gate and arf the riffraff of wapping behind em  wots all this about ses one o the policemen  i shook my ead  ask me another i ses  your missus is causing a disturbance he ses  shes not my missus i ses shes a complete stranger to me  and causing a crowd to collect and refusing to go away ses the other policeman  thats your business i ses  its nothing to do with me  they talked to each other for a moment and then they spoke to the woman i didnt ear wot she said but i saw her shake her ead and amost direckly arterwards she was marching away between the two policemen with the crowd follering and advising er where to kick em  i was a bit worried at fustnot about herand then i began to think that praps it was the best thing that could have appened  i went ome in the morning with a load lifted off my mind but i adnt been in the ouse two seconds afore my missus started to put it on agin fust of all she asked me ow i dared to come into the ouse and then she wanted to know wot i meant by leaving her at ome and going out for the day with another woman  you told me to i ses  oh yes she ses trembling with temper  you always do wot i tell you dont you  always ave especially when its anything you like  she fetched a bucket o water and scrubbed the kitchen while i was having my brekfuss but i kept my eye on er and the moment she ad finished i did the perlite and emptied the bucket for er to prevent mistakes  i read about the case in the sunday paper and im thankful to say my name wasnt in it  all the magistrate done was to make er promise that she wouldnt do it again and then he let er go  i should ha felt more comfortable if he ad given er five years but as it turned out it didnt matter  her usband happened to read it and whether e was tired of living alone or whether he was excited by caring that she ad got a little general shop e went back to her  the fust i knew about it was they came round to the wharf to see me  he ad been a finelooking chap in is day and even then e was enough like me for me to see ow she ad made the mistake and all the time she was telling me ow it appened he was looking me up and down and sniffing  ave you got a cold  i ses at last  wots that got to do with you he ses  wot do you mean by walking out with my wife  thats what ive come to talk about  for a moment i thought that his bad luck ad turned is brain  youve got it wrong i ses as soon as i could speak  she walked out with me  cos she thought you was her usband he ses but you didnt think you was me did you  course i didnt i ses  then ow dare you walk out with er  he ses  look ere i ses  you get off ome as quick as you like  ive ad about enough of your family  go on hook it  afore i could put my ands up he it me hard in the mouth and the next moment we was at it as ard as we could go  nearly every time i hit im he wasnt there and every time e hit me i wished i hadnt ha been when i said i had ad enough e contradicted me and kept on but he got tired of it at last and arter telling me wot he would do if i ever walked is wife out agin they went off like a couple o lovebirds  by the time i got ome next morning my eyes was so swelled up i could ardly see and my nose wouldnt let me touch it  i was so done up i could ardly speak but i managed to tell my missus about it arter i had ad a cup o tea  judging by her face anybody might ha thought i was telling er something funny and when i ad finished she looks up at the ceiling and ses  i ope itll be a lesson to you she ses
