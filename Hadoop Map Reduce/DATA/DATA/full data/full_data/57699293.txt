57699293	the lonely island or the refuge of the mutineers by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the refuge of the mutineers  the mutiny  on a profoundly calm and most beautiful evening towards the end of the last century a ship lay becalmed on the fair bosom of the pacific ocean  although there was nothing piratical in the aspect of the shipif we except her gunsa few of the men who formed her crew might have been easily mistaken for roving buccaneers  there was a certain swagger in the gait of some and a sulky defiance on the brow of others which told powerfully of discontent from some cause or other and suggested the idea that the peaceful aspect of the sleeping sea was by no means reflected in the breasts of the men  they were all british seamen but displayed at that time none of the wellknown hearty offhand rollicking characteristics of the jacktar  it is natural for man to rejoice in sunshine  his sympathy with cats in this respect is profound and universal  not less deep and wide is his discord with the moles and bats  nevertheless there was scarcely a man on board of that ship on the evening in question who vouchsafed even a passing glance at a sunset which was marked by unwonted splendour  the vessel slowly rose and sank on a scarce perceptible oceanswell in the centre of a great circular field of liquid glass on whose undulations the sun gleamed in dazzling flashes and in whose depths were reflected the fantastic forms snowy lights and pearly shadows of cloudland  in ordinary circumstances such an evening might have raised the thoughts of ordinary men to their creator but the circumstances of the men on board of that vessel were not ordinaryvery much the reverse  no bill mccoy muttered one of the sailors who sat on the breach of a gun near the forecastle ive bin flogged twice for merely growlin which is an englishmans birthright an i wont stand it no longer  a pretty pass things has come to when a man maynt growl without tastin the cat but if captain bligh wont let me growl ill treat him to a roar thatll make him cock his ears an wink six times without speakin  the sailor who said this matthew quintal by name was a short thickset young man of twentyone or thereabouts with a forbidding aspect and a savage expression of face which was intensified at the moment by thoughts of recent wrongs  bill mccoy to whom he said it was much the same in size and appearance but a few years older and with a cynical expression of countenance  whether you growl or roar matt said mccoy with a lowtoned laugh id advise you to do it in the minor key else the captain will give you another taste of the cat  hes awful savage just now  you should have heard him abusin the officers this afternoon about his cocoanuts  so i should returned quintal  as ill luck would have it i was below at the time  they say he was pretty hard on mr christian  hard on him  i should think he was rejoined mccoy  why if mr christian had been one of the worst men in the ship instead of the best officer the capn could not have abused him worse  i heard and saw im with my own ears and eyes  the cocoanuts was lyin as it might be here between the guns and the capn he came on deck an said he missed some of his nuts  he went into a towerin rage right offin the old styleand sent for all the officers  when they came aft he says to them says he who stole my cocoanuts  of course they all said they didnt know and hadnt seen any of the people take em  then says the capn fiercer than ever you must have stole em yourselves for they couldnt have been taken away without your knowledge  so he questioned each officer separately  mr christian when he came to him answered i dont know sir who took the nuts but i hope you do not think me so mean as to be guilty of stealing yours  whereupon the capn he flared up like gunpowder  yes you hungry hound i do says he you must have stolen them from me or you would have been able to give a better account of them  that was pitchin into im pretty stiff said quintal with a grim smile  what said mr christian  he said nothin but he looked thunder  i saw him git as red as a turkey cock an bite his lips till the blood came  its my opinion messmate added mccoy in a lower tone that if capn bligh dont change his tone therell be  come come mate interrupted a voice behind him if you talk mutiny like that youll swing at the end o the yardarm some fine mornin  the sailor who joined the others and thus spoke was a short sturdy specimen of his class and much more like a hearty harebrained tar than his two comrades  he was about twentytwo years of age deeply pitted with smallpox and with a jovial carelessness of manner that had won for him the sobriquet of reckless jack  im not the only one that talks mutiny in this ship growled mccoy theres a lot of us whose backs have bin made to smart and whose grog has been stopped for nothin but spite john adams and you know it  yes i do know it returned adams sharply and i also know that theres justice to be had in england  weve got a good case against the captain so wed better wait till we get home rather than take the law into our own hands  i dont agree with you jack said quintal with much decision and i wonder to see you of all men show the white feather  adams turned away with a light laugh of contempt and the other two joined a group of their mates who were talking in low tones near the windlass  matthew quintal was not the only man on board who did not agree with the more moderate counsels of reckless jack alias john adams alias john smith for by each of those names was he known  on the quarterdeck as well as on the forecastle mutterings of deep indignation were heard  the vessel was the celebrated bounty which had been fitted up for the express purpose of proceeding to the island of otaheite now named tahiti in the pacific for plants of the breadfruit tree it being thought desirable to introduce that tree into the west india islands we may remark in passing that the transplantation was afterwards accomplished though it failed at this time  the bounty had been placed under the command of lieutenant bligh of the royal navy  her burden was about 215 tons  she had been fitted with every appliance and convenience for her special mission and had sailed from spithead on the 23rd december 1787  lieutenant bligh although an able and energetic seaman was of an angry tyrannical disposition  on the voyage out and afterwards at otaheite he had behaved so shamefully and with such unjustifiable severity both to officers and men that he was regarded by a large proportion of them with bitter hatred  it is painful to be obliged to write thus of one who rose to positions of honour in the service but the evidence led in open court coupled with blighs own writings and testimony from other quarters proves beyond a doubt that his conduct on board the bounty was not only dishonourable but absolutely brutal  when the islanders were asked at first the name of the island they replied otahiti which means it is tahiti hence the earlier form of the nameotaheite  it was after the bounty had taken in the breadfruit trees at otaheite and was advanced a short distance on the homeward voyage that the events we are about to narrate occurred  we have said that mutterings of deep discontent were heard on the quarterdeck  fletcher christian acting lieutenant or masters mate leaned over the bulwarks on that lovely evening and with compressed lips and frowning brows gazed down into the sea  the gorgeous clouds and their grand reflections had no beauty for him but a shark which swam lazily alongside showing a fin now and then above water seemed to afford him a species of savage satisfaction  yes he muttered if one of his legs were once within your ugly jaws wed have something like peace again after these months of torment  fletcher christian although what is called a highspirited youth was not quick to resent injury or insult  on the contrary he had borne with much forbearance the oftrepeated and coarse insolence of his superior  his natural expression was bright and his temperament sunny he possessed a powerful frame and commanding stature was agile and athletic and a favourite with officers and men  but blighs conduct had soured him  his countenance was now changed  the last insult about the cocoanuts delivered openly was more than he could bear  when greek meets greek then comes the tug of war  in this case the tug was tremendous the immediate results were disastrous and the ultimate issues amazing as will be seen in the sequel of our tale  to whom does your amiable wish refer asked a brotherofficer named stewart who came up just then and leaned over the bulwarks beside him  can you not guess said the other sternly  yes i can guess returned the midshipman gazing contemplatively at the sharks fin  but i say surely you dont really mean to carry out your mad intention of deserting  yes i do said christian with emphasis  ive been to the forecockpit several times today and seen the boatswain and carpenter both of whom have agreed to help me  ive had a plank rigged up with staves into a sort of raft on which i mean to take my chance  theres a bag all ready with some victuals in it and another with a few nails beads etcetera to propitiate the natives  young hayward is the only other officer besides yourself to whom i have revealed my intention like you he attempts to dissuade me but in vain  i shall go tonight  but where will you go to asked stewart  christian pointed to tofoa one of the friendly islands which was then in sight like a little black speck on the glowing sky where the sun had just disappeared  and how do you propose to escape him said the midshipman pointing significantly to the shark which at the moment gave a wriggle with its tail as if it understood the allusion and enjoyed it  ill take my chance of that said christian bitterly and with a countenance so haggard yet so fierce that his young companion felt alarmed  see here he added tearing open his vest and revealing within it a deep sealead suspended round his neck i had rather die than live in the torments of the last three weeks  if i fail to escape you see there will be no chance of taking me alive  better try to take the ship whispered a voice behind him  christian started and grew paler but did not turn his head to see who had spoken  the midshipman at his side had evidently not heard the whisper  i cannot help thinking you are wrong said stewart  we have only to bear it a little longer and then we shall have justice done to us in england  well would it have been for fletcher christian and well for all on board the bounty if he had taken the advice of his young friend but his spirit had been tried beyond its powers of enduranceat least so he thoughtand his mind was made up  what moral suasion failed to effect however the weather accomplished  it prevented his first intention from being carried out  while the shades of evening fell and deepened into a night of unusual magnificence the profound calm continued and the ship lay motionless on the sea  the people too kept moving quietly about the deck either induced thereto by the sweet influences around them or by some indefinable impression that a storm sometimes succeeds a calm as well in the moral as the material world  as the ship had no way through the water it was impossible for the rash youth to carry out his plan either during the first or middle watches  he was therefore compelled to give it up at least for that night and about halfpast three in the morning he lay down to rest a few minutes as he was to be called by stewart to relieve the watch at four oclock  he had barely fallen into a troubled slumber when he was awakened by stewart and rose at once to go on deck  he observed in passing that young hayward the mate of his watch had lain down to take a nap on the armchest  mr hallet the other midshipman of the watch had also gone to sleep somewhere for he was not to be seen  whether the seriously reprehensible conduct of these two officers roused his already excited spirit to an ungovernable pitch or their absence afforded a favourable opportunity we cannot tell but certain it is that fletcher christian opened his ear at that time to the voice of the tempter  better try to take the ship seemed burning in words of fire into his brain  quick to act as well as to conceive he looked lustily and earnestly at the men of his watch  the one who stood nearest him looking vacantly out upon the sea was matthew quintal  to him christian revealed his hastily adopted plan of seizing the ship and asked if he would join him  quintal was what men call a deep villain  he was quite ripe for mutiny but from some motive known only to himself he held back and expressed doubt as to the possibility of carrying out the plan  i did not expect to find cowardice in you said christian with a look of scornful indignation  it is not cowardice sir retorted quintal  i will join if others do  try some one else  try martin there for instance  isaac martin was a rawboned sallow sixfoot man of about thirty who had been undeservedly flogged by bligh  christian went to him at once and put the question will you join me in taking the ship  the very thing mr christian  im with you answered martin promptly  the eager readiness of this man at once decided quintal  christian then went to every man in his watch all of whom had received more or less harsh treatment from the captain and most of whom were more than willing to join the conspirators  those who hesitated whatever might have been their motives had not sufficient regard for their commander to warn him of his danger  perhaps the very suddenness of the proposal as well as fear of the mutineers induced them to remain silent  in passing along the deck christian encountered a man named william brown he was assistantbotanist or gardener to the expedition and having been very intimate with christian at once agreed to join him  although a slenderly made young man brown was full of vigour and resolution  we must look sharp said christian to him in that low eager whisper in which the conversation among the mutineers had hitherto been carried on  it will soon be daylight  you know the men as well as i do  go below and gain over those whom you feel sure of influencing  dont waste your time on the lukewarm or cowardly  away with you  here williams he added turning to another man who was already in the plot go below and send up the gunners mate i want him then call john adamsi feel sure that reckless jack will join but do it softly  no noise or excitement  in a few seconds john mills the gunners mate a stronglybuilt middleaged man came on deck and agreeing at once to join was sent to fetch the keys of the armchest from the armourer under pretence of getting out a musket to shoot a shark which was alongside  meanwhile john williams went to the hammock of john adams and roused him  i dont half like it said adams when he was sufficiently awake to understand the message of his mate  its all very true what you say williams the ship has been little better than a hell since we left spithead and captain bligh dont deserve much mercy but mutiny is wrong any way you look at it and ive got my doubts whether any circumstances can make it right  the reasoning of adams was good but his doubts were cleared away if not solved by the abrupt entrance of christian who went to the armchest just opposite adamss hammock and began to distribute arms to all the men who came for them  seeing this and fearing to be left on the weaker side adams rose armed himself with a cutlass and went on deck  the morning of the 28th of april was now beginning to dawn  before that the greater part of the ships company had been gained over and armed yet all this was done so quietly and with such firmness that the remainder of the crew were ignorant of what was going on  no doubt a few who might have given the alarm were afraid to do so  among those who were asleep was one deserving of special notice namely peter heywood a midshipman who was true as steel at heart but whose extreme youth and inexperience coupled with the surprise and alarm of being awakened to witness scenes of violence produced a condition of inaction which resulted in his being left and afterwards classed with the mutineers  shortly after five oclock the armed men streamed quietly up the forehatch and took possession of the deck  sentinels were placed below at the doors of the officers berths and above at the hatchways  then fletcher christian john adams matthew quintal william mccoy isaac martin and several others went aft armed with muskets bayonets and cutlasses  leaving martin in charge of the quarterdeck they descended to captain blighs cabin  the commander of the bounty all ignorant of the coming storm which his ungentlemanly and cruel conduct had raised was sleeping calmly in his berth  he was roughly awakened and bidden to rise  what is the reason of such violence he demanded addressing christian as they half forced him out of bed  silence sir said christian sternly you know the reason well enough  tie his hands lads  disregarding the order to be silent bligh shouted murder at the top of his voice  hold your tongue sir else youre a dead man said christian seizing him by the tied hands with a powerful grasp and holding a bayonet to his breast  of course no one responded to the captains cry the hatchways etcetera being guarded  they gave him no time to dress but hurried him on deck where amid much confusion and many abusive cries preparations were being made for getting out a boat for it was resolved to set bligh and his friends adrift  at first there was some disputing among the mutineers as to which boat should be given to them eventually the launch was decided on  hoist her out bosn  do it smartly and instantly or lookout for yourself  the order was given sternly for the boatswain was known to be friendly to bligh  he obeyed at once with the assistance of willing men who were only too glad to get rid of their tyrannical commander  now mr hayward and mr hallet get into the boat said christian who seemed to be torn with conflicting emotions  his tone and look were sufficient for those young midshipmen  they obeyed promptly  mr samuel the clerk and several more of the crew were then ordered into the boat  at this point captain bligh attempted to interfere  he demanded the intentions of the mutineers but was told to hold his tongue with threats of instant death if he did not obey  particular persons were then called on to go into the boat and some of these were allowed to collect twine canvas lines sails cordage and other things to take with them  they were also allowed an eightandtwenty gallon cask of water fifty pounds of bread a small quantity of rum and wine a quadrant and a compass  when all the men obnoxious to the mutineers were in the boat captain bligh was ordered into it  isaac martin had been placed as a guard over the captain and appeared to favour him as he enabled him to moisten his parched lips with a shaddock  for this he was removed and adams took his place  bligh looked round but no friendly eye met his  he had forfeited the regard of all on board though there were undoubtedly men there whose detestation of mutiny and whose sense of honour would have inclined them to aid him if they had not been overawed by the numbers and resolution of the mutineers  the master indeed had already made an attempt to rally some of the men round him but had failed and been sent to his cabin  he with the others was now in the boat  poor young peter heywood the middy looked on bewildered as if in a dream  he could not be said in any sense either by look or act to have taken part with the mutineers  at last he went below for some things intending to go in the boat but was ordered to remain below  so also it is thought was edward young another midshipman who did not make his appearance on deck at all during the progress of the mutiny  it was afterwards said that the leading seamen among the mutineers had purposely ordered these officers below and detained them with a view to their working the ship in the event of anything happening to christian  bligh now made a last appeal  ill give you my honour mr christian he said never to think of what has passed this day if you will desist  to cast us adrift here in an open boat is to consign us to destruction  think of my wife and family  no captain bligh replied christian sternly if you had any honour things had not come to this and if you had any regard for your wife and family you should have thought of them before and not behaved so much like a villain  it is too late  you have treated me like a dog all the voyage  come sir your officers and men are now in the boat and you must go with them  if you attempt resistance you shall be put to death  seeing that further appeal would be useless bligh allowed himself to be forced over the side  when in the boat his hands were untied  you will at least allow us arms to defend ourselves from the savages he said  firearms were refused but four cutlasses were ultimately allowed him  at this point isaac martin quietly descended into the boat but quintal pointing a musket at him threatened to shoot him if he did not return to the ship  he obeyed the order with reluctance and soon after the boat was cast adrift  the crew of the bounty at the time consisted of fortyfour souls all told  eighteen of these went adrift with the captain  the remaining twentyfive steered back to the sunny isles of the pacific    chapter two  records the duties and troubles of the mutineers  it is not our purpose to follow the fortunes of captain bligh  the mutineers in the bounty claim our undivided attention  as regards bligh it is sufficient to say that he performed one of the most remarkable boatvoyages on record  in an overloaded and open boat on the shortest allowance of provision compatible with existence through calm and tempest heat and cold exposed to the attacks of cannibals and to the reproaches of wornout and mutinous men he traversed 3618 miles of ocean in fortyone days and brought himself and his followers to land with the exception of one man who was killed by the natives  in this achievement he displayed those qualities of indomitable resolution and unflagging courage which ultimately raised him to high rank in the navy  but we leave him now to trace those incidents which result from the display of his other qualities ungovernable passion overbearing impetuosity and incomprehensible meanness  the first act of fletcher christian after taking command of the ship was to serve out a glass of grog all round  he then called a council of war in which the mutineers discussed the question what they should do  you see lads said christian it is absolutely certain that we shant be left among these islands in peace  whether bligh manages to get home or not the british government is sure to send out to see what has become of us  my notion is that we should bear away to the southard far out of the usual track of ships find out some uninhabited and suitable island and establish ourselves thereon  what without wives or sisters or mothers or grandmothers to say nothin o mothersinlaw to cook our victuals an look after our shirtbuttons said isaac martin who having been detained against his will had become lugubriously or recklessly facetious and was stimulated to a sort of fierce hilarity by his glass of rum  youre right martin said brown the assistant botanist we couldnt get along without wives so i vote that we go back to otaheite get married every man of us an ho for the south pole  the british cruisers would never find us there  there was a general laugh at this sally but gravity returned almost instantly to every face for they were in no humour just then for jesting  it is probable that each man began to realise the dreadful nature of his position as an outlaw whose life was forfeited to his country and who could never more hope to tread the shores of old england or look upon the faces of kindred or friends  in such circumstances men sometimes try to hide their true feelings under a veil of recklessness or forced mirth but seldom succeed in the attempt  no man in his senses would go back to otaheiteat least not to stay there said john adams gravely its the first place they will send to look for us  whats the odds growled one of the seamen  they wont look there for us for a long time to come unless capn bligh borrows a pair of wings from an albatross an goes home as the crow flies  at this point john mills the gunners mate a man of about forty cleared his throat and gave it as his opinion that they should not go back to otaheite but should leave the matter of their future destination in the hands of mr christian who was well able to guide them  this proposal was heartily backed by edward young midshipman a stout young fellow of twentytwo who was fond of christian but there were one or two dissentient voices among which were the little middy peter heywood his brotherofficer george stewart and james morrison the boatswains mate  these wished to return to otaheite but the counsel of the majority prevailed and christian ultimately steered for the island of toubouai which lay some five hundred miles to the south of otaheite  there he expected to be safe from pursuit and there it was resolved that the mutineers should take up their abode if the natives proved friendly  that night while the bounty was skimming gently over the starlit sea before a light breeze the three officers heywood stewart and young leaned over the weather side of the quarterdeck and held a whispered conversation  why did you vote for going back to otaheite heywood asked young  because it is to otaheite that they will send to look after us and i should like to be there to give myself up the instant a manofwar arrives and declare my innocence of the crime of mutiny  you are right heywood said stewart i too would like to give myself up the moment i get the chance  captain bligh knows that you and i had no hand in the mutiny and if he reaches england will clear us of so foul a stain  its a pity that those who voted for otaheite were not in the majority  thats all very well for you who were seen to go below to fetch your clothes and were detained against your will said young but it was not so with me  i was forcibly detained below  they would not allow me to go on deck at all until the launch had left so that it would go hard with me before a courtmartial  but the die is now cast and theres no help for it  although i took no part in the mutiny i wont risk falling into the hands of justice with such an unprincipled scoundrel as bligh to witness against me  my future fortunes now lie with fletcher christian  i cannot avoid my fate  young spoke sadly yet with some bitterness of tone like one who has made up his mind to face and endure the worst  on reaching the remote island of toubouai the mutineers were much impressed with its beauty  it seemed exceedingly fertile was wooded to the waters edge and surrounded by a coral reef with one opening through which a ship might enter  altogether it seemed a most suitable refuge but here they met with an insurmountable difficulty  on drawing near to the shore they saw hundreds of natives who armed with clubs and spears lined the beach blew their shellhorns and resolutely opposed the landing of the strangers  as all efforts to conciliate them were fruitless resort was had to cannon and musketry  of course the terrible thunder of the white mans artillery had its usual effect on the savages  they fled inland and the mutineers gained a footing on the island  but the natives continued their opposition so vigorously that this refuge proved to be the reverse of a place of rest  christian therefore changed his plan and reembarking in the bounty set sail for otaheite  on the way thither the mutineers disagreed among themselves  some of those who had been forcibly detained even began to plot the retaking of the ship but their intentions were discovered and prevented  on the 6th of june they reached their former anchorage in otaheite where the natives received them with much joy and some surprise but a story was trumped up to account for this sudden reappearance of the mutineers  christian however had not yet given up his intention of settling on the island of toubouai  he foresaw the doom that awaited him if he should remain at otaheite and resolved to return to the former island with a quantity of livestock  he began to barter with the friendly otaheitans and soon had as many hogs goats fowls cats and dogs as he required besides a bull and a cow which had been left there by captain cook  with these and several natives he sailed again for toubouai  arriving there in nine days he found that a change had come over the spirit of the natives  they were decidedly and unaccountably amiable  they not only permitted the white men to land but assisted them in warping the ship into a place of shelter as well as in landing provisions and stores  fletcher christian whatever his faults may have been seems to have had peaceful tendencies  he had not only secured the friendship of the otaheitans by his just and considerate treatment of them while engaged in barter but he now managed to conciliate some of the chiefs of toubouai  as a precaution however he set about building an entrenched fortress in the labours connected with which he took his full share of work with the men  while the building was in progress the natives despite the friendly chiefs threw off the mask of goodwill which had doubtless been put on for the purpose of getting the white men into their power  strong in overwhelming numbers they made frequent attacks on the mutineers which these latter being strong in arms successfully repelled  it soon became evident that warfare not peace was to be the lot of the residents on toubouai and finally it was agreed that the bounty should be got ready for sea and the whole party should return to otaheite  the resolution was soon carried into effect and the mutineers ere long found themselves once again drawing near to the island  as they approached it under full sail for the wind was light the men stood looking at it commenting on its beauty and the amiableness of its people but fletcher christian stood apart by himself with his back to the shore gazing in the opposite direction  edward young went up to him  if this breeze holds sir we shall soon be at anchor in our old quarters  the midshipman spoke in the respectful tone of one addressing his superior officer  indeed although christian had by his rash and desperate act of mutiny forfeited his position and lowered himself to a level with the worst of his associates he never lost their respect it is recorded that they styled him mister christian to the end  at anchor said christian in a tone of deepest despondency  ah edward young there is no anchorage for us now in this world  we may anchor in matavai bay tonight but it will only be to up anchor and off again in a few days  come come sir said young heartily dont give way to despondency you know we were driven to act as we did and it cant be helped now  we were driven  my poor fellow returned christian laying a hand on the midshipmans shoulder you had no part in this miserable business  it is i who have drawn you all into it butwell well as you say it cant be helped now  we must make the best of itgod help us  he spoke in a low soft tone of profound sadness and continued his wistful gaze over the stern of the bounty  presently he looked quickly round and taking youngs arm began to pace the deck while he spoke to him  as you say edward we shall anchor once more in matavai bay but i am firmly resolved not to remain there  im sorry to hear it sir said young for most of the men are as firmly resolved to stay and you know several of them are resolute not to say desperate characters  i am quite aware of that but i shall make a proposal to them which i think they will accept  i will first of all propose to leave otaheite for some safer place of refuge and when they object to that i will propose to divide the whole of the ships stores and property among us all landing that portion which belongs to those who elect to remain on the island and sailing away with the rest and with those who choose to follow my fortunes to seek a more distant and a safer home  that may perhaps suit them said young  suit them rejoined christian with a quick glance then you dont count yourself one of them  no returned the midshipman with a frank look i will follow you now sir to the end  how far i am guilty is a question that does not concern me at present  if the british government gets hold of me my fate is sealed  i am in the same boat with yourself mr christian and i mean to stick by it  there was a strange spasm on christians countenance as if of conflicting emotions while he grasped the youths hand and squeezed it  thank you edward thank you  go now and see the anchor cleared to let go  he descended quickly to the cabin while the unfortunate midshipman went forward to give the order  when the proposal just referred to was made the following day after landing at otaheite it was at once agreed to  peter heywood stewart morrison and others who had taken no active part in the mutiny were glad to have the prospect of being enabled sooner or later to make a voluntary surrender of themselves while the thoughtless and reckless among the men were well pleased to have done with uncertain wanderings and to be allowed to settle among their amiable native friends  preparations for instant departure were made by christian and those who chose to follow his lead  the contents of the bounty were landed and fairly divided then the vessel was got ready for her final voyage those who resolved to sail in her were as follows    fletcher christian formerly acting lieutenantage 24   edward young midshipmanage 22   john adams seamanage 22   william mccoy seamanage 25   matthew quintal seamanage 21   john williams seamanage 25   isaac martin seamanage 30   john mills gunners mateage 40   william brown botanists assistantage 27  all these had married native women of otaheite who agreed to forsake home and kindred and follow the fortunes of their white husbands  there were also six native men who consented to accompany them  their names were talaloo ohoo timoa nehow tetaheite and menalee  three of these had wives and one of the wives had a baby girl by a former husband  the european sailors named the infant sally  she was a round lightbrown embodiment of gleeful impudence and had barely reached the staggering age of infancy when taken on board the bounty to begin her strange career  thus the party consisted of twentyeight soulsnamely nine mutineers six native men twelve native women and the lightbrown baby  it was a pleasant bright morning in september 1790 when fletcher christian and his followers bade farewell to otaheite  for some time the breeze was light and the bounty hovered round the island as if loath to leave it  in the dusk of evening a boat put off from her pulled to the shore and christian landed alone near the house of a chief who had become the special friend of peter heywood and stewart with the two midshipmen he spent some time in earnest conversation  i could not leave you he said in conclusion without relieving my mind of all that i have just said about the mutiny because you are sure to be sent for and taken to england as soon as the intelligence of this sad affair reaches  i advise you to go off at once to the first ship that may appear and give yourselves up to the commander  such is our intention said heywood  right rejoined christian you are both innocent  no harm can come to you for you took no part in the mutiny  for me my fate is fixed i go to search for some remote and uninhabited island where i hope to spend the remainder of my days without seeing the face of any europeans except those who accompany me  it is a dreary thought lads to lose country and kindred and friends for ever by the act of one dark hour now remember heywood what i have told you to tell my friends  god knows i do not plead guiltless i am alone responsible for the mutiny and i exonerate all even my adherents from so much as suggesting it to me nevertheless there are some who love me in england to whom i would beg of you to relate the circumstances that i have told you  these may extenuate though they cannot justify the crime i have committed  i assure you most solemnly that almost up to the last i had no intention of doing more than making my own escape from the ship which the injustice and brutality of bligh had made a place of torment to me when you called me stewart to relieve the watch my brain seemed on fire and it was when i found the two officers both asleep who should have been on duty that i suddenly made up my mind to take the ship now concluded christian grasping the hands of the youths i must say farewell  i have done you grievous wrong  god forgive me and bless you  goodbye peter goodbye stewart goodbye  he turned abruptly stepped into his boat and was rowed out to sea  the young midshipmen with moistened eyes stood silently watching the boat until it reached the ship  then they saw the bounty steering away to the northward  before daylight was quite gone she had disappeared on the distant horizon  thus did fletcher christian and his comrades pass from the sight and ken of man and they were not heard of after that for more than twenty years  but you and i reader have a special privilege to follow up these mutineers  before doing so however let us note briefly what became of their comrades left on otaheite  these to the number of sixteen soon distributed themselves among the houses of their various friends and proceeded to make themselves quite at home  some of them however were not disposed to take up a permanent abode there  among these was the boatswains mate james morrison a man of superior mental power and energy who kept an interesting and graphic journal of events  see note he with the armourer cooper carpenters mate and others set to work to construct a small vessel in which they meant to sail to batavia whence they hoped to procure a passage to england  the natives opposed this at first but on being told that the vessel was only meant for pleasure trips round the island they ceased their opposition and watched with great wonder at the process of shipbuilding which was carried on industriously from day to day  during the progress of the work there was witnessed an interesting ceremony which according to custom was annually performed by the chief of the district and a vast concourse of natives  it shows how deeply the celebrated captain cook had gained the reverence and love of the people of otaheite  a picture of the circumnavigator which had been presented to the islanders by the captain of a merchant vessel was brought out with great ceremony and held up before the people who including their queen eddea paid homage to it  a ceremonial dance was also performed in its honour and a long oration was pronounced by a leading chief after which the portrait was returned to the care of an old man who was its appointed custodian  long and earnestly did the white men labour at their little ship and with equal if not superior earnestness did the natives flock from all parts of the island to see the wonderful work advance bringing supplies of provisions to the whites as a sort of payment for admission to the show  the vessel was completed and launched after months of toil but its sails of matting were found to be so untrustworthy that the plan of proceeding in it to batavia had to be given up  meanwhile two of the worst of the mutineers named thompson and churchill came to a tragical end  the former insulted a member of the family with whom he resided and was knocked down  he left them in high dudgeon and went to that part of the island where the vessel above referred to was being built  one day a canoe from a distant district touched there and the owner landed with his wife and family carrying his youngest child in his arms  thompson angrily ordered him to go away but the man did not obey the order whereupon thompson seized his musket and shot father and child with the same bullet  for this murder he was shunned with abhorrence by his comrades and obliged to go off to another part of the island accompanied by churchill  these two took up their abode with a chief who was a tayo or sworn friend of the latter  this chief died shortly afterwards leaving no children behind him and churchill being his tayo succeeded to his possessions and dignity according to the custom of the country  he did not however enjoy his new position long for thompson from jealousy or some other cause shot him  the natives were so incensed at this that they arose en masse and stoned thompson to death  while these events were occurring a messenger of retribution was speeding over the sea to otaheite  on the morning of 23rd march 1791 exactly sixteen months after the landing of the mutineers hms pandora captain edwards sailed into matavai bay  before she had anchored coleman the armourer swam off to her and peter heywood and stewart immediately followed and surrendered themselves  these and all the mutineers were immediately put in irons and thrown into a specially prepared prison on the quarterdeck named the pandoras box in which they were conveyed to england  we have not space to recount the stirring incidents of this remarkable and disastrous voyage and the subsequent trial of the mutineers  let it suffice to say that the pandora after spending three months in a fruitless search for the bounty was wrecked on the homeward voyage and a large number of the crew and some of the prisoners were drowned among whom was poor stewart the midshipman  the remainder of the crew were saved in the ships boats after performing a voyage which as to its length and the sufferings endured rivals that previously made by bligh  thereafter on reaching england the mutineers were tried by courtmartial some were honourably acquitted others were condemned to death but afterwards pardoned and ultimately only three were executed  among those who were condemned but afterwards pardoned as being unquestionably innocent was peter heywood whose admirable defence and correspondence with his family especially that between himself and his charming sister nessy form a most interesting feature in the records of the trial but all this must be passed over in silence while we resume the thread of our story    note  part of this journal is quoted in an excellent account of the mutineers of the bounty by lady belcher    chapter three  the lonely island sighted  it is pleasant to turn for a time from the dark doings of evil men to the contemplation of innocent infancy  we return to the bounty and solicit the readers attention to a plump brown ball which rolls about that vessels deck exhibiting a marked tendency to gravitate towards the lee scuppers  this brown ball is sally the otaheitan infant  although brown sallys face is extremely pretty by reason of the regularity of her little features the beauty of her little white teeth and the brilliancy of her large black eyes to say nothing of her luxuriant hair and the gleeful insolence of her sweet expression  we cannot say how many or rather how few months old the child is but as we have already remarked she is a staggerer  that is to say she has begun to assert the independence of her little brown legs and progresses even when on shore with all the uncertainty of a drunken woman  of course the ships motion does not tend to remedy this defect  sallys chief delight is wallowing  no matter what part of the ships deck she may select for her operationswhether the scuppers the quarterdeck or the forecastleshe lays her down straightway for a luxurious wallow  if the spot be dirty she wallows it clean if it be clean she wallows it dirty  this might seem an awkward habit to an english mother but it is a matter of supreme indifference to sallys mother who sits on a guncarriage plaiting a mat of cocoanut fibre for sally being naked requires little washing  a shower of rain or a dash of spray suffices to cleanse her when at sea  on shore she lives if we may say so more in the water than on the land  the day is fine and the breeze so light that it scarce ruffles the face of the great ocean though it manages to fill the topsails of the bounty causing her to glide quietly on  some of the mutineers are seated on the deck or bulwarks patching a canvas jacket or plaiting a grass hat  others are smoking contemplatively  john adams is winding up the logline with mccoy  edward young stands gazing through a telescope at something which he fancies is visible on the horizon and fletcher christian is down in the cabin poring over carterets account of his voyage in the pacific  there were goats on board  one of these having become a pet with the crew was allowed to walk at liberty and became a grand playmate for sally  besides the goats christian had taken care to procure a number of hogs and poultry from otaheite also a supply of young breadfruittrees and other vegetable products of the island wherewith to enrich his new home when he should find it  all the animals were confined in cribs and pens with the exception of sallys playmate  take care exclaimed john adams as he left the quarterdeck with his hands in his pockets your matell butt you overboard sal if you dont lookout  there was indeed some fear of such a catastrophe for the precocious infant had a tendency to scramble on any object which enabled her to look over the low bulwarks and the goat had a propensity to advance on its hind legs with a playful toss of its head and take its playmate by surprise in truth what between the forehatch the companionhatch and the low bulwarks it may be said that sally led a life of constant and imminent danger  she was frequently plucked by the men out of the very jaws of death and seemed to enjoy the fun  while attempting to avoid one of the goats playful assaults sally stumbled up against matthew quintal deranged the work on which he was engaged and caused him to prick his hand with a sailneedle at which william mccoy who was beside him laughed  get out o that you little nigger exclaimed quintal angrily giving the child a push with his foot which sent her rolling to the side of the ship where her head came in contact with an iron bolt  sally opened her mouth shut her eyes and howled  quintal had probably not intended to hurt the child but he expressed no regret  on the contrary seeing that she was not much injured he laughed in concert with mccoy  these two quintal and mccoy were emphatically the bad men of the party  they did not sympathise much if at all with human suffering certainly not with those whom they styled niggers but there was one witness of the act whose heart was as tender towards the natives as quintals was hard  if you ever dare to touch her so again said young striding up to quintal ill kick you into the pigsty  the midshipman seemed to be the last man on board whose natural disposition would lead him to utter such a threat and quintal was quite taken aback but as young was a powerful fellow perfectly capable of carrying his threat into execution and seemed moreover thoroughly roused the former thought it best to hold his tongue even though lugubrious isaac martin chuckled audibly and ohoo one of the natives who stood near displayed his fine teeth from ear to ear  lifting up sally with much tenderness young carried her to her mother who after a not very careful examination of the bruised head set her down on the deck where she immediately began to wallow as before rising on her brown little feet she staggered forward a few paces and then seated herself without bending her knees  from this position she rolled towards the starboard side of the ship and squeezed herself between a guncarriage and the bulwarks until she got into the porthole  thrusting her head over the edge of this she gazed at the ripples that rolled pleasantly from the side  this was paradise  the sun glittered on these ripples and sallys eyes glittered in sympathy a very gentle lurch of the ship soon after sent sally head foremost into the midst of the ripples  this event was nothing new to sally  in her otaheitan home her mother had been wont to take her out for a swim as british mothers take their offspring for a walk  frequently had that mother pitched sally off her shoulders and left her to wabble in the water as eagles are said to toss their eaglets into the air and leave them to flutter until failing strength renders aid advisable  no doubt when sally falling from such a height and turning so as to come flat on her back experienced a tingling slap upon her skin she felt disposed to shed a salt tear or two into the mighty ocean but when the smart passed away she took to wallowing in the water by way of making the most of her opportunities  both christian and young heard the plunge  the former leaped up the companion ladder the latter ran to the stern of the ship but before either could gain the side one of the otaheitan men who had witnessed the accident plunged into the sea and was soon close to sally  the playful creature after giving him a kick in the face consented to be placed on his shoulders  the ship of course was brought up to the wind and her topsails backed as quickly as possible but the swimmers were left a considerable distance astern before this was accomplished  no need to lower a boat remarked christian as he drew out the tubes of his telescope that fellow swims like a fish  so do all his countrymen said young  and the women and children too added john adams who was at the helm  shes tugging at the mans woolly head as if it were a door mat said christian laughing and i do believeyesthe little thing is now reaching roundand pulling his nose  look at them young  handing the glass to the midshipman he turned to inquire for the childs mother and to his astonishment found that brown lady sitting on the deck busy with her matmaking as unconcerned as if nothing unusual were going on  the fact was that sallys mother thought no more of sally falling into the sea than a white mother might of her child falling on its nosenot so much perhaps  she knew that the ship would wait to pick her up she also knew that sally was an expert swimmer for her age and that the man who had gone to her rescue was thoroughly able for the duty having like all the south sea islanders been accustomed from infancy to spend hours at a time in the water  in a few minutes he came alongside with sally sitting astride his neck holding on to both sides of his head and lifting her large eyes with a gaze of ecstasy to those who looked over the vessels side  she evidently regarded the adventure as one of the most charming that had up to that time gladdened her brief career  not only so but no sooner had she been hauled on board with her deliverer than she made straight for the porthole from which she had fallen and attempted to repeat the manoeuvre amid shouts of laughter from all who saw her  after that the various portholes had to be closed up and the precocious baby to be more carefully watched  i have come to the conclusion said christian to young as they paced the deck by moonlight that same night that it is better to settle on pitcairns island than on any of the marquesas group  it is farther out of the track of ships than any known island of the pacific and if carterets account of it be correct its precipitous sides will induce passersby to continue their voyage without stopping  if we find it and it should turn out to be suitable what then asked young  we shall land form a settlement and live and die there answered christian  a sad end to all our bright hopes and ambitions said young as if speaking to himself while he gazed far away on the rippling pathway made by the sun upon the sea  christian made no rejoinder  the subject was not a pleasant one to contemplate  he thought it best to confront the inevitable in silence  captain carteret the navigator who discovered the island and named it pitcairn after the young officer of his ship who was the first to see and report it had placed it on his chart no less than three degrees out of its true longitude  hence christian cruised about unsuccessfully in search of it for several weeks  at last when he was on the point of giving up the search in despair a solitary rock was descried in the far distance rising out of the ocean  there it is at last said christian with a sigh that seemed to indicate the removal of a great weight from his spirit  immediately every man in the ship hurried to the bow of the vessel and gazed with strangely mingled feelings on what was to be his future home even the natives men and women were roused to a feeling of interest by the evident excitement of the europeans and hastened to parts of the ship whence they could obtain a clear view  by degrees tongues began to loosen  its like a fortress with its high perpendicular cliffs remarked john adams  all the better for us said quintal well need some place thats difficult to get at and easy to defend if one o the kings ships should find us out  so we will laughed mccoy in gruff tones and its my notion that theres a natural barrier round that island which will go further to defend us agin the kings ships than anything that we could do  isnt that white line at the foot o the cliffs like a heavy surf boys  it looks like it answered john mills the gunners mate an wherever you find cliffs rising like high walls out o the sea you may be pretty sure the waters too deep for good anchorage  thats in our favour too returned quintal nothin like a heavy surf and bad anchorage to indooce ships to give us a wide berth  i hope said william brown the botanist that theres some vegetation on it  i dont see much as yet  aint it a strange thing remarked longlegged isaac martin in a more than usually sepulchral tone that landlubbers invariably shows a fund of ignorance when at sea even in regard to things they might be supposed to know somethin about  how have i shown ignorance just now asked brown with a smile for he was a goodhumoured man and could stand a great deal of chaffing  why how can you bein a gardener returned martin expect to see wegitation on the face of a perpindikler cliff  youre right martin but then you know there is generally an interior as well as a face to a cliffy island and one might expect to find vegetation there dont you see  thats trueto find it retorted martin but not to see it through tons of solid rock and from five or six miles out at sea  but what if theres niggers on it suggested adams who joined the party at this point  fight em of coorse said john williams  an drive em into the sea added quintal  ay the place aint big enough for more than one lot said mccoy  it dont seem more than four miles long or thereabouts  an order to shorten sail stopped the conversation at this point  it is too late to attempt a landing tonight said christian to young well dodge off and on till morning  the bounty was accordingly put about and her crew spent the remainder of the night in chatting or dreaming about their future home    chapter four  the island explored  a bright and pleasant morning forms a powerful antidote to the evils of a cheerless night  few of the mutineers slept soundly on the night of their arrival off pitcairn and their dreams of that island were more or less unpleasantly mingled with manacles and barred windows and men dangling from yardarms  the blessed sunshine dissipated all this rousing in the hearts of some feelings of hope and forgiveness in the breasts of others only those sensations of animal enjoyment which man shares in common with the brutes  lower away the boat there said fletcher christian coming on deck with a more cheerful air than he had worn since the day of the mutiny we shall row round the island and search for a landingplace  you will take charge mr young during my absence  put muskets and ammunition into the boat john adams the place may be inhabitedtheres no sayingand south sea savages are not a hospitable race as a rule  now then look sharp lads  in a few minutes adams martin mccoy brown and quintal were in the boat with two of the otaheitan men  wont you take cutlasses asked young looking over the side  well yes hand down halfadozen and dont go far from this end of the island mr young  just keep dodging off and on  ay ay sir said the middy touching his cap from the mere force of habit  shove off said christian seating himself at the helm  in a few minutes the boat was skimming over the calm water towards the shore while the bounty wearing round went slowly out to sea  as the boat neared the shore it soon became evident that it would be extremely difficult to effect a landing  nothing could be seen but high precipitous cliffs without any sign of a harbour or creek sufficiently large or safe to afford anchorage for the ship  worst of all the only spot that seemed to offer any prospect of a landingplace even for a boat was guarded by tremendous breakers that seemed to bid defiance to mans feeble powers  these great waves or rollers were not the result of storm or wind but of the mere oceanswell of the great pacific which undulates over her broad breast even when becalmed  no signs of the coming waves were visible more than a few hundred yards from the shore  there each roller gradually and silently arose when the undulating motion of the sea caught the bottom  a little farther in it assumed the form of a magnificent green wall of liquid glass which became more and more vast and perpendicular as it rolled on until it curled over and rushed with a mighty roar and a snowy crest towards the beach  there it dashed itself in tumultuous foam among the rocks  give way lads said christian sitting down after a prolonged gaze at this scene we may find a better spot farther on  as they proceeded they were received with wild and plaintive cries by innumerable seabirds whose homes were on the cliffs and who evidently resented this intrusion of strangers  shall we give em a shot sir asked mccoy laying his hand on a musket  no time enough for that replied christian shortly  they pulled right round the island without seeing a single spot more available for a landing than the place they had first approached  it was a very little bay with a small clump of six cocoanut trees near the waters edge on the right and a single cocoanut tree on the left about two hundred yards from the others  above these on a hill a little to the westward there was a grove of the same species  well have to try it sir said john adams looking at his leader inquiringly  were sure to capsize observed mccoy  no matter said christian we have at last reached home and im bound not to be baffled at the door  come ohoo you know something about beaching canoes in a surf there cant be much difference with a boat  get up in the bow and direct me how to steer  he spoke to one of the native in the imperfect jumble of otaheitan and english with which the white men had learned to communicate with the natives  ohoo understood and at once went to the bow of the boat the head of which was now directed towards a place in the cliffs where there seemed to be a small bay or creek  the native gave directions with his arms right or left and did not require to speak  christian steered with one of the oars instead of the rudder to give him more power over the boat  soon they began to feel the influence of the ingoing wave  it was a moment of intense anxiety  christian ordered the men to cease rowing ohoo made a sudden and violent indication with his left arm  christian obeyed  give a gentle pull boys he said  they rose as he spoke on the top of a wave so high that they could look down for a moment on the seething foam that raged between them and the beach and christian was about to order the men to pull hard when the native looked back and shook his head excitedly  they had not got sufficiently into the grasp of that wave they must wait for the next  back all shouted the steersman  the boat slid back into the trough of the sea while the wave went roaring inward  the succeeding wave was soon close astern  it seemed to curl over them threatening destruction but it lifted them instead on its high shoulders  there was a slight appearance of boiling on the surface of the moving billow as it caught them  it was about to break and the boat was fairly in its grasp  give way shouted christian in a sharp loud voice  a moment more and they were rushing grandly in on a mountain of snow with black rocks rising on either side  it was nervous work  a little to the right or a little to the left and their frail bark would have been dashed to pieces  as it was they were launched upon a strip of sand and gravel that lay at the foot of the towering cliffs  hurrah cried martin and brown in wild excitement as they leaped over the bow after the natives while christian adams quintal and mccoy went over the stern to prevent the boat being dragged back by the recoiling foam and pushed it high and dry on the beach  well done  here we are at last in bounty bay exclaimed christian with a look of satisfaction giving to the spot for the first time that name which it ever afterwards retained  make fast the painter there get your arms now boys and follow me  at the head of the bay there was a hill almost a cliff up which there wound something that had the appearance of a path or the almost dry bed of a watercourse  it was exceedingly steep but seemed the only route by which the interior of the island could be reached  up the tangled pass for about three hundred yards the explorers advanced in single file all except quintal who was left in charge of the boat  it looks very like a path that has been made by men said christian pausing to breathe and turning round when halfway up the height dont you think so brown  thus appealed to the botanist whose eyes had been enchained by the luxuriant and lovely herbage of the place stooped to inspect the path  it does look a little like it sir he replied with some caution but it also looks not unlike a watercourse  you see it is a little wet just hereabouts  isnt it  what think you isaac martin  i dont think nothin about it returned martin solemnly turning over the quid of tobacco that bulged his cheek but if i might ventur for to give an opinion i should say it dont much matter what it is one way or another  thats true isaac said christian with a short laugh as he resumed his march up the cliff  on the way they were shaded and kept pleasantly cool by the neighbouring precipices but on gaining the top they came into a blaze of sunshine and then became suddenly aware that they had discovered a perfect paradise  they stood on a tableland which was thickly covered with cocoanut trees  a quarter of a mile farther on lay a beautiful valley the slopes and mounds of which were clothed with trees and beautiful flowering herbage of various kinds in clumps and groves of picturesque form with open glades and little meadows between the whole being backed by a grand mountainrange which traversed the island and rose to a height of more than a thousand feet  it is heaven upon earth exclaimed brown as they began to push into the heart of the lovely scene  humph  its not all gold that glitters growled mccoy with a sarcastic smile  its pretty real nevertheless observed isaac martin i only hope there aint none o the rascally niggers livin here  christian said nothing but wandered on looking about him like one in a dream  besides cocoanut palms and other trees and shrubs there were banyantrees the branches of which dropped downwards to the earth and there took root and other large timbertrees and plantains bananas yams taroroots mulberry teeplant and other fruitbearing plants in great profusion  over this richly varied scene the eyes of william brown wandered in rapture  magnificent he exclaimed a perfect garden  rich enough soil eh said martin turning some of it up with the point of his shoe  rich enough ay couldnt be finer said brown  i should think from its deep red colour that it is chiefly decomposed lava  the island is evidently volcanic in its origin  i hope we shall find fresh water weve not seen much yet but its sure to be found somewhere for such magnificent vegetation could not exist without it  what have we here said christian stooping to pick up something  a stone implement of some kind like a spearhead i think  it seems to me that the island must have been inhabited once although it does not appear to be so now  after they had wandered about for some time examining the land and passing many a commentary both grave and humorous they turned to retrace their steps when brown who had gone on in advance was heard to cheer as he waved his hat above his head  he had discovered a spring  they all hastened towards the spot  it lay like a clear gem in the hollow of a rock a considerable distance up the mountain  it was unanimously named browns pool but it did not contain much water at the time  can we do better than dine here said isaac martin  theres lots o food around us  this was true for of the various fruits which grew wild in the island the cocoanut plantain and banana were to be had all the year round  brown had brought a small hatchet with him which enabled them to break open several cocoanuts whose hard outer husks would not have yielded easily to a claspknife  while they sat thus enjoying themselves beside browns pool a small lizard was observed to run over a rock near to them  it stopped for a moment to raise its little head and look at the visitors apparently with great surprise  a rat was also seen and chased without success by isaac martin  a small species of flycatcher of a whiteybrown colour was likewise observed and those creatures it was afterwards ascertained were the only living things to be found on the island with the exception of a variety of insects and the innumerable gulls already mentioned  here then said christian raising a piece of the cocoanut shell filled with water to his lips i drink to our health and happiness in our island home  there was a strange mingling of pathos with heartiness in his tone which did not fail to impress his companions who cheerfully responded to the toast  i only wish we had something stronger than water to drink it in said mccoy  better without strong drink remarked john adams who was naturally a temperate man  worse without it i think growled mccoy who was naturally contentious and quarrelsome dont it warm the heart and raise the spirits and strengthen the frame and  ay and clear the brain interrupted martin with one of his most lugubrious looks an steady the gait specially wen ones pretty far gone an beautify the expression ananclear the intleck an hic an genrly inintenshify sh powers hic of cconverzashun eh  martin was a pretty fair mimic and illustrated his meaning so well not only with his tongue but with his solemn countenance that the whole party burst into a laugh with the exception of mccoy who replied with the single word bosh  to which martin returned bam  just so said christian as he stooped to refill the cocoanut shell you may be said to have reduced that spirited question to an essence which is much beyond proof and closed it we will therefore return to the shore get on board as quickly as possible and make arrangements for anchoring in the bay  i doubt its too deep for anchoring remarked adams as they walked down the hill  well then we shall run the ship on shore said christian curtly for here we must remain  there is no other island that i know of in these regions  besides this one seems the very thing we want  it has wood and water in abundance fruits and roots of many kinds a splendid soil if we may believe our eyes to say nothing of browns opinion bad anchorage for ships great difficulty and some danger in landing even in fine weather and impossible to land at all i should think in bad beautiful little valleys and hills rugged mountains with passes so difficult that a few resolute men might defy a host and caves to which we might retreat and sell our lives dearly if hard pushed  what more could we wish for  in a short time they reached the little narrow strip of shingly beach where the boat had been left in charge of quintal  here they had to encounter the great difficulty of forcing their way through the surf which had borne them shoreward in such grand style  the chief danger lay in the liability of the boat to be caught by the bow turned broadside to the great tumbling billows and overturned  safety and success lay in keeping the boats bow straight endon to the seas and pulling hard  to accomplish this fletcher christian again took an oar to steer with in preference to the rudder  besides being the most powerful man of the party he was the best boatman and the most agile in his movements  steady now he said as the boat lay in the seething foam partially sheltered by a rock while the men sat with oars out ready for instant action  a bigger wave than usual had just hurled itself with a thunderous roar on the reverberating cliffs and the great sheet of foaming water had just reached that momentary pause which indicated the turningpoint previous to the backward rush when christian shouted  give way  the boat leaped out was kept endon by a powerful stroke of the steersman rushed on the backdraught as if down a cataract and met the succeeding billow fairly  the bow was thrown up so high that it seemed as if the boat were standing on end and must inevitably be thrown right over but the impetus given by the willing men forced her half through and half over the crest of the watery mountain  with a will boys with a will cried christian  another moment and they slid down the billows back into the trough between the seas  a few more energetic strokes carried them over the next wave  after that the danger was past and in less than halfanhour they were once more on board the bounty    chapter five  the landing of the livestock in bounty bay  preparations were now made for landing  the bay which they had discovered and was the only one on the island lay on its northern side  into it they succeeded in running the bounty and cast anchor soon the women with little sally were landed and sent up to the tableland above to make some sort of encampment under the charge of midshipman young  the ship was warped close up to the cliffs so close that she ran the end of her bowsprit against them and broke it off here there was a narrow ledge that seemed suitable for a landingplace night put a stop to their labours on board  while some lighted fires and encamped on the shore others remained in the ship to guard her and to be ready for the debarkation that was to take place in the morning  and a strange debarkation it was  it had been found that there was a rise of eight feet in the tide  this enabled christian to lay the ship in such a position that it was possible to extend several long planks from the bow to the beach  fortunately the weather was fine otherwise the landing would have been difficult if not disastrous  when all was complete the goats were collected and driven over the bow to the shore  the procession was headed by an old billygoat who looked supremely philosophical as he went slowly along the rough gangway  it minds one o pirates makin the crew of a merchantman walk the plank remarked john williams as he assisted to urge the unwilling flock along  quite like a menadgeree suggested mills  more like old noah comin out o the ark said williams on the top o mountmountwhat was its name  i forget  mount synee suggested quintal  not at all it was mount arrowroot said isaac martin with the air of an oracle  clear the way lads for the poultry shouted midshipman young  a tremendous cackling in rear rendered further orders inaudible as well as unnecessary while the men stood aside from the opening to the gangway of planks  a considerable number of fowls had been taken on board at otaheite and these besides being bewildered and uncertain as to the point to which they were being driven and the precise duty that was required of them were infected with the general obstinacy of the rest of the animal kingdom  at last however a splendid cock was persuaded to enter the gangway down which he ran and flew shrieking to the shore followed by the rest of his kindred  now for the hogs said quintal to whose domineering spirit the work was congenial  but the hogs were not to be managed as easily as the goats and fowls had been  with native obstinacy and amazing energy they refused to do what they were bid and shrieked defiance when force was attempted  the noise was further increased by the butting of a few goats and the cackling of some poultry which had got mixed up with them  first of all they declined to leave the enclosures out of which they had tried pertinaciously to escape all the voyage  by way of overcoming this difficulty christian ordered the enclosures to be torn down and the planks with which they had been formed were used as persuaders to urge the refractory creatures on  as each poke or slap produced a series of horrible yells it may be understood that the operation was accompanied with noise  at last some of the men losing patience rushed at the hogs seized them by ears and tails and forcibly dragged them to the gangway  mccoy and quintal distinguished themselves in this service hurling their animals on the planks with such violence that several of them fell over into the sea and swam towards the shore in the surf from which they were rescued by the otaheitan men who danced about in the water highly enjoying this part of their labour  a profound calm seemed to succeed a wild storm when the last of the unruly pigs had left the ship  weve got em all out at last said one of the men with a sigh wiping the perspiration from his forehead with his sleeve  bad luck to them growled another tying up a slight wound received in the conflict  weve done with the live stock anyhow and thats a comfort said a third  done with the live stock exclaimed martin  why the worst lot has yet to come  that must be yourself then martin my boy said brown  i wish it was brown retorted martin but youve forgotten the cats  so we have exclaimed everybody  and you may be sure theyll give us some trouble said christian come lets go at em at once  this estimate of the cats was fully justified by what followed  a considerable number of these useful creatures black white and grey had been brought from otaheite for the purpose of keeping down the rats with which many of the south sea islands are afflicted  during the voyage most of them had retired to the privacy of the hold where they found holes and corners about the cargo and came out only at night like evil spirits to pick up a precarious livelihood  during the recent conflict a few had found insecure refuge in holes and corners about the deck where yelling and fugitive pigs had convulsed them with horror and one a huge grey cat having taken madly to the rigging rushed out to the end of the foresailyard where it was immediately roused to frenzy by a flock of astonished gulls  now these cats had to be rummaged out of their retreats by violence in which work all the white men in the ship had to take part amid a chorus of awful skirling serpentlike fuffing ominous and deadly growling and generally hideous caterwauling that no pen however gifted could adequately describe  i see im cried mills with his head thrust down between a nailcask and a bundle of otaheitan roots  where from john adams who with heels and legs in the air and head and shoulders down somewhere about the keel was poking a long stick into total darkness  there right under you with a pair of eyes blazing like green lamps  a poke in the right direction caused a convulsion in the bowels of the cargo like a miniature earthquake  it was accompanied by a fearful yell  ive touched him at last said adams quietly  lookout there brown hes goin to scramble up the bulkhead  there goes another shouted martin whose head was so far down among the cargo that his voice had a muffled sound  there was no occasion to ask where this time for with a wild shriek a large black fellow left its retreat sprang up the hatchway and sought refuge in the rigging  at the same moment there came a sepulchral moan from a cat whose place of refuge was invaded by quintal  the moan was followed by a cry loud and deep that would have done credit to a mad baby  isnt it appalling to see creeturs so furious said adams solemnly as he drew his head and shoulders out of the depths  theyre fiendishly inclined no doubt said christian who stood hard by with a stick ready to expedite the process of ejection when a cat ventured to show itself  at last with infinite trouble the whole body of the enemy were routed from the hold and the hatches fastened down to prevent a return  but the end was not yet gained for the creatures had found various refuges on deck and some had taken to the rigging  come out o that cried martin making a poke at the big grey cat like a small tiger which had fled to the foretop  with a ferocious caterwaul and fuff the creature sprang down the shrouds on the opposite side as if it had been born and bred a sailor unfortunately it made a wild leap at a pendant rope in passing missed it and came down on the deck with a prodigious flop  only one of its nine lives apparently was damaged  with the other eight it rushed to the opening in the bow and soon gained the shore where it immediately sprang to the leafy head of a cocoanut palm  at the same moment a blackandwhite cat was sent flying in the same direction by young quintal indulging his savage nature caught one of the cats by the neck and tried to strangle it into subjection but received such punishment with teeth and claws that he was fain to fling it into the sea  it swam ashore emerged a melancholy drookit spectacle and dashed into the nearest underwood  thus one by one the cats were hunted out of the bounty and introduced to their future home  the last to give in was appropriately an enormous black tom which with deadly yellow eyes erect hair bristling tail curved back extended claws and flattened ears rushed fuffing and squealing from one refuge to another until at last giving way to the concentrated attack of the assembled crew it burst through the opening scurried down the gangway and went like a shot into the bushes a confirmed maniacif not worse    chapter six  settling down and exploration  the first few days were devoted by the mutineers to conveying ashore every article that was likely to prove useful  not only were chests boxes tools bedding culinary implements etcetera removed from the vessel but the planks that formed the bulkheads much of the cordage and all the loose spars and removable ironwork were carried ashore  in short the vessel was completely gutted  when this was finished a council was called to decide what should be done with the bounty herself for although christian was the acknowledged leader of the party he took no important step without consulting his comrades  you see it is useless he said to think of venturing again to sea in the bounty we are too shorthanded for that  besides we could not find a more suitable island than this  i therefore propose that we should burn the ship to prevent her being seen by any chance vessel that may pass this way  if she were observed men might be tempted to land and of course they would tell that we were here and his majesty would soon have a cruiser out in search of us  what say you  i say wait a bit and consider replied young  ditto said adams  some of the others thought with christian  quintal in particular who seemed to live in a chronic state of objection to being hanged was strong for destroying the vessel  eventually after a good deal of delay and much discussion the good ship bounty finished her career by being burned to the waters edge in bounty bay  this occurred on the 23rd january 1790  the lower part of the vessel which would not burn was towed out into deep water and sunk so that not a vestige of her remained  and now all was bustling activity  a spot some few hundred yards farther inland than that selected as their campingground on the day of arrival was fixed on as suitable for their permanent location  it was beautifully situated and pleasantly sheltered by trees through between the stems of which the sea was visible  to this spot everything was conveyed and several of the most powerful of the men began to clear the ground and fell the trees with axes  one morning soon after landing a party was organised to traverse the island and investigate its character and resources  as they were not yet quite sure that it was uninhabited this party was a strong one and well armed  it consisted of christian adams brown martin and four of the otaheitans  edward young stayed at the encampment with the remaining men and the women  in which direction shall we go asked christian appealing to brown  the botanist hesitated and glanced round him  if i might make so bold sir said isaac martin i would suggest that we go right up to the top o the mountains  theres nothin like a birdseye view for fillin the mind wi right notions o form an size an character  following this advice they traversed the lower ground which was found very prolific everywhere  then they ascended the undulating slopes of the mountainsides until they reached the rugged and bare rocks of the higher ground  on the way they found further and indisputable evidence of the island having been inhabited at some previous and probably long past era among these evidences were spearheads and axes of stone and several warlike weapons  hallo heres a circumstance exclaimed martin stopping in front of an object which lay on the ground  on closer examination the circumstance turned out to be an image made of a hard and coarse red stone  it is evidently an idol said christian and here are some smooth round stones resembling those used by the otaheitans in war  not far from the spot and in other places as they advanced the exploring party found heaps of stone chips as well as more images and tools  ive been thinking said brown turning for a moment to look down at the sea which now lay spread out far below them like a blue plain ive been thinking that the proof of people having been here long ago lies not only in these stones axes spears and images but also in the fact that we find the cocoanut trees bananas plantains breadfruittrees as well as yams and sweet potatoes grow chiefly in the sunny and sheltered parts of the island and gathered together as if they had been planted there  heres the best proof of all exclaimed martin who had a tendency to poke about with his long nose advanced as if scenting out things  they looked at the spot to which martin pointed and there saw a human skeleton in the last stage of decay with a large pearl shell under the skull  not faroff more human bones were discovered  thats proof positive said brown  now i wonder why these natives came here and why they went away  praps they didnt come but was bornd here suggested martin an mayhap they didnt go away at all but died here  true martin said adams and that shell reminds me of what captain bligh once told me that the natives o the gambier islands which must lie to windard o this have a custom of puttin a shell under the heads of the dead in this fashion  moreover he told me that these same gambier chaps long ago used to put the people they vanquished in war on rafts and turn em adrift to sink or swim or fetch what land they might  no doubt some of these people got drifted here  as he spoke the party emerged from a somewhat rugged pass close to the highest peak of the mountainranges  a few minutes scramble brought them to the summit whence they obtained a magnificent view of the entire circuit of the island  we have said that the peak is just over a thousand feet high  from this commanding position the pacific was seen with a boundless horizon all round  not a speck of land visible save the rocky isle on which they stood  not a sail to mark the vast expanse of water which from that height seemed perfectly flat and smooth though a steady breeze was blowing and the islet was fringed with a pure white ring of foam  not a cloud even to break the monotony of the clear sky and no sound to disturb the stillness of nature save the plaintive cries mellowed by distance of the myriads of seafowl which sailed round the cliffs or dipped into the water far below  solitude profound said christian in a low voice breaking the silence which had fallen on the party as they gazed slowly round them  just then a loud and hideous yell issued from apparently the bowels of the earth and rudely put to flight the feeling of profound solitude the cry although very loud had a strangely muffled sound and was repeated as if by an echo  the explorers looked in each others faces inquiringly and not without an expression of awe  strange said adams an it sounded very like some one in distress  it was observed suddenly that isaac martin was absent  but the voice was not like his said brown  the mysterious cry was repeated at the moment and christian ran quickly in the direction whence it seemed to come  as they neared a rugged mass of rocks which lay close to the peak on which they had been standing the cry lost much of its mystery and finally assumed the tones of martins voice  hallo hi murder help  o my leg  mr christian adams brown this way  help ho hi  what between the muffled sound and the echo martin created a noise that would have set his friends into fits of laughter if they had not been greatly alarmed  in a few seconds the party reached what seemed to be a dark hole out of which the poor mans left leg was seen protruding  christian and adams grasped it  brown and one of the otaheitans lent a hand and martin was quickly dragged out of danger and set on his legs  i say martin said brown anxiously sit down or youll bust every drop o blood in your body has gone to your head  no wonder gasped isaac if youd bin hangin by one fut half as long your blood would have blowed your head off altogether  there now sit down a minute and youll be all right said christian how did it happen  to this martin replied that it was simple enough  he had fallen a few yards behind and taking a wrong turn had come on a hole into which he looked  seeing something like a light at the bottom of it he stooped down to look further slipped on the rocks and went in head foremost but was arrested by his foot catching between two rocks and getting jammed  in this position he would soon have perished had not his comrades come to the rescue  with some curiosity they now proceeded to examine the hole  it turned out to be the entrance to a cave which opened towards the northern side of the island and from which a splendid sweep of the sea could be seen while in the immediate neighbourhood far down the precipices innumerable seabirds were seen like flakes of snow circling round the cliffs  a few of the inquisitive among these mounted to the giddy height of the caves seawardmouth and seemed to gaze in surprise at the unwonted sight of man  a most suitable cavern for a hermit or a monk said brown  more fit for a monkey said martin  not a bad place of refuge in case our retreat should be discovered observed christian  hm the mutineers retreat muttered john adams in a slightly bitter tone  a few resolute men continued christian taking no notice of the last remark could hold out here against a hundredat least while their ammunition lasted  he returned as he spoke to the caves landward entrance and clambered out with some difficulty followed by his companions  proceeding with their investigations they found that while a large part of the island was covered with rich soil bearing fruittrees and shrubs in abundance the remainder of it was mountainous rugged and barren  they also ascertained that although the place had been inhabited in times long past there seemed to be no inhabitants at that time to dispute their taking possession  satisfied with the result of their investigations they descended to their encampment on the tableland close to the heights above bounty bay  on drawing near to the clearing they heard the sound of voices raised as if in anger  its quintal and mccoy said adams i know the sound o their illnatured voices  presently the two men could be seen through the trees  quintal was sitting on a felled tree looking fiercely at mccoy who stood beside him  i tell you the baccy is mine said quintal  its nothin o the sort its mine answered mccoy snatching the coveted weed out of the others hand  quintal jumped up hit mccoy on the forehead and knocked him down  mccoy instantly rose hit quintal on the nose and tumbled him over the log on which he had been sitting  not much the worse quintal sprang to his feet and a furious setto would have immediately followed if the arrival of christian and his party had not prevented it  it was no easy matter to calm the ruffled spirits of the men who had treated each other so unceremoniously and there is no doubt the bad feeling would have been kept up about the tobacco in dispute if christian had not intervened  mccoy reiterated stoutly that the tobacco was his  you are wrong said christian quietly it belongs to quintal  i gave it to him this morning  as there was no getting over this mccoy returned the tobacco with a bad grace and christian was about to give the assembled party some good advice about not quarrelling when the mother of little sally appeared suddenly wringing her hands and exclaiming in her native tongue my child is lost my child is lost  as every one of the party even the roughest was fond of sally there was an eager and anxious chorus of questioning  where away did ee lose her asked mccoy but the poor mother could only wring her hands and cry lost lost  has she gone over the cliffs asked edward young who came up at the moment but the woman would say nothing but lost lost amid floods of tears  fortunately some of the other women who had been away collecting cocoanuts arrived just then and somewhat relieved the men by prevailing on the mother to explain that although she could not say positively her child had fallen over the cliffs or come by any other mishap sally had nevertheless disappeared early in the forenoon and that she had been searching for her ever since without success  the process of interrogation was conducted chiefly by isabella alias mainmast the wife of fletcher christian and susannah the wife of edward young and it was interesting to note how anxious were the native men talaloo timoa ohoo nehow tetaheite and menalee  they were evidently as concerned about the safety of the child as were the white men  now lads said christian after it was ascertained that the poor woman could give no information whatever we must search at once but we must go about it according to a fixed plan  i remember once reading of a general having got lost in a great swamp one evening with his staff  it was near the sea i think and the tide was making  he collected his officers and bade them radiate out from him in all directions each one in a straight line so as to make sure of at least one of them finding the right road out of the danger  we will do likewise  following out this plan the entire party scattered themselves into the bush each keeping in a straight line searching as he went and widening the field of search as his distance from the centre increased there was no time to lose for the shades of night had already begun to fall  anxiously did the poor mother and one or two of the other women sit in the clearing listening for the expected shout which should indicate success  for a long time no shout of any kind was heard though there was considerable noise when the searching party came upon the lairs of members of the livestock that had taken up their quarters in the bush  we will follow only the line of search which ended in success  it was pursued by christian himself  at first he came on spots where domestic fowls had taken up their abode  then while tramping through a mass of luxuriant ferns he trod on the toes of a slumbering hog which immediately set up a shriek comparable only to the brake of an illused locomotive  this uncalledfor disturbance roused and routed a considerable number of the same family which had taken refuge in the same locality  after that he came on a bevy of cats seated at respectful distances from each other in glaring and armed neutrality his sudden and evidently unexpected appearance scattered these to the four points of the compass  presently he came upon a pretty open spot of small size which was surrounded by shrubs and trees through the leafy branches of which the setting sun streamed in a thousand rays  one of these rays dazzled the eyes and another kissed the lips of a nannygoat  it was sallys pet lying down and dozing  beside it lay sally herself sound asleep with her pretty little face resting on its side and one of her little fat hands holding on to a lock of its white hair  with a loud shout christian proclaimed his success to the pitcairn world and picking up the still slumbering child carried her home in triumph to her mother    chapter seven  roasting foraging and fabricating  one morning john adams awoke from a pleasant dream and lay for some time on his back in that lazy halfconscious fashion in which some men love to lie on first awaking  the canopy above him was a leafy structure through which he could see the deep azure of the sky with its few clouds of fleecy white  around him were the rude huts of leaves and boughs which his comrades had constructed for themselves more or less tastefully and the lairs under bush and tree with which the otaheitan natives were content  just in front of his own hut was that of fletcher christian  it was more thoroughly built than the others being partly formed of planks and other woodwork saved from the bounty and was well thatched with the broad leaves of tropical plants  in front of the hut christians wife isabella was busily engaged digging a hole in the ground  she was the only member of the party astir that morning  i wonder why mainmast is up so early murmured adams rousing himself and using his elbow as a prop while he observed her  mainmast who was better known by that sobriquet than by the name which christian had given to her on his weddingday at otaheite was a very comely and naturally amiable creature graceful in form and although a socalled savage possessing an air of simple dignity and refinement which might almost be termed ladylike  indeed several of the other native wives of the mutineers were similar to mrs christian in these respects and despite their brown complexions were remarkably goodlooking  one or two however were commonplace enough especially the wives of the three married otaheitan men who seemed to be as no doubt they were of a lower social class than the others who had mingled with the best otaheitan society edward youngs wife for instance being a sort of native princessat least she was the daughter of a great chief  the dress of these women was simple like themselves and not ungraceful  it consisted of a short petticoat of tapa or native cloth reaching below the knees and a loose shawl or scarf of the same material thrown over the shoulders  after gazing a short time adams perceived what mainmast was about  she was preparing breakfast which consisted of a hog  it had been shot by christian the night before partly because it annoyed him with pertinacious grunting in the neighbourhood of his hut and partly because several families of hoglets having been born soon after their arrival on the island he could not be charged with extravagance in giving the people a treat of flesh once in a way  the process of cooking the hog was slow hence the early move  it was also peculiar therefore we shall describe it in detail in order that the enterprising housewives of england may try the plan if convenient  mainmasts first act was to kindle a large fire into which she put a number of goodlysized and rounded stones  while these were heating she dug a large hole in the ground with a broken shovel which was the only implement of husbandry possessed at that time by the community this hole was the oven  the bottom of it she covered with fresh plantain leaves  the stones having been heated were spread over the bottom of the hole and then covered with leaves  on this hotbed the carcass of the pig was placed and another layer of leaves spread over it  some more hot stones were placed above that over which green leaves were strewn in bunches and finally the whole was covered up with earth and rubbish piled up so as to keep in the heat  just as she had accomplished this mainmast was joined by mrs young susannah and mrs mccoy  goodmorning said mrs christian using the words of salutation which she had learned from the europeans  the hog will not be ready for a long time will you help me with the cakes  the women at once assented and set to work  they spoke to each other in the otaheitan tongue  to their husbands they spoke in a jumble of that tongue and english  for convenience we shall throughout our tale give their conversations in ordinary english  while mrs mccoy prepared some yams and sweet potatoes for baking mrs young compounded a cake of yams and plantains beaten up to be baked in leaves  mainmast also roasted some breadfruit  this celebrated fruitbut for which the bounty would never have been sent forth and the mutiny with its wonderful consequences would never have occurredgrows on a tree the size of a large appletree the leaves of which are of a very deep green  the fruit larger than an orange has a thick rind and if gathered before becoming ripe and baked in an oven the inside resembles the crumb of wheaten bread and is very palatable  it lasts in season about eight months of the year  while the culinary operations were going on the precocious sally awaking from her slumbers rose and staggered forth to survey the face of the newborn day  her little body was clothed in an admirably fitting garment of lightbrown skin the gift of nature  having yawned and rubbed her eyes she strayed towards the fire  mrs christian received her with an affable smile and presented her with a pannikin of cocoanut milk to keep her quiet  quaffing this beverage with evident delight she dropped the pannikin smacked her rosy lips and toddled off to seek adventures  her first act was to stand in front of isaac martins hut and gaze with a look not unmixed with awe at the long nose pointing to the sky from which sonorous sounds were issuing  it is said that familiarity breeds contempt  it was obvious that the awesome feeling passed from the infants mind as she gazed  under the impulse of a sudden inspiration she entered the hut went up to the nose and tweaked it  hallo shouted martin springing up and tumbling sally head over heels in the act  oh poor thing i havent hurt you have i  he caught the child in his arms and kissed her but sally seemed to care neither for the tumble nor the kisses  having been released she sallied from the hut in search of more adventures  martin meanwhile having been thoroughly aroused got up and went towards the fire  youre bright and early mainmast he said slowly filling his pipe  yes hog takes time to cook  hog is it eh  thatll be firstrate  got sauce for it  hog needs no sauce said mrs christian with a laugh  to say truth it required very little to arouse her merriment or that of her amiable sisterhood  when martin had lighted his pipe he stood gazing at the fire profoundly as if absorbed in meditation  presently he seized a fryingpan which lay on the ground and descended therewith by way of the steep cliffs to the sea  while he was gone one and another of the party came to the fire and began to chat or smoke or both according to fancy  ere long martin was seen slowly ascending the cliffs holding the fryingpan with great care  what have you got there asked one  oysters eh said another scrutinising the pan  more like jellyfish said young  what in all the world is it asked adams as the pan was put on the fire  youll see when it boils said martin  theres nothin in it at all but water said quintal somewhat contemptuously  well ive heerd of many a thing but never fried water remarked mccoy  i should think it indigestible said christian coming up at the moment  whether the natives understood the jest or not we cannot say but certain it is that all of them men and women burst into a fit of laughter at this in which they were joined by otaheitan sally from mere sympathy  well what is to be the order of the day asked christian turning to young  shall we proceed with our dwellings or divide the island into locations  i think answered the midshipman that some of us at least should set up the forge  i know that williamss fingers are tingling to grasp the sledgehammer and the sooner he goes at it too the better for were badly off for tools  if you dont require my services said brown ill go plant some breadfruits and other things at that sheltered spot we fell upon yesterday  i intend to finish the thatching of my hut said quintal in that offhand tone of independence and disregard of the wishes of others which was one of his characteristics  well there are plenty of us to do all the work said christian  let every man do what pleases himself  i would only ask for one or two volunteers to cut the watertanks i spoke of yesterday  the water we have discovered although a plentiful supply for present needs may run short or cease altogether if drought comes  so we must provide against a dry instead of a rainy day by cutting a tank or two in the solid rock to hold a reserve  adams and mills at once volunteered for this duty  other arrangements were soon made and they sat down to breakfast some using plates saved from the bounty others flat stones as substitutes while empty cocoanut shells served for drinkingcups  your water pancake should be done brown by this time said young as he sat down on the turf tailorwise  not quite but nearly returned martin as he stirred the furiouslyboiling contents of the fryingpan  in a few minutes more the sea water had boiled quite away leaving a white residuum which martin scraped carefully off into a cocoanut cup  you see boys he said setting down the salt thus procured i never could abide fresh meat without a pick o salt to give it a relish  it may be weakness perhaps but  being the weakness of an old salt interrupted christian its excusable  now boys fallto with a will  weve got plenty of work before us an cant afford to waste time  this exhortation was needless  the savoury smell of the roast pig when it had been carefully disentombed might have given appetite to a seasick man  they ate heartily and for some time in silence  the women however did not join in the feast at that time  it was the custom among the otaheitans that the men should eat first the women afterwards and the mutineers having become habituated to the custom did not see fit to change it  when the men had finished and discussed the days proceedings the remainder of the pig fruits and vegetables were consumed by the females among whom we are bound to state sally was the greatest gourmand  when pipes were finished and the digestion of healthy young men had been thus impaired as far as was possible in the circumstances the party went off in several groups about their various avocations  among other things removed from the bounty were a smiths anvil and bellows with various hammers files etcetera and a large quantity of ironwork and copper  one party therefore under young and williams the armourer busied themselves in setting up a forge near their settlement and preparing charcoal for the forge fire  another party under christian proceeded to some neighbouring rocks and there with sledgehammer and crowbars which they used as jumpers began the laborious task of boring the solid rock intending afterwards to blast and partly to cut it into large watertanks  quintal continued the thatching of his hut in which work his humble wife aided him effectively  brown proceeded with the planting operations which he had begun almost immediately after landing and the women busied themselves variously some in preparing the midday meal some in gathering fruits and roots for future use and others in improving the internal arrangements of their various huts or in clearing away the debris of the late feast  as for little sally she superintended generally the work of the home department and when she tired of that went further afield in search of adventures    chapter eight  division of the islandmoralisings misgivings and a great event  there was no difficulty in apportioning the new possessions to which the mutineers had served themselves heirs  in that freeandeasy mode in which men in power sometimes arrange matters for their own special behoof they divided the island into nine equal parts of which each appropriated one part  the six native men were not only ignored in this arrangement but they were soon given to understand by at least several of their captors that they were to be regarded as slaves and treated as such  it is however but just to edward young to say that he invariably treated the natives well and was much liked by them from which it is to be supposed that he did not quite fall in with the views of his associates although he made no objection to the unjust distribution of the land  john adams being an amiable and kindly man also treated the natives well and so did fletcher christian but the others were more or less tyrannical and those kindred spirits matthew quintal and william mccoy treated them with great severity sometimes with excessive cruelty  at first however things went well  the novelty and romance of their situation kept them all in good spirits  the necessity for constant activity in laying out their gardens clearing the land around the place of settlement and erecting good loghousesall this with fresh air and abundance of good food kept them in excellent health and spirits so that even the worst among them were for a time amiably disposed and it seemed as if those nine men had by their act of mutiny really introduced themselves into a terrestrial paradise  and so they had as far as nature was concerned but the seeds of evil in themselves began ere long to grow and bear fruit  the fear of the avenger in the form of a manofwar was constantly before their minds  we have said that the bounty had been burnt and her charred remnants sunk to remove all traces of their presence on the island  for the same end a fringe of trees was left standing on the seaward side of their clearing and no erection of any kind was allowed upon the seaward cliffs or inland heights  one afternoon christian who had been labouring in his garden threw down his tools and taking up the musket which he seldom left far from his hand betook himself to the hills  he was fond of going there and often spent many hours in solitary watching in the cave near the precipitous mountainpeak  on his way up he had to pass the hut of william mccoy  the others conforming to the natural tendency of mankind to congregate together had built their houses round the cleared space on the tableland above bounty bay from which central point they were wont to sally forth each morning to their farms or gardens which were scattered wide apart in separate valleys  mccoy however aspired to higher heights and grander solitudes  his dwelling a substantial loghut was perched upon a knoll overlooking the particular valley which he cultivated with the aid of his otaheitan wife and one of the native men  you are getting on well said christian to mccoy who was felling a tree when he came up to him  ay slowly but id get on a deal faster if that lazy brownskin ohoo would work harder  just look at him  he digs up that bit o ground as if he was paid by the number o minutes he took to do it  i had to give him a taste of a ropes end this morning but it dont seem to have done him much good  it didnt seem to do much good to you when you got it on board the bounty said christian gravely  praps not but were not on board the bounty now returned mccoy somewhat angrily  depend on it mccoy said christian softening his tone that the cat never made any man work well  it can only force a scoundrel to obedience nothing more  hm i blieve youre not far wrong sir returned the other resuming his work  giving a friendly nod to ohoo as he passed and a cheerful goodmorning to mrs mccoy who was busy inside the hut christian passed slowly on through the luxuriant herbage with which that part of the hillside was covered  at first he walked in the shade of manystemmed banyans and featherytopped palms while the leaves of tall and graceful ferns brushed his cheeks and numerous luxuriant flowering plants perfumed the air  then he came to a clump of bushes into which darted one of the goats that had by this time become almost wild  the goats rush disturbed a huge sow with a litter of quite new pigs the gruntings and squeakings of which gave liveliness to an otherwise quiet and peaceful scene  coming out on the shoulder of the mountain just above the woods he turned round to look back  it was a splendid panorama of tropical vegetation rounded knolls picturesque mounds green patches and rugged cliffs extending downwards to bounty bay with its fringe of surf and beyondall roundthe sleeping sea  two or three little brown sparrowlike birds twittered in the bushes near and looked askance as if they would question the mans right to walk there  one or two active lizards ran across his path pausing now and then and glancing upwards as if in great surprise  christian smiled sadly as he looked at them then turned to breast the hill  it was a rugged climb  towards the top where he diverged to the cave every step became more difficult  reaching the hole where isaac martin had come by his misadventure christian descended by means of a rude ladder which he had constructed and let down into it  entering the cave he rested his musket against the wall of rock and sat down on a ledge near the opening towards the sea  it was a giddy height  as he sat there with hands clasped over one knee and eyes fixed wistfully on the horizon his right foot thrust a little beyond the edge of the rock overhung a tremendous precipice many hundred feet deep  for a long time he gazed so steadfastly and remained so motionless as to seem a portion of the rock itself  then he heaved a sigh that relieved the pentup feelings of an overburdened soul  so early he muttered in a scarcely audible voice  at the very beginning of life just when hope health manhood and opportunity were at the flood  he stopped and again remained motionless for a long time  then continuing in the same low sad tone but without altering his position or his wistful gaze  and now an outlaw an outcast doomed if taken to a felons death comrades seduced to their ruin  the brand of cain not more terrible than mine  selfexiled for life  never never more to see friends country kindred sistersmother  god help me  he laid his face in his hands and groaned aloud  again he was silent and remained without motion for nearly an hour  can it be true he cried in a voice of suppressed agony looking up as if expecting an answer from heaven  shall i never never never awake from this hideous dream  the consciencesmitten young man laid strong constraint upon himself and became calmer  when the sun began to approach the horizon he rose and with an air of stern resolution set about making various arrangements in the cave  from the first fletcher christian had fixed on this cavern as a retreat in case his place of refuge should be discovered  his hope was that if a manofwar should come at last and search the island he and his comrades might escape detection in such a sequestered and wellconcealed cavern  if not they could hold out to the last and sell their lives dearly  already he had conveyed to it by degrees a considerable supply of ammunition some of the arms and a quantity of such provisions as would not readily spoil with time  among other things he carried to that elevated outlook carterets book of voyages and some other works which had formed the very small library of the bounty including a bible and a church of england prayerbook  when not gazing on the horizon expecting yet fearing the appearance of a sail he passed much of his time in reading  on the evening of which we write he had beguiled some time with carteret when a slight sound was heard outside the cavern  starting up with the nervous susceptibility induced by a guilty conscience he seized his musket and cocked it  as quickly he set it down again and smiled at his weakness  next moment he heard a voice shouting  it drew nearer  hallo sir  mr christian cried john adams stooping down at the entrance  come down adams come down theres no occasion to keep shouting up there  true sir but do you come up  youre wanted immediately  there was something in the mans voice which alarmed christian grasping his musket he sprang up the ladder and stood beside his comrade  well  itsits all right sir said adams panting with his exertions in climbing the hill itsits a boy  without a word of reply christian shouldered his weapon and hurried down the mountainside in the direction of home    chapter nine  sallys chief joysdark clouds overspread the pitcairn sky and darker deeds are done  just before john adams left the settlement for the purpose of calling christian whose retreat at the mountaintop was by that time wellknown to every one little sally had gone as was her wont to enjoy herself in her favourite playground  this was a spot close to the house of edward young where the debris of material saved from the bounty had been deposited  it formed a bristling pile of masts spars planks crosstrees oars anchors nails copperbolts sails and cordage  no material compound could have been more dangerous to childhood and nothing conceivable more attractive to sally  the way in which that pretty little nude infant disported herself on that pile was absolutely tremendous  she sprang over things as if she had been made expressly to fly  she tumbled off things as if she had been created to fall  she insinuated herself among anchorflukes and chains as if she had been born an eel  she rolled out from among the folds of sails as if she were a live dumpling  she seemed to dance upon upturned nails and to spike herself on bristling bolts but she never hurt herselfat least if she did she never cried except in exuberant glee  now it was while thus engaged one day that sally became suddenly conscious of a new sound  young as she was she was fully alive to the influence of a new sensation  she paused in an attitude of eager attention  the strange sound came from christians hut  sally waddled thither and looked in  the first thing that met her gaze was her own mother with a live creature in her hands which she was carefully wrapping up in a piece of cloth  it was a pitifully thin whiteybrown creature with a puckered face resembling that of a monkey but sally had never seen a monkey and probably did not think of the comparison presently the creature opened its mouth shut its eyes and uttered a painfully weak squall  cause and effect are not infrequently involved in mystery  we cannot tell why sally who never cried either when hurt or scolded should on beholding this sight set up a tremendous howl but she did and she kept up the howl with such vigour that john adams was attracted to the spot in some alarm  stopping only long enough to look at the infant and see that the mother was all right adams ran off at full speed to the mountaintop as we have seen to be the first to announce the joyful news to the father  thus came into the world the first descendant of the mutineers of the bounty  it was with unwonted animation that the men sat down to supper that evening each having congratulated christian and inquired at the hut for the baby and mother as he came in from work  what will you call him inquired young after pledging the new arrival in a cup of cocoanut milk  what day is it asked christian  thursday answered martin  then ill call him thursday said christian it will commemorate the day  youd better add october and commemorate the month said adams  so i will said christian  an stick on seventeenninety to commemorate the year suggested mills  no there are limits to everything returned christian three names are enough  come fill up your cups lads and drink to thursday october christian  with enthusiasm and a shout of laughter the toast was pledged in cocoanut milk and once again christians hand was shaken by his comrades all round  the advent of toc as adams called him or toc as he afterwards came to be styled was as it were the breaking of the ice  it was followed ere long by quite a crop of babies  in a few months more a matthew quintal was added to the roll  then a daniel mccoy furnished another voice in the chorus and sally ceased to disquiet herself because of that which had ceased to be a novelty  this all occurred in 1791  after that there was a pause for a brief period then in 1792 elizabeth mills burst upon the astonished gaze of her father and was followed immediately by another christian whom fletcher discarding his eccentric taste for days and months named charles  by this time sally had developed such a degree of matronly solicitude that she was absolutely intrusted at times with the care of the other children  in a special manner she devoted herself to little charlie christian who was a particularly sedate infant  indeed solemnity was stamped upon that childs visage from his birth  this seemed to harmonise intensely with sallys sense of fun  she was wont to take charlie away from his mother and set him up on a log or the rusty shank of the bountys best bower prop him up with sticks or bushesany rubbish that came to handand sit down in front of him to gaze  charlie after the first few months of precarious infancy became extremely fat  he used to open his solemn eyes as wide as was possible in the circumstances and return the gaze with interest  unable to restrain herself sally would then open her pretty mouth shut her gorgeous eyes and give vent to the richest peals of laughter  oh yous so good charlie  she had learned by that time to speak broken english in an infantine fashion and her assertion was absolutely true for charlie christian was preternaturally good  the same cannot be said of all the members of this little community ere long a period approached when the harmony which had hitherto prevailed was about to be broken  increasing life had marked their course hitherto  death now stepped in to claim his share  the wife of john williams went out one day to gather gulls eggs among the cliffs  the women were all in the habit of doing this at times and they had become expert climbers as were also the men both white and brown  when day began to close they wondered why mrs williams was so late of returning  soon her husband became uneasy then taking alarm he went off to search for her accompanied by all the men  the unfortunate woman was found dead at the base of the cliffs  she had missed her footing and fallen while searching for eggs  this accident had at first a deeply solemnising effect on the whole community  accustomed though these men were to the sight of death in some of its worst forms in war they were awed by this sudden and unexpected assault of the great enemy  the poor mangled body lying so quietly among the rocks at the foot of the awful precipice the sight of the husbands grief the sad and silent procession with the ghastly burden in the deepening gloom of evening the wailing of the women and the awestruck gaze of such of the children as were old enough to know that something terrible had occurred though unable to understand it all conspired to deepen the impression even on those among the men who were least easily impressed and it was with softened feelings of pity that quintal and mccoy volunteering their services on the occasion dug the first grave at pitcairn  time however soon wore away these feelings  williams not only got over his bereavement easily but soon began to wish for another wife it was of course impossible to obtain one righteously in the circumstances he therefore resolved to take the wife of talaloo the otaheitan  it must not be supposed that all williams comrades supported him in this wicked design  christian young and adams remonstrated with him strongly but he was obstinate and threatened to take the boat and leave the island if they interfered with him  as he was an expert blacksmith his comrades could not afford to lose him and ceased remonstrating  eventually he carried out his intention  this was as might have been expected the beginning of trouble  the coloured men made common cause of it and from that time forward began to plot the destruction of their white masters  what made matters worse was that talaloos wife was not averse to the change and from that time became a bitter enemy of her otaheitan husband  it was owing to this wicked womans preference for williams that the plot was afterwards revealed  one evening while sitting in christians house talaloos wife began to sing a sort of extempore song the chorus to which was    why does black man sharpen axe   to kill white man  hearing this christian who was close at hand entered the hut and demanded an explanation  on being informed of the plot of the otaheitan men to murder all the whites a dark frown overspread his face  hastily seizing his musket he loaded it but it was observed that he put no bullet in  the otaheitans were assembled at the time in a neighbouring house christian went straight to the house charged the men with their guilty intentions pointed his gun at them and pulled the trigger  the piece missed fire  before he could recock talaloo leaped through the doorway followed by his friend timoa and took shelter in the woods  the other four men begged for mercy said that the two who had just left were the instigators as well as ringleaders in the plot and promised to hunt them down and murder them if their own lives should be spared  as christian had probably no fixed intention to kill any of the men and his sudden anger soon abated he accepted their excuses and left them it was impossible however for the mutineers to feel confidence in the natives after that  the two men who had fled for refuge to the bush did not return to the settlement but remained in hiding  one day talaloos wife went with some of the other women to the southern side of the island to fish from the rocks  they were soon busily at work  the lines used had been made by themselves from the fibrous husk of the cocoanut  the hooks had been brought on shore from the bounty  chattering and laughing with the freeandeasy gaiety of savages they plied their workit seemed more like playwith varying success  suddenly the wife of talaloo heard a faint hiss behind her  turning her head she saw her former husband in the bushes  he beckoned to her and disappeared  none of the other women appeared to have heard or observed the man  presently talaloos wife rose and going into the woods joined her husband  she found him in company with timoa  is talaloo become a dog that he should be driven to live in the bush demanded the man with a stern air  the white men are strong answered his wife with a subdued look the women can do nothing  you can stay with me here in the bush if you will said talaloo  the white men are strong but we are stronger  we will kill the white men  he turned with an air of offended dignity and strode away  his wife meekly followed and timoa went with them  now there was one woman among the fishers whose eyes were sharp and her hearing was keen  this was susannah the wife of the midshipman edward young  she had followed talaloos wife saw what occurred and carried back a report to the settlement  a council of war was at once held  if we leave these men at liberty said williams we shall never again be able to go to rest in security  something must be done said christian with the air of a man whose mind wanders far away from the subject in hand  kill them suggested mccoy  yes said quintal i vote that we get up a grand hunt run them to earth and shoot them like dogs as they are  not so easy as you think to hunt down such men among these wild and wooded hills said young  besides it is only talaloo who has threatened us timoa is guiltless i think  ill tell you what well do lads well poison em said williams ive heard of such a thing bein done at otaheite by one of the women she knows how to get the poison from some sort of plant i believe and im pretty sure that menalee will help us  the plan thus suggested was finally adopted  one of the women made three puddings two of which were good the third was poisoned  menalee at once agreed to go to the fugitives say he had stolen the puddings and would be willing to share them  the two good puddings were to be given to talaloos wife and timoa the poisoned one to talaloo himself for further security menalee was to carry a pistol with him and use it if necessary  the assassin was not long in tracking out his countrymen  you bring us food said talaloo  yes i have stolen it  will you have some  they all accepted the puddings and timoa and the woman began to eat but talaloo was quick witted  he observed something unusual in menalees manner suspected poison and would not eat his pudding laying it aside he ate that of his wife along with her  menalee pretended not to notice this  after the others had done eating he proposed that they should all go a little farther up into the bushes where he said he had left his own wife among some breadfruit trees  talaloo agreeing to this they rose and walked away  the footpath being narrow they were obliged to go in single file  menalee walked behind talaloo  after having gone a few paces the former drew his pistol pointed it at the back of his countrymans head and pulled the trigger but it missed fire  talaloo hearing the click turned round saw the pistol and immediately fled but his enemy was swift of foot soon overtook him and the two grappled  a severe struggle ensued timoa and the woman standing by and looking on but rendering help to neither party  the two combatants were pretty well matched  the pistol had fallen at the first onset and for a few minutes it seemed doubtful which should prove the victor as they swayed to and fro straining their dark and sinewy forms in deadly conflict  at last the strength of talaloo seemed to give way but still he retained a vicelike grasp of his antagonists right wrist  wont you help me gasped talaloo turning an appealing glance on his wife  no cried menalee but she will help me to kill talaloo  the hardened woman picked up the pistol and going towards her husband struck him on the head  menalee quickly finished with his knife what the murderess had begun  for a few minutes the three stood looking at the murdered man in silence when they returned to the settlement and told what they had done  but the assassins work was not yet over  another of the natives named ohoo had fled to the woods threatening vengeance against the white men  it was deemed necessary that he too should be killed and menalee was again found to be a willing instrument  timoa who had exhibited such callous indifference at the murder of talaloo was his fitting companion  they soon found ohoo and succeeded in killing him  strange to say the mutineers after these foul deeds dwelt for a long time in comparative peace and harmony  it seemed as if their worst feelings had found full vent and been expended in the double murder  no doubt this state of hollow peace was partly owing to the fact that the native men now being reduced to four in number felt themselves to be unable to cope with their masters and quietly submitted to the inevitable  but by degrees the evil spirits in some of the party began to reassert their power  mccoy and quintal in particular became very savage and cruel  they never hesitated to flog or knock down a native on the slightest pretext insomuch that these unhappy men were again driven to plot the destruction of their masters  adams christian and young were free from the stain of wanton cruelty  young in particular was kind to the natives and a favourite both with men and women    chapter ten  dangers joys trials and multiplication  im going to the cliffs today williams said young one morning will you come  williams was busy at the forge under the pleasant shade of the great banyantree  resting his hammer on the anvil he looked up  no he answered  i cant go till ive finished this spade  its the last bit of iron we have left thatll serve for such a purpose  thats no reason why you should not let it lie till the afternoon or tomorrow  true but ive got another reason for pushing through with it  isaac martin says the want of a spade keeps him idle and you know its a pity to encourage idleness in a lazy fellow  you are right  what is martin about just now  working at the big watertank  it suits him a heavy quiet sort of job with the pick requiring no energy or thoughtonly a sleepy sort o perseverance of which longlegged isaac has plenty  come now returned young with a laugh  i see you are getting jealous of martins superior intellect  but where are quintal and mccoy  diggin in their gardens i suppose  leastwise i heerd mr christian say to mainmast hed seen em go off in that direction  mr christian himself has gone to his old outlook aloft on the mountains  if he dont see a sail at last it wont be for want o keepin a bright lookout  the armourer smiled grimly as he thrust the edge of the halfformed spade into the fire and began to blow his bellows  youve got them to work again said young referring to the bellows which had belonged to the bounty  ay patched em up after a fashion though theres a good deal o windage somewheres  if them rats git hold of em again the blacksmiths occupationll be gone  here comes bill brown praps he wont object to go birdnestin with ee  the armourer drew the glowing metal from the fire as he spoke and sent the bright sparks flying up into the leaves of the banyantree while the botanist approached  ill go with all my heart said brown on being invited by young to accompany him  wed better take nehow with us  he is the best cliffman among the natives  thats just what i thought of doing said young andah here comes some one else who will be glad to go  the midshipmans tone and manner changed suddenly as he held out both hands by way of invitation to sally who came skipping forward and ran gleefully towards him  sally was no longer the nude cherub which had landed on the island  she had not only attained to maturer years but was precocious both in body and mindhad as we have shown become matronly in her ideas and actions and was clothed in a short petticoat of native cloth and a little scarf of the same her pretty little head being decorated with a wreath of flowers culled and constructed by herself  no i cant go answered sally to youngs invitation with a solemn shake of her head  why not  cause is got to look arter babby  up to this period sally had shown a decided preference for the ungrammatical language of the seamen though she associated freely with young and christian  perhaps her particular fondness for john adams may have had something to do with this  which baby sall  you know your family is a pretty large one  yes theres a stunnin lot of emamost too many for me but i said the babby  oh i suppose you mean charlie christian  in coorse i means challie replied the child with a smile that displayed a dazzling set of teeth the sparkle of which was only equalled by that of her eyes  well but you can bring charlie along with you said young and ill engage to carry him and you too if you get tired  there run away find him and fetch him quick  little sall went off like the wind and soon returned with the redoubtable charles in her arms  it was all she could do to stagger under the load but charlie christian had not yet attained to facility in walking  he was still in the nude stage of childhood and his faithful nurse being afraid lest he should get badly scratched if dragged at a rapid pace through the bushes had carried him  submitting according to custom in solemn and resigned surprise charlie was soon seated on the shoulders of our midshipman who led the way to the cliffs  william brown followed leading sally by the hand for she refused to be carried and nehow brought up the rear  the cliffs to which their steps were directed were not more than an hours walk from the settlement at bounty bay though for sallys sake the time occupied in going was about halfanhour longer  it was a wild spot which had been selected  the towering walls of rock were rugged with ledges spurs and indentations where seabirds in myriads gave life to the scene and awakened millions of echoes to their plaintive cries  there was a pleasant appearance of sociability about the birds which was powerfully attractive  even nehow accustomed as he was to such scenes appeared to be impressed  the middy and the botanist were excited  as for sally she was in ecstasies and the baby seemed lost in the profoundest fit of wonder he had experienced since the day of his birth  oh challie exclaimed his nurse in a burst of laughter what a face yous got  jis like de figread o the bounty  sall quoted here aint they bootiful birds  she effectually prevented reply even if such had been intended by suddenly seizing her little charge round the neck and kissing his right eye passionately  master charlie cared nothing for that  he gazed past her at the gulls with the unobliterated eye  when she kissed him on the left cheek he gazed past her at the gulls with the other eye  when she let him go he continued to gaze at the gulls with both eyes  he had often seen the same gulls at a distance from the lower level of bounty bay but he had never before stood on their own giddy cliffs and watched them from their own favourite birdseyeview point for there were thousands of them sloping diving and wheeling in the airy abyss pictured against the dark blue sea below as well as thousands more circling upwards floating and gyrating in the bright blue sky above it seemed as if giant snowflakes were trembling in the air in all directions  some of the gulls came so near to those who watched them that their black inquiring eyes became distinctly visible others swept towards them with rustling wings as if intending to strike and then glanced sharply off or upwards with wild cries  wouldnt it be fun to have wings asked brown of sally as she stood there openmouthed and eyed  oh wouldnt it  if i had wings said young with a touch of sadness in his tone id steer a straight course through the air for old england  i didnt know you had such a strong desire to be hanged said brown  theyd never hang me returned young  im innocent of the crime of mutiny and captain bligh knows it  bligh would be but a broken reed to lean on rejoined brown with a shrug of contempt  if he liked you hed favour you if he didnt hed go dead against you  i wouldnt trust myself in his hands whether innocent or guilty  depend upon it mr young fletcher christian would have been an honour to the service if he had not been driven all but mad by bligh  i dont justify mr christians actit cannot be defendedbut i have great sympathy with him  the only man who deserves to be hanged for the mutiny of the bounty in my opinion is mr bligh himself but men seldom get their due in this world either one way or another  thats a powerfully radical sentiment said young laughing its to be hoped that men will at all events get their due in the next world and it is well for you that pitcairn is a free republic  but come we must go to work if we would have a kettle of fresh eggs  i see a ledge which seems accessible and where there must be plenty of eggs to judge from the row the gulls are making round it  ill try  see now that you dont get yourself into a fix that you cant get out of  you know that the heads of you landsmen are not so steady as those of seamen  i know that the heads of landsmen are not stuffed with such conceit as the heads of you sailors retorted brown as he went off to gather eggs  now sally do you stop here and take care of charlie said young leading the little girl to a soft grassy mound as far back from the edge of the cliff as possible  mind that you dont leave this spot till i return  i know i can trust you and as for charlie  oh he never moves amost xcept wen i lifts im  hes so good interrupted sally  well just keep a sharp eye on him and well soon be back with lots of eggs  while edward young was thus cautioning the child william brown was busy making his way down the cliffs to some promising ledges below and nehow the otaheitan clambered up the almost perpendicular face of the part that rose above them  see frontispiece  it was interesting to watch the movements of the three men  each was in his own way venturesome fearless and more or less practised in cliff climbing  the midshipman ascended the perpendicular face with something of a nautical swagger but inasmuch as the ledges crevices and projections were neither so well adapted to the hands nor so sure as ratlines and ropes there was a wholesome degree of caution mingled with his confidence  when the wishedfor ledge was gained he gave relief to his feelings in a hearty british cheer that reverberated from cliff to cliff causing the startled seagulls to drive the very echoes mad with their clangour  the botanist on the other hand proceeded with the extreme care of a man who knew that a false step or uncertain grip might send him into the seething mass of foam and rocks below  but he did not hesitate or betray want of courage in attempting any difficulty which he had made up his mind to face  the proceedings of nehow however seemed little short of miraculous he appeared to run up perpendicular places like a cat to leap where the others crept to scramble where his companions did not dare to venture and loosely speaking to hang on occasionally to nothing by the point of his nose his eyelids or his fingernails  we say that he appeared to do all this but the gulls who watched and followed him in noisy indignation could have told you if they had chosen that his eye was quick that his feet and hands were sure and that he never trusted foot or hand for one moment on a doubtful projection or crevice  for some time all went well  the three men soon returned each with a few eggs which they laid on the grass in three little heaps to be watched and guarded by sally and to be stared at in grave surprise by charlie  they carried their eggs in three round baskets without lids and with handles which folded over on one side so that the baskets could be fitted into each other when not in use or slung round the necks of the eggcollectors while they were climbing  the last to return to the children was william brown  he brought his basket nearly half full of fine eggs and set it down beside the two heaps already brought in  aint they lovely sall asked brown wiping the perspiration from his brow with the sleeve of his coat  that same coat by the way was very disreputablethreadbare and wornbeing four years old on the lowest calculation and having seen much rough service for brown had an objection to the tapa cloth and said he would stick to the old coat as long as it would stick to him  the truth is he felt it with his worn canvas trousers and guernsey shirt to be in some sense a last link to home and he was loath to part with them  lovely exclaimed sally theys jus bootiful  nothing could exceed bootiful in sallys mindshe had paid the eggs the highest possible compliment  charlie did them at the same moment the greatest possible damage by sitting down in the basket unintentionally with an awful crash  from the gaze of horror that he cast upwards it was evident that he was impressed with a strong belief that he had done something wrong though the result did not seem to him unpleasant  the gaze of horror quickly changed into one of alarm when he observed the shocked countenance of sally and he burst into uncontrollable tears  poor thing said brown lifting him out of the mess and setting him on his legs  never mind old man ill fetch you a better basketful soon you clean him up sall and ill be back in a jiffy  so saying brown took up his basket emptied out the mess wiped it with a bunch of grass and descended the short slope to the cliff edge laughing as he went  poor sallys shocked expression had not yet passed off when charlie came to a sudden stop shut his mouth tightly and opened his eyes as though to say well how do you take it now  oh challie but you is bad today  this was enough  the shades of darkest night settled down on charlies miserable soul  reshutting his eyes and reopening his mouth he poured forth the woe of his inconsolable heart in prolonged and passionate howling  no no o dont cried the repentant sally her arms round his neck and fondling him  i didnt mean it  im so sorry  its me thats badbadder than you ever was  but charlie refused to be comforted  he flung himself on the grass in agony of spirit to the alarm and grief of his poor nurse  mes dood he cried pausing suddenly with a blaze of inquiry in his wet visage  yes yes good as goldgooder far gooder  sally did not possess an enlightened conscience at that time  she would have said anything to quiet him but he would not be quieted  mes doodo dood ahoeeawee  the noise was bad enough but the way he flung himself about was worse there was no occasion for sally to clean him up  rolling thus on the green turf made him as pure if not bright as a new pin but it had another effect which gave sally a fright such as she had never up to that time conceived of and never afterwards forgot  in his rollings charlie came to the edge of the knoll where a thick but soft bush concealed a ledge or drop of about two feet  through this bush he passed in a moment  sally leaped up and sprang to the spot just in time to see her charge rolling helplessly down the slope to what appeared to be certain death  there was but a short slope between the bush and the cliff  rotund little charlie fetched way as he advanced despite one or two feeble clutches at the rocks  if sally had been a few years older she would have bounded after him like a goat but she had only reached that period of life which rendered petrifaction possible  she stood ridged for a few moments with heart head and eyes apparently about to burst  at last her voice found vent in a shriek so awful that it made the heart of young high on the cliffs above stand still  it had quite the contrary effect on the legs of brown  that cautious man chanced to be climbing the cliff slowly with a fresh basketful of eggs  hearing the shriek and knowing full well that it meant imminent danger he leaped up the last few steps of the precipice with a degree of heedless agility that equalled that of nehow himself  he was just in time to see charlie coming straight at him like a cannon shot  it was really an awful situation  to have received the shock while his footing was still precarious would have insured his own destruction as well as that of the child  feeling this he made a kangaroolike bound over the edge of the cliff and succeeded in planting both feet and knees firmly on a grassy foundation just in time  letting go his burden he spread out both arms  charlie came into his bosom with extreme violence but he remained firm while the basket of eggs went wildly downward to destruction  meanwhile sally stood there with clasped hands and glazed eyes sending up shriek after shriek which sent successive stabs to the heart of edward young as he scurried and tumbled rather than ran down from the upper cliffs towards her  in a few minutes he came in pale and panting  a minute later and nehow ran round a neighbouring point like a greyhound  all right gasped young  all right replied brown  wheeaowho exclaimed nehow expanding his cavernous mouth with a grin of satisfaction  it is worthy of record that little sally did not revisit these particular cliffs for several years after that exciting and eventful day and that she returned to the settlement with a beating and grateful heart  it must not be supposed that charlie christian remained for any great length of time the babby of that infant colony  by no means  in a short time after the event which we have just described there came to pitcairn a little sister to charlie  she was named mary despite the earnest suggestion of isaac martin that as she was born of a wednesday she ought to be called by that name  of course otaheitan sally at once devoted herself to the newcomer but she did not on that account forsake her first love  no her little brown heart remained true to charlie though she necessarily gave him less of her society than before  then mrs quintal gave her husband the additional burden as he styled it of a daughter whom he named sarah for no other reason that any one could make out than the fact that his wife did not like it and his friend mccoy had advised him on no account to adopt it  thus was little matthew quintal also provided with a sister  shortly after that john adams became a moderately happy father and called the child dinah because he had never had a female relation of that name indeed he had never possessed a relation of any kind whatever that he knew of having been a london streetboy a mere waif when he first became aware so to speak of his own existence  about the same time that little dinah was born john mills rushed one day into the yamfield of edward young where the midshipman was at work seized his hand and exclaimedi wish you joy sir its a girl  not to be outdone in civility young carefully watched his opportunity and only four days later rushed into the yamgarden of john mills where he was smoking seized his hand and exclaimedi congratulate you mills its a boy  so young called his daughter folly because he had an old aunt of that name who had been kind to him and mills called his son john after himself who he said was the kindest friend he ever had  by this time poor otaheitan sally became overburdened with care  it became evident that she could not manage to look after so large a family of helpless infants even though her services should only be required when the mothers were busy in the gardens  mrs isabella christian alias mainmast was therefore relieved of part of her field duties and set apart for infantry drill  thus the rising generation multiplied and grew apace and merry innocent laughter and gleeful childlike shouts began to resound among the cliffs and groves of the lonely refuge of the mutineers    chapter eleven  sporting schooling and moralising  time flew by with rapid wing and the infant colony prospered in many ways though not in all  one day john adams took down his gun from the pegs on which it rested above the door of his hut  saying to his wife that he was going to shoot a few cats and bring home a pig for supper he sallied forth and took the footpath that led to one of the darkest recesses of the lonely island  lest the reader should imagine that adams was a cruel man we must explain that several years having elapsed since the landing of the mutineers on pitcairn the cats had by that time multiplied excessively and instead of killing the rats which was their duty had taken to hunting and devouring the chickens  for this crime the race of cats was condemned to death and the sentence was put in force whenever opportunity offered  fortunately the poultry had also multiplied quickly and the hogs had increased to such a degree that many of them had been allowed to take to a wild life in the woods where they were hunted and shot when required for food  sporting however was not often practised because the gunpowder which had been saved from the bounty had by this time sensibly diminished  strange to say it did not seem to occur to any of the men that the bow and arrow might become of use when guns became useless  probably they looked upon such weapons with contempt for they only made little bows as playthings for the children with harmless bluntheaded arrows  on turning from the clearing into the bush adams came on a sight which amused him not a little  in an open place partially screened from the sun by the graceful leaves of palms and bananas through which was obtained a glimpse of the sea otaheitan sally was busily engaged in playing at school  seated on the end of a felled tree was thursday october christian who had become as isaac martin expressed it a great lout of a boy for his age  thursday was at the head of the class not in virtue of his superior knowledge but his size  he was a strongmade fellow with a bright intelligent goodhumoured face like that of his father  next to him sat little matt quintal rather heavy and stupid in expression but quiet and peaceable in temperament like his mother  next came daniel mccoy whose sharp sparkling countenance seemed the very embodiment of mischief in which quality he resembled his father  fortunately for little dan his mother was the gentlest and most unselfish of all the native women and these qualities transmitted to her son were the means of neutralising the evil which he inherited from his father after him came elizabeth mills whose pretty little whiteybrown face was the counterpart of her mothers in expression  indeed all of these little ones inherited in a great degree that sweet pliability of character for which the otaheitan women were and we believe still are famous  last but not least sat charlie christian at the bottom of the class  now hol up your heads an pay tention said the teacher with the air of authority suitable to her position  it may be observed here that sallys knowledge of schooling and classwork was derived from edward young who sometimes amused himself and the children by playing at school and even imparted a little instruction in this way  dont wink danl mccoy said sally in a voice which was meant to be very stern but was laughably sweet  pease missis tocs vinkin too  thus had dan learned to express thursdays name by his initials  there was a touch of mccoy senior in this barefaced attempt to divert attention from himself by criminating another  i know that toc is winking replied sally holding up a finger of reproof but he winks with both eyes an you does it with only one which is naughty  an when you speaks to me sir dont say vinksay wink  yis mum replied little dan casting down his eyes with a look of humility so intense that there was a sudden irruption of dazzling teeth along the whole class  now toc how much does two and three make  six replied thursday without a moments hesitation  oh you booby said sally  pease mum he aint booby hims dux said dan  but hes a booby for all that sir  you hold you tongue danl an tell me what three and two makes  pease mum i cant answered dan folding his hands meekly but praps charlie can hes clebber you know  wont you ax im  yes i will ask im  challie whats three an two  if charlie had been asked how to square the circle he could not have looked more innocently blank but the desire to please sally was in him a sort of passion  gazing at her intently with reddening face he made a desperate guess and by the merest chance said five  sally gave a little shriek of delight and looked in triumph at dan that little creature who seemed scarce old enough to receive a joke much less to make one looked first at charlie and winked with his left eye then at thursday and winked with his right one  youre winkin again sir cried sally sharply  yis mum but with bof eyes this time vich isnt naughty you know  but it is naughty sir unless you do it with both eyes at once  oh with bof at vunce exclaimed dan who thereupon shut both eyes very tight indeed and then opened them in the widest possible condition of surprise  this was too much for sally  she burst into a hearty fit of laughter her class being ever ready to imitate such an example followed suit charlie tumbled forward and rolled on the grass with delight little dan kicked up his heels and tumbled back over the log in ecstasy and thursday october swayed himself to and fro while the other two got up and danced with glee  it was while the school was in this disorganised state that john adams came upon them  thats right sall he said heartily as he patted the childs head you keep em at it  nothin like havin their noses held to the grindstone when theyre young  you didnt see anybody pass this way did you  no replied the child looking earnestly up into the seamans countenance  it was a peculiarity of these children that they could change from gay to grave with wonderful facility  the mere putting of the question had changed the current of their minds as they earnestly and gravely strove to recollect whether any one had been seen to pass during the morning  no repeated sally dont think nobody have pass this mornin  yis there vas vun said little dan who had become more profoundly thoughtful than the others  ay who was that my little man said adams  isaac martins big sow replied dan gravely  the shout of laughter that followed this was not in proportion to the depth but the unexpectedness of the joke and john adams went on his way chuckling at the impudence of what he called the precocious snipe  in a short time the seaman found himself in a thicket so dense that it was with difficulty he could make his way through the luxuriant underwood  on his left hand he could see the sky through the leaves on his right the steep sides of the mountain ridge that divided the island  coming to a partially open space he thought he saw the yellow side of a hog  he raised his gun to fire when a squeaky grunt told him that this was a mother reposing with her family  he contented himself therefore with a look at them and gave vent to a shout that sent them scampering down the hill  soon after that he came upon a solitary animal and shot it  the report of the musket and the accompanying yell brought the otaheitan man tetaheite to his side  well met tighty so he styled him i want you to carry that pig to mrs adams  you didnt see any cats about did you  no sar  have you seen mr christian at the tanks this morning  yis sar but hims no dere now  hims go to de mountaintop  ha  i thought so  well take the pig to my wife tighty and say ill be back before dark  the native threw the animal over his broad shoulders and adams directed his steps to the wellknown cave on the mountaintop where the chief of the mutineers spent so much of his leisure time  after the murder of the two natives talaloo and ohoo fletcher christian had become very morose  it seemed as if a fit of deep melancholy had taken entire possession of him  his temper had become greatly soured  he would scarcely condescend to hold intercourse with any one and sought the retirement of his outlook in the cave on the mountaintop where few of his comrades ventured to disturb him save when matters of importance claimed his immediate attention  latterly however a change had been observed in his demeanour  he had become gentle almost amiable and much more like his former self before the blighting influence of bligh had fallen on him  though he seldom laughed he would chat pleasantly with his companions as in days gone by and frequently took pains to amuse the children  in particular he began to go frequently for long walks in the woods with his own sons little charlie on his back and thursday october gambolling by his side also otaheitan sally for that careful nurse refused to acknowledge any claim to the guardianship of charlie as being superior to her own not even that of a father  but fletcher christian although thus changed for the better in many respects did not change in his desire for solitude  his visits to the outlook became not less but rather more frequent and prolonged than before  he took no one into his confidence  the only man of the party who ever ventured to visit him in his outlook was edward young but his visits were not frequent though they were usually protracted when they did take place and the midshipman always returned from them with an expression of seriousness which it was observed never passed quickly away  but young was not more disposed to be communicative as to these visits than christian himself and his comrades soon ceased to think or care about the matter  with his mind meditating on these things john adams slowly wended his way up the mountainside until he drew near to the elevated hermitage of his once superior officer now his comrade in disgrace and exile  stout john adams felt his blunt straightforward seafaring spirit slightly abashed as he thus ventured to intrude on the privacy of one for whom despite his sins and their terrible consequences he had never lost respect  it felt like going into the captains cabin without orders  the seamans purpose was to remonstrate with christian for thus daily giving himself up as he expressed it to such a long spell o the blues  drawing near to the entrance of the cavern he was surprised to hear the sound of voices within  humph somebody here before me he muttered coming to an abrupt pause and turning as if with the intention of retracing his steps but the peculiarity of the sounds that issued from the cave held him as if spellbound    chapter twelve  converse in the cavecruelty punishment and revelry  it was fletcher christians voicethere could be no doubt about that but it was raised in very unfamiliar tones and it went on steadily with inflections as if in pathos and entreaty  can he be praying thought adams in surprise for the tones though audible were not articulate  suddenly they waxed louder and god be merciful to me a sinner broke on the listeners ear  oh bless and deliver the men whom i have led astraypoor edward young john adams isaac martin  the tones here sank and again became inarticulate but adams could not doubt that christian was praying by name for the rest of his companions  presently the name of jesus was heard distinctly and then the voice ceased  ashamed to have been thus unintentionally led into eavesdropping adams coughed and made as much noise as possible while stooping to pass under the low entrance to the cave  there was no door of any kind but a turn in the short passage concealed the cave itself from view  before entering adams stopped  may i come in sir he called out  is that you adams  by all means come in  christian was seated partly in the shadow partly in the light that streamed in from the seaward opening  a quiet smile was on his lips and his hand rested on an open book  it was the old bible of the bounty  beg pardon sir said adams touching his hat  hope i dont intrude i heard you waswas  praying said christian  yes adams i have been praying  well sir said adams feeling rather awkward but assuming an air of encouragement youve got no reason to be ashamed of that  quite true adams and im not ashamed of it  ive not only got no reason to be ashamed of praying but i have strong reason to be thankful that im inclined to pray  sit down adams on the ledge opposite youve got something on your mind i see that you want to get rid of come lets have it  there was nothing but goodnatured encouragement in christians look and tone nevertheless john adams felt it extremely difficult to speak and wished with all his heart that he had not come to the cave  but he was too bold and outspoken a man to be long oppressed with such feelings clearing his voice he said well mr christian heres what ive got to say  ive bin thinkin for a long time past that its of no manner of use your comin up here day after day an mopin away about what cant be mended an goin into the blues  youll excuse me sir for bein so free but you shouldnt do it sir  you cant alter whats bin done by cryin over spilt milk an it comes heavy on the rest of us like  indeed it do  so ive made so bold as to come an say youd better drop it and come along with me for a days shootin of the cats an pigs and then well go home an have a royal supper an a song or two or maybe a game at blindmansbuff with the childn  thats whatll do you good sir an make you forget whats past take my word for it mister christian  while adams was speaking christians expression varied passing from the kindly smile with which he had received his friend to a look of profound gravity  you are both right and wrong adams like the rest of us he said grasping the sailors extended hand thank you all the same for your advice and good feeling  you are wrong in supposing that anything short of death can make me forget the past or lessen my feeling of selfcondemnation but you are right in urging me to cease moping here in solitude  i have been told that already much more strongly than you have put it  have you sir said adams with a look of surprise  yes said christian touching the open bible gods book has told me it has told me more than that  it has told me there is forgiveness for the chief of sinners  you say the truth sir returned adams with an approving nod repenting as you do sir an as i may say we all do of what is past and cant be helped a merciful god will no doubt forgive us all  thats not it thats not it said christian quickly  repentance is not enough  why man do you think if i went to england just now and said ever so earnestly or so truly i repent that id escape swinging at the yardarm  well i cant say you would replied the sailor somewhat puzzled but then mans ways aint the same as gods ways are they sir  thats true adams but justice is always the same whether with god or man  besides if repentance alone would do where is the need of a saviour  adamss puzzled look increased and finally settled on the horizon  the matter had evidently never occurred to him before in that light  after a short silence he turned again to christian  well sir to be frank with you i must say that i dont rightly understand it  but i do said christian again laying his hand on the bible at least i think i do  god has forgiven me for jesus christs sake and his spirit has made me repent and accept the forgiveness and now i feel that there is work serious work for me to do  i have just been praying that god would help me to do it  ill explain more about this hereafter  meanwhile i will go with you to the settlement and try at least some parts of your plan  come  there was a quiet yet cheerful air of alacrity about fletcher christian that day so strongly in contrast with his previous sad and even moody deportment that john adams could only note it in silent surprise  have you been readin much o that book up here sir he asked as they began to descend the hill  do you mean gods book  yes  well yes ive been reading it off and on for a considerable time past but i didnt quite see the way of salvation until recently  ha thats it thats what must have turned your head  what exclaimed christian with a smiling glance at his perplexed comrade  do you mean turned in the right or the wrong direction  well whether right or wrong its not for me to say but for you to prove mr christian  this reply seemed to set the mind of the other wandering for he continued to lead his companion down the hill in silence after that  at last he said  john adams whatever turn my head may have got i shall have reason to thank god for it all the days of my lifeay and afterwards throughout eternity  the silence which ensued after this remark was broken soon after by a series of yells which came from the direction of matthew quintals house and caused both christian and adams to frown as they hastened forward  theres one man that needs forgiveness said adams sternly  whether hell get it or not is a question  christian made no reply  he knew full well that both mccoy and quintal were in the habit of flogging their slaves nehow and timoa and otherwise treating them with great cruelty  indeed there had reached him a report of treatment so shocking that he could scarcely credit it and thought it best at the time to take no notice of the rumour but afterwards he was told of a repetition of the cruelty and now he seemed about to witness it with his own eyes  burning indignation at first fired his soul and he resolved to punish quintal  then came the thought who was it that tempted quintal to mutiny and placed him in his present circumstances  the continued cries of agony however drove all connected thought from his brain as he ran with adams towards the house  they found poor nehow tied to a cocoanut tree and quintal beside him he had just finished giving him a cruel flogging and was now engaged in rubbing salt into the wounds on his lacerated back  with a furious shout christian rushed forward  quintal faced round quickly  he was livid with passion and raised a heavy stick to strike the intruders but christian guarded the blow with his left arm and with his right fist knocked the monster down  at the same time adams cut the lashings that fastened nehow who instantly fled to the bush  quintal although partially stunned rose at once and faced his adversary but although possessed of bulldog courage he could not withstand the towering wrath of christian  he shrank backward a step with a growl like a cowed but not conquered tiger  the slave is mine he hissed between his teeth  he is not he belongs to god said christian  and hark ee matthew quintal if ever again you do such a dastardly cowardly brutal act ill take on myself the office of your executioner and will beat out your brains  you know me quintal i never threaten twice  christians tone was calm though firm but there was something so deadly in the glare of his clear blue eyes that quintal retreated another step  in doing so he tripped over a root and fell prone upon the ground  ha exclaimed adams with a bitter laugh youd better lie still its your suitable position you blackguard  without another word he and christian turned on their heels and walked away  this is a bad beginning to my new resolves said christian with a sigh as they descended the hill  a bad beginning echoed adams to give a welldeserved blow to as great a rascal as ever walked  no not exactly that butwell no matter well dismiss the subject and go have a lark with the children  christian said this with something like a return to his previous goodhumour  a few minutes later they passed under the banyantree at the side of adamss house and entered the square of the village where children kittens fowls and pigs were disporting themselves in joyous revelry    chapter thirteen  tyrants and plotters  leaving christian and adams to carry out their philanthropic intentions we return to matthew quintal whom we left sprawling on the ground in his garden  this garden was situated in one of the little valleys not far from bounty bay  higher up in the same valley stood the hut of mccoy towards this hut quintal after gathering himself up wended his way in a state of unenviable sulkiness  his friend mccoy was engaged at the time in smoking his evening pipe but that pipe did not now seem to render him much comfort for he growled and puffed in a way that showed he was not soothed by it the reason being that there was no tobacco in the pipe  that weedwhich many people deem so needful and so precious that one sometimes wonders how the world managed to exist before sir walter raleigh put it to its unnatural usehad at last been exhausted on pitcairn island and the mutineers had to learn to do without it  some of them said they didnt care and submitted with a good grace to the inevitable  others growled and swore and fretted saying that they knew they couldnt live without it  to their astonishment and no doubt to their disgust they did manage to live quite as healthily as before and with obvious advantage to health and teeth  two there were however namely quintal and mccoy who would not give in but vowed with their usual violence of language that they would smoke seaweed rather than want their pipes like most men of powerful tongue and weak will they did not fulfil their vows  seaweed was left to the gulls but they tried almost every leaf and flower on the island without success  then they scraped and dried various kinds of bark and smoked that  then they tried the fibrous husk of the cocoanut and then the dried and pounded kernel but all in vain  smoke indeed they produced in huge volumes but of satisfaction they had none  it was a sad case  if we could only taste the flavour o baccy ever so mild they were wont to say to their comrades the craving would be satisfied  to which isaac martin who had no mercy on them would reply if ye hadnt created the cravin boys ye wouldnt have bin growlin and hankerin after satisfaction  as we have said mccoy was smoking perhaps we should say agonising over his evening pipe  his man or slave timoa was seated on the opposite side of the hut playing an accompaniment on the flute to mccoys wife and two other native women who were singing  the flute was one of those roughandready yellow things like the leg of a chair which might serve equally well as a policemans baton or a musical instrument  it had been given by one of the sailors to timoa who developed a wonderful capacity for drawing unmusical sounds out of it the singing was now low and plaintive anon loud and harshalways wild like the song of the savages  the two combined assisted the pipe in soothing william mccoyat least so we may assume because he had commanded the music and lay in his bunk in the attitude of one enjoying it  he sometimes even added to the harmony by uttering a bass growl at the pipe  during a brief pause in the accompaniment timoa became aware of a low hiss outside as if of a serpent  with glistening eyes and head turned to one side he listened intently  the hiss was repeated and timoa became aware that one of his kinsmen wished to speak with him in secret he did not dare however to move  mccoy was so much taken up with his pipe that he failed to notice the hiss but he observed the stoppage of the flutes wail  why dont you go on you brute he cried angrily at the same time throwing one of his shoes at the musician which hit him on the shin and caused him a moments sharp pain  timoa would not suffer his countenance to betray his feelings  he merely raised the flute to his lips exchanged a glance with the women and continued his dismal strain  his mind however was so engrossed with his comrade outside that the harmony became worse than ever  even mccoy who professed himself to be no judge of music could not stand it and he was contemplating the application of the other shoe when a step was heard outside  next moment his friend quintal strode in and sat down on a stool beside the door  oh i say matt cried mccoy who put that cocoanut on the bridge of your nose  who grow led quintal with an oath  who on the island would dare to do it but that domineerin upstart christian  humph answered mccoy with a slight sneer  he followed this up with a curse on domineerers in general and on fletcher christian in particular  it is right to observe here that though we have spoken of these two men as friends it must not be understood that they were friendly  they had no personal regard for each other and no tastes in common save the taste for tobacco and drink but finding that they disliked each other less than they disliked their comrades they were thus drawn into a hollow friendship as it were under protest  how did it happen asked mccoy  give us a whiff an ill tell ee  what sort o stuff are you tryin now  cocoanut chips ground small  the best o baccy matt for lunatics which we was when we cast anchor on this island  here fill your pipe an fire away  you wont notice the difference if you dont think about it  my what a cropper you must have come down when you got that dab on your proboscis  stop your howlin shouted quintal to the musicians in order to vent some of the spleen which his friends remark had stirred up  timoa not feeling sure whether the command was meant for the women or himself or perhaps regarding mccoy as the proper authority from whom such an order should come continued his dismal blowing  quintal could not stand this in his roused condition  leaping up he sprang towards timoa snatched the flute from his hand broke it over his head and kicked him out of the hut  excepting the blow and the kick this was just what the otaheitan wanted  he ran straight into the bush which was by that time growing dark under the shades of evening and found nehow leaning against a tree and groaning heavily though in a suppressed tone  quick come with me to the spring and wash my back he cried starting up  they did not converse in broken english now of course but in their native tongue  what has happened asked timoa anxiously  while nehow explained the nature of the cruel treatment he had just received they ran together to the nearest watercourse  it chanced to be pretty full at the time heavy rain having fallen the day before  there oh haa not so hard groaned the unfortunate man as his friend laved the water on his lacerated back  in a few minutes the salt was washed out of the wounds and nehow began to feel easier  where is menalee he asked abruptly as he sat down under the deep shadow of a banyantree  in his masters hut i suppose answered timoa  go find him and tetaheite fetch them both here he said with an expression of ferocity on his dark face  timoa looked at him with an intelligent grin  the white men must die he said  yes nehow replied the white men shall die  timoa pointed to the lump which had been raised on his shin grinned again and turning quickly round glided into the underwood like an evil spirit of the night  at that time menalee was engaged in some menial work in the hut of john mills  managing to attract his attention timoa sent him into the woods to join nehow  when timoa crept forward tetaheite was standing near to a large bush watching with intense interest the ongoings of christian adams and young  these three in pursuance of the philanthropic principle which had begun to operate were playing an uproarious game with the children round a huge bonfire but there was no method in their madness the children excepting thursday october christian and sally were still too young for concerted play  they were still staggerers and the game was simply one of romps  tetaheites goodhumoured visage was glistening in the firelight the mouth expanded from ear to ear and the eyes almost closed  suddenly he became aware of a low hissing sound  the mouth closed and the eyes opened so abruptly that there seemed some necessary connection between the two acts  moving quietly round the bush until he got into its shadow his dark form melted from the scene without any one observing his disappearance  soon the four conspirators were seated in a dark group under shade of the trees  the time has come when the black man must be revenged said nehow look my back  salt was rubbed into these wounds  it is not the first time  it shall be the last  some of you have suffered in the same way  it scarcely needed this remark to call forth looks of deadly hate on the otaheitan faces around him  the white men must die he continued  they have no mercy  we will show none  even in the darkness of that secluded spot the glistening of the eyes of these illtreated men might have been seen as they gave ready assent to this proposal in low guttural tones  how is it to be done asked menalee after a short pause  that is what we have met to talk about returned nehow  i would hear what my brothers have to say  when they have spoken i will open my mouth  the group now drew closer together and speaking in still lower tones as if they feared that the very bushes might overhear and betray them they secretly plotted the murder of the mutineers    chapter fourteen  the influence of infancy also of villainy  while the dark plots referred to in the last chapter were being hatched another life was introduced into the little community in the form of a third child to fletcher christiana little girl  much though this man loved his two boys a tenderer though not perhaps a deeper region of his heart was touched by his daughter  he at once named her mary  who can tell the multitude of old memories and affections which were revived by this name  might it not have been that a mother a sister some lost though not forgotten one came forcibly to mind and accounted in some degree at least for the wealth of affection which he lavished on the infant from the day of her birth  we cannot tell but certain it is that there never was a more devoted father than this man who in england had been branded with all that was ferocious mean desperatethis hardened outlaw this chief of the mutineers  otaheitan mothers are not particular in the matter of infant costume little marys dress may be described in one wordnothing  neither are such mothers much troubled with maternal anxieties  long before a european baby would have been let out of the hands of mother or nurse even for a moment little molly christian was committed to the care of her delighted father who daily bore her off to a favourite resort among the cliffs and there played with her  one day on reaching his place of retirement he was surprised to find a man in possession before him  drawing nearer he observed that the man also had a baby in his arms  why i declare its edward young he exclaimed on going up  of course it is said the midshipman smiling as he held his own little daughter jane aloft  do you think you are to have it all to yourself  and do you imagine that yours is the only baby in the world worth looking at  you are right young returned christian with the nearest approach to a laugh he had made for years  come now he added sitting down on a rock and placing little moll tenderly in the hollow of his left arm so as to make her face his friend lets set them up and compare notes isnt she a beauty  no doubt of it whatever and isnt mine ditto asked the midshipman sitting down and placing little poll in a similar position on his right arm  but i say if you and i are to get on amicably we mustnt praise our own babies  let it be an agreement that you praise my poll and ill praise your moll  dont they make lovely pendants  come let us change them for a bit  christian agreeing to this the infants were exchanged and thereupon these two fathers lay down on the soft grass and perpetrated practical jokes upon and talked as much ineffable nonsense to those two whiteybrown balls as if they had been splendid specimens of orthodox pink and white  it was observed however by the more sagacious of the wondering gulls that circled round them that a state of perfect satisfaction was not attained until the babies were again exchanged and each father had become exclusively engrossed with his own particular ball  now i say fletcher remarked young rising and placing himself nearer his friend its all very well for you and me to waste our time and make fools of ourselves here but i didnt merely come to show off my polly  i came to ask what you think of that rumour we heard last night that there has been some sort of plotting going on among the otaheitan men  i dont think anything of it at all replied christian whose countenance at once assumed that look of gravity which had become habitual to him since the day of the mutiny  they have had too good reason to plot poor fellows but i have such faith in their native amiability of disposition that i dont believe they will ever think of anything beyond a brief show of rebellion  i also have had faith in their amiability rejoined young but some of us i fear have tried them too severely  i dont like the looks they sometimes give us now  we did wrong at the first in treating them as servants  no doubt we did but it would have been difficult to do otherwise said christian they fell so naturally into the position of servants of their own accord regarding us as they did as superior beings  we should have considered their interests when we divided the land no doubt  however that cant well be remedied now  perhaps not remarked young in an absent tone  it would be well however to take some precautions  come we can discuss this matter as we go home said christian rising  i have to work in my yamplot today and must deliver molly to her mother  they both rose and descended the slope that led to the village chatting as they went  now although the native men were of one mind as to the slaying of the englishmen they seemed to have some difference of opinion as to the best method of putting their bloody design in execution  menalee especially had many objections to make to the various proposals of his countrymen  in fact this wily savage was deceitful  like quintal and mccoy among the whites he was among the blacks a bad specimen of humanity  the consequence was that timoa and nehow being resolved to submit no longer to the harsh treatment they had hitherto received ran away from their persecutors and took refuge in the bush  to those who have travelled much about this world it may sound absurd to talk of hiding away in an island of such small size but it must be borne in mind that the miniature valleys and hills of the interior were in many places very rugged and densely clothed with jungle so that it was in reality about as difficult to catch an agile native among them as to catch a rabbit in a whinfield  moreover the two desperate men carried off two muskets and ammunition so that it was certain to be a work of danger to attempt their recapture  in these circumstances christian and young thought it best to leave them alone for a time  you may be sure said the former as they joined their comrades that theyll soon tire of rambling especially when their ammunition is spent  quintal who stood with all the other men by the forge watching john williams as he wrought at a piece of redhot iron and overheard the remark did not he said feel so sure of that  them niggers was fond o their liberty and it was his opinion they should get up a grand hunt and shoot em down offhand  there would be no peace till that was done  there would be no peace even after that was done said isaac martin with a leer unless we shot you along wi them  its impossible either to shoot or drown matt quintal for hes born to be hanged said mccoy sucking viciously at his cocoanutloaded pipe which did not seem to draw well  thats true cried mills with a laugh in which all the party except christian joined more or less sarcastically according to humour  oh mother exclaimed otaheitan sally going into her hut on tiptoe a few minutes later with her great eyes dilated in horror the white mens is talkin of shootin timoa and nehow  never mind dear replied her mother in her own language its only talk  theyll never do such a thing  im sure mr young did not agree to help in such a deed did he  o no mother answered sally with tremendous emphasis he said it would be very very wicked to do such tings  so it would dear  no fear  its only talk  satisfied with this assurance sally went off with a cleared visage to superintend some operation in connection with her everincreasing infantry charge probably to pay some special attention to her favourite charlie or to chaff that booby thursday october though to say truth thursday was no booby but a smart intelligent fellow  the very next day after that timoa and nehow came down to edward young as he was at work alone in his yamfield  this field was at a considerable distance from the settlement high up on the mountainside the two men had left their weapons behind them  wes comed for give you a helpin hand missr yong if you no lay hands on us said nehow  i have no wish to lay hands on you replied young besides i have no right to do so  you know i never regarded you as slaves nor did i approve of your bad treatment  but let me advise you to rejoin us peaceably and i promise to do what i can to make things go easier  nebber exclaimed nehow fiercely  well it will be the worse for yourselves in the longrun said young for quintal and mccoy will be sure to go after you at last and shoot you  the two men looked at each other when he said that and smiled intelligently  however if you choose to help me now continued young ill be obliged to you and will pay you for what you do  the men set to work with a will for they were fond of the kindly midshipman but they kept a bright lookout all the time lest any of the other englishmen should come up and find them there  for two or three evenings in succession timoa and nehow came to youngs field and acted in this way  young made no secret of the fact and quintal on hearing of it at once suggested that he and mccoy should go up and lie in ambush for them  if you do said young with indignation ill shoot you both  i dont jest  you may depend on it if i find either of you fellows skulking near my field when these men are at work there your lives wont be worth a sixpence  at this quintal and mccoy both laughed and said they were jesting nevertheless while walking home together after that conversation they planned the carrying out of their murderous intention  thus with plot and counterplot did the mutineers and otaheitans render their lives wretched  what with the bitter enmity existing between the whites and blacks and the mutual jealousies among themselves both parties were kept in a state of perpetual anxiety and the beautiful isle which was fitted by its maker to become a paradise was turned into a place of torment  sometimes the other native men tetaheite and menalee joined nehow and timoa in working in youngs garden and afterwards went with them into the bush where they planned the attack which was afterwards made  at last the lowering cloud was fully charged and the thunderbolt fell    chapter fifteen  murder  the planting time came round at pitcairn and all was busy activity in the little settlement at bounty bay  the women engaged in household work and in the preparation of food scarcely troubled themselves to cast an anxious eye on the numerous children who according to age and capacity rolled tumbled staggered and jumped about in noisy play the sun streaming through the leaves of the woods studded shady places with balls of quivering light and blazed in fierce heat in the open where the men were at work each in his respective garden  we have said that those gardens lay apart at some distance from each other and were partially concealed by shrubs or undulating knolls  the garden of john williams was farthest off from the settlement  he wrought in it alone on the day of which we write  next to it was that of fletcher christian  he also worked alone that day  about two hundred yards from his garden and screened from it by a wooded rising ground was a piece of plantation in which john mills william mccoy and menalee were at work together  john adams william brown and isaac martin were working in their own gardens near their respective houses and quintal was resting in his hut  so was edward young who having been at work since early morning had lain down and fallen into a deep slumber  the three native men timoa nehow and tetaheite were still away in the woods  if the unfortunate englishmen had known what these men were about they would not have toiled so quietly on that peaceful morning  the otaheitans met in a cocoanut grove at some distance to the eastward of the settlement  each had a musket which he loaded with ball  they did not speak much and what they did say was uttered in a suppressed tone of voice  come said timoa leading the way through the woods  the others followed in single file until they reached the garden where williams was at work  here their movements were more cautious  as they advanced they crept along on their knees with the motion of cats and with as little noise  they could hear the sound of the armourers spade as he turned up the soil  presently they came to an opening in the bushes through which they could see him not thirty yards off  timoa drew himself together and in a crouching attitude levelled his musket  during their absence in the woods these men had practised shooting at a mark doubtless in preparation for the occasion which had now arrived the woods and cliffs rang to the loud report and williams fell forward without a cry or groan shot through the heart  the murderers rose and looked at each other but uttered not a word while timoa recharged his gun  the report had of course been heard by every one in the settlement but it was a familiar sound and caused neither surprise nor alarm mccoy merely raised himself for a moment remarked to mills that some one must have taken a fancy for a bit of pork to supper and then resumed his work  christian also heard the shot but seemed to pay no regard to it ceasing his labour in a few minutes he raised himself wiped his forehead and resting both hands on his spade looked upwards at the bright blue sky  fleecy clouds passed across it now and then intensifying its depth and apparently riveting christians gaze for he continued motionless for several minutes with his clear eye fixed on the blue vault and a sad wistful expression on his handsome face as if memory busy with the past and future had forgotten the present  it was his last look  a bullet from the bushes struck him at that moment on the breast  uttering one short sharp cry he threw both hands high above his head and fell backwards  the spasm of pain was but momentary  the sad wistful look was replaced by a quiet smile  he never knew who had released his spirit from the prisonhouse of clay for the eyes remained fixed on the bright blue sky clear and steadfast until death descended  then the light went out just as his murderers came forward but the quiet smile remained and his spirit returned to god who gave it  it seemed as if the murderers were for a few moments awestruck and horrified by what they had done but they quickly recovered  what they had set their faces to accomplish must now be done at all hazards  did you hear that cry said mccoy raising himself from his work in the neighbouring garden  yes what then demanded quintal  it sounded to me uncommon like the cry of a wounded man said mccoy  didnt sound like that to me returned quintal more like mainmast callin her husband to dinner  as he spoke tetaheite appeared at the edge of the garden with a musket in his hand the other two natives remaining concealed in the bushes  ho missr mills he called out in his broken english me have just shoot a large pig  will you let menalee help carry him home  yesyou may go said mills turning to menalee  the otaheitan threw down his tools and joined his comrades in the bush where he was at once told what had been done  menalee did not at first seem as much pleased as his comrades had expected nevertheless he agreed to go with them  how shall we kill mills and mccoy asked timoa in a low whisper  shoot them answered menalee you have three muskets  but they also have muskets objected tetaheite and are good shots if we miss them some of us shall be dead men at once  ill tell you what well do said nehow who thereupon hastily detailed a plan which they proceeded at once to carry out  creeping round through the woods they managed to get into mccoys house by a back window unobserved  menalee then ran down to the garden as if in a state of great excitement  oh missr mccoy timoa and nehow hab come down from mountain an is robbin you house  the bait took  mccoy ran up to his house  as soon as he reached the door there was a volley from within but mccoy remained untouched  seeing this and no doubt supposing that he must be badly wounded menalee who had followed him seized him from behind  but mccoy being the stronger man twisted himself suddenly round grasped menalee by the waist with both hands and flung him headlong into a neighbouring pigsty  he then turned and ran back to his garden to warn mills  run for it mills he cried run and take to the bush  all the black scoundrels have united to murder us  he set the example by at once disappearing in the thick bush  but mills did not believe him  he and menalee had always been good friends and he seemed to think it impossible that they would kill him  he hesitated and the hesitation cost him his life for next moment a bullet laid him low  meanwhile mccoy ran to warn christian  reaching his garden he found him there dead with the tranquil smile still on his cold lips and the now glazed eyes still gazing upwards  one glance sufficed  he turned and ran back to christians house to tell his wife what he had seen but the poor woman was sick in bed at the time and could not move  running then to quintals garden he found him alive but quite ignorant of what was going on  they seem to be wastin a deal of powder today he growled without raising himself as mccoy came up buthallo youre blowing hard whats wrong  as soon as he heard the terrible story he ran to his wife who chanced to be sitting near the edge of his garden  up old girl he cried your nigger countrymen are murderin us all if you want to see any of us escape youd better go and warn em  i shall look after number one  accordingly with his friend of kindred spirit he sought refuge in the bush  mrs quintal had no desire to see all the white men slaughtered by her countrymen  she therefore started off at once and in passing the garden of john adams called to him to take to the bush without delay and ran on  unfortunately adams did not understand what she meant  he like the others had heard the firing but had only thought of it as a foolish waste of ammunition  nothing was further from his thoughts on that peaceful day and hour than deeds of violence and bloodshed  he therefore continued at work  the four murderers meanwhile ran down to isaac martins house found him in the garden and pointing their muskets at him pulled the triggers  the pieces missed fire and poor martin thinking probably that it was a practical joke laughed at them  they cocked again however and fired  martin although he fell mortally wounded had strength to rise again and fly towards his house  the natives followed him into it  there was one of the sledgehammers of the bounty there one of them seized it and with one blow beat in the poor mans skull  roused apparently to madness by their bloody work the otaheitans now rushed in a body to browns garden  the botanist had been somewhat surprised at the frequent firing but like his unfortunate fellowcountrymen appeared to have not the remotest suspicion of what was going on  the sight of the natives however quickly opened his eyes  he turned as if to fly but before he could gain the bushes a wellaimed volley killed him  thus in little more than an hour were five of the englishmen murdered  it now seemed as if the revenge of the otaheitans had been sated for after the last tragic act they remained for some time in front of browns house talking and resting their hands on the muzzles of their guns  all this time edward young was lying asleep in ignorance of what was being done and purposely kept in ignorance by the women  having been told by quintals wife they knew part of the terrible details of the massacre but they had no power to check the murderers  they however adopted what means they could to shield young who as we have said was a favourite with all the natives and closed the door of the hut in which he lay to prevent his being awakened  the suspicions of adams having at length been aroused he went down to browns house to see what all the firing could be about  the children meanwhile having some vague fears that danger threatened had run into their mothers huts  everything passed so quickly in fact that few of the people had time to understand or think or take action in any way  reaching the edge of browns garden and seeing the four otaheitans standing as we have described adams stopped and called out to know what was the matter  silence shouted one of them pointing his gun  being unarmed and observing the body of brown on the ground adams at once leaped into the bush and ran  he was hotly pursued by the four men but being strong and swift of foot he soon left them behind  in passing williamss house he went towards it intending to snatch up some thick garments and if possible a musket and ammunition for he had no doubt now that some of his countrymen must have been killed and that he would have to take to the bush along with them  an exclamation of horror escaped him when he came upon the armourers body  it needed no second glance to tell that his comrade was dead  passing into the house he caught up an old blanket and a coat but there was no musket  he knew that without arms he would be at the mercy of the savages  being a cool and courageous man he therefore made a long detour through the bush until he reached his own house and entered by a back window  his sick wife received him with a look of glad surprise  is it true they have killed some of the white men she asked  ay too true he replied quickly and i must take to the bush for a while  where can i find a bag to hold some yams  ah here you are theres no fear o them hurting you lass  as he spoke a shot was heard  the natives had seen and followed him  a ball coming through the window entered the back of his neck and came out at the front  he fell but instantly sprang up and leaped through the doorway where he was met by the four natives  besides being a powerful man adams was very active and the wound in his neck was only a flesh one  he knocked down timoa the foremost of the band with one blow of his fist and grappling with nehow threw him violently over his prostrate comrade but menalee coming up at the moment clubbed his musket and made a furious blow at adamss head  he guarded it with one hand and in so doing had one of his fingers broken tetaheite and menalee then both sprang upon him but he nearly throttled the one tripped up the other and succeeding by a violent wrench in breaking loose once more took to his heels  in running the otaheitans were no match for him  he gradually left them behind  then timoa called out to him to stop  no you scoundrels he shouted back in reply you want to kill me but youll find it a harder job than you think  no no cried nehow vehemently we dont want to kill you  stop and we wont hurt you  adams felt that loss of blood from his wound was quickly reducing his strength  his case was desperate  he formed a quick resolve and acted promptly  stopping he turned about and walked slowly but steadily back towards the natives with his hands in his pockets and his eyes fixed sternly upon them  well i have stopped you see he said on coming up  i will take you at your word  we will do you no harm if you will follow us said timoa  they then went together to the house of young  here they found its owner just roused by the noise of the scuffle with adams listening to the explanations of the women who were purposely trying to lead him astray lest he should go out and be shot  the entrance of the four natives armed and covered with blood and adams unarmed and wounded at once showed him how matters stood  this is a terrible business he said in a low tone to adams while the murderers were disputing noisily about going into the woods to hunt down mccoy and quintal  have they killed many of our comrades  god knows said adams while quintals wife bound up the wound in his neck  there has been firin enough to have killed us all twice over i thought some of you were spending the ammunition foolishly on hogs or gulls  williams is dead i know and poor brown for i saw their bodies but i cant say  fletcher christian is killed said quintals wife interrupting  fletcher christian exclaimed adams and young in the same breath  ay and isaac martin and john mills continued the woman  while she was speaking the four otaheitans having apparently come to an agreement as to their future proceedings loaded their muskets hastily and rushing from the house soon disappeared in the woods  we shall not harrow the readers feelings by following farther the bloody details of this massacre  let it suffice to add briefly that after retiring from a fruitless search for the white men in the bush menalee quarrelled with timoa and shot him  this roused the anger of the other two against menalee who fled to the bush and tried to make friends with mccoy and quintal  this he appeared to succeed in doing but when he was induced by them to give up his musket he found out his mistake for they soon turned it on himself and killed him  then youngs wife susannah was induced to kill tetaheite with an axe and young himself immediately after shot nehow  when mccoy and quintal were told that all the otaheitan men were dead they returned to the settlement  it was a terrible scene of desolation and woe  even these two rough and heartless men were awed for a time into something like solemnity  the men now left alive on the island were young adams quintal and mccoy  in the households of these four the widows and children of the slain were distributed  the evidences of the bloody tragedy were removed the murdered men were buried and thus came to a close the first great epoch in the chequered history of pitcairn island    chapter sixteen  matt quintal makes a tremendous discovery  upwards of four years had now elapsed since the mutiny of the bounty and of the nine mutineers who escaped to pitcairn island only four remained with eleven women and a number of children  these latter had now become an important and remarkably noisy element in the colony  they and time together did much to efface the saddening effects of the gloomy epoch which had just come to a close  time however did more than merely relieve the feelings of the surviving mutineers and widows  it increased the infantry force on the island considerably so that in the course of a few years there were added to it a robert william and edward young with a little sister named dolly young to keep them in countenance  there also came a jane quintal and an arthur quintal who were closely followed by a rebecca adams and a james young  so that the selfimposed cares and burdens of that pretty active and selfdenying little creature otaheitan sally increased with her years and stature  before the most of these made their appearance however the poor otaheitan wives and widows became downcast and discontented  one cannot wonder at this  accustomed though they no doubt had been to war and bloodshed on their native island they must have been shocked beyond measure by the scenes of brutality and murder through which they had passed  the most of them being now without husbands and the men who remained being not on very amicable terms among themselves these poor creatures seem to have been driven to a state of desperation for they began to pine for their old home and actually made up their minds to quit the island in one of the bountys old boats and leave the white men and even the children behind them  see note 1  the old boat turned out to be so leaky however that they were compelled to return  but they did not cease to repine and to desire deliverance  gentlespirited and tractable though they undoubtedly were they had evidently been tried beyond their powers of endurance they were roused and when meek people are roused they not unfrequently give their friends and acquaintances to say nothing of those nearer a considerable surprise  matthew quintal who had a good deal of sly humour about him eventually hit on a plan to quiet them at least for a time  what makes you so grumpy old girl he said one day to his wife while eating his dinner under the shade of a palmtree  we wiss to go home she replied in a plaintive tone  well well you shall go home so dont let your spirits go down  if youve got tired of me lass youre not worth keeping  well set to work and build you a new boat out o the old un  well begin this very day and when its finished you may up anchor and away to otaheite or timbuctoo for all that i care  the poor woman seemed pleased to hear this and true to his word quintal set to work that very day with mccoy whom he persuaded to assist him  his friend thought that quintal was only jesting about the women and that in reality he meant to build a serviceable boat for fishing purposes  young and adams took little notice of what the other two were about but one day when the former came down to the beach on bounty bay he could not help remarking on the strange shape of the boat  itll never float he remarked with a look of surprise  its not wanted to float replied quintal at least not just yet  we can make it float well enough with a few improvements afterwards  young looked still more surprised but when quintal whispered something in his ear he laughed and went away  the boat was soon ready for it was to some extent merely a modification of the old boat  then all the women were desired to get into it and push off to see how it did  get in carefully now old girls said quintal with a leer  lay hold of the oars and well shove you through the first o the surf  lend a hand mccoy  now then give way allhi  with a vigorous shove the two men sent the boat shooting through the surf which was unusually low that day  young and adams with some of the children stood on the rocks and looked on  the women lay to their oars like men and the boat leaped like a flyingfish through the surf into deep water  forgetting in the excitement of the moment the object they had in view the poor things shouted and laughed with glee but they dipped their oars with sad irregularity and the boat began to rock in a violent manner  then youngs wife susannah caught what in nautical parlance is called a crab that is she missed her stroke and fell backwards into the bottom of the boat  with that readiness to render help which was a characteristic of these women christians widow mainmast leaped up to assist the fallen susannah  it only wanted this to destroy the equilibrium of the boat altogether  it turned bottom up in a moment and left the female crew floundering in the sea  to women of civilised lands this might have been a serious accident but to these otaheitan ladies it was a mere trifle  each had been able to swim like a duck from earliest childhood  indeed it was evident that some of their own little ones were equally gifted for several of them led by sally plunged into the surf and went out to meet their parents as they swam ashore  the men laughed heartily and after securing the boat and hauling it up on the beach returned to the settlement whither the women had gone before them to change their garments  this incident effectually cured the native women of any intention to escape from the island at least by boat but it did not tend to calm their feelings  on the contrary it seemed to have the effect of filling them with a thirst for vengeance and they spent part of that day in whispered plottings against the men  they determined to take their lives that very night  while they were thus engaged their innocent offspring were playing about the settlement at different games screaming at times with vehement delight and making the palmgroves ring with laughter  the bright sun shone equally upon the heads that whirled with merriment and those that throbbed with dark despair  suddenly in the midst of her play little sally came to an abrupt pause  she missed little matt quintal from the group  wheres he gone charlie she demanded of her favourite playmate whose name she had by that time learned to pronounce  i dunno answered charlie whose language partook more of the nautical tone of quintal than of his late father  dyou know danl she asked of little mccoy  i dunno nuffin replied dan xcep hes not here  well i must go an seek im  you stop an play here  i leave em in your care toc  see you be good  it would have amused you reader if you had seen with your bodily eyes the little creatures who were thus warned to be good  even dan mccoy who was considered out and out the worst of them might have sat to rubens for a cherub and as for the others they were we might almost say appallingly good  thursday october in particular was the very personification of innocence  it would have been much more appropriate to have named him sunday july because in his meek countenance goodness and beauty sat enthroned  of course we do not mean to say that these children were good from principle  they had no principle at that time  no their actuating motive was selfishness but it was not concentrated regardless selfishness and it was beautifully counteracted by natural amiability of temperament  but they were quite capable of sin  for instance when sally had left them to search for her lost sheep little dan mccoy moved by a desire for fun went up behind little charlie christian and gave him an unmerited kick  it chanced to be a painful kick and charlie without a thought of resentment or revenge immediately opened his mouth shut his eyes and roared  horrified by this unexpected result little dan also shut his eyes opened his mouth and roared  the face that charlie made in these circumstances was so ineffably funny that toc burst into uncontrollable laughter  hearing this the roarers opened their eyes slid quickly into the same key and tumbled head over heels on the grass in which evolutions they were imitated by the whole party except such as had not at that time passed beyond the staggering age  meanwhile sally searched the neighbouring bush in vain then bethinking her that matt quintal who was fond of dangerous places might have clambered down to the rocks to bathe she made the best of her way to the beach at a place which being somewhat difficult of access from above was seldom visited by any save the wild and venturesome  she had only descended a few yards when she met the lost one clambering up in frantic haste panting violently his fat cheeks on fire and his large eyes blazing  oh matt what is it she exclaimed awestruck at the sight of him  sipsip he cried with labouring breath as he pointed with one hand eagerly to the sea and with the other to the shore bin men down darelook got suffin  oh  a prolonged groan of despair escaped the child as he fumbled in a trouserspocket and pushed three fingers through a hole in the bottom of it  its hoed through  whats hoed through asked sally with quick sympathy trying to console the urchin for some loss he had sustained  de knife exclaimed little dan with a face of blank woe  the knife what knife  but dont cry dear if you lost it through that hole it must be lying on the track you know somewhere between us and the beach  this happy thought did not seem to have occurred to matt whose cheeks at once resumed their flush and his eyes their blaze  taking his hand sally led him down the track  they looked carefully as they went and had not gone far when matt sprang forward with a scream of delight and picked up a claspknife  it was by no means a valuable one  it had a buckhorn handle and its solitary blade besides being broken at the point was affected with rust and tobacco in about equal proportions  oh matt where did you find it  come down and you see he exclaimed pointing with greater excitement than ever to the beach below  they were soon down and there on the margin of the woods they found a heap of cocoanut shells scattered about  found de knife dere said matt pointing to the midst of the shells and speaking in a low earnest voice as if the subject were a solemn one  oh exclaimed sally under her breath  an look here said matt leading the girl to a sandy spot close by they both stood transfixed and silent for there were strange footprints on the sand  they could not be mistaken  sally and matt knew every foot and every shoe white or black in pitcairn  the marks before them had been made by unknown shoes  just in proportion as youth is more susceptible of astonishment than age so was the surprise of those little ones immeasurably greater than that of robinson crusoe in similar circumstances  with awestruck faces they traced the footprints down to the waters edge  then for the first time it struck matt that he had forgotten something  oh me forget de sipde sip he cried and pointed out to sea  sally raised her eyes and uttered an exclamation of fresh astonishment as well she might for there like a seagull on the blue wave was a ship under full sail  it was faroff nearly on the horizon but quite distinct and large enough to be recognised  of course the gazers were spellbound again  it was the first real ship they had ever seen but they easily recognised it being familiar with mans floating prisons from the frequent descriptions given to them by john adams and especially from a drawing made by him years ago on the back of an old letter representing a fullrigged manofwar  this masterpiece of fine art had been nailed up on the walls of john adamss hut and had been fully expounded to each child in succession as soon after its birth as was consistent with commonsensesometimes sooner  suddenly otaheitan sally recovered herself  come matt we must run home an tell what weve seen  away they went like two goats up the cliffs  panting and blazing they charged down on their amazed playmates shouting a sip a sip but never turning aside nor slacking their pace until they burst with the news on the astonished mutineers  something more than astonishment however mingled with the feelings of the seamen and it was not until they had handled the knife and visited the sandy cove and seen the footprints and beheld the vessel herself that they became fully convinced that she had really been close to the island that men had apparently landed to gather cocoanuts and had gone away without having discovered the settlement which was hid from their view by the high cliffs to the eastward of bounty bay  the vessel had increased her distance so much by the time the men reached the cove that it was impossible to make out what she was  a manowar mayhap sent to search for us suggested quintal  not likely said adams  if shed bin sent to search for us she wouldnt have contented herself with only pickin a few nuts  i should say she is a trader that has got out of her course said young but whatever she is weve seen the last of her  im not sure that i wouldnt have run the risk of having our hidingplace found out and of being hung for the sake of seeing once more the fresh face of a white man  he spoke with a touch of sadness in his tone which contrasted forcibly with the remark that followed  its little i would care about the risk o bein scragged said quintal if i could only once more have a stiff glass o grog an a pipe o good strong genuine baccy  youll maybe have the first sooner than you think observed mccoy with a look of intelligence  what dye mean asked quintal  ax no questions an youll be told no lies was mccoys polite rejoinder to which quintal returned a not less complimentary remark and followed young and adams who had already begun to reascend the cliffs  this little glimpse of the great outer world was obtained by the mutineers in 1795 and was the only break of the kind that occurred during a residence of many years on the lonely island    note 1  we are led to this conclusion in regard to the children by the fact that in the various records which tell us of these women attempting their flight no mention is made of the children being with them    chapter seventeen  the clouds grow thicker and blacker  this glimpse of a stray vessel left a deep impression on the minds of the exiles for many days and it so far influenced the women that they postponed their scheme of vengeance for some time  it must not be supposed however that all of those women whom we have described as being so gentle in character were suddenly transformed into demons  it was only two or three of the more energetic and passionate among them who stirred up the rest and forced them to fall in with their views  these passionate ones were the widows of the men who had been slain  they not only felt their loss most bitterly but became almost mad with the despair caused by their forlorn condition and the apparent hopelessness of deliverance  the sight of the passing ship had diverted their thoughts for a time perhaps had infused a little hope but when the excitement died down they renewed their plots against the men and at last made a desperate attempt to carry them out  it was on a dark and stormy night  thunder was rolling in the sky lightning flashed among the mountainpeaks  rain the first that had descended for many days fell in fitful showers  it must have seemed to the women either that the elements sympathised with them or that the extreme darkness was favourable to the execution of their plan for about midnight one of them rose from her bed and crept noiselessly to the corner of her hut where she had seen quintal deposit a loaded musket the previous day  possessing herself of the weapon she went straight to the widow of fletcher christian and wakened her  she rose somewhat reluctantly and followed the woman whose face was concealed in a kerchief of native cloth  the two then went cautiously to another hat where two of the wives of the murdered otaheitans awaited them the one with a long knife the other with an axe in her hand  they whispered together for a few seconds  as they did so there came a tremendous crash of thunder followed by a flash which revealed the dark heads and glistening eyeballs drawn together in a group  we had better not try tonight said one voice timidly  faint heart you may stay behind replied another voice firmly come let us not delay  they were cruel we will be cruel too  they all crouched down and seemed to melt into the dark earth  when the next lightningflash rent the heavens they were gone  lying in his bunk opposite the door of his house that night john adams lay half asleep and halfconscious of the storm outside  as he lay with closed eyes there came a glaring flash of light  it revealed in the open doorway several pallid faces and glistening eyeballs  a strange dream thought adams stranger still to dream of dreaming  the thunderclap that followed was mingled with a crash a burst of smoke and a shriek that caused adams to leap from his couch as a bullet whistled past his ear  in the succeeding lightningflash he beheld a woman near him with an uplifted axe another with a gleaming knife and edward young who slept in his house that night in the act of leaping upon her  adams was prompt to act on all occasions  he caught the uplifted axe and wrenching it from her grasp thrust the woman out of the door  there he said quietly go thy way lass  i dont care to know which of ees done it  let the other one go too mr young  its not worth while making a work about it  the midshipman obeyed and going to a shelf in a corner took down a torch made of small nuts strung on a palmspine struck a light and kindled it  poor things he said im sorry for them  theyve had hard times here  they wont try it again remarked adams as he closed the door and quietly turned again into his sleepingbunk  but john adams was wrong  foiled though they were on this occasion and glad though some of them must have been at their failure there were one or two who could not rest and who afterwards made another attempt on the lives of the men  this also failed  the first offence had been freely forgiven but this time it was intimated that if another attempt were made they should all be put to death  fortunately the courage of even the most violent of the women had been exhausted  to the relief of the others they gave up their murderous designs and settled down into that state of submission which was natural to them  one might have thought that now at last the little colony of pitcairn had passed its worst days most of the disturbing elements having been removed but there was yet one other cloud the blackest of all to burst over them  one of the worlds greatest curses was about to be introduced among them  it happened thus  one night william mccoy went to his house up on the mountainside entered it and shut and bolted the door  this was an unusual proceeding on his part and had no connection with the recent attempts at murder made by the women because he was quite fearless in regard to that and scoffed at the possibility of being killed by women  he also carefully fastened the windowshutters  he appeared to be somewhat excited and went about his operations with an air at once of slyness and of mystery  a small torch or nutcandle which he lighted and set on a bracket on the wall gave out a faint flickering light which barely rendered darkness visible and from its position threw parts of the chamber into deepest gloom  it looked not unlike what we suppose would be the laboratory of an alchemist of the olden time and mccoy himself with his eager yet frowning visage a nativemade hat slouched over his brows and a piece of native cloth thrown over his shoulders like a plaid was no bad representative of an old doctor toiling for the secrets that turn base metal into gold and old age into youthsecrets by the way which have been lying open to mans hand for centuries in the word of god  taking down from a shelf a large kettle which had formed part of the furniture of the bounty and a twisted metal pipe derived from the same source he fitted them up on a species of stove or oven made of clay  the darkness of the place rendered his movements not very obvious but he appeared to put something into the kettle and fill it with water  then he put charcoal into the oven kindled it and blew it laboriously with his mouth until it became redhot  this flameless fire did not tend much to enlighten surrounding objects it merely added to them a lurid tinge of red  the operators face being close in front of the fire as he blew seemed almost as hot as the glowing coals  with patient watchfulness he sat there crouching over the fire for several hours occasionally blowing it up or adding more fuel  as the experiment went on mccoys eyes seemed to dilate with expectation and his breathing quickened  after a time he rose and lifted a bottle out of a tub of water near the stove  the bottle was attached to one end of the twisted tube which was connected with the kettle on the fire  detaching it therefrom he raised it quickly to the light  then he put it to his nose and smelt it  as he did so his face lit up with an expression of delight  taking down from a shelf a cocoanut cup he poured into it some sparkling liquid from the bottle it is a question which at that moment sparkled most mccoys eyes or the liquid  he sipped a little and his rough visage broke into a beaming smile  he drank it all and then he smacked his lips and laughednot quite a joyous laugh but a wild fierce triumphant laugh such as one might imagine would issue from the panting lips of some stout victor of the olden time as he clutched a muchcoveted prize after slaying some halfdozen enemies  ha ha  ive got it at last he cried aloud smacking his lips again  and so he had  long and earnestly had he laboured to make use of a fatal piece of knowledge which he possessed  among the hills of scotland mccoy had learned the art of making ardent spirits  after many failures he had on this night made a successful attempt with the tiroot which grew in abundance on pitcairn  the spirit was at last produced  as the liquid ran burning down his throat the memory of a passion which he had not felt for years came back upon him with overwhelming force  in his newborn ecstasy he uttered a wild cheer and filling more spirit into the cup quaffed it again  splendid he cried firstrate  hurrah  a tremendous knocking at the door checked him and arrested his hand as he was about to fill another cup  whos that he demanded angrily  open the door an youll see  the voice was that of matthew quintal  mccoy let him in at once  see here he cried eagerly holding up the bottle with a leer ive got it at last  so any deaf man might have found out by the way youve bin shoutin it why didnt you open sooner  never heard you matt  was too much engaged with my new friend i suppose  come ill introdooce him to you  look alive then growled quintal impatiently for he seemed to have smelt the spirit as the warhorse is said to smell the battle from afar give us hold o the cup and fill up fill up i say to the brim none o your half measures for me  he took a mouthful rolled it round and round with his tongue once or twice and swallowed it  heh thats it once more  come heres your health mccoy  well be better friends than ever now good luck to ee  mccoy thought that there was room for improvement in their friendship but said nothing as he watched his comrade pour the fiery liquid slowly down his throat as if he wished to prolong the sensation  another he said holding out the cup  no no drink fair matt quintal wotever you do drink fair  its my turn now  your turn retorted quintal fiercely why youve bin swillin away for halfanhour before i came  no matt no honour bright  id only just begun  but come we wont quarrel over it  heres the other half o the nut so well drink together  now hold steady  more need for me to give you that advice you shake the bottle as if youd got the ague  if you spill a drop now illill flatten your big nose on your ugly face  not in the least hurt by such uncomplimentary threats mccoy smiled as he filled the cup held by his comrade  the spirit was beginning to tell on him and the smile was of that imbecile character which denotes perfect selfsatisfaction and goodwill  having poured the remainder into his own cup he refixed the bottle to the tube of the still and while more of the liquid was being extracted the cronies sat down on low stools before the stove to spend a pleasant evening in poisoning themselves  it may be interesting and instructive though somewhat sad to trace the steps by which those two men formed originally in gods image reduced themselves of their own free will to a level much lower than that of the brutes  doesnt the taste of it bring back old times said mccoy holding his cup to the light as he might have held up a transparent glass  ay assented quintal gradually becoming amiable the good old times before that fool fletcher christian indooced us to jine him  heres to ee lad once more  why when i think o the jolly times ive had at the blue boar of plymouth said mccoy or at the swan wi the two throttles inini forget where i feeli feellikelikeheres your health again matt quintal  give us your flipper man  youre not a bad feller if you wasnt given to grumpin so much  quintals amiability even when roused to excess by drink was easily dissipated  the free remarks of his comrade did not tend to increase it but he said nothing and refreshed himself with another sip  i really do think continued mccoy looking at his companion with an intensity of feeling which is not describable i really do think that thatwhen i think o that blue boar i could amost become poetical  if you did growled quintal you would not be the first that had become a big fool on a worse subjec  i shay matt quintal returned the other who was beginning to talk rather thickly so powerful was the effect of the liquor on his unaccustomed nerves i shay ole feller you used to sing well once come ggive us a stave now  bah was quintals reply with a look of undisguised contempt  jusso  xactly my opinion about it  well as you wont sing ill give you a ditty myself  hereupon mccoy struck up a song which being deficient in taste while its execution was defective as well as tuneless did not seem to produce much effect on quintal  he bore it with equanimity until mccoy came to a note so far beyond his powers that he broke into a shriek  come get some more drink growled his comrade pointing to the still it must be ready by this time  shum more drink exclaimed mccoy with a look of indignant surprise then sliding into a smile of imbecile goodhumour you shlaveit my boy you shlaveit  he unfixed the bottle with an unsteady hand and winking with dreadful solemnity filled up his companions cup  then he filled his own and sat down to resume his song  but quintal could stand no more of it he ordered his comrade to stop his noise  shtop my noise exclaimed mccoy with a look of lofty disdain  yes stop it an lets talk  well im wwillin t talk returned mccoy after a grave and thoughtful pause  they chose politics as a light agreeable subject of conversation  now you see s my pinion matt that them coves upt th admiralty dont know no more how to guvn this country than they knows how to work a turks head on a manrope  praps not replied quintal with a look of wise solemnity  norabiton it continued mccoy becoming earnest  an wot on earths the use o the lords an commons an war office  wy dont they slump em all together into one ouse an get the archbishop o cantingbury to bless em all right off same as the pope does  thats were it is  dye see  thats were the shoe pinches  ah an what would you make o the king demanded quintal with an argumentative frown  the king eh said mccoy bringing his fuddled mind to bear on this royal difficulty the king eh  why idid make lopscouse o the king  come thats treason  you shant speak treason in my company bill mccoy  im a manowars man  it wont do to shove treason in the face of a marowaar  if i am a mutineer wat o that  ill let no other man haul down my colours  so dont go shovin treason at me bill mccoy  ill shove treason werever i please said mccoy fiercely  no you shant  yes i shall  from this point the conversation became very contradictory in tone then recriminative and after that personally abusive  at last quintal losing temper threw the remains of his last cup of spirits in his friends face  mccoy at once hit quintal on the nose  he returned wildly on the eye and jumping up the two grappled in fierce anger  they were both powerful men whose natural tendency to personal violence towards each other had up to this time been restrained by prudence but now that the great destroyer of sense and sanity was once again coursing through their veins there was nothing to check them  all the grudges and bitternesses of the past few years seemed to have been revived and concentrated on that night and they struggled about the little room with the fury of madmen striking out savagely but with comparatively little effect because of excessive passion coupled with intoxication clutching and tugging at each others whiskers and hair and cursing with dreadful sincerity  there was little furniture in the room but what there was they smashed in pieces  quintal flung mccoy on the table and jumping on the top of him broke it down  the other managed to get on his legs again clutched quintal by the throat and thrust him backward with such violence that he went crashing against the little windowshutters split them up and drove them out  in one of their wildest bursts they both fell into the fireplace overturned the still and scattered the fire fortunately the embers were nearly out by this time  tumbling over the stools and wreck these menwho had begun the evening as friends continued it as fools and ended it as fiendsfell side by side into one of the sleepingbunks the bottom of which was driven down by the shock as they sank exhausted amid the wreck foaming with passion and covered with blood  this was the climax they fell into a state of partial insensibility which degenerated at last into a deep lethargic slumber  hitherto the quarrels and fights that had so disturbed the peace of pitcairn and darkened her moral sky had been at least intelligently founded on hatred or revenge with a definite object and murderous end in view  now for the first time a furious battle had been fought for nothing with no object to be gained and no end in view with besotted idiots for the champions and with strong drink for the cause    chapter eighteen  aquatic amusements  now it must not be supposed that the wives and widows of these mutineers gave themselves up to moping or sadness after the failure of their wild attempt to make their condition worse by slaying all the men by no means  by degrees they recovered the natural tone of their mild yet hearty dispositions and at last we presume came to wonder that they had ever been so mad or so bad  neither must it be imagined that these women were condemned to be the laborious drudges who are fitly described as hewers of wood and drawers of water  they did indeed draw a good deal of water in the course of each day but they spent much time also in making the tapa cloth with which they repaired the wornout clothes of their husbands or fabricated petticoats for themselves and such of the children as had grown old enough to require such garments  but besides these occupations they spent a portion of their time in prattling gossip which whatever the subject might be was always accompanied with a great deal of merriment and hearty laughter  they also spent no small portion of their time in the sea for bathing was one of the favourite amusements of the pitcairners young and old  coming up one day to susannah the wife of edward young thursday october christian begged that she would go with him and bathe  susannah was engaged in making the native cloth at the time and laid down her mallet with a look of indecision  it may be remarked here that a mallet is used in the making of this cloth which is not woven but beaten out from a state of pulp it is in fact rather a species of tough paper than cloth and is produced from the bark of the paper mulberry  is got to finish dis bit of cloth today toc said susannah in broken english for she knew that master thursday october preferred that tongue to otaheitan though he could speak both an its gettin late  oh what a pity said toc with a look of mild disappointment  now susannah was by far the youngest and most girlish among the otaheitan women and could not resist an appeal to her feelings even when uttered only by the eyes  besides little toc was a great favourite with her  she therefore burst into a merry laugh gently pulled thursdays nose and said well come along but well git some o the others for go too an have some fun  you go klect de jumpers me git de womans  susannah referred to the older children by the term jumpers  highly pleased the urchin started off at once  he found one of the jumpers namely otaheitan sally nursing polly young while she delivered an oracular discourse to charlie christian who sat at her feet meekly receiving and believing the most outrageous nonsense that ever was heard  it is but just to sally however to say that she gave her information in all good faith having been previously instructed by john adams whose desire for the good of the young people was at that period stronger than his love of truth  wishing to keep their minds as long as possible ignorant of the outer world he had told them that ships came out of a hole in the clouds on the horizon  yes charlie its quite true father adams says so  they comes out of a hole on the horizon  charlies huge eyes gazed in perplexity from his instructors face to the horizon as if he expected to behold a ship emerging from a hole then and there  then turning to sally again with a simple look he asked  but why does sips come out of holes on de rizon  sally was silenced  she was not the first knowing one who had been silenced by a child  little daniel mccoy came up at the moment  having passed the staggering period of life he no longer walked the earth in a state of nudity but was decorated with a pair of very short tapa trousers cut in imitation of seafaring ducks but reaching only to the knees  he also wore a little shirt  me kin tell why ships come out ob de hole in de horizon he said with a twinkle in his eyes just for notin else dan to turn about an go back into de hole again  nonsense danl cried sally with a laugh  nonsense repeated dan with an injured look  didnt you sawd it happen jus tother day  well i did saw the ship go farer an farer away an vanish admitted sall but he didnt go into a hole that time  pooh ejaculated little dan dats cause de hole was too far away to be seen  further discussion of the subject was prevented by the arrival of thursday  well toc yous in a hurry today said little dan with a look of innocent insolence  were all to go an bathe childn cried thursday with a look of delight susannahs goin an all the oomans an she send me for you  hurrah shouted dan and sally  goin to bave cried charlie christian to lizzie mills who was attracted by the cheering which also brought up matt quintal who led his little sister sarah by the hand  sarah was yet a staggerer and so was dinah adams also mary christian polly young and john mills had not yet attained even to the staggering periodthey were only what little dan mccoy called sprawlers  before many minutes had elapsed the whole colony of women jumpers staggerers and sprawlers were assembled on the beach at bounty bay  it could scarcely be said that the women undressedthey merely threw off the light scarf or bodice that covered their shoulders but kept on the short skirts which were no impediment to their graceful movements in the water  the jumpers of course were only too glad of the excuse to get out of their very meagre allowance of clothing and the rest were so to speak naturally ready for the plunge  it was a splendid forenoon  there was not a zephyr to ruffle the calm breast of the pacific nevertheless the gentle undulation of that mighty bosom sent wave after wave like green liquid walls into the bay in ceaseless regularity  these toppling over and breaking and coming in with a succession of magnificent roars finally hissed in harmless foam on the shingly beach  now tursday said mrs adams you stop here an take care o de sprawlers  adamss helpmate was the oldest of the women and defective in vision her commands were law  thursday october would as soon have thought of disobeying adams himself as his wife  it was not in his nature despite its goodness to help feeling disappointed at being left in charge of the little ones  however he made up his mind at once to the sacrifice  never mind toc said youngs wife with a bright smile ill stay an keep you company  this was ample compensation to thursday  he immediately flung himself into the shallow surf and turning his face to the land held out his arms and dared the little ones to come to him  two of them instantly accepted the challenge crept down to the water and were beaten back by the next rush of foam  but they were caught up and held aloft with a shout of glee by susannah  meanwhile the women advanced into the deep surf with the small children on their shoulders while the others being able to look after themselves followed panting with excitement for although able to swim like corks they found it extremely difficult to do battle with the rushing water  deeper and deeper the foremost women went until they neared the unbroken glassy billows  ill go at de nixt muttered mrs adams to mary christian who was on her back clutching tight round her neck  the nixt was a liquid wall that came rolling grandly in with everincreasing force and volume until it hovered to its fall almost over the heads of the daring women  mrs adams mainmast and millss widow who were the foremost of the group bent their heads forward and with a graceful but vigorous plunge sprang straight into the wall of water and went right through it  the others though a moment later were quite in time  the children also uttering wild screams in varied keys faced the billow gallantly and pierced it like needles  another moment and they were all safe in deep water on the seaward side while the wave went thundering to the shore in a tumultuous wilderness of foam and spent its weakened force among the babies  the moment the women were safe beyond the rolling influence of these great waves in the calm sea beyond they threw the staggerers from their shoulders and let them try their own unaided powers while the jumpers swam and floated around to watch the result  these wonderful infants disported themselves variously in the sea  mary christian wobbled about easily as if too fat to sink and bessy mills supported herself bravely being much encouraged by the presence and the cheering remarks of that humorous imp dan mccoy  but charlie christian showed symptoms of alarm and losing heart after a few moments threw up his fat little arms and sank  like the swooping eagle his mother plunged forward placed a hand under him and lifted him on her shoulders where he recovered equanimity in a few minutes and soon wanted to be again sent afloat  when this had gone on for a little time the women reshouldered their babies and swam boldly out to sea followed at various distances by the youngsters  of these latter sall of otaheite was by far the best  she easily outstripped the other children and could almost keep pace with the women  meanwhile thursday october christian and susannah young performed amazing feats with the infants in the shallow water on the beach  sarah quintal and johnny mills gave them some trouble having a strong disposition to explore places beyond their depth but dinah adams and polly young were as good as gold spluttering towards their guardians when called and showing no tendency to do anything of their own immediate free will except sit on the sand and let the foam rush round and over them like soapsuds  now it is wellknown that every now and then there are waves of the sea which seem to have been born on a gigantic scale and which emerging somewhere from the great deep come to shore with a grander roar and a higher rush than ordinary waves  one such roller came in while no one was on the lookout for it  its deeptoned roar first apprised susannah of its approach but before she could run to the rescue its white crest was careering up the beach in magnificent style  it caught the infants each sitting with a look of innocent surprise on the sand  it turned them head over heels and swept them up the shingly shore  it tumbled susannah herself over in its might and swept thursday october fairly off his legs  having terminated its career thus playfully the big wave retired carrying four babies in its embrace  but susannah and thursday had regained their footing and their presence of mind  with a brave and for him a rapid spring thursday caught little sarah and dinah as they were rolling helpless down the strand the one by an arm the other by a leg and held on  at the same instant susannah sprang forward and grasped jack mills by the hair of the head but poor polly young was beyond her reach  little polly was the smallest the neatest and the dearest of the sprawling band  she was rolling to her doom  the case was desperate  in this emergency susannah suddenly hurled jack mills at thursday  the poor boy had to drop the other two in order to catch the flying jack but the other two sliding down his body held each to a thursday october leg like limpets  the result was that the four remained firm and safe while susannah leaped into the surf and rescued little poll  it all happened so quickly that the actors had scarcely time to think having reached the dry land they looked seaward and there saw their more practised companions about to come in on the top of a wave  for a few seconds their heads were seen bobbing now on the top now between the hollows of the waves  then they were seen on a towering snowy crest which was just about to fall  on the summit of the roaring wave as if on a snowy mountain they came rushing on with railway speed  to an unpractised eye destruction among the rocks was their doom  but they had taken good aim and came careering to the sandy patch where the little ones sprawled  in another moment they stood safe and sound upon the land  this was but an everyday feat of the pitcairners who went up to their village chatting merrily and thinking nothing more about the adventure than that it was capital fun    chapter nineteen  the darkest hour  a long time after the events narrated in the last chapter john adams and edward young sat together one evening in the cave at the top of the mountain where poor fletcher christian had been wont to hold his lonely vigils  ive bin thinkin of late said young that it is very foolish of us to content ourselves with merely fishing from the rocks when there are better fish to be had in deep water and plenty of material at hand for making canoes  youre right sir we ought to try our hands at a canoe  pity we didnt do so before the native men was all killed  they knew what sort o trees to use and how to split em up into planks an all that sort o thing  but mccoy used to study that subject and talk much about it when we were in otaheite returned young  ive no doubt that with his aid we could build a good enough canoe and the women would be as able as the men no doubt to direct us what to do if we were in a difficulty mccoy is a handy fellow you know with tools as he has proved more than once since the death of poor williams  adams shook his head  no doubt mr young hes handy enough with the tools but ever since he discovered how to make spirits neither he nor quintal as you know sir are fit for anything  true said young with a perplexed look it never occurred to me before that strong drink was such a curse  i begin now to understand why some men that i have known have been so enthusiastic in their outcry against it  perhaps it would be right for you and me to refuse to drink with quintal and mccoy seeing that they are evidently killing themselves with it  i dont quite see that sir objected adams  a glass of grog dont do me no harm that i knows of an it wouldnt do them no good if we was to stop our allowance  it might who can tell said young  ive not thought much about the matter however so we wont discuss it  but what would you say if we were to hide the kettle that mccoy makes it in and refuse to give it up till the canoe is finished  again adams shook his head  theyd both go mad with dt said he by which letters he referred to the drunkards awful disease delirium tremens  well at all events we will try to persuade him to go to work and the sooner the better said young rising and leaving the cave  in pursuance of this plan young spoke to mccoy in one of his few sober moments and got him persuaded to begin the work and to drink less while engaged in it  under the impulse of this novelty in his occupation the unhappy man did make an attempt to curb himself and succeeded so far that he worked pretty steadily for several days and made considerable progress with the canoe  the wood was chosen the tree felled the trunk cut to the proper length and split up into very fair planks which were further smoothed by means of a stone adze brought by the natives from otaheite and it seemed as if the job would be quickly finished when the terrible demon by whom mccoy had been enslaved suddenly asserted his tyrannical power quintal who rendered no assistance in canoebuilding had employed himself in making a new brew as he expressed it and mccoy went up to his hut in the mountain one evening to taste  the result of course was that he was absolutely incapable of work next day and then giving way to the maddening desire he and his comradeindebauchery went in as they said for a regular spree  it lasted for more than a week and when it came to an end the two men with cracked lips bloodshot eyes and haggard faces looked as if they had just escaped from a madhouse  edward young now positively refused to drink any more of the spirits and adams although he would not go quite to that length restricted himself to one glass in the day  this at first enraged both quintal and mccoy  the former cursed his comrades in unmeasured terms and drank more deeply just to spite them the latter refused to work at the canoe and both men became so uproarious that young and adams were obliged to turn them out of the house where they were wont occasionally to meet for a social evening  thus things went on for many a day from bad to worse  bad as things had been in former years it seemed as if the profoundest depth of sin and misery had not yet been fathomed by these unhappy mutineers  in all these doings it would have gone hard with the poor women and children if adams and young had not increased in their kindness and consideration for them as the other two men became more savage and tyrannical  at last matters came to such a crisis that it became once more a matter of discussion with young and adams whether they should not destroy the machinery by which the spirits were made and it is probable that they might have done this if events had not occurred which rendered the act unnecessary  one day william mccoy was proceeding with a very uncertain step along the winding footpath that led to his house up in the mountain  the mans face worked convulsively and it seemed as if terrible thoughts filled his brain  muttering to himself as he staggered along he suddenly met his own son who had grown apace by that time being nearly seven years of age  both father and son stopped abruptly and looked intently at each other  what brings you here demanded the father with a look of as much dignity as it was in his power to assume  the poor boy hesitated and looked frightened  his natural spirit of fun and frolic seemed of late to have forsaken him  what are ee afraid of roared mccoy who had not quite recovered from his last fit of delirium tremens  why dont ee speak  mothers not well said daniel softly she bid me come and tell you  whats that to me cried mccoy savagely  come here dan  he lowered his tone and held out his hand but the poor boy was afraid to approach  uttering a low growl the father made a rush at him stumbled over a treeroot and fell heavily to the earth  little dan darted into the bush and fled home  rising slowly mccoy looked halfstunned at first but speedily recovering himself staggered on till he reached the hut when he wildly seized the bottle from its shelf and put it to his lips which were bleeding from the fall and covered with dust  ha ha he shouted while the light of delirium rekindled in his eyes this is the grand cure for everything  my own sons afraid o me now but who cares  whats that to bill mccoy an his mothers ill too ha  he checked himself in the middle of a fierce laugh and stared before him as if horrorstricken  no no he gasped  ii didnt  oh  god be merciful to me  again he stopped raised both hands high above his head uttered a wild laugh which terminated in a prolonged yell as he dashed the bottle on the floor and darted from the hut  all the strength and vigour which the wretched man had squandered seemed to come back to him in that hour  the swiftness of youth returned to his limbs  he ran down the path by which he had just come and passed quintal on the way  hallo bill youre pretty bad tonight said his comrade looking after him  he then followed at a smart run as if some new idea had suddenly occurred to him  two of the women met mccoy further down but as if to evade them he darted away to the right along the track leading to the eastward cliffs  the women joined quintal in pursuit but before they came near him they saw him rush to the highest part of the cliffs and leap up into the air turning completely over as he vanished from their sight  at that spot the cliff appeared to overhang its base and was several hundred feet high  far down there was a projecting rock where seagulls clustered in great numbers  mccoy like the lightningflash came in contact with the rock and was dashed violently out into space while the affrighted seabirds fled shrieking from the spot  next moment the mans mangled body cleft the dark water like an arrow leaving only a little spot of foam behind to mark for a few seconds his watery grave  it might have been thought that this terrible event would have had a sobering effect upon matthew quintal but instead of that it made him worse  the death of his wife too by a fall from the cliffs about the same time seemed only to have the effect of rendering him more savage insomuch that he became a terror to the whole community and frequently threatened to take the lives of his remaining comrades  in short the man seemed to have gone mad and young and adams resolved in selfdefence to put him to death  we spare the reader the sickening details  they accomplished the terrible deed with an axe and thus the number of the male refugees on pitcairn was reduced to two  the darkest hour of the lonely island had been reachedthe hour before the dawn    chapter twenty  the dawn of a better day  the eighteenth century passed away and as the nineteenth began its course a great and marvellous change came over the dwellers on the lonely island in that almost unknown region of the southern seas  it was a change both spiritual and physical the latter resulting from the former and both having their roots as all things good must have in the blessed laws of god  the change did not come instantaneously  it rose upon pitcairn with the sure but gradual influence of the morning dawn and its progress like its advent was unique in the history of the church of god  no preacher went forth to the ignorant people armed with the powers of a more or less correct theology  no prejudices had to be overcome or preexisting forms of idolatry uprooted and the people who had to be changed were what might have been deemed most unlikely soilmutineers murderers and their descendants  the one hopeful characteristic among them was the natural amiability of the women for young and adams did not display more than the average goodhumour of men yet these amiable women as we have seen twice plotted and attempted the destruction of the men and two of them murdered in cold blood two of their own kinsmen  it may perhaps have already been seen that young and adams were of a grave and earnest turn of mind  the terrible scenes which they had passed through naturally deepened this characteristic especially when they thought of the dreadful necessity which had been forced on them the deliberate slaying of matthew quintal an act which caused them to feel like murderers however justifiable it may have seemed to them  like most men who are under deep and serious impressions they kept their thoughts to themselves  indeed john adams with his grave matteroffact tendencies and undemonstrative disposition would probably never have opened his lips on spiritual things to his companion if young had not broken the ice and even when the latter did venture to do so adams resisted at first with the dogged resolution of an unbelieving man  weve been awful sinners john adams said young one afternoon as they were sauntering home from their plantations to dinner  well sir no doubt theres some truth in what you say replied adams slowly but then dye see weve bin placed in what you may call awful circumstances  thats true thats true returned young with a perplexed look and ive said the same thing or something like it to myself many a time but man the bible doesnt seem to harmonise with that idea somehow it seems to make no difference between big and little sinners so to speak at least as far as the matter of salvation is concerned and yet i cant help feeling somehow that men who have sinned much ought to repent much  just so sir said john adams with a selfsatisfied air youre right sir  we have been awful sinners as you say an now weve got to repent as hard as we can and lead better lives though of course we cant make much difference in our style o livin seein that our circumstances dont allow o much change an neither of us has bin much given to drink or swearin  strange rejoined young  you almost echo what ive been saying to myself over and over again yet i cant feel quite easy for if we have only got to repent and try to lead better lives whats the use of our talking about our saviour and what does the bible mean in such words as these believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved only believe  by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god  by the works of the law shall no flesh living be justified  do you mean to say sir that them words are all out of the bible asked adams  yes i know they are for i read them all this morning  i had a long hunt after the bible before i found it for poor christian never told me where he kept it  i turned it up at last under a bit of tarpaulin in the cave and ive been reading it a good deal since and i confess that ive been much puzzled  hold on a bit here he added stopping and seating himself on a flowering bank beside the path that old complaint of mine has been troubling me a good deal of late  lets rest a bit  young referred here to an asthmatic affection to which he was subject and which had begun to give him more annoyance since the catching of a severe cold while out shooting among the hills a year before  from what you say sir said adams thoughtfully after they had sat down it seems to me that if we can do nothing in the matter o workin out our salvation and have nothin to do but sit still an receive it we cant be to blame if we dont get it  but we may be to blame for refusing it when its offered returned young  besides the bible says ask and ye shall receive so that knocks away the ground from under your notion of sitting still  praps youre right sir continued adams after a few minutes thought during which he shook his head slowly as if not convinced but i cant help thinkin that if a man only does his best to do his dooty itll be all right with him  thats all thats required in his majestys service you know of any man  true but if a man doesnt do his best what then  or if he is so careless about learning his duty that he scarce knows what it is and in consequence falls into sundry gross mistakes what then  moreover suppose that you and i having both done our duty perfectly up to the time of the mutiny were now to go back to england and say like the bad boys we will never do it again what would come of it think you  wed both be hanged for certain answered adams with emphasis  well then the matter isnt as simple an you thought it at least according to your view  it is more puzzlin than i thought it returned adams but then thats no great wonder for if it puzzles you its no wonder that it should puzzle me who has had no edication whatever xcep what ive picked up in the streets  but it surprises meyoull excuse me mr youngthat you whos bin at school shouldnt have your mind more clear about religion  dont they teach it at school  they used to read a few verses of the bible where i was at school said young and the master who didnt seem to have any religion in himself read over a formal prayer but i fear that that didnt do us much good for we never listened to it  anyhow it could not be called religious teaching  but were you never at school adams  no sir not i answered the seaman with a quiet laugh leastwise not at a reglar trueblue school  i was brought up chiefly in the streets of london though thats a pretty good school too of its kind it teaches lads to be uncommon smart i tell you and up to a thing or two but it dont do much for us in the booklarnin way  i can scarcely read even now an what i have of it was got through spellin out the playbills in the publichouse windows  but what dye say sir now that we both seem inclined to turn over a new leaf if you was to turn schoolmaster an teach me to read and write a bit better than i can do at present  id promise to be a willin scholar an a good boy  not a bad idea said young with a laugh as he rose and continued the descent of the track leading to the settlement  the village had by this time improved very much in appearance good substantial cottages made of the tafano or flower wood and the aruni having taken the place of the original huts run up at the period of landing  some of the cottages were from forty to fifty feet long by fifteen wide and thirteen high  it was evident that ships were partly at least the model on which they had been constructed for the sleepingplaces were a row of berths opposite the door each with its separate little window or porthole  there were no fireplaces the range of the thermometer on the island being from 55 degrees to 85 degrees and all cooking operations were performed in detached outhouses and ovens  in the chief of these cottages might have been found among the many miscellaneous objects of use and ornament two articles which lay apart on a shelf and were guarded by young and adams with almost reverential care  these were the chronometer and the azimuth compass of the bounty  the cottages some of which had two stories were arranged so as to enclose a large grassy square which was guarded by a strong palisade from the encroachments of errant hogs goats and fowls  this spot among other uses served as a convenient daynursery for the babies and also a place of occasional frolic and recreation to the elder children  to the first of these was added not long after the death of their respective fathers edward quintal and catherine mccoy  to john adams also a daughter was born whom he named hannah after a poor girl who had been in the habit of chucking him under the chin and giving him sugarplums when he was an arab in the streets of londonat least so he jestingly remarked to his spouse on the day she presented the new baby to his notice  on the day of which we write young and adams found the square abovementioned in possession of the infantry under command of their selfelected captain otaheitan sally who was now according to john adams no longer a chicken  being in her eleventh year and like her countrywomen generally at that age far advanced towards big girlhood she presented a tall slight graceful and beautifully moulded figure with a sweet sprightly face and a smile that was ever disclosing her fine white teeth  her profusion of black hair was gathered into a knot which hung low on the back of her pretty round head  she was crowned with a wreath of wildflowers made and presented by her troops  it is needless to say that every one of these big and little was passionately attached to sally  chief among her admirers now as of old was charlie christian who being about eight years of age well grown and stalwart like his father was now almost as tall as his former nurse  charlie had not with years lost one jot of that intensely innocent and guileless look of childhood which inclined one to laugh while he merely cast earnest gaze into ones face but years had given to him a certain gravity and air of selfpossession which commanded respect even from that volatile imp his contemporary dan mccoy  thursday october christian who was less than a year younger than sally had also shot up into a longlegged boy and bade fair to become a tall and sturdy man  he like his brother was naturally grave and earnest but was easily roused to action and if he did not himself originate fun was ever ready to appreciate the antics and mild wickedness of dan mccoy or to burst into sudden and uproarious laughter at the tumbles or ludicrous doings of the sprawlers who rolled their plumpmade forms on the soft grass  not one of the band however had yet attained to the age which renders young people ashamed of childish play  when young and adams appeared on the scene sally her hair broken loose and the wreath confusedly mingled with it was flying round the square with dolly young on her shoulder and chased by charlie christian who pretended in the most obvious manner that he could not catch her  toc was sitting on the fence watching them and perceiving his brothers transparent hypocrisy was chuckling to himself with great delight  matt quintal and dan mccoy at the head of two opposing groups were engaged in playing french and english each group endeavouring to pull the other over a rope laid on the grass between them  several of the others being too little were not allowed to join in the game and contented themselves with general scrimmaging and skylarking while edward quintal catherine mccoy and hannah adams the most recent additions to the community rolled about in meaningless felicity  hold on hard shouted dan mccoy whose flushed face and blue eyes beamed and flashed under a mass of curling yellow hair and who was the foremost boy of the french band  im holdin on cried matt quintal who was intellectually rather obtuse  tight cried dan  tight repeated matt  there dont let gooh hup  the grasp of dan suddenly relaxed when matt and his englishmen were straining their utmost  of course they went back on the top of each other in a wild jumble while dan having put a foot well back was prepared and stood comparatively firm  you did that apurpose cried matt springing up and glaring  i know you did it apurpose retorted dan  butbut i said thatthat you did it apurpose stammered matt  well an didnt i say that you said that i said you did it apurpose  a yell of delight followed this reply in which however matt did not join  like his father matt quintal was short in the temperat least short for a pitcairn boy  he suddenly gave dan mccoy a dab on the nose with his fist  now as every one must know a dab on the nose is painful moreover it sometimes produces blood  dan mccoy who also inherited a shortish temper from his father feeling the pain and seeing the blood suddenly flushed to the temples and administered to matt a sounding slap on the side of the head which sent him tumbling on the grass  but matt was not conquered though overturned  jumping up he made a rush at dan who stood on the defensive  the other children being more gentle in their natures stood by and anticipated with feelings of awe the threatened encounter but thursday october christian who had listened with eager ears ever since his intelligence dawned to the conversations of the mutineers here stepped between the combatants  come come said he authoritatively in virtue of his greater age and superior size lets have fair play  if you must fight do it shipshape an accordin to the articles of war  we must form a ring first you know an get a bottle an a sponge and  an appalling yell at this point nearly froze the marrow in everybodys bones  it was caused by a huge pig which observing that the gate had been left open had entered the square and gone up to snuff at one of the nude babies who seated like a whiteybrown petrifaction gazed with a look of horror in the pigs placid face  if ever a pig in this sublunary sphere regretted a foolish act that pitcairn pig must have been steeped in repentance to the latest day of its life  with one howl in unison the entire field minus the infants ran at that pig like a human tornado  it was of no avail that the pig made straight for the gate by which it had entered  that gate had either removed or shut itself  in frantic haste the unhappy creature coursed round the square followed by its pursuers who soon caught it by the tail then by an ear then by the nose and the other ear and a fore leg and two hind ones and finally hurled it over the fence amid a torrent of shrieks which only a pitcairn pig could utter or a pitcairn mind conceive  it fell with a bursting squeak and retired in grumpy silence to ruminate over the dire consequences of a too earnest gaze in the face of a child  well done childn cried john adams  sarves him right  come now to grub all of you  even though the pitcairn children had been disobedient by nature they would have obeyed that order with alacrity  in a few brief minutes a profound silence proclaimed more clearly than could a trumpettongue that the inhabitants of the lonely island were at dinner    chapter twenty one  the last man  one morning john adams instead of going to work in his garden as was his wont took down his musket from its accustomed pegs above the door and sallied forth into the woods behind the village  he had not gone far when he heard a rustling of the leaves and looking back beheld the graceful form of sally bounding towards him  are you going to shoot father she said on coming up  the young people of the village had by this time got into the habit of calling adams father and regarded him as the head of the community not because of his age for at this time he was only between thirty and forty years but because of his sedate quiet character and a certain air of elderly wisdom which distinguished him  even edward young who was about the same age but more juvenile both in feeling and appearance felt the influence of his solid unpretending temperament and laughingly acknowledged him king of pitcairn  no dear im not goin to shoot said adams in reply im only going up to christians outlook to try if i can find somethin there an i always like to have the old blunderbuss with me  it feels sort of company you know an minds me of old times but youll not understand what i mean sall  no because ive no old times to mind about said sally with a peculiar smile  may i go with you father  of course you may  come along lass  adams held out his strong hand  sally put her peculiarly small one into it and the two went slowly up the mountaintrack together  on reaching the top of a little knoll or plateau they stopped and turned to look back  they could see over the tops of the palmgroves from that place  the track by which they had ascended was visible here and there winding among the flowering shrubs and trees  the village lay far below like a gem in a setting of bright green which contrasted pleasantly with the warm clouds and the blue sea beyond  the sun was bright and the air was calmso calm that the voices of the children at play came up to them distinctly in silvery ripples  how comes it sall that youve deserted your post today  because the guard has been relieved same as you say they do on board a manofwar  i left the sprawlers in charge of bessy mills and the staggerers are shut into the green  you see im feeling a little tired today and thought i would like to have a quiet walk in the woods  she finished this explanation with a little sigh  dear dear me exclaimed adams with a look of amused surprise youre not becomin sentimental are you sally  what is sentimental father  why its aits a sort of a feelina sensation you know a kind of alloverishness thatdye see  he stopped short and stared with a perplexed air at the girl who burst into a merry laugh  thats one of your puzzlers i think she said looking up slyly from the corners of her eyes  well sall that is a puzzler returned adams with a selfcondemning shake of the head  i never before felt so powerfully the want o dictionary knowledge  ill be shot if i can tell you what sentimental is though i know what it is as well as i know what sixwater grog or plumduff is  we must ask mr young to explain it hes bin to school you know an thats more than i havemores the pity  well said sally as they proceeded on their way whatever senti senti  mental said adams  whatever sentimental is im not that because im just the same as ever i was for i often want to be quiet and alone and i often am quiet and alone in the bush  and what do you think about sall when youre alone in the bush said the seaman looking down with more interest than usual at the innocent face beside him  oh about heaps and heaps of things  i couldnt tell you in a month all i think about but one thing i think most about is a manofwar  a manofwar sall  yes i would give anything to see a manofwar what youve so often told us about with all its masts and sails and bunks and guns and anchors and officers and men  i often wonder so much what new faces would be like  you see im so used to the faces of yourself and mr young and mainmast and susannah and toc and matt and dan and  just say the rest o the youngsters dear interrupted adams theres no use in goin over em all by name  well im so used to them that i cant fancy how any other faces can be different and yet i heard mr young say the other day that theres no two faces in the world exactly alike and you know there must be hundreds and hundreds of faces in the world  ay theres thousands and thousandsfor the matter o that theres millions and millions of eman its quite true that you cant ever pick out two that would fit into the same mould  of course continued adams in an argumentative tone im not goin for to say but that you could find a dozen men any day with hook noses an black eyes an lanky hair just as you can find another dozen with turnup noses an grey eyes an carroty hair but what i mean to say is that you wont find no two of em that hant got a difference of some sort somewheres  its very odd but its a fact  another puzzler said sally with a laugh  just so  but what else do you think about sall  sometimes i think about those fine ladies youve told us of who drive about in grand carriages with horses  oh these horses what i would give to see horses  have they got tails father  tails cried adams with a laugh of course they have long hairy ones and manes too thats hair down the back o their necks dear see here fetch me that bit of red stone and ill draw you a horse  sally brought the piece of red stone and her companion sitting down beside a smooth rock from which he wiped the dust with the sleeve of his shirt began slowly and with compressed lips frowning eyebrows and many a harddrawn sigh to draw the portrait of a horse  adams was not an artist  the drawing might have served almost equally well for an ass or even for a cow but sally watched it with intense interest  you see dear said the artist commenting as the work proceeded this is his head with a turnuptherelike that for his nose  a little too bluff no doubt but no matter  then comes the ears two of em somewhat longishso not exactly fore an aft as ive made em but athort ships so to speak only i never could understand how painters manage to make one thing look as if it was behind another  i cant get behind the one ear to put on the other one nohow  a puzzler ejaculated sally  just so  well you have them both anyhow only fore an aft as i said before  well then comes his back with a hollowso for people to sit in when they go cruisin about on shore then heres his legs somethin like that the fore ones straight an the aft ones crooked  has he only two legs asked sally in surprise one before an one behind  no dear hes got four but ive the same difficulty wi them that i had wi the earsone behind the other you know  however there you have emso in the foreanaft style  then hes got hoofs at the end o the legs like the goats you know only not split up the middle though why theyre not split is more than i can tell an theres a sort o curl behind a little above itthe fetlock i think they call it but thats far beyond my powers o drawin  but youve forgot the tail said sally  so i have think o that now to forget his tail  hed never do that himself if he was alive  it sticks out from hereabouts  there you have it flowin quite graceful down amost to his heels  now sally thats a horse an not much to boast of after all in the way of a likeness though i say it that shouldnt  how i should like to see a real one said the girl gazing intently at the wild caricature while her instructor looked on with a benignant smile  then i often think of the poor people mr young is so fond of telling us stories about continued sally as they resumed their upward path though im much puzzled about them  why are they poor  why are they not rich like other people  theres a many reasons why dear continued adams whose knowledge of political economy was limited some of em dont work an some of em wont work and some of em cant work an what between one thing an another theres a powerful lot of em everywhere  sally whose thirst for knowledge was great continued to ply poor john adams with questions regarding the poor until he became so involved in puzzlers that he was fain to change the subject and for a time they talked pleasantly on many themes  then they came to the steep parts of the mountains and relapsed into silence  on reaching another plateau or flat knoll where they turned to survey the magnificent panorama spread out before them sally said slowly  sometimes when im alone in the bush i think of god  mr young has been talking to me about him lately and i am wondering and wanting to know more about him  do you know anything about him father  john adams had looked at his simple interrogator with surprise and not a little perplexity  well to tell you the honest truth said he i cant say that i do know much about him more shame to me an some talks ive had lately with mr young have made me see that i know even less than i thought i did  but well ask mr young to explain these matters to us when we return home  as it happens  ive come up here to search for the very book that tells us about godhis own book the bible  mr christian used to read it an kept it in his cave  soon afterwards the man and child reached the cave referred to  on entering they were surprised to find young himself there before them he was reading the bible and adams could not help recalling his previous visit when he had found poor fletcher christian similarly occupied  i didnt know you was here mr young else i wouldnt have disturbed you said adams  i just came up to see if i could find the book for it seems to me that if you agree to carry out your notion of turnin schoolmaster it would be as well to have the schoolbook down beside us  my notion of turning schoolmaster said young with a faint smile it was your notion adams  however ive no objection to fall in with it and i quite agree about carrying the bible home with us for to say truth i dont feel the climbing of the mountain as easy as i used to  again the faint smile played on the midshipmans lips for a moment or two  im sorry to hear you say that sir said adams with a look of concern  and it cant be age you know continued young in a tone of pleasantry for im not much above thirty  i suspect its that asthmatic affection that has troubled me of late  however he added in a heartier tone it wont do to get downhearted about that  come what say you to begin school at once  well put you at the bottom of the class being so stupid and well put sally at the top  will you join sall  we need scarcely say that sally who was always ready for anything whether agreeable to her or otherwise assented heartily to the proposition and then and there began to learn to read out of the bible with john adams for a classfellow  of course it was uphill work at first  it was found that adams could blunder on pretty well with the small words but made sad havoc among the long ones  still his condition was pronounced hopeful  as to sally she seemed to take up the letters at the first sitting and even began to form some correct notion of the power of syllables  after a short trial young said that that was quite enough for the first day and then went on to read a passage or two from the bible himself  and now for the first time otaheitan sally heard the old old story of the love of god to man in the gift of jesus christ  the name of jesus was indeed not quite unfamiliar to her but it was chiefly as an oath that her associations presented it to her  now she learned that it was the name of immanuel god with us the just one who died that sinful man might be justified and saved from the power of sin  she did not indeed learn all this at that time but she had her receptive mind opened to the first lessons of the glorious truth on than summer evening on the mountaintop  from this date forward edward young became a real schoolmaster for he not only taught adams to read better than he had ever yet read but he daily assembled all the children except the very little ones and gave them instruction in reading out of the word of god  in all this john adams gave him hearty assistance and when not acting as a pupil did good service in teaching the smaller children their letters  but young went a step further  john adams said he one morning it has been much on my mind of late that god has spared you and me in order that we may teach these women and children the way of salvation through jesus christ  it may be as you say sir returned adams but i cant exactly feel that im fit to say much to em about that  i can only give the little uns their a b c an praps a little figurin  but ill go in with you mr young an do my best  thank you adams thank you  i feel sure that you will do well and that god will bless our efforts  do you know john i think my difficulties about the way are somewhat cleared up  its simpler than i thought  the whole work of our salvation is already accomplished by our blessed lord jesus  all we have got to do is not to refuse it you see whatever i know about it is got from the bible an you can judge of that as well as i  besides the passages that i have already shown you about believing i find this come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest and this whosoever will let him come and this turn ye turn ye for why will ye die so you see theres no doubt the offer is made to every one who will and then it is written that the holy spirit is able to make us willing if god entreats us to come and provides the way what is it that hinders but unwillingness  indeed the word says as much for i find it written ye will not come to me that ye might have life  what you say seems very true sir replied adams knitting his brows and shaking his head dubiously but then sir do you mean to say a mans good behaviour has nothin to do with his salvation at all  nothing whatever john as far as i can make out from the bibleat least not in the matter of procuring his salvation  as a consequence of salvation yes  why is it not said by the lord if ye love me keep my commandments  what could be plainer or stronger than that  if i wont behave myself because of love to my lord ill not do it on any lower ground  still john adams shook his head  he admitted that the arguments of his friend did seem unanswerable butin short he became an illustration of the truth of the proverb a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still  he had promised however to render all the aid in his power and he was not the man to draw back from his word  when therefore edward young proposed to read daily prayers out of the church of england prayerbook which had been taken from the bounty with the bible and carterets voyages he made no objection and he was similarly agreeable as he expressed it when young further proposed to have service forenoon and afternoon on sundays  for some months these various occupations and duties were carried on with great vigour much to the interest of all concerned the native women being quite as tractable scholars as the children  we cannot tell now whether it was the extra labour thus undertaken by young or some other cause that threw him into bad health but certain it is that a very few months later he began to feel his strength give way and a severe attack of his old complaint asthma at last obliged him to give up the work for a time  it is equally certain that at this important period in the history of the lonely island the good seed was sown in good ground for young had laboured in the name of the lord jesus and the promise regarding such work is sure your labour is not in vain in the lord  i must knock under for a time john he said with a wearied look on the occasion of his ceasing to work  he had of late taken to calling adams by his christian name and the latter had been made unaccountably uneasy thereby  never mind sir said the bluff seaman in an encouraging tone  you just rest yourself for a bit an ill carry on the school business sunday services an all  i aint much of a parson no doubt but ill do my best and a man cant do no more  all right john i hand it over to you  a short time of loafing about and taking it easy will set me all to rights again and ill resume office as fresh as ever  alas poor edward youngs day of labour was ended  he never more resumed office on earth  shortly after the above conversation he had another and extremely violent attack of asthma  it prostrated him completely so that for several days he could not speak  afterwards he became a little better but it was evident to every one that he was dying and it was touching to see the earnest way in which the tearful women who were so fond of him vied with each other in seeking to relieve his sufferings  john adams sat by his bedside almost continually at last  he seemed to require neither food nor rest but kept watching on hour after hour sometimes moistening the patients lips with water sometimes reading a few verses out of the bible to him  john said the poor invalid one afternoon faintly your hand  im goingjohnto befor ever with the lordthe dear lord  there was a long pause then  youllcarry onthe work john not in your own strength johnin his  adams promised earnestly in a choking voice and the sick man seemed to sink to rest with a smile on his lips  he never spoke again  next day he was buried under the palmtrees far from the home of his childhood from the land which had condemned him as a heartless mutineer    chapter twenty two  john adams longs for a chum and becomes a storyteller  faithful to his promise john adams after the death of young did his best to carry on the good work that had been begun  but at first his spirit was very heavy  it had not before occurred to him that there was a solitude far more profound and overwhelming than anything he had hitherto experienced  the difference between ten companions and one companion is not very great but the difference between one and none is immeasurable  of course we refer to that companionship which is capable of intelligent sympathy  the solitary seaman still had his otaheitan wife and the bright children of the mutineers around him and the death of young had drawn out his heart more powerfully than ever towards these but they could not in any degree fill the place of one who could talk intelligently of home of old england of british battles fought and won of ships and men and things that might have belonged as far as the women and children were concerned to another world  they could only in a slight degree appreciate the nautical phraseology in which he had been wont to convey some of his strongest sentiments and they could not in any degree enter into his feelings when forgetting for a moment his circumstances he came out with a pithy forecastle allusion to the politics or the government of his native land  oh you meekfaced brute if you could only speak he exclaimed one day dropping his eyes from the sea on which he had been gazing to the eyes of a pet goat that had been looking up in his face  whats the use of having a tongue in your head if you cant use it  as may be imagined the goat made no reply to this remark but continued its gaze with somewhat of the solemnity of the man himself  for want of a companion poor adams at this time took to talking frequently in a quiet undertone to himself  he also fell a good deal into fletcher christians habit of retiring to the cave on the mountaintop but he did not read the bible while there  he merely communed with his own spirit meditated sadly on the past and wondered a good deal as to the probable future  its not that i aint happy enough here he muttered softly to himself one evening while he gazed wistfully at the horizon as christian had been wont to gaze  im happy enoughmore so than what i deserve to be god knowswith them goodnatured women an jolly bit things of childn butbut im awful hard up for a chum  i do believe that if bill mccoy or even matt quintal was here id get along pretty well with either of em  ah poor quintal  i feel as if id never git over that  if it wasnt murder it feels awful like it an yet i cant see that they could call it murder  if we hadnt done it he would certainly have killed both me an mr young for matt never threatened without performin and then hed have gone mad an done for the women an childn as well  no it wasnt murder  it was necessity  he remained silent for some time and then his thoughts appeared to revert to the former channel  if only a ship would come an be wrecked here now we could start fresh once more with a new lot maybe but im not so sure about that either  praps wed quarrel an fight an go through the bloody business all over again  no its better as it is  but a ship might touch in passin an we could prevail on two or three of the crew or even one to stop with us  what would i not give to hear a mans voice once more a good growlin bass  i wouldnt be partickler as to sentiments or grammar not i if it was only gruff an well spiced with sealingo an smelt o baccy  not that i cares for baccy myself now or grog either  humph it do make me amost laugh to think o the times ive said ay and thought that i couldnt git along nohow without my pipe an my glass  why i wouldnt give a chip of a brass farden for a pipe now an as to grog after what ive seen of its cursed natur i wouldnt taste a drop even if they was to offer to make me lord high admiral o the british fleet for so doin  but i would like once more to see a bearded man even an unbearded one would be better than nothin  ah well its no manner o use sighin any more than cryin over spilt milk  here i am an i suppose here i shall be to the end o the chapter  again he was silent for a long time while his eyes remained fixed as usual on the horizon  suddenly the gaze became intent and leaning forward with an eager expression he shaded his eyes with his hand  its not creditable he murmured as he fell back again into his former listless attitude its not creditable for an old salt like me to go mistakin seagulls for sails as ive bin doin so often of late im out o practice thats where it is  come john adams he added after another pause and jumping up smartly this will never do  rouse yourself john an give up this mumblebumble style o thing  why itll kill you in the longrun if you dont  besides you promised mr young to carry on the work and you must keep your promise old boy  yes rang out a clear sweet voice from the inner end of the cave and you promised to give up coming here to mope so you must keep your promise to me as well father  otaheitan sally tripped into the cave and seating herself on the stone ledge opposite beamed up in the sailors face  youre a good girl sall an ill keep my promise to you from this day forth see if i dont  ill make a note of it in the log  the log to which adams here referred was a journal or register which edward young had begun to keep and in which were inserted the incidents of chief interest including the births and deaths that took place on the island from the day of landing  after youngs death john adams continued to post it up from time to time  the promise to sally was faithfully kept  from that time forward adams gave up going to the outlook except now and then when anything unusual appeared on the sea but never again to mope  he also devoted himself with increased assiduity to the instruction of the women and children in bible truths although still himself not very clear in his own mind as to the great central truth of all  in this work he was ably assisted by sally and also by youngs widow susannah  we have mentioned this woman as being one of the youngest of the otaheitans  she was also one of the most graceful and strange to say though it was she who killed tetaheite she was by nature one of the gentlest of them all  the school never became a prisonhouse to these islanders either women or children  adams had wisdom enough at first to start it as a sort of play and never fell into the civilised error of giving the pupils too much to do at a time  all the children answered the daily summons to school with equal alacrity though it cannot be said that their performances there were equally creditable  some were quick and intelligent others were slow and stupid while a few were slow but by no means stupid  charlie christian was among these last  oh charlie you are such a booby one day exclaimed otaheitan sally who being advanced to the dignity of monitor devoted much of her time to the instruction of her old favourite  what can be the matter with your brains  the innocent gaze of blank wonder with which the challie of infancy had been wont to receive his companions laughing questions had not quite departed but it was chastened by this time with a slight puckering of the mouth and a faint twinkle of the eyes that were suggestive  sitting modestly on the low bench with his hands clasped before him this strapping pupil looked at his teacher and said that really he did not know what was wrong with his brains  perhaps he added looking thoughtfully into the girls upturned orbs perhaps i havent got any brains at all  o yes you have cried sall with a laugh you have got plenty if youd only use them  ah sighed charlie stretching out one of his strong muscular arms and hands if brains were only things that one could lay hold of like an oar or an axe or a sledgehammer id soon let you see me use them but bein only a soft kind o stuff in ones skull you know  a burst of laughter from sally not only cut short the sentence but stopped the general hum of the school and drew the attention of the master  hallo sall i say you know said adams in remonstrative tone you forget that youre a monitor  if you go on like that well have to make a schoolgirl of you again  please father i couldnt help it said sally while her cheeks flushed crimson charlie is such a  she stopped short covered her face with both hands and bending forward till she hid her confusion on her knees went into an uncontrollable giggle the only evidences of which however were the convulsive movements of her shoulders and an occasional squeak in the region of her little nose  come now childn cried adams seating himself on an inverted teabox which formed his official chair times up so well have a slap at carteret before dismissing  thursday october christian will bring the book  there was a general hum of satisfaction when this was said for carterets voyages which with the bible and prayerbook formed the only classbooks of that singular school were highly appreciated by young and old alike especially as read to them by adams who accompanied his reading with a free running commentary of explanation which infused great additional interest into that old writers book toc rose with alacrity displaying in the act the immense relative difference between his very long legs and his ordinary body in regard to which adams used to console him by saying never mind toc your legsll stop growin at last and when they do your body will come out like a telescope  youll be a sixfooter yet  why youre taller than i am already by two inches  in process of time carteret was finished it was then begun a second time and once more read through  after that adams felt a chill feeling of helplessness steal over him for carteret could not be read over and over again like the bible and he could not quite see his way to reading the church of england prayers by way of recreation  in his extremity he had recourse to sally for advice  indeed now that sall was approaching young womanhood not only the children but all the grown people of the island including their chief or father found themselves when in trouble gravitating as if by instinct to the sympathetic heart and the ready hand  ill tell you what to do said sally when appealed to as she took the seamans rough hand and fondled it just try to invent stories and tell them to us as if you was readin a book  you might even turn carteret upside down and pretend that you was readin  adams shook his head  i never could invent anything sall xcept wen i was tellin lies an thats a long while ago nowa long long while  no i doubt that i couldnt invent but ill tell ee what ill try to remember some old yarns and spin them off as well as i can  the new idea broke on adamss mind so suddenly that his eyes sparkled and he bestowed a nautical slap on his thigh  the very thing cried sally whose eyes sparkled fully more than those of the sailor while she clapped her hands nothing could be better what will you begin with  let me see said adams seating himself on a treestump and knitting his brows with a severe strain of memory  theres cinderella an theres ally babby or the fifty thievesif it wasnt fortyim not rightly sure which but it dont much matter an theres jack the giantkiller an jack and the peastalkno let me see it was a beanstalk i thinkanyhow it was the stalk of a vegetable o some sort  why i wonder it never struck me before to tell you all about them tales  reader if you had seen the joy depicted on sallys face and the rich flush of her cheek and her halfopen mouth with its double row of pearls while adams ran over this familiar list you would have thought it well worth that seamans while to tax his memory even more severely than he did  and then he continued knitting his brows still more severely theres gulliver an the lillycups or putts an the pilgrims progressthough of course i dont mean for to say i knows em all right off by heart but thats no odds  an theres robinson crusoe ha thats the story for you sall thats the tale thatll make your hair stand on end an amost split your sides open an cause the very marrow in your spine to wriggle  yes well begin with robinson crusoe  having settled this point to their mutual and entire satisfaction the two went off for a short walk before supper  on the way they met elizabeth mills and mary christian both of whom were now no longer staggerers but far advanced as jumpers  they led between them adamss little daughter dinah who being still very small could not take long walks without assistance and an occasional carry  di my pet cried her father seizing the willing child and hoisting her on his shoulder  come you shall go along with us  and you too lassies if you have no other business in hand  yes well go with you cried bessy mills  may was just saying it was too soon to go home to supper  come along then cried adams tossing his child in the air as he went  my beauty youll beat your mammy in looks yet eh an when youre old enough well tell you all about rob  he checked himself abruptly cleared his voice and looked at sally  well father said may christian quickly about rob who  ahem eh well yes about robha but we wont talk about him just now dear  sally and i were havin some private conversation just now about rob though that isnt the whole of his name neither but we wont make it public at present  youll hear about him time enougheh sall  the girls were so little accustomed to anything approaching to mystery or secrecy in john adams that they looked at him in silent wonder then they glanced at sally whose suppressed smile and downcast eyes told eloquently that there was as adams would have said something in the wind and they tried to get her to reveal the secret but sall was immovable  she would not add a single syllable to the information given inadvertently by adams but she and he laughed a good deal in a quiet way and made frequent references to rob in the course of the walk  of course when the mysterious word was pronounced in the village in the evening and what had been said and hinted about it was repeated curiosity was kindled into a violent flame and when the entire colony was invited to a feast that night the excitement was intense  from the oldest to the youngest excluding the more recently arrived sprawlers every eye was fixed on john adams during the whole course of supper except at the commencement when the customary blessing was asked at which point every eye was tightly closed  adams conscious of increased importance spoke little during the meal and maintained an air of profounder gravity than usual until the dishes were cleared away  then he looked round the assembled circle and said women an childn im goin to tell ee a story    chapter twenty three  the pitcairners have a night of it  although john adams had often in the course of his residence on pitcairn jested and chatted and taken his share in relating many an anecdote he had never up till that time resolved to go in as he said for a regular story like a book  women an childn he began it may be that im goin to attempt more than im fit to carry out in this business for my memorys none o the best  however that wont matter much for i tell ee fair an aboveboard at the beginnin that when i come to gaps that i cant fill up from memory ill just bridge em over from imagination dye see  whats imagination demanded dan mccoy whose tendency to pert interruption and reply nothing yet discovered could restrain  its a puzzler said otaheitan sally in a low tone which called forth a laugh from the others  it did not take much to make these people laugh as the observant reader will have perceived  well it is a puzzler said adams with a quiet smile and a perplexed look  i may say dan mccoy in an offhand roughanready sort o way that imagination is that power o the mind which enables a man to tell lies  there was a general opening of juvenile eyes at this as if recent biblical instruction had led them to believe that the use of such a power must be naughty  you see explained adams when a man usin his imagination tells whats not true just to deceive people an mislead em we call it lyin but when his imagination invents whats not true merely for the fun o the thing an tells it as a joke never pretendin that its true he aint lyin hes only tellin a story or a anecdote or a parable  now dan put that in your pipe an smoke it  likewise shut your potatotrap and let me go on wi my story which is he looked impressively round while every eye gazed and ear listened and mouth opened in breathless attention the adventure of robinson crusoe an his man friday  all eyes were turned as if by magic on thursdayas if there must be some strange connection here  toc suddenly shut his mouth and hung his head in confusion at this unexpected concentration of attention on himself  youve no need to be ashamed thursday said adams with a laugh youve got the advantage of friday anyhow bein a day in advance of him  well as i was about to say boys an girls this robinson crusoe was a seafarin man just like myself an he went to sea an was shipwrecked on a desolate island just like this but there was nobody whatever on that island not even a woman or a babby  poor robinson was all alone an it wasnt till a considrable time after he had gone ashore that he discovered friday who was a black savage through seein his footprint in the sand  adams having burst thus suddenly into the very marrow of his story had no reason thereafter to complain either of interruption or inattention neither had he reason to find fault with the wealth of his prolific imagination  it would have done the soul of a painter good to have watched the faces of that rapt eager breathless audience and it would have afforded much material for reflection to a student of mind had he knowing the original story of robinson crusoe been permitted to trace the ingenious sinuosities and astounding creations by which adams wove his meagre amount of original matter into a magnificent tale which not only thrilled his audience but amazed himself  in short he quite justified the assurance formerly given to sally that the story of robinson crusoe would make the hair of his hearers stand on end their sides almost split open and the very marrow in their spines wriggle  indeed his version of the tale might have caused similar results in robinson crusoe himself had he been there to hear it besides causing his eyebrows to rise and vanish evermore among the hair of his head with astonishment  it was the same with the pilgrims progress which he often told to them afterwards  simple justice to adams however requires us to state that he was particularly careful to impress on his hearers that the pilgrims progress was a religious tale  its a allegory you must know he said on first introducing it which means a story intended to teach some good lessona story which says one thing and means another  he looked pointedly at dan mccoy here as if to say thats an exhaustive explanation which takes the wind out o your sails young man but dan was not to be so easily silenced  whats the use father he asked with an air of affected simplicity of a story sayin one thing an meanin another  wouldnt it be more honest like if it said what it meant at once straight off  praps it would returned adams who secretly enjoyed dans irrepressible impudence but then if it did dan it would take away your chance of askin questions dye see  anyhow this story dont say what it means straight off an that gives me a chance to expound it  now it was in the expounding of the pilgrims progress that john adamss peculiar talents shone out brilliantly for not only did he misremember jumble and confuse the whole allegory but he so misapprehended its meaning in many points that the lessons taught and the morals drawn were very wide of the mark indeed  in regard to some particular points too he felt himself at liberty to let his genius have free untrammelled scope as for instance in the celebrated battle between christian and apollyon  arguing with himself that it was not possible for any man to overdo a fight with the devil adams made up his mind to go well in for that incident and spent a whole evening over it keeping his audience glaring and on the rack of expectation the whole time  taking perhaps an unfair advantage of his minute knowledge as a manofwarsman of cutlassdrill and of fighting in general from pugilistic encounters to greatgun exercise including all the intermediate performances with rapiers swords muskets pistols blunderbusses and other weapons for general scrimmaging he so wrought upon the nerves of his hearers that they quivered with emotion and when at last he drove apollyon discomfited from the field like chaff before the wind there burst forth a united cheer of triumph and relief dan mccoy in particular jumping up with tumbled yellow locks and glittering eyes in a perfect yell of exultation  but to return from this digression to the story of robinson crusoe  it must not be supposed that adams exhausted that tale in one night  no soon discovering that he had struck an intellectual vein so to speak he resolved to work it out economically and with that end in view devoted the first evening to a minute dissection of crusoes character as a man and a seaman to the supposed fitting out and provisioning of his ship to the imaginary cause of the disaster to the ship which with bligh no doubt in memory he referred to the incompetence and wickedness of the skipper and to the terrible incidents of the wreck winding up with the landing of his hero halfdead and alone on the uninhabited island  now childn he concluded thatll do for one night and as its of no manner of use sending you all to bed to dream of bein shipwrecked and drownded well finish off with a game of blindmansbuff  need we say that the disappointment at the cutting short of the story was fully compensated by the game  leaping up with another cheer taught them by the best authorities and given with true british fervour they scattered about the room  otaheitan sally was as a matter of course the first to be blindfolded  and really reader it was wonderful how like that game as played at pitcairn was to the same as performed in england  to justify this remark let us describe it and see whether there were any points of material difference  the apartment let it be understood was a pretty large one lighted by two nutcandles in brackets on the walls  there was little furniture in it only a few stools and two small tables which were quickly thrust into a corner  then sally was taken to the centre of the room by adams and there blindfolded with a snuffcoloured silken bandana handkerchief which had seen much service on board of the bounty  now sall can you see asks adams  no not one bit  oh yes you can from charlie christian who hovers round her like the moth round the candle  no really i cant  yes you can from dan mccoy who is on the alert i see your piercin black eyes comin right through the hankitchif  get along then cries adams twirling sally round and skipping out of the way  it is not the first time the women have played at that game and their short garments reaching little below the knees seem admirably adapted to it while they glide about with motions little less easy and agile than those of the children and cause the roof to ring with laughter at the various misadventures that occur  mrs adams however does not join  besides being considerably older than her husband that good woman has become prematurely shortsighted and deaf  this being so she sits in a corner not inappropriately to act the part of grandmother to the players and to serve as an occasional buffer to such of the children as are hurled against her  now otaheitan sally having gone rather cautiously about without catching any one except charliewhom she pretends not to know examines from head to foot and then guesses wrong on purposebecomes suddenly wild makes a desperate lunge as she thinks at dan mccoy and tumbles into mrs adamss lap amid shouts of delight  of course dan brought about this incident by wise forethought  his next success is unpremeditated  making a pull at sallys skirt he glides quickly out of her way as she wheels round and hits mainmast an unintentional backhander on the nose  this is received by mainmast with a little scream and by the children with an oh oo of consternation while sally pulling down the handkerchief hastens to give needless assurance that she is so vexed etcetera  susannah joins her in condoling and so does widow martin but mainmast with tears in her eyes drawn by the blow and a smile on her lips declares that she dont care a button  sally is therefore blindfolded again  she catches charlie christian immediately and feeling that there is no other way of escaping from him names him  then charlie being blindfolded sets to work with one solitary end in view namely to capture sally  the injustice to the others of this proceeding never enters his innocent mind  he hears no voice but sallys he clutches at nobody but sally  when he is compelled to lay hold of any one else he guesses wrong not on purpose but because he is thinking of sally  perceiving this sally retires quietly behind mrs adamss chair and charlie growing desperate makes wild dashes tumbling into the corner among the tables and stools sending the staggerers spinning in all directions and finally pitching headlong into mrs adamss lap  at last he catches john adams himself and as there is no possibility of mistaking him the handkerchief is changed and the game becomes more sedate at the same time more nervous for the stride of the seaman is awful and the sweep of his outstretched arms comprehensive  besides he has a way of listening and making sudden darts in unexpected directions which is very perplexing  after a few failures adams makes what he calls a wild roll to starboard followed instantly by a heavy lurch to port and pins dan mccoy into a corner  ha  ive grabbed you at last have i says he  who is it shout halfadozen voices  who but danl  theres impudence in the very feel of his hair  so dan is blindfolded  and now comes the tug of war  if it was fast and furious before it is maniacal madness now  the noise is indescribable yet it fails to waken two infants who with expressions of perfect peace on their innocent faces repose in two bunks at one side of the room  at last thursday october tumbles into one of these bunks and all but immolates an infant  mrs adams is fairly overturned one table comes by a damaged leg the other is split lengthwise and one of the candles is blown out  these symptoms are as good as a weatherglass to adams  now then one and all its time for bed he says  instantly the rioting comes to a close and still panting from their exertions the elder children carry out the tables and rectify their damages as well as may be while the younger range the stools round the wall and sit down on them or on the floor  fetch the bible and prayerbook matt quintal says adams  they are about to close the evening with worship  it has become habitual now and there is no difficulty in calming the spirits of the children to the proper tone for they have been trained by a man who is unaffected and sincere  they slide easily because naturally from gay to grave and they would as soon think of going to work without breakfast as of going to rest without worship  a chapter is read with comparative ease by john adams for he has applied himself heartily to his task and overcome most of his old difficulties  then he reads a short prayer selected from the prayerbook  the lords prayer follows in which they all join and the evening comes to a close  trooping from adamss house they dispersed to their respective homes the lights are extinguished  only the quiet stars remain to shed a soft radiance over the pleasant scene and in a few minutes more the people of pitcairn are wrapped in deep healthy sound repose    chapter twenty four  refers to things spiritual and physical  it was not until some years had elapsed after the death of edward young that john adams became seriously impressed with the great responsibility of his position  in the year 1804 a son was born to him whom he named george whether after the king of england or a relative of his own we are not prepared to state  after the king very likely for adams although a mutineer was a loyal subject at heart and never ceased to condemn and deplore the act of mutiny into which after all he had been surprised rather than willingly led  this infant george was the last of this first generation and his father was extremely proud and fond of him  having already three daughters he seemed to have peculiar satisfaction in the advent of a son and having latterly acquired the habit of mingling a dash of scriptural language with his usual phraseology he went about the first day or two after the childs birth murmuring ive gotten a manchild from the lorda manchild lets be thankful an a regular shipshape trim little craft he is too  there can be no doubt that the seamans naturally serious mind became more profoundly impressed with religion shortly after this event  a dream which he appears to have had deepened his impressions  like most dreams it was not in itself very definite or noteworthy but we have no doubt it was used as a means towards perfecting the good work which had been already begun  at all events it is certain that about this time adams began to understand the way of life more clearly and to teach it more zealously to the little community which was fast growing up around him  the duties which he had undertaken to fulfil were now no longer carried on merely because of his promise to edward young and a sense of honour  while these motives did indeed continue to operate with all their original force he was now attracted to his labour out of regard to the commands of god and a strong desire for the welfare of the souls committed to his charge  naturally he fell into one or two errors of judgment  among other things he at first imagined that it was his duty to attempt the keeping of all the jewish festivals and to institute a fast twice in the week these errors were however corrected by increased knowledge in the course of time  but it must not be supposed that this earnest searcher after truth became ascetic or morose  despite his mistakes and the somewhat severe discipline which he was thereby led to impose on himself and the community the effect on him and his large family of the scriptures pure unadulterated and without note or commentwas to create love to god to intensify their love for each other to render them anxious to imitate the example and walk in the footsteps of jesus and to cause them to rejoice at all times  it was quite evident ere long that the whole community had drunk deeply into the spirit of such passages in the word as thesedelight thyself in the lordby love serve one anotherrejoice in the lord alway and again i say rejoicewhatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might as unto the lord and not unto menask and ye shall receive seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto youlet each esteem other better than himselfwhatsoever ye would that men should do unto you do ye even so to themlove is the fulfilling of the lawlet not the sun go down upon your wrath  the last text was a favourite one with adams who occasionally found that even among the tractable and kindly troop he had to deal with sin was by no means extinct  do not suppose good reader that we are now attempting to depict a species of exceptional innocence which never existed an arcadia which never really had a local habitation  on the contrary we are taking pains to analyse the cause of a state of human goodness and felicity springing up in the midst of exceptionally unpromising circumstances which has no parallel we think in the history of mankind which not only did exist but which with modifications does still exist and has been borne witness to through more than half a century by men of varied and unquestionable authority including merchantskippers discoverers travellers captains and admirals in the royal navy  the point that we wish to press is not that the enviable condition of things we have described is essentially true but that this condition has been brought about by the unaided word of god that word which so many nowadays would fain underrate but which for those who are taught by the holy spirit is still the power of god unto salvation  the hilarity of the pitcairners increased rather than diminished as their love for the bible deepened  fun and solemnity are not necessarily and never need be antagonistic  hand in hand these two have walked the earth together since adam and eve bid each other goodmorning in the peaceful groves of paradise  they are subject no doubt to the universal laws which make it impossible for two things to fill the same place at the same time and they sometimes do get as it were out of step and jostle each other slightly which calls forth a gentle shake of the head from the one and a deprecatory smile from the other but they seldom disagree and never fight  thus it came to pass that though john adams as time went on read more than ever of the bible to his audiences and dilated much on the parables he did not dismiss robinson crusoe or expel gulliver or put a stop to blindmansbuff  on the contrary waxing courageous under the influence of success he cast off his moorings from the skeletons of the stories to which he had at first timidly attached himself and crowding all sail alow and aloft swept out into the unexplored seas of pure unadulterated and outrageous fiction of his own invention  thems the stories for me daniel mccoy was wont to say when commenting on this subject  truth is all very well in its way you know but its a great bother when youve got to stick to it of course i mean when storytellin  neither john adams nor his pupils knew at that time though doubtless their descendants have learned long ere now that after all truth is in very deed stranger than fiction  as time passed changes more or less momentous occurred in the lonely island  true none of those convulsions which rack and overturn the larger communities of men on earth visited that favoured spot but forces of nature were being slowly yet surely developed which began to tell with considerable effect on the people of pitcairn  they were not however much troubled by the ills that flesh is heir to leading as they did natural and healthy lives eating simple and to a large extent vegetable fare and knowing nothing of the abominations of tobacco or strong drink their maladies were few and seldom fatal  john adams himself had the constitution of a horse  nevertheless he was troubled now and then with a bad tooth and once had a regular attack of raging toothache  as none of the people had ever even heard of this malady they were much alarmed and not a little solemnised by its effects on their chief  walking up and down the floor of his house holding his afflicted jaw with both hands the poor man endeavoured to endure it with fortitude but when the quivering nerve began as it were to dance a hornpipe inside of his tooth irrepressible groans burst from him and awed the community  is it very bad john asked his sympathetic wife who was cleaning up the house at the time  hooorible answered john  im very sorry john said the wife  ohooooh groaned the husband  when it became known in the village that adams was suffering from some mysterious complaint that nearly drove him mad two or three of the children unable to restrain their curiosity ran to his house and peeped in at the open door and windows  the sufferer either disregarded or did not see them  in a few minutes the poor mans steps became more frantic and another groan burst from him  then he stopped in the middle of the room uttered a deep growl and stamped  at this the heads of the peeping children disappeared  they gazed at each other in solemn wonder  they had never seen the like of this before  to stamp on the floor without an apparent reason and without being done in fun was beyond their comprehension  wheres the toolbox lass gasped adams suddenly  his helpmate brought to him an old handbox for nails and small tools which had once done service in the bounty  with eager haste adams selected a pair of pincers and seizing his tooth therewith he began to twist  at the same time his features began to screw up into an expression of agony  howgh he exclaimed between a gasp and a short roar as the pincers slipped  and no wonder for it was a threefanged grinder of the largest size situate in the remote backwoods of the under jaw  he tried again and again failed  then a third time and then discovered that up to a certain point his will was free to act but that beyond that point the agony was so intense that the muscles of the hand and arm refused to act responsive to the will  in other circumstances he might have moralised on this curious fact  as it was he only moaned aloud  two of the children of peculiarly sympathetic natures echoed the moan unintentionally  they immediately vanished but soon peeped up again in irresistible curiosity  old ooman said adams this is out o sight the worst fit as ever i had  just fetch me a bit of that small strong cord out o the cupboard there  mrs adams did as she was bid and her husband making a sailorlike loop on it fastened the same round his tooth which was not difficult for the evil grinder stood unsupported and isolated in the jaw  now said her husband you take hold o the end o this and haul haul harddont be afraid  mrs adams felt nervous and remonstrated but being persuaded after a time to try again she gave a vigorous pull which drew from the unhappy man a terrible yell but did not draw the tooth  thisll never do groaned john feeling the rebellious molar with his finger its as firm as a copper bolt yet  come wife ill try another plan  you go outside that door an do what i bid you  mind never you heed what it means you just obey orders exactly  it was not necessary thus to caution poor tractable mrs adams  she went outside the door as bid  now then said her husband when i cry pull you shut the door with all your mightwith a bang  dye hear  yes replied the wife faintly  fastening the cord once more round the tooth the wretched sailor attached the other end to the handle of the door and retiring till there was only about eight inches or a foot of slack cord left stood up and drew a long breath  the glaring children also drew long breaths one very small one who had been lifted on to the windowsill by an amiable companion lay there on his breast visibly affected by alarm  shut the door cried adams  there was a tremendous bang followed by an instantaneous yell  the children jumped nearly out of their own skins and the little one on the windowsill fell flat on the ground in speechless horror but the tooth was not yet out  the cord had slipped again  this is becomin terrible said adams with a solemn look  ill tell ee what lass you run round to the smiddy an tell thursday that i want him drectly an look alive old girl  mrs adams hastened out and scattering the children soon returned with the desired youth  and a most respectable youth had thursday october christian become at that time  he was over six feet high though not quite sixteen years of age with a breadth of shoulder and depth of chest that would have befitted a man of sixandtwenty  he had no beard but he possessed a deep bass voice which more than satisfied john adamss oftexpressed wish of earlier days to hear the sound of a man  toc said adams holding his jaw with one hand and the pincers in the other ive got a most astoundin fit o the toothache and must git rid o this grinder but its an awful one to hold on  ive tried it three times myself wi them pincers an my old ooman has tried it wi this here cableonce with her fist an once wi the door as a sort o capstan but its still hard an fast like the sheetanchor of a seventyfour  now toc my lad youre a stout young chap for your age just you take them pincers lay hold o the rascally thing an haul him out  dont be afeared  he must come if you only heave with a will  what father do you mean that im to lay hold o that tooth wi them pincers an wrench it bodily out of your head  thats just about what i do mean toc returned adams with a grim smile  moreover i want you to make no bungle of it  dont let your narves come into play  just take a grip like a brave man heave away wi the force of a windlass an dont stop for my yellin  thus adjured thursday october took the pincers and gazed with a look of great anxiety into the cavernous mouth that adams opened to his view  which one is it father asked toc rolling up his shirt sleeves to the shoulder and displaying arms worthy of vulcan  man alive dont you see it  the one furthest aft with a black hole in it big enough amost to stuff my george into  thursday applied the pincers gently  adams unable to use clear speech in the circumstances said chokingly ats e unool away which interpreted is thats the onepull away  toc pulled adams roared the children quaked and the pincers slipped  oh toc toc cried adams with a remonstrative look such as martyrs are said to give when their heads are not properly cut off is that all you can do with your big strong arms  fie man fie  this disparaging reference to his strength put poor thursday on his mettle  ill try again father he said  well do an see you make a better job of it this time  the powerful youth got hold of the tooth a second time and gave it a terrible wrench  adams roared like a bull of bashan but tocs heart was hardened now he wrenched againa long strong and steady pull the martyr howled as if his spinal marrow were being extracted  toc suddenly staggered back his arm flew up displaying a bloody tooth with three enormous fangs  the old ooman shrieked the child on the windowsill fell again therefrom in convulsions and the others fled panicstruck into the woods where they displayed their imitative tendencies and relieved their feelings by tearing up wild shrubs by the roots amid yells and roars of agony during the remainder of the day    chapter twenty five  tells of an important matter  not very long after this thursday october christian experienced at the hands of john adams treatment which bore some slight resemblance to a species of toothdrawing  in fact adams may be said to have had his revenge  it happened thus  adams was seated one afternoon in front of his house on a low stool where he was wont to sun himself and smoke an imaginary pipe while the children were at play in the grassy square  he was absorbed apparently in what he used to term a brown study  thursday october making his appearance from among the bushes on the opposite side of the square leaped the fourfoot fence like a greyhound without a run and crossed over  whether it was the leap or the rate at which he had walked home through the woods we cannot say but his handsome face was unusually flushed and he stopped once or twice on nearing adams as if undecided what to do  at last he seemed to make up his mind walked straight up to the seaman and stood before him with folded arms  hallo toc said adams rousing himself youve caught me napping the truth is ive bin inventin a lot of awful whackers to spin a yarn out o for the childn  this is friday you know an as theyve bin fastin poor things i want to give em what you may call mental food to keep their breadbaskets quiet dye see  but youve got somethin to tell me toc what is it  father said thursdayand then followed a long pause during which the youth shifted from one leg to the other  well now toc said adams eyeing the lad with a twinkling expression dye know i have heard it said or writ somewhere that brevity is the soul of wit  if that sayins true an ive no reason for to suppose that it isnt i should say that that observation of yours was wit without either soul or body its so uncommon short too witty in short  couldnt you manage to add something more to it  yes father said thursday with a deprecating smile i have come to askto ask you for leave tototo  well toc you have my cheerful leave tototo and tootle too as much as you please replied adams with a bland smile  in short said thursday with a desperate air iiwant leave to marry  whew whistled adams with a larger display of eyeball than he had made since he settled on the island  youve come to the point now and no mistake  youwantleavetomarry thursday october christian eh  yes father if youve no objection  hem no objection marryeh said adams while his eyebrows began to return slowly to their wonted position  ha well now lets hear who do you want to marry  having fairly broken the ice the bashful youth said quickly susannah  again john adams uttered a prolonged whistle while his eyebrows sprang once more to the roots of his hair  what the widdy  yes mr youngs widow replied thursday covered with confusion  well i never  but this does beat cockfightin  he gave his thigh a sounding slap and seemed about to give way to irrepressible laughter when he suddenly checked himself and became grave  i say toc said he earnestly hand me down the prayerbook  somewhat surprised the lad took the book from its shelf and placed it on the sailors knees  look ee here toc theres somethin here that touches on your case if i dont misremember where  let me see  ah here it is a man may not marry his grandmother much less a boy he added looking up  but father susannah aint my grandmother said toc stoutly feeling that he had got an advantage here  true lad but she might be your mother  shes to the full sixteen years older than yourself  but seriously boy do you mean it and is she willin  yes father i do mean it an she is quite willin  susannah has bin kinder to me than any one else i ever knew and i love her better than everybody else put together  she did laugh a bit at first when i spoke to her about it an told me not to talk so foolishly an said just as you did that she might be my mother but that made no odds to me for shes not one bit like my mother you know  no shes not said adams with an assenting nod  shes not like mainmast by any means bein a deal younger an better lookin  well now toc youve given me matter to put in my pipe if i had one an smoke it for some time to comefood for reflection so to speak  just you go to work my lad as if there was nothin in the wind an when ive turned it over looked at it on all sides gone right round the compass with it worked at it so to speak like a cooper round a cask ill send for you an let you know how the land lies  when adams had anything perplexing on his mind he generally retired to the outlook cave at the mountaintop  thither he went upon this occasion  the result was that on the following day he sent for thursday and made him the following oration  thursday my lad its not for the likes o me to fly in the face o providence  if you still remain in earnest about this little matter an susannahs mind aint changed ill throw no difficulty in your way ive bin searchin the book in reference to it an i see nothin particular there regardin age one way or another  its usual in old england toc for the man to be a deal older than the wife but theres no law against its bein the other way as i knows on  all i can find on the subject is that a man must leave his father and mother an cleave to his wife  you hant got no father to leave my boy mores the pity an as for mainmast you can leave her when you like though in the circumstances you cant go very far away from her your tether bein somewhat limited  as to the ceremony i cant find nothin about that in the bible but theres full directions in the prayerbook so ill marry you off all shipshape fair an above board when the time comes  but theres one point  toc that i feel bound to settle and its this that you cant be married till youve got a good bit of ground under cultivation so that you may be able to keep your wife comfortably without callin on her to work too hard  youve bin a busy enough fellow i admit since ever you was able to do a hands turn but you havent got a garden of your own yet  now ill go up with you tomorrow an mark off a bit o your fathers property which you can go to work on an when youve got it into something of a forard state ill marry you  sothats a good job settled  when adams finished he turned away with a profound sigh of relief as if he felt that he had not only disposed of a particular and knotty case but had laid down a great general principle by which he should steer his course in all time to come  it need scarcely be said that thursday october was quite prepared to undertake this probationary work that the new garden was quickly got into a sufficiently forard state and that ere long the first wedding on pitcairn was celebrated under circumstances of jubilant rejoicing    chapter twenty six  treats of a birth and of devastation  more than eighteen years had now elapsed without the dwellers on that little isle of the southern sea having beheld a visitant from the great world around them  that world meanwhile had been convulsed with useless wars  the great napoleon had run through a considerable portion of his withering career drenching the earth with blood and heaping heavy burdens of debt on the unfortunate nations of europe  nelson had shattered his fleets and wellington was on the eve of commencing that victorious career which was destined ere long to scatter his armies but no echo of the turmoil in which all this was being accomplished had reached the peaceful dwellers on pitcairn who went on the even tenor of their way proving in the most convincing and interesting manner that after all love is the fulfilling of the law  but the year 1808 had now arrived a year fraught with novelty interest and importance to the pitcairners  the first great event of that year was the birth of a son to thursday october christian and if ever there was a juvenile papa who opened his eyes to the uttermost stared in sceptical wonder pinched himself to see if he were awake and went away into the bush to laugh and rejoice in secret that man was toc  boys and girls said thursday about a month after the birth well celebrate this event with a picnic to martins cove if you would like it  there was an assumption of fine paternal dignity about toc when he said this which was quite beautiful to behold  his making the proposal too without any reference to john adams was noted as being unusual  dont you think wed better ask father first suggested otaheitan sally  of course i do said toc on whose ear the word father fell pleasantly  you dont suppose do you that id propose to do anything of importance without his consent  it may strike the supercilious reader here that a picnic even on pitcairn was not a matter of profound importance but he must remember that that particular picnic was to be held in honour of thursdays baby it may be that this remark is thrown away on those who are not in the position of thursday  if so let it pass  we will invite father adams to go with us continued toc ingeniously referring to adams in a manner suggestive of the idea that there were other fathers on the island as well as he  when father adams was invited he accepted the invitation heartily and slapping toc on his huge broad back wished him joy of the noo babby and hoped he might live to see it grow up to have a babby of its own similar to itself dye see at which remark toc laughed with evident delight  well the whole thing was arranged and they proceeded to carry the picnic into effect  it was settled that some were to go by land though the descent from the cliffs to the cove was not an easy or safe one others were to go by water and the waterparty was subdivided into two bands  one band which included susannah and the amazing baby was to go in canoes the other was to swim  the distance by water might be about eight miles but that was a mere trifle to the pitcairners some of whom could swim right round their island  it turned out however that that charming island was not altogether exempt from those vicissitudes of weather which play such a prominent part in the picnicry of other and less favoured lands for while they were yet discussing the arrangements of the day a typhoon stepped in unexpectedly to arrest them  it may be that there are some persons in britain who do not know precisely what a typhoon is  if they saw or felt one they would not be apt to forget it  roughly speaking a typhoon is a terrific storm cyclopaedias which are supposed to tell us about everything say that the chinese name such a storm teifun or hotwind  nofun would seem to be a more appropriate term if one were to name it from results one writer says of typhoons they are storms which rage with such intensity and fury that those who have never seen them can form no conception of them you would say that heaven and earth wished to return to their original chaos  obviously if this writer be correct there would be no use in our attempting to enlighten those who can form no conception of the thing nevertheless in the hope that the writer referred to may be as ignorant on this point as he is in regard to the wishes of heaven and earth we will attempt a brief description of the event which put such a sudden stop to what may be called the tocbabypicnic  for several days previously the weather had been rather cloudy and there had been a few showers but this would not have checked the proceedings if the wind had not risen so as to render it dangerous to launch the canoes into the surf on the beach of bounty bay  as the day advanced it blew a gale and toc congratulated himself on having resisted the urgent advice of the volatile dan mccoy to stick at nothing  about sunset the gale increased to a hurricane  john adams with several of the older youths went to the edge of the precipice near the eastern part of the village where a deep ravine ran up into the mountains  there under the shelter of a rock they discussed the situation  lucky that you didnt go toc said adams pointing at the sea whose waves were lashed and churned into seething foam  yes thanks be to god replied thursday  it will blow harder yet i think said charlie christian who had grown into a tall stripling of about seventeen  he resembled his father in the bright expression of his handsome face and in the vigour of his lithe frame  looks like it charlie  it minds me o a regular typhoon we had when you was quite a babby that blew down a lot o trees an almost took the roofs off our huts  as he spoke it seemed as if the wind grew savage at having been recognised for it came round the corner of the rock with a tremendous roar and nearly swept adamss old seafaring hat into the rising sea  id ha bin sorry to lose ee muttered john as he thrust the glazed and battered covering well down on his brows  i wore you in the bounty and i expect with care to make you last out my time an leave you as a legacy to my son george  lookout father shouted matt quintal and jack mills in the same breath  the whole party crouched close in beside the rock and looked anxiously upwards where a loud rending sound was going on  another moment and a large cocoanut palm growing in an exposed situation was wrenched from its hold and hurled like a feather over the cliffs carrying a mass of earth and stones along with it  its well the rock overhangs a bit or wed have got the benefit o that shower said adams  come boys its clear that were goin to have a dirty night of it an i think wed better look to our roofs an make all snug  if our groundtackle aint better than that o the tree which has just gone by the board we shall have a poor lookout  there was much cause for the anxiety which the seaman expressed regarding the roofs of the houses  already before they got back to the village part of the roof of one of the oldest huts had been stripped off and the women were beginning to look anxiously upwards as they heard the clattering overhead  now lads all hands to work  not a moment too soon either  out wi the old tacklin o the bounty  get the tarpaulins up  lash one over tocs hut  clap some big stones on quintals  fetch the ladders some o you youngsters  out o the way boys  here mainmast you get the little uns off to their bunks  fetch me the big sledgehammer charlie  look alive lads  while he shouted these directions john adams went to work as actively as the youngest among them  every one wrought with a will  in a few minutes all moveables were carried under shelter heavy stones were placed where they were required tarpaulins and stout ropes were lashed over roofs and pegged to the ground shutters and doors were made fast and in short the whole village was made snug for a dirty night with almost as much celerity as if it had been a fullymanned and welldisciplined ship of the line  as john adams had said it was not begun a moment too soon  they had barely finished indeed when the heavens appeared to rend with a blinding flash of lightning  then came a thunder crash or rather a series of crashes and flashes that seemed to imply the final crack of doom  this was followed by rain in sheets so heavy that it seemed as if the ocean had been lifted and poured upon the island  to render the confusion worse confounded the wind came in what may be called swirls overturning trees as if they were straws and mixing up rain mud stones and branches in the great hurlyburly until ancient chaos seemed to reign on land and sea  its an awful night said john adams as he sat beside his wife and listened while the children unable to sleep peeped in awe and wonder from their several bunks round the room  god save them thats at sea this night  amen said mrs adams  by midnight the typhoon had reached its height  the timbers of the houses appeared to groan under the strain to which they were subjected the whole heavens seemed in a continual blaze and the thunder came not in bursts but in one incessant roar with intermittent cracks now and then  occasionally there were louder crashes than usual which were supposed to be only more violent thunder but they were afterwards found to be the results of very different causes  now old ooman you turn in said adams when the small hours of morning had advanced a little  youll only be unfit for work tomorrow if you sit up bobbin about on your stool like that  mrs adams obediently and literally tumbled into her bunk without taking the trouble to undress while her anxious husband trimmed the lamp took down the bountys bible and made up his mind to spend the remainder of the night in study  away at the other end of the village near the margin of the ravine before referred to there stood a cottage in which there was evidently a watcher for the rays of his light could be seen through the chinks of the shutters  this was the house occupied by thursday october christian and his wife and baby  thursday like adams felt the anxieties of fatherhood strong upon him and was unable to sleep  he therefore also like adams made up his mind to sit up and read  carterets voyages claimed his attention and he was soon deep in this old book while his wife lay sound asleep with the baby in her arms in the same condition  both were quite deaf to the elemental turmoil going on around them  the watchful husband and father was still poring over his book when there came a noise so deafening that it caused him to start to his feet and awoke his wife  that cant be thunder he exclaimed and sprang to the door  the sight that met his gale when he looked out was sufficiently terrible  day had begun to dawn and the grey light showed him a large mass of earth and trees moving down the ravine  the latter were crashing and overturning  as he gazed they went bodily over the cliffs a mighty avalanche into the sea  the whole had evidently been loosened from the rocks by the action of the wind on the trees coupled with the deluges of rain  but this was not the worst of it  while thursday was gazing at this sight another crash was heard higher up the ravine  turning quickly in that direction he saw the land moving slowly towards him  immense masses of rock were borne along with slow but irresistible violence many cocoanut trees were torn up by the roots and carried bodily along with the tough stream of mud and stones and general debris  some of these trees advanced several yards in an upright position and then fell in dire confusion  suddenly toc observed to his horror that the mass was slowly bearing down straight towards his hut  indeed so much had his mind been impressed with the general wreck that he had failed to observe a few tons of stones and rubbish which even then appeared on the point of overwhelming him  without uttering a word he sprang into the hut  whats wrong thursday asked his wife in some alarm  never mind  hold your tongue an hold tight to dumplin  the baby had been named charles after tocs young brother and the inelegant name of dumplin had been given him to prevent his being confounded with charlie senior  susannah did as she was bid and the young giant rolling her and the baby and the bedclothes into one bundle lifted them in his widespreading arms and rushed out of the house  he had to pass a neighbours house on the way which also stood dangerously near the ravine  kicking its door open he shouted all hands ahoy  turn out turn out and passed on  a few seconds later john adams who had gone to sleep with his nose flattened on the bible was startled by the bursting in of his door  hallo toc he cried starting up whats wrong eh  all right father but the ravine is bearin down on us  thrusting his living bundle into an empty bunk the stout youth left it to look after itself and rushed out with adams to the scene of devastation  the avalanche was still advancing when they reached the spot but a fortunate obstruction had turned it away from the houses  it moved slowly but steadily downwards like genuine lava and in the course of a few hours swept some hundreds of cocoanut trees a yam ground containing nearly a thousand yams one of the canoes and a great mass of heterogeneous material over the cliffs into the sea  then the stream ceased to flow the consternation of the people began to abate and they commenced to repair as far as possible the damage caused by that memorable typhoon    chapter twenty seven  a picnic and a surprise  but the cyclone terrible though it was did not altogether put an end to the dumplin picnic if we may be allowed the phrase  it only delayed it  as soon as the weather cleared up that interesting event came off  wholl go by land and wholl go by water asked thursday when the heads of houses were assembled in consultation on the morning of the great day for great it was in more ways than one in the annals of pitcairn  ill go by water said charlie christian who was one of the heads inasmuch as he had been appointed to take charge of the hut which had been nearly carried away  does any one know how the girls are going asked matt quintal  im not sure said john adams with one of those significant glances for which he was noted  i did hear say that sally meant to go by land but of course i cant tell  girls will be girls you know an theres no knowing when you have them  well perhaps the land road will be pleasanter said charlie  yes now i think of it ill go by land  i think also continued adams without noticing charlies remark that some one said bessy mills was going by water  youre all wrong charlie about the land road said matt quintal the water is far better  i shall go by water  danl my lad said adams addressing young mccoy which way did you say youd go  i didnt say id go any way father answered dan  that may be so lad but youll have to go one way or other  not of necessity father  mightnt i stay at home and take care of the pigs  you might said adams with a smile if you think they would be suitable company for you  well now the sooner we start the better  i mean to go by water myself for im gettin rather stiff in the legs for cliffwork  besides i promised to give sarah quintal a lesson in deepsea fishing so shes goin with me  perhaps observed dan mccoy after a pause i might as well go by water too and if youve no objection to take me in your canoe i would lend you a hand wi the paddle  i would be suitable company for you father you know and im very anxious to improve in deepsea fishin  it dont take much fishin to find out how the wind blows you blessed innocents thought john adams with a quiet chuckle which somewhat disconcerted dan but he only said aloud well yes you may come but only on condition that you swim alongside for i mean to carry a cargo of staggerers and sprawlers  theres only one staggerer and one sprawler now said dan with a laugh your own george and tocs dumplin  just so but aint these a host in themselves  you keep your tongue under hatches dan or ill have to lash it to your jaw with a bit o ropeyarn  oh what a yarn id spin with it if you did retorted the incorrigible dan  but how are the jumpers to go and where are they  they may go as they please returned adams as he led the way to the footpath down the cliffs they went to help the women wi the victuals an ive no doubt are at their favourite game of slidin on the waves  he was right in this conjecture  while the younger women and girls of the village were busy carrying the provisions to the beach those active little members of the community who were styled jumpers and of whom there were still halfadozen were engaged in their favourite game  it was conducted amid shouts and screams of delight which rose above the thunder of the mighty waves that rolled in grand procession into the bay  ned quintal the stoutest and most daring as well as the oldest of these jumpers being over eight years was the best slider  he was on the point of dashing into the sea when adams and the others arrived on the scene  clothed only with a little piece of tapa cloth formed into breeches reaching to about the knees his muscular little frame was shown to full advantage as he stood with streaming curly hair having a thin board under his arm about three feet long and shaped like a canoe  he watched a mighty wave which was coming majestically towards him just as it was on the point of falling little ned held up the board in front of him and with one vigorous leap dived right through the wave and came out at the other side  thus he escaped being carried by it to the shore and swam over the rolling backs of the waves that followed it until he got out to sea  then turning his face landward he laid his board on the water and pushing it under himself came slowly in watching for a larger wave than usual  as he moved along little billy young ranged alongside  heres a big un billy cried ned panting with excitement and exertion as he looked eagerly over his shoulder at a billow which seemed big enough to have wrecked an east indiaman  billy did not reply for having a spice of dan mccoys funloving spirit in him he was intent on giving neds board a tip and turning it over  as the wave came up under them it began as it were to boil on the surface a sure sign that it was about to break  with a shout ned thrust his board along and actually mounted it in a sitting posture billy made a violent kick missed his aim lost hold of his own board and was left ignominiously behind  ned caught on the waves crest was carried with a terrific rush towards the shore  he retained his position for a few seconds then tumbled over in the tumult of water but got the board under him again as he was swept along  how that boy escaped being dashed to pieces on the rocks which studded bounty bay is more than we can comprehend much more therefore than we can describe  suffice it to say that he arrived somehow on his legs and was turning to repeat the manoeuvre when adams called to him and all the others to come ashore an get their sailin orders  things having been finally arranged adams said by the way whos stopping to take charge of poor jimmy young  a sympathetic look from every one and a sudden cessation of merriment followed the question for poor little james young the only invalid on pitcairn was afflicted with a complaint somewhat resembling that which carried off his father  of course continued adams i know that my old ooman an mainmast are with him but i mean who of the young folk  may christian said sally who had come down to see the waterparty start  two or three of us offered also to stay father but jim wouldnt hear of it an said he would cry all the time if we stayed he said that may was all he wanted  dear little jim said adams i do believe hes got more o gods book into him small though he is than all the rest of us put together  an hes not far wrong neither about may  shes worth a dozen ornary girls  now then lend a hand wi the canoe  are you ready mistress toc  quite replied the heroine of the day with a pleased glance in thursdays somewhat sheepish face  an dumplin is he ready said the seaman  the hero of the day was held up in the arms of his proud father  now then lads shove off  in a few minutes the canoe with its precious freight and thursday at the steeringpaddle was thrust through the wild surf and went skimming over the smooth sea beyond  immediately thereafter another canoe was launched with john adams and a miscellaneous cargo of children women and girls including graceful bessy mills and pretty sarah quintal  now then here goes cried matt quintal wading deep into the surf are you coming dan  im your man said dan following  both youths raised their hands and leaped together  they went through the first wave like two stalwart eels and were soon speeding after the canoes spurning the water behind them and conversing as comfortably on the voyage as though the sea were their native element  close on their heels went two of the most athletic among the smaller boys while one bold infant was arrested in a reckless attempt to follow by otaheitan sally who had to rush into the surf after him  descended though he was of an amiable race it is highly probable that this infant would have displayed the presence of white blood in his veins had his detainer been any other than sally but she possessed a power to charm the wildest spirit on the island  so the child consented to be good and go along with her overland  now are you ready to go said sally to charlie who was the only other one of the band left on the beach besides herself  poor charlie stood looking innocently into the sparkling face of the brunette  he did not know what was the matter with him still less did he care  he knew that he was supremely happy  that was enough  sally who knew quite well what was the matterquite as well almost as if she had gone through a regular civilised educationlaughed heartily grasped the infants fat paw and led him up the hill  truly it was a pleasant picnic these people had that day  healthy and hearty they probably came as near to the realisation of heaven upon earth as it is ever given to poor sinful man to know for they had love in their hearts and their religion drawn direct from the pure fountainhead was neither dimmed by false sentimentality on the one hand nor by hypocrisy on the other  perhaps john adams was the only one of the band who wondered at the sight and thanked god for undeserved and unexpected mercy for he alone fully understood the polluted stock from which they had all sprung and the terrible pit of heathenish wickedness from which they had been rescued not by him the humbled mutineer had long since escaped from that delusion but by the word of god  after proceeding a considerable distance along the rocky coast of their little isle john adams ordered the canoes to lieto while he made an attempt to catch a fresh cod for dinner  of course matt quintal and dan mccoy ranged up alongside and were speedily joined by some of the adventurous small boys  adams took these latter into the canoe but the former he ordered away  no no he said while sarah quintal assisted to get out the bait and bessy mills to arrange the line  no no we dont want no idlers here you be off to the rocks matt and dan an see what you can catch remember he who wont work shall not eat  there should be lots o crawfish about or you might try for a redsnapper  now be off both of you  ay ay father replied the youths pushing off and swimming shoreward rather unwillingly  i dont feel much inclined to go after crawfish or redsnappers today matt do you asked dan brushing the curls out of his eyes with his right hand  no not i but were bound to do something towards the dinner you know  at that moment there was a loud shouting and screaming from the canoe they looked quickly back  adams was evidently struggling with something in the water  he has hooked something big cried matt lets go see  dan said nothing but turned and made for the canoe with the speed of a porpoise  his companion followed  adams had indeed hooked a large cod or something like it and had hauled it near to the surface when the youths came up  have a care  he bolts about like a mad cracker cried adams  there i have him now  stand clear all  gently did the seaman raise the big fish to the surface and very tenderly did he play him on observing that he was not well hooked  come along my beauty  what a wopper  wont he go down without sauce pity ive got no kleek to gaff him  not quite so close dan hell gethah  the weight of the fish tore it from the hook at that moment and it dropped  dropped ay but not exactly into its native element  it dropped into dans bosom  with a convulsive grasp dan embraced it in his strong arms and sank  matt quintal dived also caught hold of the fish with both hands and worked his two thumbs deep into its gills  by the process called treading water the two soon regained the surface  sarah quintal seized dan mccoy by the hair bessy mills made a grasp at matt and caught him by the ear while john adams made a grab at the fish got him by the nose thrust a hand into his mouth which was wide open with surprise or something else as well it might be and caught it by the tongue  another moment and a wild cheer from the boys announced that the fish was safe in the canoe  were entitled to dinner now father said dan laughing  not a bit of it you lazy boys that fish is only big enough for the girls  we want something for the men and childn  be off again  with much more readiness the youths now gratified by their success turned to the outlying rocks of a low promontory which jutted from the inaccessible cliffs at that part  effecting a landing with some difficulty they proceeded to look for crawfish a species of lobster which abounds there  leaning over a ledge of rock and peering keenly down into a clear pool which was sheltered from the surf dan suddenly exclaimed theres one matt i see his feelers  as he spoke he dived into the water and disappeared  even a pearl diver might have wondered at the length of time he remained below  presently he reappeared puffing like a grampus and holding a huge lobsterlike creature in his hands  thatll stop the mouths of two or three of us matt he exclaimed looking round  but matt quintal was nowhere to be seen  he too had seen a fish and gone to beard the lobster in his den  in a few seconds he reappeared with another crawfish  thus in the course of a short time these youths captured four fine fish and returned to the canoe swimming on their backs with one in each hand  while things were progressing thus favourably at sea matters were being conducted not less admirably though with less noise on land  the canoe containing mrs toc and the celebrated baby went direct to the landingplace at martins cove which was a mere spot of sand in a narrow creek where landing was by no means easy even for these expert canoemen  here the women kindled a fire and heated the culinary stones while toc and some of the others clambered up the cliffs to obtain gulls eggs and cocoanuts  meanwhile charlie christian and otaheitan sally and the staggerer wended their way overland to the same rendezvous slowlyremarkably slowly they had so much to talk about not of politics you may be sure nor yet of love for they were somewhat shy of that being so to speak new to it  i wonder said charlie sitting down for the fiftieth time on a bank whereon time grew to such an extent that he seemed to take no account of it whatever i wonder if the people in the big world weve heard so much of from father lead as pleasant lives as we do  some of em do of course said sally  you know there are plenty of busy people among them who go about working read their bible an try to make other people happy so of course they must be happy themselves  thats true sall but then they have many things to worry them an you know we havent  yes theyve many things to worry them i suppose rejoined sall with a pensive look at the ground  i wonder what sort of things worry them most  it cant be dressin up grand an goin out to great parties an drivin in lovely carriages  nobody could be worried by that you know  charlie nodded his head and agreed with her entirely  neither can it be money resumed sall for money buys everything you want as father says and that can be nothin but pleasure  if their yamfields went wrong i could understand that because even you and i know somethin about such worries but you see they havent got no yamfields  then father says the rich ones among em eat an drink whatever they like and as much as they like and sleep as long as they like an we know that eatin an drinkin an sleepin dont worry us do they charlie  again charlie accorded unmeasured assent to salls propositions  i can understand better continued sall how the poor ones among em are worried  it must worry em a good deal i should think to see some people with far more than they want when they havent got half as much as they want an father says some of em are sometimes wellnigh starvin  now it must be a dreadful worry to starve  just think how funny it would feel to have nothin to eat at all not even a yam  then it must be a dreadful thing for the poor to see their childn without enough to eat  yes the poor childn of the poor must be a worry to em though the childn of the rich never are  at this point a wild shriek from the little child caused sallys heart to bound  she looked up and beheld the fat legs of her charge fly up as he went headlong over a precipice  fortunately the precipice was only three feet high so that when sally and charlie ran panting to the spot he was already on his feet looking much surprised but none the worse for his tumble  this incident sobered the inquisitive friends and brought them back from fanciful to actual life  they hurried over the remainder of the journey and arrived at martins cove just as the picnic party were beginning dinner  feasting is a commonplace and rather gross subject having many points of similitude in all lands  we shall therefore pass over this part of the days enjoyment merely remarking that what with fish and lobster and yams and cocoanuts and bananas and plantains and sundry compounds of the same made into cakes and clear water from the mountainside there was ample provision for the wants of nature  there was no lack either of that feast which is said to flow from reason and soul there was incident also to enliven the proceedings for the child who had come by the overland route with sally fell into something resembling a yampie and the hero of the day managed to roll into the oven which had cooked the victuals  fortunately it had cooled somewhat by that time and seemed to tickle his fancy rather than otherwise  dinner was concluded and as it had been preceded by asking a blessing it was now closed with thanksgiving  then dinah adams began to show a tendency to clear up the debris when dan mccoy who had wandered away with sarah quintal in search of shells to a neighbouring promontory suddenly uttered a tremendous and altogether new cry  what is he up to now said john adams rising hastily and shading his eyes with his hand  dan was seen to be gesticulating frantically on the rocks and pointing wildly out to sea  the whole party ran towards him and soon became as wildly excited as himself for there at long last was a ship far away on the horizon  to launch the canoes and make for home was the work of a very few minutes  no one thought of swimming now  those who did not go in the canoes went by the land road as fast as they could run and clamber  in a short time the gulls were left in undisturbed possession of martins cove    chapter twenty eight  the first ship and news of home  no wonder that there was wild excitement on the lonely island at the sight of this sail for with the exception of the ship that had been seen years before and only for a few minutes by sally and matt quintal no vessel of any kind had visited them during the space of nineteen years  ive longed for it old ooman as nobody but myself can understand said adams in a low earnest voice to his wife who stood on the cliffs beside him  although nearly blind mrs adams was straining her eyes in the direction of the strange sail  and now that its come continued her husband i confess to you lass im somewhat afeared to face it its not that i fear to die more than other men but id feel it awful hard to be took away from you an all them dear childn  but gods will be done  theyd never take you from us father exclaimed dinah adams who overheard this speech  theres no sayin di  ive forfeited my life to the laws of england i tell ee what it is thursday said adams going up to the youth who was gazing wistfully like the others at the rapidly approaching vessel it may be a manowar an they may praps want to ship me off to england on rather short notice  if so i must go but id rather not so ill retire into the bushes toc while you go aboard in the canoe ill have time to think over matters before you come back with word who they are an where they hail from  while thursday went down to the beach accompanied by charlie to prepare a canoe for this mission the ship drew rapidly near the island and soon after hove to just outside of bounty bay  as she showed no colours and did not look like a manofwar adams began to feel easier in his mind and again going out on the cliffs watched the canoe as it dashed through the surf  under the vigorous strokes of thursday and charlie christian it was soon alongside the strange ship  to judge from the extent to which the men opened their eyes there is reason to believe that those on board of that strange ship were filled with unusual surprise and well they might be for the appearance of our two heroes was not that which voyagers in the south pacific were accustomed to expect  the remarks of two of the surprised ones as the canoe approached will explain their state of mind better than any commentary  i say jack it aint a boat i guess its a canoe  yes bill its a canoe  what dye make em out to be jack  men i think leastwise theyre not much like monkeys though of coorse a feller cant be sure till they stand up an show their tailsor the want of em  well now remarked bill as the canoe drew nearer thats the most puzzlin lot ive seen since i was raised  they aint niggers thats plain theyre too lightcoloured for that an has none o the nigger brickdust in their faces  one on em moreover seems to have fair curly hair an they wears jackets an hats with something of a sailorcut about em  why i do blieve theyre shipwrecked sailors  no returned jack with a critical frown theyre not just the colour o white men  mayhap theyre a noo style o savage this bein raither an outotheway quarter  stand by with a rope there cried the captain of the vessel cutting short the discussion while the canoe ranged longside  ship ahoy shouted thursday in the true nautical style which he had learned from adams  if the eyes of the men who looked over the side of the ship were wide open with surprise before they seemed to blaze with amazement at the next remark by thursday  where dye hail from an whats your name he asked as charlie made fast to the rope which was thrown to them  the topaz from america captain folger answered the captain with a smile  with an agility worthy of monkeys and that might have justified jack and bill looking for tails the brothers immediately stood on the deck and holding out their hands offered with affable smiles to shake hands we need scarcely say the offer was heartily accepted by every one of the crew  and who may you be my good fellows asked captain folger with an amused expression  i am thursday october christian answered the youth drawing himself up as if he were announcing himself the king of the cannibal islands im the oldest son of fletcher christian one of the mutineers of the bounty an this is my brother charlie  the sailors glanced at each other and then at the stalwart youths as if they doubted the truth of the assertion  ive heard of that mutiny said captain folger  it was celebrated enough to make a noise even on our side of the atlantic  if i remember rightly most of the mutineers were caught on otaheite and taken to england being wrecked and some drowned on the way the rest were tried and some acquitted some pardoned and some hanged  i know nothin about all that said thursday with an interested but perplexed look  but i do sir said the man whom we have styled jack touching his hat to the captain  im an englishman as you knows an chanced to be in england at the very time when the mutineers was tried  there was nine o the mutineers sir as went off wi the bounty from otaheite an theyve never bin heard on from that day to this  yes yes exclaimed thursday with sudden animation thats us the nine mutineers came to our island here pitcairn an remained here ever since an weve all bin born here theres lots more of usboys and girls  you dont say so exclaimed the captain whose interest was now thoroughly aroused  are the nine mutineers all on pitcairn still  thursdays mobile countenance at once became profoundly sad and he shook his head slowly  no said he theyre all dead but one  john adams is his name  dont remember that name among the nine said to be lost remarked the englishman  ive heard father say he was sometimes called john smith said thursday  ah yes  i remember the name of smith said jack  he was one of em  and is he the only man left on the island asked the captain  yes the only man replied thursday who had never yet thought of himself in any other light than a boy an if youll come ashore in our canoe fatherll take you to his house an treat you to the best hes got  hell be right glad to see you too for hes not seen a soul except ourselves for nigh twenty years  not seen a soul  dye mean to say no ship has touched here for that length of time asked the captain in surprise  no except one that only touched an went off without discovering that we were here an none of us found out she had bin here till we chanced to see her sailin away far out to sea  that was five years ago  thats very strange and interestin  id like well to visit old adams lad an i thank ee for the invitation but i wont run my ship through such a surf as that an dont like to risk leavin her to go ashore in your canoe  if you please sir id be very glad to go an bring off what news there is said jack the english sailor whose surname was brace  at first captain folger refused this offer but on consideration he allowed jack to go promising at the same time to keep as near to the shore as possible so that if there was anything like treachery he might have a chance of swimming off  so your father is dead asked the captain as he walked with thursday to the side  yes long long ago  but you called adams father just now  hows that  oh we all calls im that  its only a way weve got into  what made your father call you thursday  cause i was born on a thursday  hm i an i suppose if youd bin born on a tuesday or saturday hed have called you by one or other of these days  spose so said thursday with much simplicity  are you married thursday  yes im married to susannah said thursday with a pleased smile shes a dear girl though shes a deal older than meold enough to be my mother  and ive got a babby tooa splendid babby  thursday passed ever the side as he said this and fortunately did not see the merriment which him remarks created  jack brace followed him into the canoe and in less than halfanhour he found himself among the wondering admiring almost awestruck islanders of pitcairn  its a man whispered poor mainmast to susannah with the memory of fletcher christian strong upon her  what a lovely beard he has murmured sally to bessy mills  charlie christian and matt quintal chancing curiously enough to be near sally and bessy overheard the whisper and for the first time each received a painful stab from the greeneyed demon jealousy  but the children did not whisper their comments  they crowded round the seaman eagerly  youve come to live with us asked dolly young looking up in his face with an innocent smile and taking his rough hand  to tell us stories said little arthur quintal with an equally innocent smile  well no my dears not exactly answered the seaman looking in a dazed manner at the pretty faces and graceful forms around him but if i only had the chance to remain here its my belief that i would  further remark was stopped by the appearance of john adams coming towards the group  he walked slowly and kept his eyes steadily yet wistfully fastened on the seaman  holding out his hand he said in a low tone as if he were soliloquising at last  its like a dream then as the sailor grasped his hand and shook it warmly he added aloud a hearty welcome welcome to pitcairn  thank ee thank ee said jack brace not less heartily an may i ax if you are one o the bounty mutineers an no mistake  the old tone murmured adams and the old lingo an the old cut o the jib ananthe old toggery  he took hold of a flap of jacks peajacket and almost fondled it  oh man but it does my heart good to see you  come come away up to my house an have some grub  yes yesaxin your pardon for not answerin right offi am one o the bounty mutineers the last onejohn smith once better known now as john adams  but where do you hail from friend  jack at once gave him the desired information told him on the way up all he knew about the fate of the mutineers who had remained at otaheite and received in exchange a brief outline of the history of the nine mutineers who had landed on pitcairn  the excitement of the two men and their interest in each other increased every moment the one being full of the idea of having made a wonderful discovery of as it were a lost community the other being equally full of the delight of once more talking to a mana seamana messmate he might soon say for he meant to feed him like a prince  get a pig cooked molly he said during a brief interval in the conversation an do it as fast as you can  theres one amost readybaked now replied mrs adams  all right send the girls for fruit and make a glorious spread outside hell like it better than in the houseunder the banyantree sit down sit down messmate  turning to the sailor man what a time it is since ive used that blessed word  sit down and have a glass  jack brace smacked his lips in anticipation thanked adams in advance and drew his sleeve across his mouth in preparation while his host set a cocoanutcup filled with a whitish substance before him  thats a noo sort of a glass john adams remarked the man as he raised and smelt it also a strange kind o tipple  he sipped and seemed disappointed  then he sipped again and seemed pleased  what is it may i ax  its milk of the cocoanut answered adams  milk o the kokonut eh  well now that is queer  if youd a called it the milk o the cowcownut i could have believed it howsever it aint bad tho raither wishywashy  got no stronger tipple than that  nothin stronger than that xcept water said john with one of his sly glances but its a toss up which is the strongest  well itll be a toss down with me whichever is the strongest said the accommodating tar as he once more raised the cup to his lips and drained it  but i say you unhung mutineer do you mean for to tell me that all them goodlookin boys an girls are yours  he looked round on the crowd of openmouthed young people who from sixfoot toc down to the youngest staggerer gazed at him solemnly all eyes and ears  no they aint answered adams with a laugh  what makes you ask  cause they all calls you father  oh replied his host thats only a way they have but theres only four of em mine three girls an a boy  the rest are the descendants of my eight comrades who are now dead and gone  well now dye know john adams alias smith mutineer as ought to have bin hung but wasnt an as nobody would have the heart to hang now even if they had the chance this here adventur is out o sight one o the most extraornar circumstances as ever did happen to me since i was the length of a marlinspike  as mainmast here entered to announce that the pig was ready for consumption the amazed mariner was led to a rich repast under the neighbouring banyantree  here he was bereft of speech for a considerable time whether owing to the application of his jaws to food or increased astonishment it is difficult to say  before the repast began adams according to custom stood up removed his hat and briefly asked a blessing  to which all assembled with clasped hands and closed eyes responded amen  this no doubt was another source of profound wonder to jack brace but he made no remark at the time  neither did he remark on the fact that the women did not sit down to eat with the males of the party but stood behind and served them conversing pleasantly the while  after dinner was concluded and thanks had been returned jack brace leaned his back against one of the descending branches of the banyantree and with a look of supreme satisfaction drew forth a short black pipe  at sight of this the countenance of adams flushed and his eyes almost sparkled  there it is again he murmured the old pipe once more  let me look at it jack brace its not the first by a long way that ive handled  jack handed over the pipe a good deal amused at the manner of his host who took the implement of fumigation and examined it carefully handling it with tender care as if it were a living and delicate creature  then he smelt it then put it in his mouth and gave it a gentle draw while an expression of pathetic satisfaction passed over his somewhat careworn countenance  the old taste not a bit changed he murmured shutting his eyes brings back the old ships and the old messmates and the old times and old england  come old feller said jack brace if its so powerful why not light it and have a real good pull for old acquaintance sake  he drew from his pocket flint and tinder matches being unknown in those days and began to strike a light when adams took the pipe hastily from his mouth and handed it back  no no he said with decision its only the old associations that it calls up thats all  as for baccy ive bin so long without it now that i dont want it and it would only be foolish in me to rouse up the old cravin  there you light it jack  ill content myself wi the smell of it  well john adams have your way  you are king here you know nobody to contradict you  so ill smoke instead of you if these young ladies wont object  the young ladies referred to were so far from objecting that they were burning with impatience to see a real smoker go to work for the tobacco of the mutineers had been exhausted and all the pipes broken or lost before most of them were born  and let me tell you john adams continued the sailor when the pipe was fairly alight ive not smoked a pipe in such koorious circumstances since i lit one an had my right forefinger shot off when i was stuffin down the baccy in the maintop o the victory at the battle o trafalgar  but it was against all rules to smoke in action an served me right  howsever it got me my discharge and thats how i come to be in a yankee merchantman this good day  at the mention of battle and being wounded in action the old professional sympathies of john adams were awakened  what battle might that have been he asked  which said jack  traflegar said the other  jack brace took the pipe out of his mouth and looked at adams as though he had asked where adam and eve had been born  for some time he could not make up his mind how to reply  you dont mean to tell me he said at length that youve never heard of thebattleoftrafalgar  never answered adams with a faint smile  nor of the great lord nelson  never heard his name till today  you forget jack that ive not seen a mortal man from old england or any other part o the civilised world since the 28th day of april 1789 and thats full nineteen years ago  thats true john thats true said the seaman slowly as if endeavouring to obtain some comprehension of what depths of ignorance the fact implied  so i suppose youve never heerd tell ofhold on let me rake up my brainpan a bit  he tilted his straw hat and scratched his head for a few minutes puffing the while immense clouds of smoke to the inexpressible delight of the openmouthed youngsters around him  youyouve never heerd tell of lord howe who licked the french off ushant somewheres about sixteen years gone by  never  nor of the great victories gained in the 95 by sir edward pellew an admiral hotham an admiral cornwallis an lord bridgeport  no of coorse ye couldnt nor yet of admiral duncan who in the 97 i think it was beat the dutch fleet near camperdown all to sticks nor yet of that tremendous fight off cape saint vincent in the same year when sir john jervis with nothin more than fifteen sail o the mediterranean fleet attacked the spaniards wi their twentyseven ships o the linelineobattle ships youll observe john adamsan took four of em knocked half of the remainder into universal smash an sunk all the rest  that was splendid exclaimed adams his martial spirit rising while the eyes of the young listeners around kept pace with their mouths in dilating  splendid  pooh said jack brace delivering puffs between sentences that resembled the shots of miniature seventyfours that was nothin to what followed  nelson was in that fight he was an nelson began to shove out his horns a bit soon after that i tell you  well well continued the british tar with a resigned look to think of meetin a man out of bedlam who hasnt heerd of nelson and the nile wich of coorse ye havent  its worth while comin all this way to see you  adams smiled and said lets hear all about it  all about it john  why it would take me all night to tell you all about it there was an audible gasp of delight among the listeners and i havent time for that but you must know that lord nelson bein sir horatio nelson at that time chased the french fleet under admiral brueys into aboukir bay thats on the coast of egypt sailed in after em anchored alongside of em opened on em wi both broadsides at once an blew them all to bits  you dont say that jack brace  yes i do john adams an nine french lineobattle ships was took two was burnt two escaped and the biggest o the lot the great threedecker the orient was blowed up an sent to the bottom  it was a thoroughgoin piece o business that i tell you an nelson meant it to be for wen he gave the signal to go into close action he shouted victory or westminster abbey  what did he mean by that asked adams  why dont you see westminster abbey is the old church in london where they bury the great nobs o the nation in theres none but great nobs there you knowsnobs not allowed on no account whatever  so he meant of coorse victory or death dye see  after which hed be put into westminster abbey  an death it was to many a good man that day  why if you take even the orient alone wen she was blowed up admiral brueys himself an a thousand men went up along with her an never came down again so far as we know  it must have bin bloody work said adams  i believe you my boy continued the sailor it was bloody work there was some of our chaps that was always for reasonin about things an would never take anything on trust xcept their own inventions who used to argufy that it was an awful waste o human life to say nothin o treasure as they called it all for nothin  i used to wonder sometimes why them reasoners jined the sarvice at all but to be sure most of em had been pressed  to my thinkin war wouldnt be worth a brass farthin if there wasnt a deal o blood and thunder about it an of coorse if were goin to have that sort o thing we must pay for it  then we didnt do it for nothin  is it nothin to have the honour an glory of lickin the mounseers an bein able to sing britannia rules the waves  john adams who was not fond of argument and did not agree with some of jacks reasoning said praps and then drawing closer to his new friend with deepening interest said well jack what more has happened  what more  why ill have to start a fresh pipe before i can answer that  having started a fresh pipe he proceeded and the group settled down again to devour his words and watch and smell the smoke  well then there wasbut you know i aint a dictionry or a cyclopodia or a gazinteerlet me see  after the battle o the nile there came the irish rebellion  did that do em much good jack  o yes john it united em immediately after to old england so that were now great britain an ireland  then sir ralph abercromby he gave the french an awful lickin on land in egypt at aboukir where nelson had wopped em on the sea and last of all came the glorious battle of trafalgar  but it wasnt all glory for we lost lord nelson there  he was killed  that was a bad business said adams with a look of sympathy  and you was in that battle was you  in it  i should just think so replied jack brace looking contemplatively at his mutilated finger  why i was in lord nelsons own ship the victory  come ill give you an outline of it  this is how it began  the exmanofwarsman puffed vigorously for a few seconds to get the pipe well alight he remarked and collect his thoughts    chapter twenty nine  jack brace stirs up the war spirit of adams  you must know john adams said jack brace with a look and a clearing of the throat that raised great expectations in the breasts of the listeners you must know that for a long while before the battle lord nelson had bin scourin the seas far and near in search o the french and spanish fleets but do what he would he could never fall in with em  at last he got wind of em in cadiz harbour and made all sail to catch em  it was on the 19th of october 1805 that villeneuve that was the french admiral put to sea with the combined fleets o france and spain  it wasnt till daybreak of the 21st that we got sight of em right ahead formed in close line about twelve miles to leeard standin to the suthard off cape trafalgar  ha john adams an boys an girls all you should have seen that sight it would have done you good  an you should have felt our buzzums they was fit to bust i tell you  you see wed bin chasin of em so long that we could scarce believe our eyes when we saw em at long last  they wor bigger ships and more of em than ours but what cared nelson for that not the shank of a brass button he rather liked that sort o thing for you know one englishman is equal to three frenchmen any day  no no jack brace said john adams with a quiet smile and shake of the head snot quite so many as that  not quite repeated brace vehemently why its my opinion that i could lick any six o the mounseers myself  thursday november christian there  he aint november yet interrupted adams quietly hes only october  no matter its all the same  i tell ee john that he could wallop twenty of em easy  there aint no go in em at all  didnt you tell me jack brace that trafalgar was a glorious battle  in coorse i did for so it was  didnt the frenchmen stick to their guns like men  no doubt of it  an they didnt haul down their colours i suppose till they was about blown to shivers  youre about right there john adams  well then you cant say theyve got no go in em  dont underrate your enemy whatever you do for its not fair besides in so doin you underrate your own deeds  moreover we dont allow boastin aboard of this island so go ahead jack brace and tell us what you did do without referrin to what you think you could do  mind im king here and ill have to clap you in irons if you let your tongue wag too freely  all right your majesty replied brace with a bow of graceful humility which deeply impressed his juvenile audience ill behave better in futur if youll forgive me this time  well as i was about to say when you sent that round shot across my bows and brought me up nelson he would have fought em if theyd had ten times the number o ships that we had  as it was the enemy had thirtythree sail of the line and seven frigates  we had only twentyseven sail of the line and four frigates so we was outnumbered by nine vessels  moreover the enemy had 4000 lobsters on board  lobsters bein land sodgers my dears remarked adams in explanation socalled cause of their bein all redcoated but the french sodgers are only redtrousered coats bein blue  axin your pardon brace go on  the seaman who had availed himself of the interruption to stir up and stuff down his pipe resumed  likewise one of their lineobattle ships was a huge fourdecker called the santissima trinidad and they had some of the best tyrolese riflemen that could be got scattered throughout the fleet as we afterwards came to find out to our cost  soon after daylight nelson came on deck  i see him as plain as if he was before me at this moment for bein stationed in the mizzentop o the victorythat was nelsons ship you knowi could see everything quite plain  he stood there for a minute or so with his admirals frockcoat covered with orders on the left breast and his empty right sleeve fastened up to it for you must know he had lost his right arm in action before that and also his right eye but the arm and eye that were left were quite enough for him to work with  after a word or two with the officers he signalled to bear down on the enemy in two lines  then it seemed to have occurred to him that the smoke of battle might render the signals difficult or impossible to make out for he immediately made one that would serve for everything  it was this if signals cant be seen no captain can do wrong if he places his ship alongside an enemy  of coorse we all knew that he meant to win that battle but for the matter of that every soul in the fleet from the admiral to the smallest powdermonkey meant  boasting not allowed said dan mccoy displaying his fine teeth from ear to ear  the seaman looked at him with a heavy frown  you young slip of a pumphandle what dye mean  the kings orders said dan pointing to adams while the rest of the pitcairners seemed awestruck by his presumption  the frown slowly left the visage of jack brace  he shut his eyes smiled benignly and delivered a series of heavy puffs from the starboard side of his mouth  then a little squeak that had been bottled up in the nose of otaheitan sally forced a vent and the whole party burst into hilarious laughter  just so resumed brace when they had recovered that is exactly what we did in the mizzentop o the victory when we made out the signal only we stuck a cheer on to the end o the laugh  after that came another signal just as we were about to go into action england expects that every man will this day do his duty  the effect of that signal was just treemendious i tell you  i noticed at this time that some of nelsons officers were botherin himtryin to persuade him so to speak to do somethin he didnt want to  i afterwards found out that they were tryin to persuade him not to wear his orders but he wouldnt listen to em  then they tried to convince him it would be wise for him to keep out of action as long as possible  he seemed to give in to this for he immediately signalled the temeraire and leviathan which were abreast of us to pass ahead but in my opinion this was nothin more than a sly joke of the admiral for he kept carrying on all sail on the victory so that it wasnt possible for these ships to obey the order  we made the attack in two lines  the victory led the weatherline of fourteen ships and collingwood in the royal sovereign led the leeline of thirteen ships  as we bore down the enemy opened the ball  we held our breath for as no doubt you know messmate just before the beginnin of a fight when a man is standin still an doin nothin hes got time to think an he does think too in a way mayhap that hes not much used to think  thats true jack brace responded adams with a grave nod an dye know it strikes me that it would be better for all of us if wed think oftener in that fashion when weve got time to do it  youre right john adams youre right  howsever we hadnt much time to think that morning for the shot soon began to tell  one round shot came as it seemed straight for my head but it missed me by a shave an only took off the hat of a man beside me that was about a fut shorter than myself  you see the advantage says he o bein a little feller  thats so says i but i didnt say or think no more that i knows on after that for we had got within musket range and the small bullets went whistling about our heads pickin off or woundin a man here an there  it was just then that i thought it time to put my pipe in my pocket for you see i had been havin a puff on the sly as we was bearin down an i put up my forefinger to shove the baccy down when one o them stingin little things comes along whips my best cutty out o my mouth an carries the finger along with it  of coorse i warnt goin below for such a small matter so i pulls out my hankerchief an says i to the little man that lost his hat just take a round turn here jim says i an ill be ready for action again in two minutes  jim he tied it up but before he quite done it the round shot was pitchin into us like hail cuttin up the sails and riggin most awful  they told me afterwards that nelson gave orders to steer straight for the bow of the great santissima trinidad and remarked its too warm work to last long but he did not return a single shot though about fifty of our men had been killed and wounded  you see he never was fond of wastin powder an shot  he generally reserved his fire till it could be delivered with stunnin effect  just then a round shot carried away our maintopmast with all her stunsls an booms  by good luck however we were close alongside o the enemys ship redoubtable by that time  our tiller ropes were shot away too but it didnt matter much now  the word was given and we opened with both broadsides at once  you should have felt the victory tremble john adams  we tackled the redoubtable with the starboard guns and the bucentaur and santissima trinidad with the port guns of course they gave it us hot and strong in reply  at the same time captain hardy in the temeraire fell on board the redoubtable on her other side and the fougueux another o the enemy fell on board the temeraire so there we were four ships abreasta compact tier blazin into each other like mad with the muzzles of the guns touchin the sides when they were run out an men stationed with buckets at the ports to throw water into the shotholes to prevent their takin fire  it was awful work i tell you with the neverstopping roar of great guns and rattle of small arms an the smoke an the decks slippery with blood  the order was given to depress our guns and load with light charges of powder to prevent the shot going right through the enemy into our own ship on the other side  the redoubtable flew no colours so we couldnt tell when she struck and twice the admiral wishing to spare life gave orders to cease firing thinking she had given in  but she had not done so and soon after a ball from her mizzentop struck nelson on the left shoulder and he fell  they took him below at once  of course we in the mizzentop knew nothing of this for we couldnt see almost anything for the smoke only here and there a bit of a mast or a yardarm or a bowsprit while the very air trembled with the tremendous and continuous roar  we were most of us wounded by that time more or less but kept blazing away as long as we could stand  then there came cheers of triumph mingling with the shouts and cries of battle  the ships of the enemy were beginning to strike  one after another the flags went down before long the cry was five have struck then ten hurrah then fifteen then twenty hurrah  hurrah  old england for ever cried adams starting to his feet and waving his hat in a burst of irrepressible excitement which roused the spirits of the youths around who leaping up with flushed faces and glittering eyes sent up from the groves of pitcairn a vigorous british cheer in honour of the great victory of trafalgar  but continued jack brace when the excitement had abated there was great sorrow mingled with our triumph that day for nelson the hero of a hundred fights was dead  the ball had entered his spine  he lived just long enough to know that our victory was complete and died thanking god that he had done his duty  that was truly a great battle said adams while brace having concluded was refilling his pipe  right you are john said the other about the greatest victory we ever gained  it has settled the fleets of france and spain i guess for the next fifty years  but what was it all for asked bessy mills looking up in the sailors face with much simplicity  what was it for repeated brace with a perplexed look  why my dear it wasit was for the honour and glory of old england to be sure  no no jack not quite that interposed adams with a laugh it was to clap a stopper on the ambition of the french as far as i can make out or rather to snub that rascal napoleon bonnypart an keep him within bounds  but he aint easy to keep within bounds said brace putting his pipe in his pocket and rising for hes been knockin the lobsters of europe over like ninepins of late years  howsever well lick him yet on land as weve licked him already on the sea or my names not  he stopped abruptly having caught sight of dan mccoys twinkling eye  now john adams i must go else the capnll think ive deserted altogether  oh dont go yet please dont pleaded dolly young as she grasped and fondled the seamans huge hand  dolly was at that time about nine years of age and full of enthusiasm she was seconded in her entreaties by dinah adams who seized the other hand while several of the older girls sought to influence him by words and smiles but jack brace was not to be overcome  ill be ashore again tomorrow praps with the captain if he lands said brace and spin you some more yarns about the wars  with this promise they were obliged to rest content  in a few minutes the visitor was carried over the surf by toc and charlie in their canoe and soon put on board the topaz which stood inshore to receive him    chapter thirty  adams and the girls  great was the interest aroused on board the topaz when jack brace narrated his experiences among the islanders and captain folger resolved to pay them a visit  he did so next day accompanied by the englishman and some of the other men the sight of whom gladdened the eyes and hearts of adams and his large family  besides assuring himself of the truth of braces statements the captain obtained additional proof of the truth of adamss account of himself and his community in the form of the chronometer and azimuth compass of the bounty  how many did you say your colony consists of asked folger  thirtyfive all told sir answered adams but i fear we shall be only thirtyfour soon  how so  one of our lads a dear boy of about eight years of age is dying i fear returned adams sadly  im sorry to hear it and still more sorry that i have no doctor in my ship said folger but i have a smatterin of doctors work myself let me see him  adams led the way to the hut where poor james young lay tenderly nursed by mary christian  the boy was lying on his bed as they entered gazing wistfully out at the little window which opened from the side of it like the portlights or bullseyes of a ships berth  his young nurse sat beside him with the bounty bible open on her knees  she shut it and rose as the strangers entered  the poor invalid was too weak to take much interest in them  he was extremely thin and breathed with great difficulty  nevertheless his face flushed and a gleam of surprise shot from his eyes as he turned languidly towards the captain  my poor boy said folger taking his hand and gently feeling his pulse do you suffer much  yesvery much said little james with a sickly smile  can you rest at all asked the captain  i amalwaysresting he replied with a pause between each word restingon jesus  the captain was evidently surprised by the answer  who told you about jesus he asked  gods bookandthe holyspirit  it was obvious that the exertion of thinking and talking was not good for poor little james  captain folger therefore after smoothing the hair on his forehead once or twice very tenderly bade him goodbye and went out  doctors could do nothing for the child he said while returning with adams to his house but he is rather to be envied than pitied  i would give much for the rest which he apparently has found  give much exclaimed adams with an earnest look  rest in the lord is not to be purchased by gifts  itself is the grand free gift of god to man to be had for the asking  i know it was the captains curt reply as he entered adamss house where got you the chronometer and azimuth compass he said on observing these instruments  they belonged to the bounty  you are heartily welcome to both of them if you choose they are of no use to me  see note  folger accepted the gift and promised to write to england and acquaint the government with his discovery of the colony  you see sir said adams with a grave look while hospitably entertaining his visitor that afternoon we are increasing at a great rate and although they may perhaps take me home and swing me up to the yardarm i think it better to run the risk o that than to leave all these poor young things here unprotected  why just think what might happen if one o them traders which are little better than pirates were to come an find us here  he looked at the captain earnestly  now if we were under the protection o the british flagonly just recognised as it werethat would go a long way to help us and prevent mischief  at this point the importunities of some of the young people to hear about the outside world prevailed and folger began as jack brace had done the day before to tell them some of the most stirring events in the history of his own land  but he soon found out that the mental capacity of the pitcairners was like a bottomless pit  however much they got they wanted more anecdote after anecdote story after story fact after fact was thrown into the gulf and still the cry was more more  at last he tore himself away  goodbye and god bless you all he said while stepping into the canoe which was to carry him off  i wont forget my promise  and tell em to send us storybooks shouted daniel mccoy as the canoe rose on the back of the breakers  the captain waved his hand  most of the women and children wiped their eyes and then they all ran to the heights to watch the topaz as she sailed away  they watched her till she vanished over that mysterious horizon which seemed to the pitcairners the utmost boundary of the world and some of them continued to gaze until the stars came out and the gulls retired to bed and the soft black mantle of night descended like a blessing of tranquillity on land and sea  before bidding the topaz farewell we may remark that captain folger faithfully fulfilled his promise  he wrote a letter to england giving a full account of his discovery of the retreat of the mutineers which aroused much interest all over the land but at that time the stirring events of warfare filled the minds of men in europe so exclusively that the lonely island and its inhabitants were soon forgottenat least no action was taken by the governmentand six years elapsed before another vessel sailed out of the great world into the circle of vision around pitcairn  meanwhile the pitcairners knowing that even at the shortest a long long time must pass before folger could communicate with the old country continued the even tenor of their innocent lives  the school prospered and became a vigorous institution  the church not less so  more children were born to thursday october insomuch that he at last had one for every workingday in the week more yamfields were cultivated and more marriages took placebut hold this is anticipating  we have said that the school prospered  the entire community went to it male and female old and young  john adams not only taught his pupils all he knew but set himself laboriously to acquire all the knowledge that was to be obtained by severe study of the bible the prayerbook  carterets voyages and by original meditation  from the first mine he gathered and taught the grand plain and blessed truths about salvation through jesus together with a few tares of error resulting from misconception and imperfect reasoning  from the second he adopted the forms of worship of the church of england  from the third he gleaned and amplified a modicum of nautical geographical and general information and from the fourth he extracted a flood of miscellaneous incomplete and disjointed facts fancies and fallacies which at all events served the good purpose of interesting his pupils and exercising their mental powers  but into the midst of all this life death stepped and claimed a victim the great destroyer came not however as an enemy but as a friend to raise little james young to that perfect rest of which he had already had a foretaste on the island  it was the first death among the second generation and naturally had a deeply solemnising effect on the young people  this occurred soon after the departure of the topaz  the little grave was made under the shade of a palmgrove where wildflowers grew in abundance and openings in the leafy canopy let in the glance of heavens blue eye  one evening about six months after this event adams went up the hill to an eminence to which he was fond of retiring when a knotty problem in arithmetic had to be tackled  arithmetic was his chief difficulty  the soliloquy which he uttered on reaching his place of meditation will explain his perplexities  that rithmetic do bother me an no mistake he said with a grave shake of the head at a lively lizard which was looking up in his face you see history is easy  what i knows i knows an can teach an what i dont know i let alone an theres an end ont  theres no makin a better o that  then as to writin though my hand is crabbed enough and my pothooks are shaky and sprawly still i know the shapes o things an the youngsters are so quick that they can most of em write better than myself but in regard to that rithmetic its a heartbreak altogether for ive only just got enough of it to puzzle me wi the use o my fingers i can do simple addition pretty well an i can screw round subtraction but multiplications a terrible business unfortnitely my edication has carried me only the length o the fourth line an that aint enough  he paused and the lively lizard ready to fly at a moments notice put its head on one side as if interested in the mans difficulty  seven times eight now continued adams  ive no more notion what that is than the man in the moon  an ive no table to tell me an no way o findin it outeh  why yes i have  ill mark em down one at a time an count em up  he gave his thigh a slap which sent the lively lizard into his hole horrified  poor thing i didnt mean that he said to the absent animal howsever ill try it  why ill make a multiplicationtable for myself  strange that that way never struck me before  as he went on muttering he busied himself in rubbing clean a flat surface of rock on which with a piece of reddish stone he made a row of eight marks one below another  alongside of that he made another row of eight marks and so on till he had put down seven rows when he counted them up and found the result to be fiftysix  this piece of acquired knowledge he jotted down in a little notebook which with a quantity of other stationery had originally belonged to that great fountain of wealth the bounty  why ill make out the whole table in this way he said quite heartily as he sat down again on the flat rock and went to work  of course he found the process laborious especially when he got among the higher numbers but adams was not a man to be turned from his purpose by trifles  he persevered until his efforts were crowned with success  while he was engaged with the multiplication problem on that day he was interrupted by the sound of merry voices and soon otaheitan sally bessy mills may christian sarah quintal and his own daughter dinah came tripping up the hill towards him  these five ranging from fifteen to nineteen were fond of rambling through the woods in company being not only the older members of the young flock but likeminded in many things  sally was looked up to by the other four as being the eldest and wisest as well as the most beautiful and truly the fine clear complexion of the pretty brunette contrasted well with their fairer skins and golden or lightbrown locks  we came up to have a chat with you father said sally as they drew near  are you too busy to be bothered with us  never too busy to chat with such dear girls said the gallant seaman throwing down his piece of red chalk and taking one of sallys hands in his  sit down sall sit down may on the other sidethere  now what have you come to chat about  about that dear topaz of course and that darling captain folger and jack brace and all the rest of them answered sarah quintal with sparkling eyes  hallo sarah youve sent your heart away with them i fear said adams  not quite but nearly returned sarah  i would give anything if the whole crew would only have stayed with us altogether  oh how charming delightful so nice exclaimed three of the others  sally said nothing but gave a little smile which sent a sparkle from her pearly teeth that harmonised well with the gleam of her laughterloving eyes  no doubt said adams with a peculiar laugh but i say girls you must not go on thinking for ever about that ship  why it is six months or more since it left us and you are all as full of it as if it had sailed but yesterday  how can we help it father said sally  it is about the most wonderful thing that has happened since we were born and you cant expect us to get it out of our heads easily  and how can we help thinking and talking too said bessy mills about all the new and strange things that jack brace related to us  besides father said dinah you are quite as bad as we are for you talk about nothing else now almost except lord nelson and the battles of the nile and trafalgar  come come di dont be hard on me  i dont say much about them battles now  indeed you do cried may christian and it is only last night that i heard you muttering something about trafalgar in your sleep and you suddenly broke out with a halfmuttered shout like this englan specs every manll dos dooty  may was not a bad mimic  this was received with a shout of laughter by the other girls  while they were conversing thus two tall and slim but broadshouldered youths were seen climbing the hill towards them engaged in very earnest conversation  and this reference to conversation reminds us of the curious fact that the language of the young pitcairners had greatly improved of late  as they had no other living model to improve upon than john adams this must have been entirely the result of reading although the books they had were few they proved to be sufficient not only to fill their minds with higher thoughts but their mouths with purer english than that nautical type which had been peculiar to the mutineers  the tall striplings who now approached were daniel mccoy and charlie christian  these two were great friends and confidants  we will not reveal the subject of their remarkably earnest conversation but merely give the concluding sentences  well charlie said dan as they came in view of the knoll on which adams and the girls were seated we will pluck up courage and make a dash at it together  yees said charlie with hesitation  and shall we break the ice by referring to tocs condition eh said dan  well it seems to me the easiest plan perhaps i should say the least difficult returned charlie with a faint smile  come dont lose heart charlie said dan with an attempt to look humorous which signally failed  hallo lads where away said adams as they came up  just bin havin a walk and a talk father answered dan  we saw you up here and came to walk back with you  im not so sure that well let you  the girls and i have been having a pleasant confab an praps they dont want to be interrupted  oh we dont mind they may come said di adams with a laugh  so the youths joined the party and they all descended the mountain in company    a footnote in lady belchers book tells us that this chronometer had been twice carried out by captain cook on his voyages of discovery  it was afterwards supplied to the bounty when she was fitted out for what was to be her last voyage and carried by the mutineers to pitcairn island  captain folger brought it away but it was taken from him the same year by the governor of juan fernandez and sold in chili to a caldeleugh esquire of valparaiso from whom it was purchased by captain afterwards admiral sir t herbert for fifty guineas  that officer took it to china and in 1843 brought it to england and transmitted it to the admiralty by which department it was presented to the united service museum in great scotland yard where the writer saw it only a few days ago and was told that it keeps excellent time still    chapter thirty one  treats of interesting matters  of course charlie christian gravitated towards sally and these two falling slowly behind the rest soon turned aside and descended by another of the numerous paths which traversed that part of the mountain  of course also daniel mccoy drew near to sarah quintal and these two falling slowly behind sought another of the mountainpaths  it will be seen that these young people were charmingly unsophisticated  for a considerable time charlie walked beside sally without uttering a word and sally seeing that there was something on his mind kept silence  at last charlie lifted his eyes from the ground and with the same innocent gaze with which as an infant he had been wont to look up to his guardian he now looked down at her and said sally  well charlie  there was a little smile lurking about the corners of the girls mouth which seemed to play hideandseek with the twinkle in her downcast eyes  well charlie what are you going to tell me  isnt tocveryhappy  he blushed to the roots of his hair when he said this and dropped his eyes again on the ground  of course he is replied sally with a touch of surprise  butbuti mean as  well why dont you go on charlie  i mean as aa married man  every one sees and knows that charlie  there was another silence during which the timid youth cleared his throat several times  at last he became desperate  andandsally dont you think that other people might be happy too if they were married  to be sure they might said the girl with provoking coolness theres dan mccoy now and sarah quintal they will be very happy when  why how do you knowcharlie spoke with a look of surprise and stopped short  the girl laughed in a low tone but did not reply and the youth becoming still more desperate said  but ii didnt mean dan and sarah when ioh sally dont you know that i love you  yes i know that replied the girl with a blush and a little tremulous smile  i couldnt help knowing that  have i made it so plain then he asked in surprise  havent you followed me ever since you were a staggerer asked sally with a simple look  o yes of coursebutbut i love you far far more now  in short i want to marry you sally  he had reached the culminating point at last  well charlie why dont you ask fathers leave said the maiden  and you agree he exclaimed timidly taking her hand  oh charlie returned sally looking up in his face with an arch smile how stupid you are  nothing goes into your dear head without such a deal of hammering  will you never become wise and  charlie became wise at last and stopped her impudent mouth effectively but she broke from him and ran into the woods while he went down to the village to tell adams  meanwhile daniel mccoy led sarah quintal by a roundabout path to the cliffs above pitcairn  pretty little sarah was timid and had a vague suspicion of something that caused her heart to flutter  i say sarah said the bold and stalwart dan did you ever see such a jolly couple as toc and his wife before  i never saw any couple before you know replied the girl simply except father adams and his wife  well they are an oldish couple returned dan with a laugh but its my opinion that before long youll see a good many more couplesyoung ones too  indeed said sarah becoming much interested for this was the first time that any young man had ventured to refer to such a subject though she and her female companions had often canvassed the possibilities that surrounded them  yes indeed returned dan  let me see now  theres charlie christian and otaheitan sally  why how did you come to know that asked sarah in genuine surprise  dan laughed heartily  come to know what he asked  thatthat he is fond of sally stammered sarah  why everybody knows that returned dan the very gulls must be aware of it by this time unless they are geese  yes of course said the poor girl blushing crimson at the thought of having been led almost to betray her friends confidences  well then continued dan charlie and sall bein so fond o one another  i did not say that sally was fond of charlie interrupted sarah quickly  oh dear no said dan with deep solemnity of course you didnt nevertheless i know it and it wouldnt surprise me much if something came of ita wedding for instance  sarah being afraid to commit herself in some way if she opened her lips said nothing but gazed intently at the ground as they walked slowly among the sweetscented shrubs  but theres one o the boys that wants to marry you sarah quintal and it is for him i want to put in a good word today  a flutter of surprise mingled with dismay at her heart tended still further to confuse the poor girl  not knowing what to say she stammered indeed  who can itit and stopped short  they sometimes call him dan said the youth suddenly grasping sarahs hand and passing an arm round her waist but his full name is daniel mccoy  sarah quintal became as suddenly pale now as she had formerly become red and struggled to get free  oh dan dan dont she cried earnestly do let me go if you love me  well i will if you say i may speak to father adams about it  sarahs answer was quite inaudible to ordinary ears but it caused dan to loosen his hold and the girl bounding away like a frightened gazelle disappeared among the palmgroves  well exclaimed dan thrusting both hands into his trouserspockets as he walked smartly down the hill you are the dearest girl in all the world  there cant be two opinions on that point  dans world was a remarkably small one as worlds go but it was quite large enough to fill his heart to overflowing at that time  in turning into another path he almost ran against charlie christian  well exclaimed charlie with a brilliant smile  well repeated dan with a beaming countenance  all right said charlie  ditto said dan as he took his friends arm and hastened to the abode of john adams the great referee in all important matters  they found him seated at his table with the big bible open before him  well my lads he said with a kindly smile as they entered you find me meditatin over a verse that seems to me full o suggestive thoughts  yes father what is it asked dan  a prudent wife is from the lord  youll find it in the nineteenth chapter o proverbs  the youths looked at each other in great surprise  it is very strange said charlie that you should hit upon that text today  why so charlie  becausebecausewe came tothat is to say we want to  get spliced charlie out with it man  you keep shuffling about the edge like a timid boy goin to dive into deep water for the first time  well and so it is deep water replied charlie so deep that we cant fathom it easily and this is the first time too  the fact is youve come to tell me said adams looking at charlie that you want to marry otaheitan sally and that dan there wants to marry sarah quintal  is it not so  i think father you must be a wizard said dan with a surprised look  how did you come to guess it  i didnt guess it lad i saw it as plain as the nose on your own face anybody could see it with half an eye  why ive seen it for years past but thats not the point  the first question is are you able to feed your wives without requirin them to work too hard in the fields  yes father answered dan promptly  charlie helped me and i helped him and so weve both got enough of land enclosed and stocked to keep ourourwives comfortably even dan looked modest here without requiring them to work at all for a long time at least  well  i dont want em not to work at allthats good for neither man nor woman nor beast  even childn work hard poor things while playin at pretendin to work  however im glad to hear you are ready of course i knew what you were up to all along  now youll want to borrow a few odds an ends from the general stock therefore go an make out lists of what you require and ill see about it  is it long since you arranged it wi the girls  about halfanhour returned dan  hm sharp practice  youll be the better of meditation for a week or two  now get along with you lads and think of the word i have given you from gods book about marriage  ill not keep you waitin longer than i think right  so dan and charlie left the presencechamber of their nautical ruler quite content to wait for a couple of weeks having plenty to keep them employed body and mind in labouring in their gardens perfecting the arrangements of their respective cottages and making out lists of the various things they required to borrow  in all of which operations they were lovingly assisted by their intended wives with a matteroffact gravity that would have been quite touching if it had not been half ridiculous  the list of things to be borrowed was made out in accordance with a system of barter exchange and loan which had begun in necessity and was afterwards conducted on regular principles by adams who kept a systematic journal and record of accounts in which he entered the nature and quantity of work performed by each family what each had received and what each was due on account  the exchanges also were made in a systematic manner  thus when one family had too many salt fish and another had too much fruit or vegetables a fair exchange restored the equilibrium to the satisfaction of both parties and when the stores of one family were exhausted a fresh supply was raised for it from the general possessions of all the rest to be repaid however in exact measure when the suffering family should be again in affluence through good harvests and hard work  all details were minutely noted down by adams so that injustice to individuals or to the community at large was avoided  it is interesting to trace in this wellconducted colony the great rootprinciples on which the colossal system of the worlds commerce and trade has been reared and to recognise in john adams the germs of those principles of equity and method which have raised england to her high commercial position  but still more interesting is it to recognise in him that good seed the love of god and his truth spiritual intellectual and material which originated by the holy spirit and founded in jesus christ produces the righteousness that exalteth a nation  when the short period of probation was past charlie christian became the happy husband of the girl whom he had all but worshipped from the earliest rememberable days of infancy and dan mccoy was united to sarah quintal  as in the first case of marriage otaheitan sall was older than her husband but in her case the difference was so slight as scarcely to be worth mentioning  as to appearance tall serious strapping charlie looked old enough to have been sallys father  the weddingday was a day of great rejoicing considerable solemnity and not a little fun for the religion of the pitcairners being drawn direct from the inspired word was the reverse of dolorous  indeed the simplicity of their faith was extreme for it consisted in merely asking the question what does god wish me to do and doing it  of course the simplicity of this rule was in pitcairn as elsewhere unrecognised by ignorance or rendered hazy and involved by stupidity adams had his own difficulties in combating the effects of evil in the hearts of his children for as we have said before they were by no means perfect though unusually good  for instance one day one of those boys who was passing into the hobbledehoy stage of life came with a perplexed air and said  didnt you tell us in school yesterday father that if we were good jesus would save us  no jack mills i told you just the reverse  i told you that if jesus saved you you would be good  then why doesnt he save me and make me good asked jack anxious to cast the blame of his indecision about his salvation off his own shoulders  because you refuse to be saved said adams pointedly  jack mills felt and looked somewhat hurt at this  he was one of the steadiest boys at the school always learned his tasks well and was generally pretty well behaved but there was in him an ugly halfhidden root of selfishness which he did not himself perceive  do you remember going to the shore yesterday asked adams replying to the lookfor the boy did not speak  yes father  and you remember that two little boys had just got into a canoe and were pushing off to enjoy themselves when you ran down turned them out and took the canoe to yourself  jack did not reply but his flushed face told that he had not forgotten the incident  thats right dear boy continued adam your blood tells the truth for you and your tongue dont contradict it  so longs you keep the unruly member straight youll get along  well now jack that was a sin of unkindness and a sort of robbery too for the canoe belonged to the boys while they had possession  did you want to be saved from that sin my boy  jack was still silent  he knew that he had not wished to be saved at the time because if he had he would have at once returned to the shore and restored the canoe with an apology for having taken it by force  but i was sorry afterwards father pleaded the boy  i know you were jack and your guilty conscience longed for forgiveness  but jesus did not come to this world to forgive us  he came to save usto save this people from their sins his peopleforgiven people my boyfrom their sins  if you had looked to jesus he would have sent his spirit into you and brought his word to your mind be ye kind one to another or whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them or in some way or other he would have turned you back and saved you from sin but you did not look to jesus in short you refused to be saved just then and thought to make up for it by being sorry afterwards  isnt that the way of it jack  yes father said jack with downcast but no longer hurt looks for adamss tone and manner were very kind  then you know now jack mills why youre not yet saved and you cant be good till you are saved any more than you can fly till youve got wings  but dont be cast down my lad he will save you yet  all youve got to do is to cease your opposition and let him take you in hand  thus or in some such way did this godappointed pastor lead his little flock from day to day and year to year  but to return from this digression  we have said that the double weddingday was one of mingled rejoicing solemnity and fun  if you insist on further explanation good reader and want to know something more about the rejoicing we can only direct you to yonder clump of blossoming plants in the shade of the palmgrove there you will find charlie christian looking timidly down into the gorgeous orbs of otaheitan sally as they hold sweet converse of things past present and to come  they have been so trained in ways of righteousness that the omission of the worldtocome from their lovemaking not flirtation observe would be as ridiculous as the absence of reference to the weddingday  on the other side of the same knoll daniel mccoy sits by the side of modest sarah quintal his only halftamed spirit torn by the conflicting emotions aroused by a compound of jollity love joy thankfulness and fun which render his words too incoherent to be worthy of record  in regard to solemnity reader we refer you to the little schoolroom which also serves for a chapel where john adams in tones befitting a bishop and with feelings worthy of an apostle reads the marriage service in the midst of the assembled population of the island  he has a brass curtainring which did duty at the marriage of thursday october christian and which is destined to do duty in similar circumstances in many coming years  the knots are soon tied  there are no sad tears for at pitcairn there are no partings of parents and children but there are many tears of joy for adamss words are telling though few and his prayers are brief but deeply impressive while the people young and middleaged are powerfully sympathetic  the most of the girls break down when adams draws to an abrupt close and most of the youths find it hard to behave like men  they succeed however and then the wedding party goes off to have a spell of fun  if you had been there reader to behold things for yourself it is not improbable that some of the solemnity of the wedding would have been scattered for you at least and some of the fun introduced too soon for the costumes of the chief actors were not perfect indeed not quite appropriate according to our ideas of the fitness of things  it is not that we could object to the bare feet of nearly all the party for to such we are accustomed among our own poor  neither could we find the slightest fault with the brides  their simple loose robes flowing hair and wreaths of natural flowers were in perfect keeping with the beauty of their faces  but the garb of guileless charlie christian was incongruous to say the least of it  during the visit of the topaz a few old clothes had been given by the seamen to the islanders and charlie had become the proud possessor of a huge black beaver hat which had to be put on sidewise to prevent its settling down on the back of his neck also of a blue dresscoat with brass buttons the waist and sleeves of which were much too short and the tails unaccountably long likewise of a pair of wellington boots the tops of which did not by four inches reach the legs of his native trousers and therefore displayed that amount of brawny wellmade limbs while the absence of a vest and the impossibility of buttoning the coat left a broad sunburnt expanse of manly chest exposed to view  but such is the difference of opinion resulting from difference of custom that not a muscle of any face moved when he appeared save in open admiration though there was just the shade of a twinkle for one moment in the eye of john adams for he had seen other though not better days  even dans excitable sense of the ridiculous was not touched  himself indeed was a greater guy than charlie for he wore a richlyflowered vest so tight that it would hardly button and had been split up the back while being put on  as he wore a shelljacket much too short for him this accident to the vest and a portion of his powerful back were clearly revealed  but these things were trifles on that great day and when the fun did begin it was kept up with spirit  first the greater part of the population went to the beach for a little surfsliding  it is not necessary to repeat our description of that exercise  the waves were in splendid order  it seemed as if the great pacific itself were pulsating with unwonted joy  the billows were bigger grander almost slower and more sedate than usual  outside it was dead calm  the fall of each liquid wall was more thunderous its roar more deeptoned and the confusion of the surf more riotous than ever  for average rejoicers this exercise might in itself have sufficed for one day but they were used to it and wanted variety so the youths took to racing on the sands and the maidens to applauding while the elderly looked on and criticised  the small children went loosely speaking mad  some there were who went off on their own accounts and cast a few of those shadows which are said to precede coming events  others less poetically inclined just then remained in the village to prepare roast pig yampie and those various delicacies compounded of fruits and vegetables which they knew from experience would be in great demand ere long  as evening descended they all returned to the village and at sunset hauled down their flag  this flag by the way was another souvenir of the topaz  it was an old union jack for which adams had set up a flagstaff having by that time ceased to dread the approach of a ship  by jack brace he had been reminded of the date of the kings birthday and by a strange coincidence that happened to be the very day on which the two couples were united  hence there was a double perhaps we should say a treble reason for rejoicing  as john adams was now endeavouring to undo the evils of his former life he naturally became an enthusiastic loyalist  on passing the flagstaff he called for three cheers for the british king and with his own voice led off the first verse of the national anthem before hauling down the colours  thereafter assembling round the festive board in the schoolroom they proceeded to take physical nourishment with the memory of mental food strong upon them before the meal a profound hush fell on all the scene and the deep voice of adams was heard asking a blessing on the food they were about to receive  thanks were returned with equal solemnity after meat  then the tables were cleared and games became the order of the evening when a point of semiexhaustion was reached a story was called for and the nautical pastor at once launched into oceans of imagination and fancy in which he bid fair to be wrecked and drowned  during the recital of this the falling of a pin would have been heard if there had been such a thing as a pin at pitcairn to fall  last but not least came blindmansbuff  this exhausted the last spark of physical energy left even in the strongest  but the mental and spiritual powers were still vigorous so that when they all sat down in quiescence round the room and toc took down the family bible from its accustomed shelf and set it before adams they were all young and old in a suitable state of mind to join in the worship of him who had given them the capacity as well as the opportunity to enjoy that glorious and ever memorable day    chapter thirty two  another visit from the great world  if ever there had been a doubt of the truth of the proverb that example is better than precept the behaviour of the young men and maidens of pitcairn after the wedding just described would have cleared that doubt away for ever  the demands upon poor adamss services became ridiculous insomuch that he began to make laws somewhat in the spirit of the medopersic lawmakers and sternly refused to allow any man to marry under the age of twenty years or any woman under eighteen  even with this drag on the wheels the evilif evil it weredid not abate but as time went on steadily increased  it seemed as if the ice having been broken the entire population kept on tumbling into the water  among others our once little friend matthew quintal married bessy mills  the cares of the little colony now began to tell heavily on john adams for he was what is termed a willing horse and would not turn over to another the duties which he could perform with his own hands  besides acting the part of pastor schoolmaster lawmaker and lawenforcer he had to become the sympathetic counsellor of all who chose to call upon him also public registrar of events baptiser of infants and medical practitioner  it is a question whether there ever was a man placed in so difficult and arduous a position as this last mutineer of the bounty and it is not a question at all but an amazing and memorable fact that he filled his unique post with statesmanlike ability  as time went on he of course obtained help sympathy and counsel from the men and women whom he had been training for god around him but he seems to have been loath formally to hand over the helm either wholly or in part to any one else as long as he had strength to steer the ship  we have said that england was too much engaged with her european wars to give much thought to this gem in her crown which was thus gradually being polished to such a dazzling brightness  she knew it was but a little gem if gem at all and at such a distance did not see its brilliant sheen  amid the smoke and turmoil of war she forgot it yet the god of battles and the prince of peace were winning a grand moral bloodless victory in that lonely little island  it was not till the year 1814 six years after the visit of the topaz that the solitude of pitcairn was again broken in upon by visitors from the outside world  in that year two frigates hms britain and tagus commanded respectively by captain sir f staines and captain pipon came unexpectedly on pitcairn island while in pursuit of an american ship the essex which had been doing mischief among the british whalers  it was evening when the ships sighted pitcairn and were observed by one of the almost innumerable youngsters with which the island had by that time been peopled  with blazing eyes and labouring breath the boy rushed down the cliffs bounded over the level ground and burst into the village shouting ships  no warwhoop of red indians ever created greater excitement  pitcairn swarmed at once to the cliffs with flushed faces glittering eyes and hopeful looks  yes there they were and no mistaketwo ships  theyre menowar father said thursday october christian a little anxiously  so i see lad but i wont hide this time  i dont believe theyd think it worth while hangin me now  anyhow ill risk it  many of the people spent the whole of that night on the cliffs for as it was too late to attempt a landing captain staines did not venture to approach till the following morning  soon after daybreak the ships were seen to stand inshore and a canoe was launched through the surf to meet them  as on the occasion of the visit of the topaz thursday was deputed to represent the islanders he was accompanied by edward young now a handsome youth of eighteen years of age  as on the previous boarding of a ship toc amazed the sailors by shouting in english to throw him a rope  being now possessed of a wardrobe he had in his heart resolved to appear in a costume worthy of the great occasion  for this end he had put on a vest without sleeves trousers that had done duty in the topaz and were much too short and a beaver hat which he had jauntily ornamented with cocktail feathers and wore very much on the back of his head  thursday met the eager inquiries of sir f staines with his usual goodhumoured offhand urbanity and gave his name in full but a sudden change came over his face while he spokea look of amazement mingled with alarm  look look there ned he said in a low tone laying his hand on his comrades shoulder and pointing towards a certain part of the ship what is that  ned looked with an expression of awe in the direction indicated  what is it that puzzles you asked the captain not a little amused by their looks  the beast the beast said toc  what dyou mean the cow  is it a cow asked toc in wonder  of course it is  did you never see a cow before  no never  i thought it was a big goat or a horned sow returned the young man as he approached the quiet animal cautiously  i say ned its a cow  it dont look much like the things that father adams used to draw do it  ned agreed that adamss representation fell far short of the original and for some time they stood cautiously examining the strange creature and gently touching its sides  just then a little black terrier came bounding forward and frisked round the captain  ha exclaimed edward young with an intelligent look i know that beast toc its a dog  im sure it is for i have read of such things in carteret and father has described em often so have the women they have dogs you know on some islands  but the surprise and interest raised in them by two animals were nothing to what they felt on being conducted over the ship and shown all the details of stores and armament in a manofwar  the surprise changed sides however when on being asked to partake of luncheon these men stood up clasped their hands shut their eyes and asked a blessing before commencing to eat in the familiar phrase for what we are about to receive etcetera  of course captains staines and pipon went on shore where they were received by adams hat in hand and by the rest of the population down to the minutest infant for no one would consent to miss the sight and there was no sick person to be looked after  up at the village the pigs and poultry had it all their own way and made the most of their opportunity  it was curious to mark the air of respect with which adams regarded the naval uniform which had once been so familiar  as he stood conversing with the officers he occasionally in sailorlike fashion smoothed down his scanty locks for although little more than fifty at that time care sorrow and anxiety had given his countenance an aged and worn look though his frame was still robust and healthy  in the course of the interview captain pipon offered to give him a passage to england with any of his family who chose to accompany him to his surprise adams at once expressed a desire to go  we know not whether this was a piece of pleasantry on adamss part but when he sent for his old wife and daughters to tell them of it the scene of distress that ensued baffles description  the old woman was in despair  dinah adams burst into tears and entreated the officers not to take her dear father away  her sister rachel flung her arms round her fathers neck and held on  hannah adams clasped her hands and wept in silent despair and even george at that time about ten years of age and not at all given to the melting mood felt a tear of sympathy trickling down his nose  of course when the cause of the ebullition became known the whole pitcairn colony was dissolved in tears or lamentations insomuch that adams gave up all idea of leaving them  we firmly believe that he never had any intention of doing so but had merely thrown out the hint to see what effect it would have  like captain folger of the topaz the captains of the britain and tagus wrote eloquent and enthusiastic letters to the admiralty about their discovery but the dogs of war were still loose in europe  their lordships at whitehall had no time to devote to such matters and once again the lonely island was forgotten  it is a curious coincidence that death came close on the heels of this visit as it had come on that of the topaz  scarcely had the two frigates left when matthew quintal took a fit while out fishing in his canoe and was drowned  about the same time jack mills was killed by falling from the rocks when out after gulls eggs  thus poor bessy quintal lost her husband and brother in the same year but she was not without comfort  she had been early taught to carry her cares to jesus and found him now a very present help  besides she had now two little sons john and matthew who were old enough to fondle her and sympathise with her to some extent though they scarce understood her sorrow and her fast friend and comforter sally christian did not fail her in the hour of need  indeed that warmhearted otaheitan would have taken poor bessy into her house to live with her and charlie but for the difficulty that six riotous little creatures of her own named fletcher edward charles isaac sarah and maria already filled it to overflowing  a little more than six years after this there came a visitant of a rare and heartgladdening kind namely a parcel of books  although the government of england was too busy to think of the faroff isle there were englishmen who did not forget her  the society for promoting christian knowledge happening in 1819 to hear of an opportunity of communicating with pitcairn made up and despatched to it a parcel of books containing besides bibles and prayerbooks works of instruction fitted for all ages  who can imagine the delight produced by this gift to minds which had been well educated and were thirsting for more knowledge  it must have been as food to the starving as water to the dry ground  four years after that a whaleship from london named the cyrus touched in passing  as this visit was a noteworthy epoch in the lonely island we shall devote a new chapter to it    chapter thirty three  new arrivals and strange adventures  my dear said adams one morning to his spouse as he was about to go forth to superintend the working of his busy hive im beginnin to feel as if i was gettin old and would soon have to lay up like an old hulk  youve done good service for the master john perhaps he thinks you should rest now answered his wife  youve got plenty able helpers to take the heavy work off your hands  true old woman able willin and good helpers thank god but they want a headpiece still  however theres a deal of life in the old dog yet  if that dear angel otaheitan sally were only a man now i could resign the command of the ship without a thought  but ive committed the matter to the lord  he will provide in his own good time goodday old girl  if any one wants me you know where to send em  not many days after that in which these remarks were made a sail was seen on the horizon  so few and far between had these visitants been that the excitement of the people was as wild as when the first ship appeared and much more noisy seeing that the juveniles had now become so very numerous  the ship soon drew near  canoes were sent off to board her  thursday october as of old introduced himself and soon the captain and several men were brought on shore to the intense joy of the inhabitants  one of the sailors who landed attracted adamss attention in a special manner not so much because of his appearance which was nothing uncommon as because of a certain grave kindly serious air which distinguished him  this mans name was john buffett  another of the men named john evans less serious in manner but not less hearty and open made himself very agreeable to the women especially to old mrs adams to whom he told a number of nautical anecdotes in an undertone while the captain was chatting with adams himself  buffett spoke little  after spending an agreeable day on shore the sailors walked down to the beach towards evening to return to their ship  you lead a happy life here mr adams said buffett in an earnest tone  would you object to a stranger staying among you  object said adams with a quick pleasant glance  i only wish the lord would send us one one at least who is a follower of himself  john buffett said no more but that same evening he expressed to his captain so strong a desire to remain behind that he obtained leave and next day was sent on shore  the sailor named john evans accompanied him to see him all right and bring off the latest news but evans himself had become so delighted with the appearance of the place and people that he deserted into the mountains and the ship had to sail without him  thus were two new names added to the musterroll of pitcairn  john buffett in particular turned out to be an invaluable acquisition he was a man of earnest piety and had obtained a fairly good education adams and he drew together at once  youll not object praps said the former on the occasion of their first talk over future plans to give me a lift wi the school  nothing would please me better answered buffett  im rather fond o teachin to say truth and am ready to begin work at once  not only did buffett thereafter become to adams as a right arm in the school but he assisted in the church services on sundays and eventually came to read sermons which for the fixing of them more effectually on the minds of the people he was wont to deliver three times over  but buffett could tell stories as well as read sermons  one afternoon some of the youngsters caught him meditating under a cocoanut tree and insisted on his telling the story of his life  it aint a long story boys an girls said he for ive only lived some sixandtwenty years yet  i was born in 1797 near bristol and was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker  not takin kindly to that sort o work i gave it up an went to sea  however im bound to say that the experience i had with the saw and plane has been of the greatest service to me ever since and its my opinion that what ever a man is or whoever he may be he should learn a trade ay even though he should be a king  the pitcairn juveniles did not see the full force of this remark but nevertheless they believed it heartily  it was the american merchant service i entered continued buffett an my first voyage was to the gulf of saint lawrence  i was wrecked there and most o the crew perished but i swam ashore and was saved through gods mercy  mark that childn  it wasnt by good luck or good swimmin or chance or fate or anything else in the shape of a second cause but it was the good god himself that saved or rather spared me  now i say that because theres plenty of people who dont like to give their maker credit for anything cept when they do it in a humdrum matterofcourse way at church  these last remarks were quite thrown away upon the children whose training from birth had been to acknowledge the goodness of god in everything and who could not of course comprehend the allusions to formalism  well he continued after suffering a good deal i was picked up by some canadian fishermen and again went to sea to be once again wrecked and saved  that was in the year 1821  then i went to england and entered on board a ship bound for china from which we proceeded to manilla and afterwards to california where i stayed some time  then i entered an english whaler homeward bound intendin to go home and the lord did bring me home for he brought me here and here i mean to stay  and were all so glad exclaimed dolly young who had now become an enthusiastic warmhearted pretty young woman of twentythree summers  dolly blushed as she spoke but not with consciousness  it was but innocent truthfulness  john buffett paused and looked at her steadily what john buffett thought we are not prepared to say but it may be guessed when we state that within two months of that date he and dolly young were united in marriage by old adams with all the usual ceremonial including the curtainring which did duty on all such occasions and the unfailing game of blindmansbuff  john evans was encouraged a few months later to take heart and do likewise  he was even bolder than buffett for he wooed and won a princess at least if john adams was in any sense a king his second daughter rachel must have been a princess  be this as it may evans married her and became a respected member of the little community  and now another of these angellike visits was looming in the distance about twelve years after the departure of the britain and tagus one of hm cruisers the blossom captain beechy sailed out of the great unknown into the circlet of pitcairn and threw the islanders into a more intense flutter than ever for there were now upwards of fifty souls there many of whom had not only never seen a manofwar but had had their imaginations excited by the glowing descriptions of those who had  this was in 1825  the blossom had been fitted out for discovery  when buffett first recognised her pennant he was in great trepidation lest they had come to carry off adams but such was not the case  it was merely a passing visit  three weeks the blossom stayed during which the captain and officers were entertained in turn at the different houses and it seems to have been to both parties like a brief foretaste of the land of beulah  naturally captain beechy was anxious to test the truth of the glowing testimony of former visitors  he had ample opportunity and afterwards sent home letters quite as enthusiastic as those of his predecessors in regard to the simplicity truthfulness and genuine piety alike of old and young  if a few hours visit had on former occasions given the community food for talk and reflection you may be sure that the three weeks of the blossoms sojourn gave them a large supply for future years  it seemed to otaheitan sally and dinah adams and dolly and polly young and the rest of them that the island was not large enough now to contain all their new ideas and they said so to john adams one evening  my dears said john in reply laying his hand on that of sally who sat beside him on their favourite confabulationknoll which overlooked bounty bay ideas dont take up much room and if they did we could send em out on the sea for they wont drown  ah  sall sall  what are you thinking of dear father asked sally with a sympathetic look as the old man stopped  that my time cant be long now  i feel as if i was about wornout  oh dont say that father cried his daughter hannah laying her cheek on his arm and hugging it  theres ever so much life in you yet  it may be so  it shall be so if the lord will said adams with a little smile but im not the man i was  poor john adams spoke truly  he had landed on pitcairn a slim young fellow with broad shoulders powerful frame and curling brown hair  he was now growing feeble and rather corpulent his brow was bald his scanty locks were grey and his countenance deeply careworn  no wonder considering all he had gone through and the severe wound he had received upwards of thirty years before  nevertheless hannah was right when she said there was a good deal of life in the old man yet  he lived after that day to tie the weddingknot between his own youngest child george and polly young more than that he lived to dandle georges eldest son johnny on his knees and to dismiss him in favour of his little brother jonathan when that child made his appearance  but before this latter event the crowning joy of john adamss life was vouchsafed to him in the shape of a worthy successor to his pitcairn throne  the successors name was neither pretty nor suggestive of romance yet was closely allied with both  it was george nobbs  he arrived at the island in very peculiar circumstances on the 15th of november 1828 and told his story one afternoon under the banyantree to adams and buffett and as many of the young generation as could conveniently get near him as follows  entering the navy at an early period of life i went through many vicissitudes and experiences in various quarters of the globe  but circumstances induced me to quit the navy and for a short time i remained inactive until my old commander offered to procure me a berth on board a ship of eighteen guns designed for the use of the patriots in south america  accepting the offer i left england early in 1816 for valparaiso and cruised there for sixteen months taking many prizes  while on board of one of our prizes i was taken prisoner and carried into callao where i and my comrades were exposed to the gaze and insults of the people here for many months i walked about the streets with fifty pounds weight of iron attached to me on a spare diet of beans and chili peppers with a stone at night for a pillow  we were made to carry stones to repair the forts of the place  there were seventeen of us five or six of our party died of fever and exposure to the sun after which our guardians became careless about us  we managed to get rid of our irons by degrees and at length were left to shift for ourselves soon after with some of my comrades i escaped on board a vessel in the bay and succeeded in getting put on board our own vessel again which was still cruising in these seas  entering valparaiso in the latter part of 1817 i had now an opportunity of forwarding about 140 pounds to my poor mother in england who was sorely in need of help at the time  some time after that i went with a number of men in a launch to attempt the cutting out of a large merchant ship from cadiz  we were successful and my share of the prizemoney came to about 200 pounds one hundred of which i also sent to my mother  after this i took a situation as prizemaster on board a vessel commanded by a frenchman  deserting from it i sought to discover a road to guayaquil through the woods where i suffered great hardships and failed in the attempt  the adventurer paused a few seconds and looked earnestly in adamss countenance  i am not justifying my conduct he said still less boasting  right you are nobbs said adams with an approving nod  your line of life wont stand justification according to the rule of gods book  i know it adams i am merely telling you a few of the facts of my life which you have a right to know from one who seeks an asylum among your people  well returning to the coast i went on board an english whaler by the captain of which i was kindly treated and landed at talcahuans  i had not been long there when at midnight on the 7th may in the year 1819 the chilian garrison fifteen in number was attacked by benevades and his indian troops  a number of the inhabitants were killed the town was sacked and a large number of prisoners myself included carried off  next morning troops from concepcion came in pursuit and rescued us as we were crossing a river  soon after this affair i returned to valparaiso and engaged as first officer of a ship named the minerva which had been hired by the chilian government as a transport to carry out troops to peru  having landed the troops i took part on 5th november in cutting out a spanish frigate named the esmeraldas from under the callao batteries this affair was planned and headed by lord cochrane  owing to my being in this affair i was appointed to a chilian sloop of war and received a lieutenants commission  i will not take up your time at present with an account of the various cuttingsout and other warlike expeditions i was engaged in while in the chilian service  it is enough to refer to the last which ended my connection with that service  having been sent in charge of a boat up a river to recover a quantity of property belonging to british and american merchants which had been seized by the miscreant benevades we set off and pulled up unmolested but finding nothing of consequence turned to pull back again when volleys of musketry were poured into us from both banks  we saw no one and could do nothing but pull down as fast as possible losing many men as we went  at last a few horsemen showed themselves  we had a carronade in the bow which we instantly turned on them and discharged  this was just what they wanted  at the signal a large boat filled with soldiers shoved out and boarded us  we fought of course but with so many wounded and assailed by superior numbers we had no chance and were soon beaten  i received a tremendous blow on the back of the neck which nearly killed me fortunately i did not fall  those who did or were too badly wounded to walk were at once thrown into the river  the rest of us had our clothes stripped off and some rags given us in exchange  a pair of trousers cut off at the knees a ragged poncho and a sombrero fell to my share  we were marched off to prison where we lay three weeks every chilian of our party was shot while i and three other europeans were exchanged for four of benevadess officers  soon after this event while at valparaiso i received a letter from my dear mother telling me that she was ill  i quitted the chilian navy at once and went home alas to see her die  in 1822 i went to naples and was wrecked while on my way to messina in the following year i went to sierra leone as chief mate of a ship called the gambia  of nineteen persons who went out in that ship only the captain two coloured men and myself lived to return  why mr nobbs interrupted john buffett at this point i used to think id seen a deal o rough service but i couldnt hold a candle to you sir  it is an unenviable advantage to have of you returned the other with a sad smile  however im getting near the end now  in all that i have said i have not told you what the lord has done for my soul another time i will tell that to you  at present it is enough to say that i had heard of your little island here and of the wonderful accounts of it brought home at various times  i had an intense longing to reach it and devote my life to the service of jesus  i sold all my little possessions resolving to quit england for ever  but i could find no means of getting to pitcairn  leaving england however in november 1825 i reached calcutta in may 1826 sailed thence for valparaiso in 1827 and proceeded on to callao  here i fell in with bunker to whom you have all been so kind  finding no vessel going in this direction and my finances being nearly exhausted i agreed on a plan with him  he had a launch of eighteen tons a mere boat as you know but being in bad health and without means could not fit her out i agreed to spend my all in fitting this launch for sea on the understanding that i should become part proprietor and that bunker should accompany me to pitcairn  well you see friends we have managed it  through the mercy of god we have by our two selves made this voyage of 3500 miles and now i hope that my days of wandering are over and that i shall begin here to do the work of the prince of peace but alas  i fear that my poor friend bunkers days are numbered  he was right  this bold adventurer about whose history we know nothing died a few weeks after his arrival at pitcairn    chapter thirty four  farewell  and now at last approached a crisis in the life of pitcairn which had indeed been long foreseen long dreaded and often thought of but seldom hinted at by the islanders  good patient longenduring john adams began to draw towards the end of his strange unique and glorious career  for him to live had been christ to die was gain  and he knew it  george nobbs said he about four months after the arrival of the former the lords ways are wonderful past finding out but always sure and safe  nothing puzzles me so much as my own want of faith when theres such good ground for confidence  but gods book tells me to expect even that he added after a pause with a faint smile does it not tell of the desperately wicked and deceitful heart  true mr adams replied his friend with the term of respect which he felt constrained to use but it also tells of salvation to the uttermost  ay  i know that too returned adams with a cheery smile  well do i know that  but dont mister me george  there are times when the little titles of this world are ridiculous  such a time is now  i am going to leave you george  the hour of my departure is at hand strange how anxious i used to feel  i used to think what if i am killed by a fall from the cliffs or by sickness and these poor helpless children should be left fatherless  the dear lord sent me a rebuke  he sent john buffett to help me  but john buffett has not the experience or the education thats needful  not that i had education myself but somehow my experience beginnin as it did from the very beginnin went a long way to counterbalance that  then anxious thoughts would rise up again  want of faith nothing else george nothing else  so the lord rebuked me again for he sent you  ah father i hope it is as you say  i dare hardly believe it yet i earnestly hope so  i have no doubt now resumed adams  you have got just the qualities that are wanted  regularly stored and victualled for the cruise  theyll be far better off than ever they were before  if i had only trusted more i should have suffered less  but i was always thinking of john adams  ah that has been the great curse of my lifejohn adamsas if everything depended on him  why continued the old man kindling with a sudden burst of indignation could i have saved these souls by merely teaching em readin and writin or even by readin gods book to em  isnt it read every day by thousands to millions against whom it falls like the sea on a great rock  can the absence of temptation be pleaded when here in full force there have been the most powerful temptations to disobedience continually  if that would have done why were not all my brother mutineers saved from sin  it was not even when we read the bible that deliverance came  i read it for ten years as a sealed book  no george no it was when gods holy spirit opened the eyes and the heart that i an the dear women an childn became nothin and fell in with his ways  he stopped suddenly as if exhausted and his new friend led him gently to his house  many loving eyes watched him as he went along and many tender hearts beat for him but better still many true hearts prayed for him  that night he became weaker and next day he did not rise  when this became known all the settlement crowded to his house while from his bed there was a constant coming and going of those who had the right to be nearest to him  nursed by the loving women whom he had ledand whose childrens children he had ledto jesus and surrounded by men whom he had dandled played with reared and counselled he passed into the presence of god to behold the king in his beauty to be for ever with the lord  may we join him reader you and i when our time comes  on a tombstone over a grave under the banyantree near his house is the simple record john adams died 5th march 1829 aged 65    and here our tale must end for the good work which we have sought to describe has no end  yet for the sake of those who have a regard for higher things than a mere tale we would add a few words before making our farewell bow  the colony of pitcairn still exists and flourishes  but many changes have occurred since adams left the scene though the simple guileless spirit of the people remains unchanged  here is a brief summary of its history since 1829  george nobbs had gained the affections of the people before adamss death and he at once filled the vacant place as well as it was possible for a stranger to do so  in 1830 the colony consisted of nearly ninety souls and it had for some time been a matter of grave consideration that the failure of water by drought might perhaps prove a terrible calamity  it was therefore proposed by government that the people of pitcairn should remove to otaheite or to give the island its modern name tahiti  there was much division of opinion among the islanders and mr nobbs objected however the experiment was tried and it failed signally  the whole community was transported in a ship to tahiti in march 1831  but the loose manners and evil habits of many of the people there had such an effect on the pitcairners that they took the first opportunity of returning to their muchloved island  john buffett and a few families went first  the remainder soon followed in an american brig  thereafter life on the lonely island flowed as happily as ever for many years with the exception of a brief but dark interval when a scoundrel named joshua hill went to the island passed himself off as an agent of the british government misled the trusting inhabitants and established a reign of terror illtreating nobbs buffett and evans whom for a time he compelled to quit the place  fortunately this impostor was soon found out and removed  the banished men returned and all went well again  rearadmiral moresby visited pitcairn in 1851 and experienced a warm reception  finding that the people wished mr nobbs to be ordained he took him to england for this purpose  the faithful pastor did not fail to interest the english public in the romantic isle of which god had given him the oversight  during his visit he was presented to the queen who gave him portraits of herself and the royal family  the society for the propagation of the gospel placed mr nobbs on their missionary list with a salary of 50 pounds per annum  soon after this the increasing population of pitcairn island rendered it necessary that the islanders should find a wider home  government therefore offered them houses and land in norfolk island a penal settlement from which the convicts had been removed  of course the people shrank from the idea of leaving pitcairn when it was first proposed but ultimately assented and were landed on norfolk island hundreds of miles from their old home in june 1856  on this lovely spot the descendants of the mutineers of the bounty have lived ever since under the care of that loved pastor on whom john adams had dropped his mantle  we believe that the reverend george h nobbs is still alive  at all events he was so last year 1879 having written a letter in june to the secretary of the society for the propagation of the gospel in which among other things he speaks of the rapidly increasing community now numbering 370 persons  he addsi am becoming very feeble from age and my memory fails me in consequence of an operation at the back of my neck for carbuncle two years since and goes on to tell of the flourishing condition of his flock  in regard to the other personages who have figured in our little tale very few perhaps none now survive  so late as the year 1872 we read in a pamphlet of the melanesian mission that george adams and his sister rachel evans both over seventy years of age were present at an evening service in norfolk island and that arthur quintal was still alive though quite imbecile  but dear otaheitan sally and her loving charlie and all the rest had long before joined the church above  there was however a homesick party of the pitcairners who could by no means reconcile themselves to the new home  these left it not very long after landing in 1856 and returned to their beloved pitcairn multiplying by degrees as the first settlers had done they gradually became an organised community and now while we write the palmgroves of pitcairn resound with the shouts of childrens merriment and with the hymn of praise as in days of yore  ajr mccoy is chief magistrate and a simon young acts as minister doctor and schoolmaster while his daughter rosalind amelia assists in the school  in a report from the chief magistrate we learn that although still out of the beaten track of commerce the pitcairners are more frequently visited by whalers than they used to be  their simplicity of life manners and piety appears to be unchanged  he says among other things  no work is done on the sabbathday  we have a bibleclass every wednesday and a prayermeeting the first friday of each month  every family has morning and evening prayers without intermission  we have a public or church library at which all may read  clothing we generally get from whalers who call in for refreshments  no alcoholic liquors of any kind are used on the island except for medical purposes  a drunkard is unknown here  so the good seed sown under such peculiar circumstances at the beginning of the century continues to grow and spread and flourish bringing forth fruit to the glory of god  thus he causes light to spring out of darkness good to arise out of evil and the lonely island once an almost unknown rock in the pacific ocean was made a centre of blessed christian influence soon after the time when it becamethe refuge of the mutineers
