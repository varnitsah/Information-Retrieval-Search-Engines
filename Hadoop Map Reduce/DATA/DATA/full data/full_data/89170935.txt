land  the ruins of san francisco  a night at wingdam     legends and tales     the legend of monte del diablo   the cautious reader will detect a lack of authenticity in the following pages i am not a cautious reader myself yet i confess with some concern to the absence of much documentary evidence in support of the singular incident i am about to relate disjointed memoranda the proceedings of ayuntamientos and early departmental juntas with other records of a primitive and superstitious people have been my inadequate authorities it is but just to state however that though this particular story lacks corroboration in ransacking the spanish archives of upper california i have met with many more surprising and incredible stories attested and supported to a degree that would have placed this legend beyond a cavil or doubt i have also never lost faith in the legend myself and in so doing have profited much from the examples of divers grantclaimants who have often jostled me in their more practical researches and who have my sincere sympathy at the scepticism of a modern hardheaded and practical world  for many years after father junipero serro first rang his bell in the wilderness of upper california the spirit which animated that adventurous priest did not wane the conversion of the heathen went on rapidly in the establishment of missions throughout the land so sedulously did the good fathers set about their work that around their isolated chapels there presently arose adobe huts whose mudplastered and savage tenants partook regularly of the provisions and occasionally of the sacrament of their pious hosts nay so great was their progress that one zealous padre is reported to have administered the lords supper one sabbath morning to over three hundred heathen salvages it was not to be wondered that the enemy of souls being greatly incensed thereat and alarmed at his decreasing popularity should have grievously tempted and embarrassed these holy fathers as we shall presently see  yet they were happy peaceful days for california the vagrant keels of prying commerce had not as yet ruffled the lordly gravity of her bays no torn and ragged gulch betrayed the suspicion of golden treasure the wild oats drooped idly in the morning heat or wrestled with the afternoon breezes deer and antelope dotted the plain the watercourses brawled in their familiar channels nor dreamed of ever shifting their regular tide the wonders of the yosemite and calaveras were as yet unrecorded the holy fathers noted little of the landscape beyond the barbaric prodigality with which the quick soil repaid the sowing a new conversion the advent of a saints day or the baptism of an indian baby was at once the chronicle and marvel of their day  at this blissful epoch there lived at the mission of san pablo father jose antonio haro a worthy brother of the society of jesus he was of tall and cadaverous aspect a somewhat romantic history had given a poetic interest to his lugubrious visage while a youth pursuing his studies at famous salamanca he had become enamored of the charms of dona carmen de torrencevara as that lady passed to her matutinal devotions untoward circumstances hastened perhaps by a wealthier suitor brought this amour to a disastrous issue and father jose entered a monastery taking upon himself the vows of celibacy it was here that his natural fervor and poetic enthusiasm conceived expression as a missionary a longing to convert the uncivilized heathen succeeded his frivolous earthly passion and a desire to explore and develop unknown fastnesses continually possessed him in his flashing eye and sombre exterior was detected a singular commingling of the discreet las casas and the impetuous balboa  fired by this pious zeal father jose went forward in the van of christian pioneers on reaching mexico he obtained authority to establish the mission of san pablo like the good junipero accompanied only by an acolyte and muleteer he unsaddled his mules in a dusky canyon and rang his bell in the wilderness the savagesa peaceful inoffensive and inferior racepresently flocked around him the nearest military post was far away which contributed much to the security of these pious pilgrims who found their open trustfulness and amiability better fitted to repress hostility than the presence of an armed suspicious and brawling soldiery so the good father jose said matins and prime mass and vespers in the heart of sin and heathenism taking no heed to himself but looking only to the welfare of the holy church conversions soon followed and on the 7th of july 1760 the first indian baby was baptizedan event which as father jose piously records exceeds the richnesse of gold or precious jewels or the chancing upon the ophir of solomon i quote this incident as best suited to show the ingenious blending of poetry and piety which distinguished father joses record  the mission of san pablo progressed and prospered until the pious founder thereof like the infidel alexander might have wept that there were no more heathen worlds to conquer but his ardent and enthusiastic spirit could not long brook an idleness that seemed begotten of sin and one pleasant august morning in the year of grace 1770 father jose issued from the outer court of the mission building equipped to explore the field for new missionary labors  nothing could exceed the quiet gravity and unpretentiousness of the little cavalcade first rode a stout muleteer leading a packmule laden with the provisions of the party together with a few cheap crucifixes and hawks bells after him came the devout padre jose bearing his breviary and cross with a black serapa thrown around his shoulders while on either side trotted a dusky convert anxious to show a proper sense of their regeneration by acting as guides into the wilds of their heathen brethren their new condition was agreeably shown by the absence of the usual mudplaster which in their unconverted state they assumed to keep away vermin and cold the morning was bright and propitious before their departure mass had been said in the chapel and the protection of st ignatius invoked against all contingent evils but especially against bears which like the fiery dragons of old seemed to cherish unconquerable hostility to the holy church  as they wound through the canyon charming birds disported upon boughs and sprays and sober quails piped from the alders the willowy watercourses gave a musical utterance and the long grass whispered on the hillside on entering the deeper defiles above them towered dark green masses of pine and occasionally the madrono shook its bright scarlet berries as they toiled up many a steep ascent father jose sometimes picked up fragments of scoria which spake to his imagination of direful volcanoes and impending earthquakes to the less scientific mind of the muleteer ignacio they had even a more terrifying significance and he once or twice snuffed the air suspiciously and declared that it smelt of sulphur so the first day of their journey wore away and at night they encamped without having met a single heathen face  it was on this night that the enemy of souls appeared to ignacio in an appalling form he had retired to a secluded part of the camp and had sunk upon his knees in prayerful meditation when he looked up and perceived the archfiend in the likeness of a monstrous bear the evil one was seated on his hind legs immediately before him with his fore paws joined together just below his black muzzle wisely conceiving this remarkable attitude to be in mockery and derision of his devotions the worthy muleteer was transported with fury seizing an arquebuse he instantly closed his eyes and fired when he had recovered from the effects of the terrific discharge the apparition had disappeared father jose awakened by the report reached the spot only in time to chide the muleteer for wasting powder and ball in a contest with one whom a single ave would have been sufficient to utterly discomfit what further reliance he placed on ignacios story is not known but in commemoration of a worthy californian custom the place was called la canada de la tentacion del pio muletero or the glen of the temptation of the pious muleteer a name which it retains to this day  the next morning the party issuing from a narrow gorge came upon a long valley sear and burnt with the shadeless heat its lower extremity was lost in a fading line of low hills which gathering might and volume toward the upper end of the valley upheaved a stupendous bulwark against the breezy north the peak of this awful spur was just touched by a fleecy cloud that shifted to and fro like a banneret father jose gazed at it with mingled awe and admiration by a singular coincidence the muleteer ignacio uttered the simple ejaculation diablo  as they penetrated the valley they soon began to miss the agreeable life and companionable echoes of the canyon they had quitted huge fissures in the parched soil seemed to gape as with thirsty mouths a few squirrels darted from the earth and disappeared as mysteriously before the jingling mules a gray wolf trotted leisurely along just ahead but whichever way father jose turned the mountain always asserted itself and arrested his wandering eye out of the dry and arid valley it seemed to spring into cooler and bracing life deep cavernous shadows dwelt along its base rocky fastnesses appeared midway of its elevation and on either side huge black hills diverged like massy roots from a central trunk his lively fancy pictured these hills peopled with a majestic and intelligent race of savages and looking into futurity he already saw a monstrous cross crowning the domelike summit far different were the sensations of the muleteer who saw in those awful solitudes only fiery dragons colossal bears and breakneck trails the converts concepcion and incarnacion trotting modestly beside the padre recognized perhaps some manifestation of their former weird mythology  at nightfall they reached the base of the mountain here father jose unpacked his mules said vespers and formally ringing his bell called upon the gentiles within hearing to come and accept the holy faith the echoes of the black frowning hills around him caught up the pious invitation and repeated it at intervals but no gentiles appeared that night nor were the devotions of the muleteer again disturbed although he afterward asserted that when the fathers exhortation was ended a mocking peal of laughter came from the mountain nothing daunted by these intimations of the near hostility of the evil one father jose declared his intention to ascend the mountain at early dawn and before the sun rose the next morning he was leading the way  the ascent was in many places difficult and dangerous huge fragments of rock often lay across the trail and after a few hours climbing they were forced to leave their mules in a little gully and continue the ascent afoot unaccustomed to such exertion father jose often stopped to wipe the perspiration from his thin cheeks as the day wore on a strange silence oppressed them except the occasional pattering of a squirrel or a rustling in the chimisal bushes there were no signs of life the halfhuman print of a bears foot sometimes appeared before them at which ignacio always crossed himself piously the eye was sometimes cheated by a dripping from the rocks which on closer inspection proved to be a resinous oily liquid with an abominable sulphurous smell when they were within a short distance of the summit the discreet ignacio selecting a sheltered nook for the camp slipped aside and busied himself in preparations for the evening leaving the holy father to continue the ascent alone never was there a more thoughtless act of prudence never a more imprudent piece of caution without noticing the desertion buried in pious reflection father jose pushed mechanically on and reaching the summit cast himself down and gazed upon the prospect  below him lay a succession of valleys opening into each other like gentle lakes until they were lost to the southward westerly the distant range hid the bosky canada which sheltered the mission of san pablo in the farther distance the pacific ocean stretched away bearing a cloud of fog upon its bosom which crept through the entrance of the bay and rolled thickly between him and the northeastward the same fog hid the base of mountain and the view beyond still from time to time the fleecy veil parted and timidly disclosed charming glimpses of mighty rivers mountain defiles and rolling plains sear with ripened oats and bathed in the glow of the setting sun as father jose gazed he was penetrated with a pious longing already his imagination filled with enthusiastic conceptions beheld all that vast expanse gathered under the mild sway of the holy faith and peopled with zealous converts each little knoll in fancy became crowned with a chapel from each dark canyon gleamed the white walls of a mission building growing bolder in his enthusiasm and looking farther into futurity he beheld a new spain rising on these savage shores he already saw the spires of stately cathedrals the domes of palaces vineyards gardens and groves convents half hid among the hills peeping from plantations of branching limes and long processions of chanting nuns wound through the defiles so completely was the good fathers conception of the future confounded with the past that even in their choral strain the wellremembered accents of carmen struck his ear he was busied in these fanciful imaginings when suddenly over that extended prospect the faint distant tolling of a bell rang sadly out and died it was the angelus father jose listened with superstitious exaltation the mission of san pablo was far away and the sound must have been some miraculous omen but never before to his enthusiastic sense did the sweet seriousness of this angelic symbol come with such strange significance with the last faint peal his glowing fancy seemed to cool the fog closed in below him and the good father remembered he had not had his supper he had risen and was wrapping his serapa around him when he perceived for the first time that he was not alone  nearly opposite and where should have been the faithless ignacio a grave and decorous figure was seated his appearance was that of an elderly hidalgo dressed in mourning with mustaches of irongray carefully waxed and twisted around a pair of lanternjaws the monstrous hat and prodigious feather the enormous ruff and exaggerated trunkhose contrasted with a frame shrivelled and wizened all belonged to a century previous yet father jose was not astonished his adventurous life and poetic imagination continually on the lookout for the marvellous gave him a certain advantage over the practical and material minded he instantly detected the diabolical quality of his visitant and was prepared with equal coolness and courtesy he met the cavaliers obeisance  i ask your pardon sir priest said the stranger for disturbing your meditations pleasant they must have been and right fanciful i imagine when occasioned by so fair a prospect  worldly perhaps sir devilfor such i take you to be said the holy father as the stranger bowed his black plumes to the ground worldly perhaps for it hath pleased heaven to retain even in our regenerated state much that pertaineth to the flesh yet still i trust not without some speculation for the welfare of the holy church in dwelling upon yon fair expanse mine eyes have been graciously opened with prophetic inspiration and the promise of the heathen as an inheritance hath marvellously recurred to me for there can be none lack such diligence in the true faith but may see that even the conversion of these pitiful salvages hath a meaning as the blessed st ignatius discreetly observes continued father jose clearing his throat and slightly elevating his voice the heathen is given to the warriors of christ even as the pearls of rare discovery which gladden the hearts of shipmen nay i might say  but here the stranger who had been wrinkling his brows and twisting his mustaches with wellbred patience took advantage of an oratorical pause  it grieves me sir priest to interrupt the current of your eloquence as discourteously as i have already broken your meditations but the day already waneth to night i have a matter of serious import to make with you could i entreat your cautious consideration a few moments  father jose hesitated the temptation was great and the prospect of acquiring some knowledge of the great enemys plans not the least trifling object and if the truth must be told there was a certain decorum about the stranger that interested the padre though well aware of the protean shapes the archfiend could assume and though free from the weaknesses of the flesh father jose was not above the temptations of the spirit had the devil appeared as in the case of the pious st anthony in the likeness of a comely damsel the good father with his certain experience of the deceitful sex would have whisked her away in the saying of a paternoster but there was added to the security of age a grave sadness about the strangera thoughtful consciousness as of being at a great moral disadvantagewhich at once decided him on a magnanimous course of conduct  the stranger then proceeded to inform him that he had been diligently observing the holy fathers triumphs in the valley that far from being greatly exercised thereat he had been only grieved to see so enthusiastic and chivalrous an antagonist wasting his zeal in a hopeless work for he observed the issue of the great battle of good and evil had been otherwise settled as he would presently show him it wants but a few moments of night he continued and over this interval of twilight as you know i have been given complete control look to the west  as the padre turned the stranger took his enormous hat from his head and waved it three times before him at each sweep of the prodigious feather the fog grew thinner until it melted impalpably away and the former landscape returned yet warm with the glowing sun as father jose gazed a strain of martial music arose from the valley and issuing from a deep canyon the good father beheld a long cavalcade of gallant cavaliers habited like his companion as they swept down the plain they were joined by like processions that slowly defiled from every ravine and canyon of the mysterious mountain from time to time the peal of a trumpet swelled fitfully upon the breeze the cross of santiago glittered and the royal banners of castile and aragon waved over the moving column so they moved on solemnly toward the sea where in the distance father jose saw stately caravels bearing the same familiar banner awaiting them the good padre gazed with conflicting emotions and the serious voice of the stranger broke the silence  thou hast beheld sir priest the fading footprints of adventurous castile thou hast seen the declining glory of old spaindeclining as yonder brilliant sun the sceptre she hath wrested from the heathen is fast dropping from her decrepit and fleshless grasp the children she hath fostered shall know her no longer the soil she hath acquired shall be lost to her as irrevocably as she herself hath thrust the moor from her own granada  the stranger paused and his voice seemed broken by emotion at the same time father jose whose sympathizing heart yearned toward the departing banners cried in poignant accents  farewell ye gallant cavaliers and christian soldiers farewell thou nunes de balboa thou alonzo de ojeda and thou most venerable las casas farewell and may heaven prosper still the seed ye left behind  then turning to the stranger father jose beheld him gravely draw his pockethandkerchief from the baskethilt of his rapier and apply it decorously to his eyes  pardon this weakness sir priest said the cavalier apologetically but these worthy gentlemen were ancient friends of mine and have done me many a delicate servicemuch more perchance than these poor sables may signify he added with a grim gesture toward the mourning suit he wore  father jose was too much preoccupied in reflection to notice the equivocal nature of this tribute and after a few moments silence said as if continuing his thought  but the seed they have planted shall thrive and prosper on this fruitful soil  as if answering the interrogatory the stranger turned to the opposite direction and again waving his hat said in the same serious tone  look to the east  the father turned and as the fog broke away before the waving plume he saw that the sun was rising issuing with its bright beams through the passes of the snowy mountains beyond appeared a strange and motley crew instead of the dark and romantic visages of his last phantom train the father beheld with strange concern the blue eyes and flaxen hair of a saxon race in place of martial airs and musical utterance there rose upon the ear a strange din of harsh gutturals and singular sibilation instead of the decorous tread and stately mien of the cavaliers of the former vision they came pushing bustling panting and swaggering and as they passed the good father noticed that giant trees were prostrated as with the breath of a tornado and the bowels of the earth were torn and rent as with a convulsion and father jose looked in vain for holy cross or christian symbol there was but one that seemed an ensign and he crossed himself with holy horror as he perceived it bore the effigy of a bear  who are these swaggering ishmaelites he asked with something of asperity in his tone  the stranger was gravely silent  what do they here with neither cross nor holy symbol he again demanded  have you the courage to see sir priest responded the stranger quietly  father jose felt his crucifix as a lonely traveller might his rapier and assented  step under the shadow of my plume said the stranger  father jose stepped beside him and they instantly sank through the earth  when he opened his eyes which had remained closed in prayerful meditation during his rapid descent he found himself in a vast vault bespangled overhead with luminous points like the starred firmament it was also lighted by a yellow glow that seemed to proceed from a mighty sea or lake that occupied the centre of the chamber around this subterranean sea dusky figures flitted bearing ladles filled with the yellow fluid which they had replenished from its depths from this lake diverging streams of the same mysterious flood penetrated like mighty rivers the cavernous distance as they walked by the banks of this glittering styx father jose perceived how the liquid stream at certain places became solid the ground was strewn with glittering flakes one of these the padre picked up and curiously examined it was virgin gold  an expression of discomfiture overcast the good fathers face at this discovery but there was trace neither of malice nor satisfaction in the strangers air which was still of serious and fateful contemplation when father jose recovered his equanimity he said bitterly  this then sir devil is your work this is your deceitful lure for the weak souls of sinful nations so would you replace the christian grace of holy spain  this is what must be returned the stranger gloomily but listen sir priest it lies with you to avert the issue for a time leave me here in peace go back to castile and take with you your bells your images and your missions continue here and you only precipitate results stay promise me you will do this and you shall not lack that which will render your old age an ornament and a blessing and the stranger motioned significantly to the lake  it was here the legend discreetly relates that the devil showedas he always shows sooner or laterhis cloven hoof the worthy padre sorely perplexed by his threefold vision and if the truth must be told a little nettled at this wresting away of the glory of holy spanish discovery had shown some hesitation but the unlucky bribe of the enemy of souls touched his castilian spirit starting back in deep disgust he brandished his crucifix in the face of the unmasked fiend and in a voice that made the dusky vault resound cried  avaunt thee sathanas diabolus i defy thee what wouldst thou bribe meme a brother of the sacred society of the holy jesus licentiate of cordova and inquisitor of guadalaxara thinkest thou to buy me with thy sordid treasure avaunt  what might have been the issue of this rupture and how complete might have been the triumph of the holy father over the archfiend who was recoiling aghast at these sacred titles and the flourishing symbol we can never know for at that moment the crucifix slipped through his fingers  scarcely had it touched the ground before devil and holy father simultaneously cast themselves toward it in the struggle they clinched and the pious jose who was as much the superior of his antagonist in bodily as in spiritual strength was about to treat the great adversary to a back somersault when he suddenly felt the long nails of the stranger piercing his flesh a new fear seized his heart a numbing chillness crept through his body and he struggled to free himself but in vain a strange roaring was in his ears the lake and cavern danced before his eyes and vanished and with a loud cry he sank senseless to the ground  when he recovered his consciousness he was aware of a gentle swaying motion of his body he opened his eyes and saw it was high noon and that he was being carried in a litter through the valley he felt stiff and looking down perceived that his arm was tightly bandaged to his side  he closed his eyes and after a few words of thankful prayer thought how miraculously he had been preserved and made a vow of candlesticks to the blessed saint jose he then called in a faint voice and presently the penitent ignacio stood beside him  the joy the poor fellow felt at his patrons returning consciousness for some time choked his utterance he could only ejaculate a miracle blessed saint jose he lives and kiss the padres bandaged hand father jose more intent on his last nights experience waited for his emotion to subside and asked where he had been found  on the mountain your reverence but a few varas from where he attacked you  howyou saw him then asked the padre in unfeigned astonishment  saw him your reverence mother of god i should think i did and your reverence shall see him too if he ever comes again within range of ignacios arquebuse  what mean you ignacio said the padre sitting boltupright in his litter  why the bear your reverencethe bear holy father who attacked your worshipful person while you were meditating on the top of yonder mountain  ah said the holy father lying down again chut child i would be at peace  when he reached the mission he was tenderly cared for and in a few weeks was enabled to resume those duties from which as will be seen not even the machinations of the evil one could divert him the news of his physical disaster spread over the country and a letter to the bishop of guadalaxara contained a confidential and detailed account of the good fathers spiritual temptation but in some way the story leaked out and long after jose was gathered to his fathers his mysterious encounter formed the theme of thrilling and whispered narrative the mountain was generally shunned it is true that senor joaquin pedrillo afterward located a grant near the base of the mountain but as senora pedrillo was known to be a termagant halfbreed the senor was not supposed to be overfastidious  such is the legend of monte del diablo as i said before it may seem to lack essential corroboration the discrepancy between the fathers narrative and the actual climax has given rise to some scepticism on the part of ingenious quibblers all such i would simply refer to that part of the report of senor julio serro subprefect of san pablo before whom attest of the above was made touching this matter the worthy prefect observes that although the body of father jose doth show evidence of grievous conflict in the flesh yet that is no proof that the enemy of souls who could assume the figure of a decorous elderly caballero could not at the same time transform himself into a bear for his own vile purposes     the adventure of padre vincentio  a legend of san francisco   one pleasant new years eve about forty years ago padre vicentio was slowly picking his way across the sandhills from the mission dolores as he climbed the crest of the ridge beside mission creek his broad shining face might have been easily mistaken for the beneficent image of the rising moon so bland was its smile and so indefinite its features for the padre was a man of notable reputation and character his ministration at the mission of san jose had been marked with cordiality and unction he was adored by the simpleminded savages and had succeeded in impressing his individuality so strongly upon them that the very children were said to have miraculously resembled him in feature  as the holy man reached the loneliest portion of the road he naturally put spurs to his mule as if to quicken that decorous pace which the obedient animal had acquired through long experience of its masters habits the locality had an unfavorable reputation sailorsdeserters from whaleshipshad been seen lurking about the outskirts of the town and low scrub oaks which everywhere beset the trail might have easily concealed some desperate runaway besides these material obstructions the devil whose hostility to the church was well known was said to sometimes haunt the vicinity in the likeness of a spectral whaler who had met his death in a drunken bout from a harpoon in the hands of a companion the ghost of this unfortunate mariner was frequently observed sitting on the hill toward the dusk of evening armed with his favorite weapon and a tub containing a coil of line looking out for some belated traveller on whom to exercise his professional skill it is related that the good father jose maria of the mission dolores had been twice attacked by this phantom sportsman that once on returning from san francisco and panting with exertion from climbing the hill he was startled by a stentorian cry of there she blows quickly followed by a hurtling harpoon which buried itself in the sand beside him that on another occasion he narrowly escaped destruction his serapa having been transfixed by the diabolical harpoon and dragged away in triumph popular opinion seems to have been divided as to the reason for the devils particular attention to father jose some asserting that the extreme piety of the padre excited the evil ones animosity and others that his adipose tendency simply rendered him from a professional viewpoint a profitable capture  had father vicentio been inclined to scoff at this apparition as a heretical innovation there was still the story of concepcion the demon vaquero whose terrible riata was fully as potent as the whalers harpoon concepcion when in the flesh had been a celebrated herder of cattle and wild horses and was reported to have chased the devil in the shape of a fleet pinto colt all the way from san luis obispo to san francisco vowing not to give up the chase until he had overtaken the disguised archenemy this the devil prevented by resuming his own shape but kept the unfortunate vaquero to the fulfilment of his rash vow and concepcion still scoured the coast on a phantom steed beguiling the monotony of his eternal pursuit by lassoing travellers dragging them at the heels of his unbroken mustang until they were eventually picked up halfstrangled by the roadside the padre listened attentively for the tramp of this terrible rider but no footfall broke the stillness of the night even the hoofs of his own mule sank noiselessly in the shifting sand now and then a rabbit bounded lightly by him or a quail ran into the bushes the melancholy call of plover from the adjoining marshes of mission creek came to him so faintly and fitfully that it seemed almost a recollection of the past rather than a reality of the present  to add to his discomposure one of those heavy seafogs peculiar to the locality began to drift across the hills and presently encompassed him while endeavoring to evade its cold embraces padre vicentio incautiously drove his heavy spurs into the flanks of his mule as that puzzled animal was hesitating on the brink of a steep declivity whether the poor beast was indignant at this novel outrage or had been for some time reflecting on the evils of being priestridden has not transpired enough that he suddenly threw up his heels pitching the reverend man over his head and having accomplished this feat coolly dropped on his knees and tumbled after his rider  over and over went the padre closely followed by his faithless mule luckily the little hollow which received the pair was of sand that yielded to the superincumbent weight half burying them without further injury for some moments the poor man lay motionless vainly endeavoring to collect his scattered senses a hand irreverently laid upon his collar and a rough shake assisted to recall his consciousness as the padre staggered to his feet he found himself confronted by a stranger  seen dimly through the fog and under circumstances that to say the least were not prepossessing the newcomer had an inexpressibly mysterious and brigandlike aspect a long boatcloak concealed his figure and a slouched hat hid his features permitting only his eyes to glisten in the depths with a deep groan the padre slipped from the strangers grasp and subsided into the soft sand again  gads life said the stranger pettishly hast no more bones in thy fat carcass than a jellyfish lend a hand here yo heave ho and he dragged the padre into an upright position now then who and what art thou  the padre could not help thinking that the question might have more properly been asked by himself but with an odd mixture of dignity and trepidation he began enumerating his different titles which were by no means brief and would have been alone sufficient to strike awe in the bosom of an ordinary adversary the stranger irreverently broke in upon his formal phrases and assuring him that a priest was the very person he was looking for coolly replaced the old mans hat which had tumbled off and bade him accompany him at once on an errand of spiritual counsel to one who was even then lying in extremity to think said the stranger that i should stumble upon the very man i was seeking body of bacchus but this is lucky follow me quickly for there is no time to lose  like most easy natures the positive assertion of the stranger and withal a certain authoritative air of command overcame what slight objections the padre might have feebly nurtured during this remarkable interview the spiritual invitation was one also that he dared not refuse not only that but it tended somewhat to remove the superstitious dread with which he had begun to regard the mysterious stranger but following at a respectful distance the padre could not help observing with a thrill of horror that the strangers footsteps made no impression on the sand and his figure seemed at times to blend and incorporate itself with the fog until the holy man was obliged to wait for its reappearance in one of these intervals of embarrassment he heard the ringing of the faroff mission bell proclaiming the hour of midnight scarcely had the last stroke died away before the announcement was taken up and repeated by a multitude of bells of all sizes and the air was filled with the sound of striking clocks and the pealing of steeple chimes the old man uttered a cry of alarm the stranger sharply demanded the cause the bells did you not hear them gasped padre vicentio tush tush answered the stranger thy fall hath set triple bobmajors ringing in thine ears come on  the padre was only too glad to accept the explanation conveyed in this discourteous answer but he was destined for another singular experience when they had reached the summit of the eminence now known as russian hill an exclamation again burst from the padre the stranger turned to his companion with an impatient gesture but the padre heeded him not the view that burst upon his sight was such as might well have engrossed the attention of a more enthusiastic temperament the fog had not yet reached the hill and the long valleys and hillsides of the embarcadero below were glittering with the light of a populous city look said the padre stretching his hand over the spreading landscape look dost thou not see the stately squares and brilliantly lighted avenues of a mighty metropolis dost thou not see as it were another firmament below  avast heaving reverend man and quit this folly said the strange dragging the bewildered padre after him behold rather the stars knocked out of thy hollow noddle by the fall thou hast had prithee get over thy visions and rhapsodies for the time is wearing apace  the padre humbly followed without another word descending the hill toward the north the stranger leading the way in a few moments the padre detected the wash of waves and presently his feet struck the firmer sand of the beach here the stranger paused and the padre perceived a boat lying in readiness hard by as he stepped into the stern sheets in obedience to the command of his companion he noticed that the rowers seemed to partake of the misty incorporeal texture of his companion a similarity that became the more distressing when he perceived also that their oars in pulling together made no noise the stranger assuming the helm guided the boat on quietly while the fog settling over the face of the water and closing around them seemed to interpose a muffled wall between themselves and the rude jarring of the outer world as they pushed further into this penetralia the padre listened anxiously for the sound of creaking blocks and the rattling of cordage but no vibration broke the veiled stillness or disturbed the warm breath of the fleecy fog only one incident occurred to break the monotony of their mysterious journey a oneeyed rower who sat in front of the padre catching the devout fathers eye immediately grinned such a ghastly smile and winked his remaining eye with such diabolical intensity of meaning that the padre was constrained to utter a pious ejaculation which had the disastrous effect of causing the marine cocles to catch a crab throwing his heels in the air and his head into the bottom of the boat but even this accident did not disturb the gravity of the rest of the ghastly boats crew  when as it seemed to the padre ten minutes had elapsed the outline of a large ship loomed up directly across their bow before he could utter the cry of warning that rose to his lips or brace himself against the expected shock the boat passed gently and noiselessly through the sides of the vessel and the holy man found himself standing on the berth deck of what seemed to be an ancient caravel the boat and boats crew had vanished only his mysterious friend the stranger remained by the light of a swinging lamp the padre beheld him standing beside a hammock whereon apparently lay the dying man to whom he had been so mysteriously summoned as the padre in obedience to a sign from his companion stepped to the side of the sufferer he feebly opened his eyes and thus addressed him  thou seest before thee reverend father a helpless mortal struggling not only with the last agonies of the flesh but beaten down and tossed with sore anguish of the spirit it matters little when or how i became what thou now seest me enough that my life has been ungodly and sinful and that my only hope of absolution lies in my imparting to thee a secret which is of vast importance to the holy church and affects greatly her power wealth and dominion on these shores but the terms of this secret and the conditions of my absolution are peculiar i have but five minutes to live in that time i must receive the extreme unction of the church  and thy secret said the holy father  shall be told afterwards answered the dying man come my time is short shrive me quickly  the padre hesitated couldst thou not tell this secret first  impossible said the dying man with what seemed to the padre a momentary gleam of triumph then as his breath grew feebler he called impatiently shrive me shrive me  let me know at least what this secret concerns suggested the padre insinuatingly  shrive me first said the dying man  but the priest still hesitated parleying with the sufferer until the ships bell struck when with a triumphant mocking laugh from the stranger the vessel suddenly fell to pieces amid the rushing of waters which at once involved the dying man the priest and the mysterious stranger  the padre did not recover his consciousness until high noon the next day when he found himself lying in a little hollow between the mission hills and his faithful mule a few paces from him cropping the sparse herbage the padre made the best of his way home but wisely abstained from narrating the facts mentioned above until after the discovery of gold when the whole of this veracious incident was related with the assertion of the padre that the secret which was thus mysteriously snatched from his possession was nothing more than the discovery of gold years since by the runaway sailors from the expedition of sir francis drake     the legend of devils point   on the northerly shore of san francisco bay at a point where the golden gate broadens into the pacific stands a bluff promontory it affords shelter from the prevailing winds to a semicircular bay on the east around this bay the hillside is bleak and barren but there are traces of former habitation in a weatherbeaten cabin and deserted corral it is said that these were originally built by an enterprising squatter who for some unaccountable reason abandoned them shortly after the jumper who succeeded him disappeared one day quite as mysteriously the third tenant who seemed to be a man of sanguine hopeful temperament divided the property into building lots staked off the hillside and projected the map of a new metropolis failing however to convince the citizens of san francisco that they had mistaken the site of their city he presently fell into dissipation and despondency he was frequently observed haunting the narrow strip of beach at low tide or perched upon the cliff at high water in the latter position a sheeptender one day found him cold and pulseless with a map of his property in his hand and his face turned toward the distant sea  perhaps these circumstances gave the locality its infelicitous reputation vague rumors were bruited of a supernatural influence that had been exercised on the tenants strange stories were circulated of the origin of the diabolical title by which the promontory was known by some it was believed to be haunted by the spirit of one of sir francis drakes sailors who had deserted his ship in consequence of stories told by the indians of gold discoveries but who had perished by starvation on the rocks a vaquero who had once passed a night in the ruined cabin related how a strangely dressed and emaciated figure had knocked at the door at midnight and demanded food other storytellers of more historical accuracy roundly asserted that sir francis himself had been little better than a pirate and had chosen this spot to conceal quantities of illgotten booty taken from neutral bottoms and had protected his hidingplace by the orthodox means of hellish incantation and diabolic agencies on moonlight nights a shadowy ship was sometimes seen standing offandon or when fogs encompassed sea and shore the noise of oars rising and falling in their rowlocks could be heard muffled and indistinctly during the night whatever foundation there might have been for these stories it was certain that a more weird and desolatelooking spot could not have been selected for their theatre high hills verdureless and enfiladed with dark canadas cast their gaunt shadows on the tide during a greater portion of the day the wind which blew furiously and incessantly seemed possessed with a spirit of fierce disquiet and unrest toward nightfall the seafog crept with soft step through the portals of the golden gate or stole in noiseless marches down the hillside tenderly soothing the windbuffeted face of the cliff until sea and sky were hid together at such times the populous city beyond and the nearer settlement seemed removed to an infinite distance an immeasurable loneliness settled upon the cliff the creaking of a windlass or the monotonous chant of sailors on some unseen outlying ship came faint and far and full of mystic suggestion  about a year ago a welltodo middleaged broker of san francisco found himself at nightfall the sole occupant of a plunger encompassed in a dense fog and drifting toward the golden gate this unexpected termination of an afternoons sail was partly attributable to his want of nautical skill and partly to the effect of his usually sanguine nature having given up the guidance of his boat to the wind and tide he had trusted too implicitly for that reaction which his business experience assured him was certain to occur in all affairs aquatic as well as terrestrial the tide will turn soon said the broker confidently or something will happen he had scarcely settled himself back again in the sternsheets before the bow of the plunger obeying some mysterious impulse veered slowly around and a dark object loomed up before him a gentle eddy carried the boat further in shore until at last it was completely embayed under the lee of a rocky point now faintly discernible through the fog he looked around him in the vain hope of recognizing some familiar headland the tops of the high hills which rose on either side were hidden in the fog as the boat swung around he succeeded in fastening a line to the rocks and sat down again with a feeling of renewed confidence and security  it was very cold the insidious fog penetrated his tightly buttoned coat and set his teeth to chattering in spite of the aid he sometimes drew from a pocketflask his clothes were wet and the sternsheets were covered with spray the comforts of fire and shelter continually rose before his fancy as he gazed wistfully on the rocks in sheer despair he finally drew the boat toward the most accessible part of the cliff and essayed to ascend this was less difficult than it appeared and in a few moments he had gained the hill above a dark object at a little distance attracted his attention and on approaching it proved to be a deserted cabin the story goes on to say that having built a roaring fire of stakes pulled from the adjoining corral with the aid of a flask of excellent brandy he managed to pass the early part of the evening with comparative comfort  there was no door in the cabin and the windows were simply square openings which freely admitted the searching fog but in spite of these discomfortsbeing a man of cheerful sanguine temperamenthe amused himself by poking the fire and watching the ruddy glow which the flames threw on the fog from the open door in this innocent occupation a great weariness overcame him and he fell asleep  he was awakened at midnight by a loud halloo which seemed to proceed directly from the sea thinking it might be the cry of some boatman lost in the fog he walked to the edge of the cliff but the thick veil that covered sea and land rendered all objects at the distance of a few feet indistinguishable he heard however the regular strokes of oars rising and falling on the water the halloo was repeated he was clearing his throat to reply when to his surprise an answer came apparently from the very cabin he had quitted hastily retracing his steps he was the more amazed on reaching the open door to find a stranger warming himself by the fire stepping back far enough to conceal his own person he took a good look at the intruder  he was a man of about forty with a cadaverous face but the oddity of his dress attracted the brokers attention more than his lugubrious physiognomy his legs were hid in enormously wide trousers descending to his knee where they met long boots of sealskin a peajacket with exaggerated cuffs almost as large as the breeches covered his chest and around his waist a monstrous belt with a buckle like a dentists sign supported two trumpetmouthed pistols and a curved hanger he wore a long queue which depended halfway down his back as the firelight fell on his ingenuous countenance the broker observed with some concern that this queue was formed entirely of a kind of tobacco known as pigtail or twist its effect the broker remarked was much heightened when in a moment of thoughtful abstraction the apparition bit off a portion of it and rolled it as a quid into the cavernous recesses of his jaws  meanwhile the nearer splash of oars indicated the approach of the unseen boat the broker had barely time to conceal himself behind the cabin before a number of uncouthlooking figures clambered up the hill toward the ruined rendezvous they were dressed like the previous comer who as they passed through the open door exchanged greetings with each in antique phraseology bestowing at the same time some familiar nickname flashinthepan spitteroffrogs malmsey butt latheyardwill and markthepinker were the few sobriquets the broker remembered whether these titles were given to express some peculiarity of their owner he could not tell for a silence followed as they slowly ranged themselves upon the floor of the cabin in a semicircle around their cadaverous host  at length malmsey butt a sphericalbodied manofwarsman with a rubicund nose got on his legs somewhat unsteadily and addressed himself to the company they had met that evening said the speaker in accordance with a timehonored custom this was simply to relieve that one of their number who for fifty years had kept watch and ward over the locality where certain treasures had been buried at this point the broker pricked up his ears if so be camarados and brothers all he continued ye are ready to receive the report of our excellent and wellbeloved brother master slittheweazand touching his search for this treasure why marry to t and begin  a murmur of assent went around the circle as the speaker resumed his seat master slittheweazand slowly opened his lantern jaws and began he had spent much of his time in determining the exact location of the treasure he believednay he could state positivelythat its position was now settled it was true he had done some trifling little business outside modesty forbade his mentioning the particulars but he would simply state that of the three tenants who had occupied the cabin during the past ten years none were now alive applause and cries of go to thou wast always a tall fellow and the like  markthepinker next arose before proceeding to business he had a duty to perform in the sacred name of friendship it ill became him to pass an eulogy upon the qualities of the speaker who had preceded him for he had known him from boyhoods hour side by side they had wrought together in the spanish war for a neat hand with a toledo he challenged his equal while how nobly and beautifully he had won his present title of slittheweazand all could testify the speaker with some show of emotion asked to be pardoned if he dwelt too freely on passages of their early companionship he then detailed with a fine touch of humor his comrades peculiar manner of slitting the ears and lips of a refractory jew who had been captured in one of their previous voyages he would not weary the patience of his hearers but would briefly propose that the report of slittheweazand be accepted and that the thanks of the company be tendered him  a beaker of strong spirits was then rolled into the hut and cans of grog were circulated freely from hand to hand the health of slittheweazand was proposed in a neat speech by markthepinker and responded to by the former gentleman in a manner that drew tears to the eyes of all present to the broker in his concealment this momentary diversion from the real business of the meeting occasioned much anxiety as yet nothing had been said to indicate the exact locality of the treasure to which they had mysteriously alluded fear restrained him from open inquiry and curiosity kept him from making good his escape during the orgies which followed  but his situation was beginning to become critical flashinthepan who seemed to have been a man of choleric humor taking fire during some hotly contested argument discharged both his pistols at the breast of his opponent the balls passed through on each side immediately below his armpits making a clean hole through which the horrified broker could see the firelight behind him the wounded man without betraying any concern excited the laughter of the company by jocosely putting his arms akimbo and inserting his thumbs into the orifices of the wounds as if they had been armholes this having in a measure restored goodhumor the party joined hands and formed a circle preparatory to dancing the dance was commenced by some monotonous stanzas hummed in a very high key by one of the party the rest joining in the following chorus which seemed to present a familiar sound to the brokers ear       her majestie is very sicke      lord essex hath ye measles      our admiral hath licked ye french      poppe saith ye weasel  at the regular recurrence of the last line the party discharged their loaded pistols in all directions rendering the position of the unhappy broker one of extreme peril and perplexity  when the tumult had partially subsided flashinthepan called the meeting to order and most of the revellers returned to their places malmsey butt however insisting upon another chorus and singing at the top of his voice       i am ycleped j keyseri was born at spring hys garden      my father toe make me ane clerke erst did essaye      but a fico for ye offisi spurn ye losels offeire      for i fain would be ane butcher byr ladykin alwaye  flashinthepan drew a pistol from his belt and bidding some one gag malmsey butt with the stock of it proceeded to read from a portentous roll of parchment that he held in his hand it was a semilegal document clothed in the quaint phraseology of a bygone period after a long preamble asserting their loyalty as lieges of her most bountiful majesty and sovereign lady the queen the document declared that they then and there took possession of the promontory and all the treasure trove therein contained formerly buried by her majestys most faithful and devoted admiral sir francis drake with the right to search discover and appropriate the same and for the purpose thereof they did then and there form a guild or corporation to so discover search for and disclose said treasures and by virtue thereof they solemnly subscribed their names but at this moment the reading of the parchment was arrested by an exclamation from the assembly and the broker was seen frantically struggling at the door in the strong arms of markthepinker  let me go he cried as he made a desperate attempt to reach the side of master flashinthe pan let me go i tell you gentlemen that document is not worth the parchment it is written on the laws of the state the customs of the country the mining ordinances are all against it dont by all thats sacred throw away such a capital investment through ignorance and informality let me go i assure you gentlemen professionally that you have a big thinga remarkably big thing and even if i aint in it im not going to see it fall through dont for gods sake gentlemen i implore you put your names to such a ridiculous paper there isnt a notary  he ceased the figures around him which were beginning to grow fainter and more indistinct as he went on swam before his eyes flickered reappeared again and finally went out he rubbed his eyes and gazed around him the cabin was deserted on the hearth the red embers of his fire were fading away in the bright beams of the morning sun that looked aslant through the open window he ran out to the cliff the sturdy seabreeze fanned his feverish cheeks and tossed the white caps of waves that beat in pleasant music on the beach below a stately merchantman with snowy canvas was entering the gate the voices of sailors came cheerfully from a bark at anchor below the point the muskets of the sentries gleamed brightly on alcatraz and the rolling of drums swelled on the breeze farther on the hills of san francisco cottagecrowned and bordered with wharves and warehouses met his longing eye  such is the legend of devils point any objections to its reliability may be met with the statement that the broker who tells the story has since incorporated a company under the title of flashinthepan gold and silver treasure mining company and that its shares are already held at a stiff figure a copy of the original document is said to be on record in the office of the company and on any clear day the locality of the claim may be distinctly seen from the hills of san francisco     the devil and the broker  a mediaeval legend   the church clocks in san francisco were striking ten the devil who had been flying over the city that evening just then alighted on the roof of a church near the corner of bush and montgomery streets it will be perceived that the popular belief that the devil avoids holy edifices and vanishes at the sound of a credo or paternoster is long since exploded indeed modern scepticism asserts that he is not averse to these orthodox discourses which particularly bear reference to himself and in a measure recognize his power and importance  i am inclined to think however that his choice of a restingplace was a good deal influenced by its contiguity to a populous thoroughfare when he was comfortably seated he began pulling out the joints of a small rod which he held in his hand and which presently proved to be an extraordinary fishingpole with a telescopic adjustment that permitted its protraction to a marvellous extent affixing a line thereto he selected a fly of a particular pattern from a small box which he carried with him and making a skilful cast threw his line into the very centre of that living stream which ebbed and flowed through montgomery street  either the people were very virtuous that evening or the bait was not a taking one in vain the devil whipped the stream at an eddy in front of the occidental or trolled his line into the shadows of the cosmopolitan five minutes passed without even a nibble dear me quoth the devil thats very singular one of my most popular flies too why theyd have risen by shoals in broadway or beacon street for that well here goes another and fitting a new fly from his wellfilled box he gracefully recast his line  for a few moments there was every prospect of sport the line was continually bobbing and the nibbles were distinct and gratifying once or twice the bait was apparently gorged and carried off in the upper stories of the hotels to be digested at leisure at such times the professional manner in which the devil played out his line would have thrilled the heart of izaak walton but his efforts were unsuccessful the bait was invariably carried off without hooking the victim and the devil finally lost his temper ive heard of these san franciscans before he muttered wait till i get hold of onethats all he added malevolently as he rebaited his hook a sharp tug and a wriggle foiled his next trial and finally with considerable effort he landed a portly twohundredpound broker upon the church roof  as the victim lay there gasping it was evident that the devil was in no hurry to remove the hook from his gills nor did he exhibit in this delicate operation that courtesy of manner and graceful manipulation which usually distinguished him  come he said gruffly as he grasped the broker by the waistband quit that whining and grunting dont flatter yourself that youre a prize either i was certain to have had you it was only a question of time  it is not that my lord which troubles me whined the unfortunate wretch as he painfully wriggled his head but that i should have been fooled by such a paltry bait what will they say of me down there to have let bigger things go by and to be taken in by this cheap trick he added as he groaned and glanced at the fly which the devil was carefully rearranging is whatpardon me my lordis what gets me  yes said the devil philosophically i never caught anybody yet who didnt say that but tell me aint you getting somewhat fastidious down there here is one of my most popular flies the greenback he continued exhibiting an emeraldlooking insect which he drew from his box this so generally considered excellent in election season has not even been nibbled at perhaps your sagacity which in spite of this unfortunate contretemps no one can doubt added the devil with a graceful return to his usual courtesy may explain the reason or suggest a substitute  the broker glanced at the contents of the box with a supercilious smile too oldfashioned my lordlong ago played out yet he added with a gleam of interest for a consideration i might offer somethingahemthat would make a taking substitute for these trifles give me he continued in a brisk businesslike way a slight percentage and a bonus down and im your man  name your terms said the devil earnestly  my liberty and a percentage on all you take and the things done  the devil caressed his tail thoughtfully for a few moments he was certain of the broker any way and the risk was slight done he said  stay a moment said the artful broker there are certain contingencies give me your fishingrod and let me apply the bait myself it requires a skilful hand my lord even your wellknown experience might fail leave me alone for half an hour and if you have reason to complain of my success i will forfeit my depositi mean my liberty  the devil acceded to his request bowed and withdrew alighting gracefully in montgomery street he dropped into meade  cos clothing store where having completely equipped himself a la mode he sallied forth intent on his personal enjoyment determining to sink his professional character he mingled with the current of human life and enjoyed with that immense capacity for excitement peculiar to his nature the whirl bustle and feverishness of the people as a purely aesthetic gratification unalloyed by the cares of business what he did that evening does not belong to our story we return to the broker whom we left on the roof  when he made sure that the devil had retired he carefully drew from his pocketbook a slip of paper and affixed it on the hook the line had scarcely reached the current before he felt a bite the hook was swallowed to bring up his victim rapidly disengage him from the hook and reset his line was the work of a moment another bite and the same result another and another in a very few minutes the roof was covered with his panting spoil the broker could himself distinguish that many of them were personal friends nay some of them were familiar frequenters of the building on which they were now miserably stranded that the broker felt a certain satisfaction in being instrumental in thus misleading his fellowbrokers no one acquainted with human nature will for a moment doubt but a stronger pull on his line caused him to put forth all his strength and skill the magic pole bent like a coachwhip the broker held firm assisted by the battlements of the church again and again it was almost wrested from his hand and again and again he slowly reeled in a portion of the tightening line at last with one mighty effort he lifted to the level of the roof a struggling object a howl like pandemonium rang through the air as the broker successfully landed at his feetthe devil himself  the two glared fiercely at each other the broker perhaps mindful of his former treatment evinced no haste to remove the hook from his antagonists jaw when it was finally accomplished he asked quietly if the devil was satisfied that gentleman seemed absorbed in the contemplation of the bait which he had just taken from his mouth i am he said finally and forgive you but what do you call this  bend low replied the broker as he buttoned up his coat ready to depart the devil inclined his ear i call it wild cat     the ogress of silver land  or  the diverting history of prince badfellah and prince bulleboye   in the second year of the reign of the renowned caliph lo there dwelt in silver land adjoining his territory a certain terrible ogress she lived in the bowels of a dismal mountain where she was in the habit of confining such unfortunate travellers as ventured within her domain the country for miles around was sterile and barren in some places it was covered with a white powder which was called in the language of the country al ka li and was supposed to be the pulverized bones of those who had perished miserably in her service  in spite of this every year great numbers of young men devoted themselves to the service of the ogress hoping to become her godsons and to enjoy the good fortune which belonged to that privileged class for these godsons had no work to perform neither at the mountain nor elsewhere but roamed about the world with credentials of their relationship in their pockets which they called stokh which was stamped with the stamp and sealed with the seal of the ogress and which enabled them at the end of each moon to draw large quantities of gold and silver from her treasury and the wisest and most favored of those godsons were the princes badfellah and bulleboye they knew all the secrets of the ogress and how to wheedle and coax her they were also the favorites of soopah intendent who was her lord high chamberlain and prime minister and who dwelt in silver land  one day soopah intendent said to his servants what is that which travels the most surely the most secretly and the most swiftly  and they all answered as one man lightning my lord travels the most surely the most swiftly and the most secretly  then said soopah intendent let lightning carry this message secretly swiftly and surely to my beloved friends the princes badfellah and bulleboye and tell them that their godmother is dying and bid them seek some other godmother or sell their stokh ere it becomes badjeeworthless  bekhesm on our heads be it answered the servants and they ran to lightning with the message who flew with it to the city by the sea and delivered it even at that moment into the hands of the princes badfellah and bulleboye  now the prince badfellah was a wicked young man and when he had received this message he tore his beard and rent his garment and reviled his godmother and his friend soopah intendent but presently he arose and dressed himself in his finest stuffs and went forth into the bazaars and among the merchants capering and dancing as he walked and crying in a loud voice o happy day o day worthy to be marked with a white stone  this he said cunningly thinking the merchants and men of the bazaars would gather about him which they presently did and began to question him what news o most worthy and serene highness tell us that we make merry too  then replied the cunning prince good news o my brothers for i have heard this day that my godmother in silver land is well the merchants who were not aware of the substance of the real message envied him greatly and said one to another surely our brother the prince badfellah is favored by allah above all men and they were about to retire when the prince checked them saying tarry for a moment here are my credentials or stokh the same i will sell you for fifty thousand sequins for i have to give a feast today and need much gold who will give fifty thousand and he again fell to capering and dancing but this time the merchants drew a little apart and some of the oldest and wisest said what dirt is this which the prince would have us swallow if his godmother were well why should he sell his stokh bismillah the olives are old and the jar is broken when prince badfellah perceived them whispering his countenance fell and his knees smote against each other through fear but dissembling again he said well so be it lo i have much more than shall abide with me for my days are many and my wants are few say forty thousand sequins for my stokh and let me depart in allahs name who will give forty thousand sequins to become the godson of such a healthy mother and he again fell to capering and dancing but not as gayly as before for his heart was troubled the merchants however only moved farther away thirty thousand sequins cried prince badfellah but even as he spoke they fled before his face crying his godmother is dead lo the jackals are defiling her grave mashalla he has no godmother and they sought out panik the swiftfooted messenger and bade him shout through the bazaars that the godmother of prince badfellah was dead when he heard this the prince fell upon his face and rent his garments and covered himself with the dust of the marketplace as he was sitting thus a porter passed him with jars of wine on his shoulders and the prince begged him to give him a jar for he was exceeding thirsty and faint but the porter said what will my lord give me first and the prince in very bitterness of spirit said take this and handed him his stokh and so exchanged it for a jar of wine  now the prince bulleboye was of a very different disposition when he received the message of soopah intendent he bowed his head and said it is the will of god then he rose and without speaking a word entered the gates of his palace but his wife the peerless maree jahann perceiving the gravity of his countenance said why is my lord cast down and silent why are those rare and priceless pearls his words shut up so tightly between those gorgeous oystershells his lips but to this he made no reply thinking further to divert him she brought her lute into the chamber and stood before him and sang the song and danced the dance of ben kotton which is called ibrahims daughter but she could not lift the veil of sadness from his brow  when she had ceased the prince bulleboye arose and said allah is great and what am i his servant but the dust of the earth lo this day has my godmother sickened unto death and my stokh become as a withered palmleaf call hither my servants and cameldrivers and the merchants that have furnished me with stuffs and the beggars who have feasted at my table and bid them take all that is here for it is mine no longer with these words he buried his face in his mantle and wept aloud  but maree jahann his wife plucked him by the sleeve prithee my lord said she bethink thee of the brokah or scrivener who besought thee but yesterday to share thy stokh with him and gave thee his bond for fifty thousand sequins but the noble prince bulleboye raising his head said shall i sell to him for fifty thousand sequins that which i know is not worth a soo markee for is not all the brokahs wealth even his wife and children pledged on that bond shall i ruin him to save myself allah forbid rather let me eat the salt fish of honest penury than the kibobs of dishonorable affluence rather let me wallow in the mire of virtuous oblivion than repose on the divan of luxurious wickedness  when the prince had given utterance to this beautiful and edifying sentiment a strain of gentle music was heard and the rear wall of the apartment which had been ingeniously constructed like a flat opened and discovered the ogress of silver land in the glare of blue fire seated on a triumphal car attached to two ropes which were connected with the flies in the very act of blessing the unconscious prince when the walls closed again without attracting his attention prince bulleboye arose dressed himself in his coarsest and cheapest stuffs and sprinkled ashes on his head and in this guise having embraced his wife went forth into the bazaars in this it will be perceived how differently the good prince bulleboye acted from the wicked prince badfellah who put on his gayest garments to simulate and deceive  now when prince bulleboye entered the chief bazaar where the merchants of the city were gathered in council he stood up in his accustomed place and all that were there held their breath for the noble prince bulleboye was much respected let the brokah whose bond i hold for fifty thousand sequins stand forth said the prince and the brokah stood forth from among the merchants then said the prince here is thy bond for fifty thousand sequins for which i was to deliver unto thee one half of my stokh know then o my brotherand thou too o aga of the brokahsthat this my stokh which i pledged to thee is worthless for my godmother the ogress of silver land is dying thus do i release thee from thy bond and from the poverty which might overtake thee as it has even me thy brother the prince bulleboye and with that the noble prince bulleboye tore the bond of the brokah into pieces and scattered it to the four winds  now when the prince tore up the bond there was a great commotion and some said surely the prince bulleboye is drunken with wine and others he is possessed of an evil spirit and his friends expostulated with him saying what thou hast done is not the custom of the bazaarsbehold it is not biz but to all the prince answered gravely it is right on my own head be it  but the oldest and wisest of the merchants they who had talked with prince badfellah the same morning whispered together and gathered around the brokah whose bond the prince bulleboye had torn up hark ye said they our brother the prince bulleboye is cunning as a jackal what bosh is this about ruining himself to save thee such a thing was never heard before in the bazaars it is a trick o thou mooncalf of a brokah dost thou not see that he has heard good news from his godmother the same that was even now told us by the prince badfellah his confederate and that he would destroy thy bond for fifty thousand sequins because his stokh is worth a hundred thousand be not deceived o too credulous brokah for this what our brother the prince doeth is not in the name of allah but of biz the only god known in the bazaars of the city  when the foolish brokah heard these things he cried justice o aga of the brokahsjustice and the fulfilment of my bond let the prince deliver unto me the stokh here are my fifty thousand sequins but the prince said have i not told that my godmother is dying and that my stokh is valueless at this the brokah only clamored the more for justice and the fulfilment of his bond then the aga of the brokahs said since the bond is destroyed behold thou hast no claim go thy ways but the brokah again cried justice my lord aga behold i offer the prince seventy thousand sequins for his stokh but the prince said it is not worth one sequin then the aga said bismillah i cannot understand this whether thy godmother be dead or dying or immortal does not seem to signify therefore o prince by the laws of biz and of allah thou art released give the brokah thy stokh for seventy thousand sequins and bid him depart in peace on his own head be it when the prince heard this command he handed his stokh to the brokah who counted out to him seventy thousand sequins but the heart of the virtuous prince did not rejoice nor did the brokah when he found his stokh was valueless but the merchants lifted their hands in wonder at the sagacity and wisdom of the famous prince bulleboye for none would believe that it was the law of allah that the prince followed and not the rules of biz     the ruins of san francisco   towards the close of the nineteenth century the city of san francisco was totally ingulfed by an earthquake although the whole coastline must have been much shaken the accident seems to have been purely local and even the city of oakland escaped schwappelfurt the celebrated german geologist has endeavored to explain this singular fact by suggesting that there are some things the earth cannot swallowa statement that should be received with some caution as exceeding the latitude of ordinary geological speculation  historians disagree in the exact date of the calamity tulu krish the wellknown newzealander whose admirable speculations on the ruins of st paul as seen from london bridge have won for him the attentive consideration of the scientific world fixes the occurrence in a d 1880 this supposing the city to have been actually founded in 1850 as asserted would give but thirty years for it to have assumed the size and proportions it had evidently attained at the time of its destruction it is not our purpose however to question the conclusions of the justly famed maorian philosopher our present business lies with the excavations that are now being prosecuted by order of the hawaiian government upon the site of the lost city  every one is familiar with the story of its discovery for many years the bay of san francisco had been famed for the luscious quality of its oysters it is stated that a dredger one day raked up a large bell which proved to belong to the city hall and led to the discovery of the cupola of that building the attention of the government was at once directed to the spot the bay of san francisco was speedily drained by a system of patent siphons and the city deeply embedded in mud brought to light after a burial of many centuries the city hall postoffice mint and customhouse were readily recognized by the large fullfed barnacles which adhered to their walls shortly afterwards the first skeleton was discovered that of a broker whose position in the upper strata of mud nearer the surface was supposed to be owing to the exceeding buoyancy or inflation of scrip which he had secured about his person while endeavoring to escape many skeletons supposed to be those of females encompassed in that peculiar steel coop or cage which seems to have been worn by the women of that period were also found in the upper stratum alexis von puffer in his admirable work on san francisco accounts for the position of these unfortunate creatures by asserting that the steel cage was originally the frame of a parachutelike garment which distended the skirt and in the submersion of the city prevented them from sinking if anything says von puffer could have been wanting to add intensity to the horrible catastrophe which took place as the waters first entered the city it would have been furnished in the forcible separation of the sexes at this trying moment buoyed up by their peculiar garments the female population instantly ascended to the surface as the drowning husband turned his eyes above what must have been his agony as he saw his wife shooting upward and knew that he was debarred the privilege of perishing with her to the lasting honor of the male inhabitants be it said that but few seemed to have availed themselves of their wives superior levity only one skeleton was found still grasping the ankles of another in their upward journey to the surface  for many years california had been subject to slight earthquakes more or less generally felt but not of sufficient importance to awaken anxiety or fear perhaps the absorbing nature of the san franciscans pursuits of goldgetting which metal seems to have been valuable in those days and actually used as a medium of currency rendered the inhabitants reckless of all other matters everything tends to show that the calamity was totally unlooked for we quote the graphic language of schwappelfurt  the morning of the tremendous catastrophe probably dawned upon the usual restless crowd of goldgetters intent upon their several avocations the streets were filled with the expanded figures of gayly dressed women acknowledging with coy glances the respectful salutations of beaux as they gracefully raised their remarkable cylindrical headcoverings a model of which is still preserved in the honolulu museum the brokers had gathered at their respective temples the shopmen were exhibiting their goods the idlers or bummersa term applied to designate an aristocratic privileged class who enjoyed immunities from labor and from whom a majority of the rulers are chosenwere listlessly regarding the promenaders from the streetcorners or the doors of their bibulous temples a slight premonitory thrill runs through the city the busy life of this restless microcosm is arrested the shopkeeper pauses as he elevates the goods to bring them into a favorable light and the glib professional recommendation sticks on his tongue in the drinkingsaloon the glass is checked halfway to the lips on the streets the promenaders pause another thrill and the city begins to go down a few of the more persistent topers tossing off their liquor at the same moment beyond a terrible sensation of nausea the crowds who now throng the streets do not realize the extent of the catastrophe the waters of the bay recede at first from the centre of depression assuming a concave shape the outer edge of the circle towering many thousand feet above the city another convulsion and the water instantly resumes its level the city is smoothly ingulfed nine thousand feet below and the regular swell of the pacific calmly rolls over it terrible says schwappelfurt in conclusion as the calamity must have been in direct relation to the individuals immediately concerned therein we cannot but admire its artistic management the division of the catastrophe into three periods the completeness of the cataclysms and the rare combination of sincerity of intention with felicity of execution     a night at wingdam   i had been stageridden and bewildered all day and when we swept down with the darkness into the arcadian hamlet of wingdam i resolved to go no farther and rolled out in a gloomy and dyspeptic state the effects of a mysterious pie and some sweetened carbonic acid known to the proprietor of the halfway house as lemming sody still oppressed me even the facetiae of the gallant expressman who knew everybodys christian name along the route who rained letters newspapers and bundles from the top of the stage whose legs frequently appeared in frightful proximity to the wheels who got on and off while we were going at full speed whose gallantry energy and superior knowledge of travel crushed all us other passengers to envious silence and who just then was talking with several persons and manifestly doing something else at the same timeeven this had failed to interest me so i stood gloomily clutching my shawl and carpetbag and watched the stage roll away taking a parting look at the gallant expressman as he hung on the top rail with one leg and lit his cigar from the pipe of a running footman i then turned toward the wingdam temperance hotel  it may have been the weather or it may have been the pie but i was not impressed favorably with the house perhaps it was the name extending the whole length of the building with a letter under each window making the people who looked out dreadfully conspicuous perhaps it was that temperance always suggested to my mind rusks and weak tea it was uninviting it might have been called the total abstinence hotel from the lack of anything to intoxicate or inthrall the senses it was designed with an eye to artistic dreariness it was so much too large for the settlement that it appeared to be a very slight improvement on outdoors it was unpleasantly new there was the forest flavor of dampness about it and a slight spicing of pine nature outraged but not entirely subdued sometimes broke out afresh in little round sticky resinous tears on the doors and windows it seemed to me that boarding there must seem like a perpetual picnic as i entered the door a number of the regular boarders rushed out of a long room and set about trying to get the taste of something out of their mouths by the application of tobacco in various forms a few immediately ranged themselves around the fireplace with their legs over each others chairs and in that position silently resigned themselves to indigestion remembering the pie i waived the invitation of the landlord to supper but suffered myself to be conducted into the sittingroom mine host was a magnificentlooking heavily bearded specimen of the animal man he reminded me of somebody or something connected with the drama i was sitting beside the fire mutely wondering what it could be and trying to follow the particular chord of memory thus touched into the intricate past when a little delicatelooking woman appeared at the door and leaning heavily against the casing said in an exhausted tone husband as the landlord turned toward her that particular remembrance flashed before me in a single line of blank verse it was this two souls with but one single thought two hearts that beat as one  it was ingomar and parthenia his wife i imagined a different denouement from the play ingomar had taken parthenia back to the mountains and kept a hotel for the benefit of the alemanni who resorted there in large numbers poor parthenia was pretty well fagged out and did all the work without help she had two young barbarians a boy and a girl she was faded but still goodlooking  i sat and talked with ingomar who seemed perfectly at home and told me several stories of the alemanni all bearing a strong flavor of the wilderness and being perfectly in keeping with the house how he ingomar had killed a certain dreadful bar whose skin was just up yar over his bed how he ingomar had killed several bucks whose skins had been prettily fringed and embroidered by parthenia and even now clothed him how he ingomar had killed several injins and was once nearly scalped himself all this with that ingenious candor which is perfectly justifiable in a barbarian but which a greek might feel inclined to look upon as blowing thinking of the wearied parthenia i began to consider for the first time that perhaps she had better married the old greek then she would at least have always looked neat then she would not have worn a woollen dress flavored with all the dinners of the past year then she would not have been obliged to wait on the table with her hair half down then the two children would not have hung about her skirts with dirty fingers palpably dragging her down day by day i suppose it was the pie which put such heartless and improper ideas in my head and so i rose up and told ingomar i believed id go to bed preceded by that redoubtable barbarian and a flaring tallow candle i followed him up stairs to my room it was the only single room he had he told me he had built it for the convenience of married parties who might stop here but that event not happening yet he had left it half furnished it had cloth on one side and large cracks on the other the wind which always swept over wingdam at nighttime puffed through the apartment from different apertures the window was too small for the hole in the side of the house where it hung and rattled noisily everything looked cheerless and dispiriting before ingomar left me he brought that barskin and throwing it over the solemn bier which stood in one corner told me he reckoned that would keep me warm and then bade me good night i undressed myself the light blowing out in the middle of that ceremony crawled under the barskin and tried to compose myself to sleep  but i was staringly wide awake i heard the wind sweep down the mountainside and toss the branches of the melancholy pine and then enter the house and try all the doors along the passage sometimes strong currents of air blew my hair all over the pillow as with strange whispering breaths the green timber along the walls seemed to be sprouting and sent a dampness even through the barskin i felt like robinson crusoe in his tree with the ladder pulled upor like the rocked baby of the nursery song after lying awake half an hour i regretted having stopped at wingdam at the end of the third quarter i wished i had not gone to bed and when a restless hour passed i got up and dressed myself there had been a fire down in the big room perhaps it was still burning i opened the door and groped my way along the passage vocal with the snores of the alemanni and the whistling of the night wind i partly fell down stairs and at last entering the big room saw the fire still burning i drew a chair toward it poked it with my foot and was astonished to see by the upspringing flash that parthenia was sitting there also holding a fadedlooking baby  i asked her why she was sitting up  she did not go to bed on wednesday night before the mail arrived and then she awoke her husband and there were passengers to tend to  did she not get tired sometimes  a little but abner the barbarians christian name had promised to get her more help next spring if business was good  how many boarders had she  she believed about forty came to regular meals and there was transient custom which was as much as she and her husband could tend to but he did a great deal of work  what work  o bringing in the wood and looking after the traders things  how long had she been married  about nine years she had lost a little girl and boy three children living he was from illinois she from boston had an education boston female high schoolgeometry algebra a little latin and greek mother and father died came to illinois alone to teach school saw himyesa love match two souls etc etc married and emigrated to kansas thence across the plains to california always on the outskirts of civilization he liked it  she might sometimes have wished to go home would like to on account of her children would like to give them an education had taught them a little herself but couldnt do much on account of other work hoped that the boy would be like his father strong and hearty was fearful the girl would be more like her had often thought she was not fit for a pioneers wife  why  o she was not strong enough and had seen some of his friends wives in kansas who could do more work but he never complainedwas so kind two souls etc  sitting there with her head leaning pensively on one hand holding the poor wearied and limplooking baby wearily on the other arm dirty drabbled and forlorn with the firelight playing upon her features no longer fresh or young but still refined and delicate and even in her grotesque slovenliness still bearing a faint reminiscence of birth and breeding it was not to be wondered that i did not fall into excessive raptures over the barbarians kindness emboldened by my sympathy she told me how she had given up little by little what she imagined to be the weakness of her early education until she found that she acquired but little strength in her new experience how translated to a backwoods society she was hated by the women and called proud and fine and how her dear husband lost popularity on that account with his fellows how led partly by his roving instincts and partly from other circumstances he started with her to california an account of that tedious journey how it was a dreary dreary waste in her memory only a blank plain marked by a little cairn of stonesa childs grave how she had noticed that little willie failed how she had called abners attention to it but manlike he knew nothing about children and poohpoohed it and was worried by the stock how it happened that after they had passed sweetwater she was walking beside the wagon one night and looking at the western sky and she heard a little voice say mother how she looked into the wagon and saw that little willie was sleeping comfortably and did not wish to wake him how that in a few moments more she heard the same voice saying mother how she came back to the wagon and leaned down over him and felt his breath upon her face and again covered him up tenderly and once more resumed her weary journey beside him praying to god for his recovery how with her face turned to the sky she heard the same voice saying mother and directly a great bright star shot away from its brethren and expired and how she knew what had happened and ran to the wagon again only to pillow a little pinched and cold white face upon her weary bosom the thin red hands went up to her eyes here and for a few moments she sat still the wind tore round the house and made a frantic rush at the front door and from his couch of skins in the inner roomingomar the barbarian snored peacefully  of course she always found a protector from insult and outrage in the great courage and strength of her husband  o yes when ingomar was with her she feared nothing but she was nervous and had been frightened once  how  they had just arrived in california they kept house then and had to sell liquor to traders ingomar was hospitable and drank with everybody for the sake of popularity and business and ingomar got to like liquor and was easily affected by it and how one night there was a boisterous crowd in the barroom she went in and tried to get him away but only succeeded in awakening the coarse gallantry of the halfcrazed revellers and how when she had at last got him in the room with her frightened children he sank down on the bed in a stupor which made her think the liquor was drugged and how she sat beside him all night and near morning heard a step in the passage and looking toward the door saw the latch slowly moving up and down as if somebody were trying it and how she shook her husband and tried to waken him but without effect and how at last the door yielded slowly at the top it was bolted below as if by a gradual pressure without and how a hand protruded through the opening and how as quick as lightning she nailed that hand to the wall with her scissors her only weapon but the point broke and somebody got away with a fearful oath how she never told her husband of it for fear he would kill that somebody but how on one day a stranger called here and as she was handing him his coffee she saw a queer triangular scar on the back of his hand  she was still talking and the wind was still blowing and ingomar was still snoring from his couch of skins when there was a shout high up the straggling street and a clattering of hoofs and rattling of wheels the mail had arrived parthenia ran with the faded baby to awaken ingomar and almost simultaneously the gallant expressman stood again before me addressing me by my christian name and inviting me to drink out of a mysterious black bottle the horses were speedily watered and the business of the gallant expressman concluded and bidding parthenia good by i got on the stage and immediately fell asleep and dreamt of calling on parthenia and ingomar and being treated with pie to an unlimited extent until i woke up the next morning in sacramento i have some doubts as to whether all this was not a dyspeptic dream but i never witness the drama and hear that noble sentiment concerning two souls etc without thinking of wingdam and poor parthenia
