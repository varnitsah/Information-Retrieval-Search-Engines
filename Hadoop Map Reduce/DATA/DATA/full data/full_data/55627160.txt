55627160	dr breens practice  by william dean howells  1881     i  near the verge of a bold promontory stands the hotel and looks southeastward over a sweep of sea unbroken to the horizon behind it stretches the vast forest which after two hundred years has resumed the sterile coast wrested from it by the first pilgrims and has begun to efface the evidences of the inroad made in recent years by the bold speculator for whom jocelyns is named the young birches and spruces are breast high in the drives and avenues at jocelyns the low blackberry vines and the sweet fern cover the carefullygraded sidewalks and obscure the divisions of the lots the children of the boarders have found squawberries in the public square on the spot where the bandstand was to have been the notion of a seaside resort at this point was courageously conceived and to a certain extent it was generously realized except for its remoteness from the railroad a drawback which future enterprise might be expected to remedy in some way the place has many natural advantages the broad plateau is cooled by a breeze from the vast forests behind it which comes laden with health and freshness from the young pines the sea at its feet is warmed by the gulf stream to a temperature delicious for bathing there are certainly mosquitoes from the woods but there are mosquitoes everywhere and the report that people have been driven away by them is manifestly untrue for whoever comes to jocelyns remains the beach at the foot of the bluff is almost a mile at its curve and it is so smooth and hard that it glistens like polished marble when newly washed by the tide it is true that you reach it from the top by a flight of eighty steps but it was intended to have an elevator like those near the whirlpool at niagara in the mean time it is easy enough to go down and the ladies go down every day taking their novels or their needlework with them they have various notions of a bath some conceive that it is bathing to sit in the edge of the water and emit shrieks as the surge sweeps against them others run boldly in and after a moment of poignant hesitation jump up and down halfadozen times and run out yet others imagine it better to remain immersed to the chin for a given space looking toward the shore with lips tightly shut and the breath held but after the bath they are all of one mind they lay their shawls on the warm sand and spreading out their hair to dry they doze in the sun in such coils and masses as the unconscious figure lends itself to when they rise from their beds they sit in the shelter of the cliff and knit or sew while one of them reads aloud and another stands watch to announce the coming of the seals which frequent a reef near the shore in great numbers it has been said at rival points on the coast that the ladies linger there in despair of ever being able to remount to the hotel a young man who clambered along the shore from one of those points reported finding day after day the same young lady stretched out on the same shawl drying the same yellow hair who had apparently never gone upstairs since the season began but the recurrence of this phenomenon in this spot at the very moment when the young man came by might have been accounted for upon other theories jocelyns was so secluded that she could not have expected any one to find her there twice and if she had expected this she would not have permitted it probably he saw a different young lady each time  many of the same boarders come year after year and these tremble at the suggestion of a change for the better in jocelyns the landlord has always believed that jocelyns would come up some day when times got better he believes that the narrowgauge railroad from new leydenarrested on paper at the disastrous moment when the fortunes of jocelyns felt the general crashwill be pushed through yet and every summer he promises that next summer they are going to have a steamlaunch running twice a day from leyden harbor but at present his house is visited once a day by a barge as the new england coastfolks call the vehicle in which they convey city boarders to and from the station and the old frequenters of the place hope that the station will never be nearer jocelyns than at present some of them are rich enough to afford a sojourn at more fashionable resorts but most of them are not though they are often people of polite tastes and of aesthetic employments they talk with slight of the large wateringplaces and probably they would not like them though it is really economy that inspires their passion for jocelyns with most of them and they know of the splendid weariness of newport mostly by hearsay new arrivals are not favored but there are not often new arrivals at jocelyns the chief business of the barge is to bring fresh meat for the table and the gaunt bag which contains the mail for in the first flush of the enterprise the place was made a postoffice and the landlord is postmaster he has the help of the ladyboarders in his official duties  scattered about among the young birches there are several of those pine frames known as shells within easy walk of the hotel where their inmates board they are picturesque interiors and are on informal terms with the public as to many domestic details the lady of the house doing her back hair at her dressingroom glass is divided from her husband smoking at the parlor fireplace only by a partition of unlathed studding the arrest of development in these shells is characteristic of everything about the place none of the improvements invented since the hard times began have been added to jocelyns lawntennis is still unknown there but there is a croquetground before the hotel where the short tough grass is kept in tolerable order the wickets are pretty rusty and it is usually the children who play but toward the close of a certain afternoon a young lady was pushing the balls about there she seemed to be going over a game just played and trying to trace the cause of her failure she made bad shots and laughed at her blunders another young lady drooped languidly on a bench at the side of the croquetground and followed her movements with indifference  i dont see how you did it louise panted the player its astonishing how you beat me  the lady on the bench made as if to answer but ended by coughing hoarsely  oh dear child cried the first dropping her mallet and running to her you ought to have put on your shawl she lifted the knit shawl lying beside her on the bench and laid it across the others shoulders and drew it close about her neck  oh dont said the other it chokes me to be bundled up so tight she shrugged the shawl down to her shoulders with a pretty petulance if my chests protected thats all thats necessary but she made no motion to drape the outline which her neatlyfitted dress displayed and she did not move from her place or look up at her anxious friend  oh but dont sit here louise the latter pleaded lingering near her i was wrong to let you sit down at all after you had got heated  well grace i had to said she who was called louise i was so tired out im not going to take more cold i can always tell when i am ill put on the shawl in half a minute or else ill go in  im sure theres nothing to keep me out thats the worst of these lonely places my mind preys upon itself thats what dr nixon always said he said it was no use in air so long as my mind preyed upon itself he said that i ought to divert my mind all i could and keep it from preying upon itself that it was worth all the medicine in the world  thats perfectly true  then you ought nt to keep reminding me all the time that im sick thats what starts my mind to preying upon itself and when it gets going once i cant stop it i ought to treat myself just like a well person thats what the doctor said  the other stood looking at the speaker in frowning perplexity she was a seriousfaced girl and now when she frowned her black brows met sternly above her gray eyes but she controlled any impulse she had to severity and asked gently shall i send bella to you  oh no i cant make society out of a child the whole time ill just sit here till the barge comes in i suppose it will be as empty as a gourd as usual she added with a sick and weary negligence i dont even know where bella is shes run off somewhere  its quite time she should be looked up for tea ill wander out that way and look for her she indicated the wilderness generally  thanks said louise she now gratefully drew her shawl up over her shoulders and faced about on the bench so as to command an easy view of the arriving barge the other met it on her way to the place in the woods where the children usually played and found it as empty as her friend had foreboded but the driver stopped his horses and leaned out of the side of the wagon with a little package in his hand he read the superscription and then glanced consciously at the girl youre miss breen aint you  yes she said with ladylike sweetness and a sort of businesslike alertness  well suggested the driver this is for miss grace breen m d  for me thank you said the young lady im dr breen she put out her hand for the little package from the homoeopathic pharmacy in boston and the driver yielded it with a blush that reddened him to his hair well he said slowly staring at the handsome girl who did not visibly share his embarrassment they told me you was the one but i could nt seem to get it through me i thought it must be the old lady  my mother is mrs breen the young lady briefly explained and walked rapidly away leaving the driver stuck in the heavy sand of seaglimpse avenue  why get up he shouted to his horses goin to stay here all day he craned his neck round the side of the wagon for a sight of her well dumm f i dont wish i was sick steps along he mused watching the swirl and ripple of her skirt likei dunno what  with her face turned from him dr breen blushed too she was not yet so used to her quality of physician that she could coldly bear the confusion to which her being a doctor put men she laughed a little to herself at the helplessness of the driver confronted probably for the first time with a graduate of the new york homoeopathic school but she believed that she had reasons for taking herself seriously in every way and she had not entered upon this career without definite purposes when she was not yet out of her teens she had an unhappy love affair which was always darkly referred to as a disappointment by people who knew of it at the time though the particulars of the case do not directly concern this story it may be stated that the recreant lover afterwards married her dearest girlfriend whom he had first met in her company it was cruel enough and the hurt went deep but it neither crushed nor hardened her it benumbed her for a time she sank out of sight but when she returned to the knowledge of the world she showed no mark of the blow except what was thought a strange eccentricity in a girl such as she had been the world which had known herit was that of an inland new england cityheard of her definitely after several years as a student of medicine in new york those who had more of her intimacy understood that she had chosen this work with the intention of giving her life to it in the spirit in which other women enter convents or go out to heathen lands but probably this conception had its exaggerations what was certain was that she was rich enough to have no need of her profession as a means of support and that its study had cost her more than the usual suffering that it brings to persons of sensitive nerves some details were almost insuperably repugnant but in schooling herself to them she believed that she was preparing to encounter anything in the application of her science  her first intention had been to go back to her own town after her graduation and begin the practice of her profession among those who had always known her and whose scrutiny and criticism would be hardest to bear and therefore as she fancied the most useful to her in the formation of character but afterwards she relinquished her purpose in favor of a design which she thought would be more useful to others she planned going to one of the great factory towns and beginning practice there in company with an older physician among the children of the operatives pending the completion of this arrangement which was waiting upon the decision of the other lady she had come to jocelyns with her mother and with mrs maynard who had arrived from the west aimlessly sick and unfriended just as they were about leaving home there was no resource but to invite her with them and dr breen was finding her first patient in this unexpected guest she did not wholly regret the accident this too was useful work though not that she would have chosen but her mother after a fortnight openly repined and could not mention mrs maynard without some rebellious murmur she was an old lady who had once kept a very vigilant conscience for herself but after making her life unhappy with it for some threescore years she now applied it entirely to the exasperation and condemnation of others she especially devoted it to fretting a new england girls naturally morbid sense of duty in her daughter and keeping it in the irritation of perpetual selfquestion she had never actively opposed her studying medicine that ambition had harmonized very well with certain radical tendencies of her own and it was at least not marriage which she had found tolerable only in its modified form of widowhood but at every step after the decisive step was taken she was beset with misgivings lest grace was not fully alive to the grave responsibilities of her office which she accumulated upon the girl in proportion as she flung off all responsibilities of her own she was doubtless deceived by that show of calm which sometimes deceived grace herself who in tutoring her soul to bear what it had to bear mistook her tense effort for spiritual repose and scarcely realized through her tingling nerves the strain she was undergoing in spite of the bitter experience of her life she was still very ardent in her hopes of usefulness very scornful of distress or discomfort to herself and a little inclined to exact the heroism she was ready to show she had a childs severe morality and she had hardly learned to understand that there is much evil in the world that does not characterize the perpetrators she held herself as strictly to account for every word and deed as she held others and she had an almost passionate desire to meet the consequence of her errors till that was felt an intolerable doom hung over her she tried not to be impulsive that was criminal in one of her calling and she struggled for patience with an endeavor that was largely successful  as to the effect of her career outside of herself and of those whom her skill was to benefit she tried to think neither arrogantly nor meanly she would not entertain the vanity that she was serving what is called the cause of woman and she would not assume any duties or responsibilities toward it she thought men were as good as women at least one man had been no worse than one woman and it was in no representative or exemplary character that she had chosen her course at the same time that she held these sane opinions she believed that she had put away the hopes with the pleasures that might once have taken her as a young girl in regard to what had changed the current of her life she mentally asserted her mere nullity her absolute nonexistence the thought of it no longer rankled and that interest could never be hers again if it had not been so much like affectation and so counter to her strong aesthetic instinct she might have made her dress somehow significant of her complete abeyance in such matters but as it was she only studied simplicity and as we have seen from the impression of the bargedriver she did not finally escape distinction in dress and manner in fact she could not have escaped that effect if she would and it was one of the indomitable contradictions of her nature that she would not  when she came back to the croquetground leading the little girl by the hand she found mrs maynard no longer alone and no longer sad she was chatting and laughing with a slim young fellow whose gay blue eyes looked out of a sunburnt face and whose straw hat carried in his hand exposed a closely shaven head he wore a suit of gray flannel and mrs maynard explained that he was camping on the beach at birkmans cove and had come over in the steamer with her when she returned from europe she introduced him as mr libby and said oh bella you dirty little thing  mr libby bowed anxiously to grace and turned for refuge to the little girl hello bella hello said the child remember me the child put her left hand on that of grace holding her right and prettily pressed her head against the girls arm in bashful silence grace said some coldly civil words to the young man without looking at mrs maynard and passed on into the house  you dont mean thats your doctor he scarcely more than whispered  yes i do answered mrs maynard is nt she too lovely and shes just as good she used to stand up at school for me when all the girls were down on me because i was western and when i came east this time i just went right straight to her house i knew she could tell me exactly what to do and thats the reason im here i shall always recommend this air to anybody with lung difficulties its the greatest thing im almost another person oh you need nt look after her mr libby theres nothing flirtatious about grace said mrs maynard  the young man recovered himself from his absentminded stare in the direction grace had taken with a frank laugh so much the better for a fellow i should say  grace handed the little girl over to her nurse and went to her own room where she found her mother waiting to go down to tea  where is mrs maynard asked mrs breen  out on the croquetground answered the daughter  i should think it would be damp suggested mrs green  she will come in when the teabell rings she wouldnt come in now if i told her  well said the elder lady for a person who lets her doctor pay her board i think shes very independent  i wish you would nt speak of that mother said the girl  i cant help it grace its ridiculousthats what it is its ridiculous  i dont see anything ridiculous in it a physician need not charge anything unless he chooses or she and if i choose to make louise my guest here its quite the same as if she were my guest at home  i dont like you to have such a guest said mrs green i dont see what claim she has upon your hospitality  she has a double claim upon it grace answered with a flush she is in sickness and in trouble i dont see how she could have a better claim even if she were quite well i should consider the way she had been treated by her husband sufficient and i should want to do everything i could for her  i should want her to behave herself said mrs breen dryly  how behave herself what do you mean demanded grace with guilty heat  you know what i mean grace a woman in her position ought to be more circumspect than any other woman if she wants people to believe that her husband treated her badly  we ought nt to blame her for trying to forget her troubles its essential to her recovery for her to be as cheerful as she can be i know that shes impulsive and shes free in her manners with strangers but i suppose thats her westernism shes almost distracted she was crying half the night with her troubles and kept bella and me both awake  is bella with her now  no grace admitted janes getting her ready to go down with us louise is talking with a gentleman who came over on the steamer with her hes camping on the beach near here i didnt wait to hear particulars  when the nurse brought the little girl to their door mrs green took one hand and grace the other and they led her down to tea mrs maynard was already at table and told them all about meeting mr libby abroad  until the present time she and grace had not seen each other since they were at school together in southington where the girl used to hear so much to the disadvantage of her native section that she would hardly have owned to it if her accent had not found her out it would have been pleasanter to befriend another person but the little westerner suffered a veritable persecution and that was enough to make grace her friend shortly after she returned home from school she married in that casual and tentative fashion in which so many marriages seem made grace had heard of her as travelling in europe with her husband from whom she was now separated she reported that he had known mr libby in his bachelor days and that mr libby had travelled with them mr maynard appeared to have left to mr libby the arrangement of his wifes pleasures the supervision of her shopping and the direction of their common journeys and sojourns and it seemed to have been indifferent to him whether his friend was smoking and telling stories with him or going with his wife to the opera or upon such excursions as he had no taste for she gave the details of the triangular intimacy with a frank unconsciousness and after nine oclock she returned from a moonlight walk on the beach with mr libby  grace sat waiting for her at the little ones bedside for bella had been afraid to go to sleep alone  how good you are cried louise in a grateful undertone as she came in she kissed grace and choked down a cough with her hand over her mouth  louise said grace sternly this is shameful you forget that you are married and ill too  oh im ever so much better tonight the airs just as dry and you neednt mind mr libby hes such an old friend besides im sure to gain the case  no matter even as a divorced woman you oughtnt to go on in this way  well i would nt with every one but its quite different with mr libby and besides i have to keep my mind from preying on itself somehow     ii  mrs maynard sat in the sun on the seawardlooking piazza of the hotel and coughed in the warm air she told the ladies as they came out from breakfast that she was ever so much better generally but that she seemed to have more of that tickling in her throat each of them advised her for good and suggested this specific and that and they all asked her what miss breen was doing for her cough mrs maynard replied between the paroxysms that she did not know it was some kind of powders then they said they would think she would want to try something active even those among them who were homoeopathists insinuated a fine distrust of a physician of their own sex oh its nothing serious mrs maynard explained its just bronchial the air will do me more good than anything im keeping out in it all i can  after they were gone a queer gaunt man came and glanced from the doorway at her he had one eye in unnatural fixity and the other set at that abnormal slant which is said to qualify the owner for looking round a corner before he gets to it a droll twist of his mouth seemed partly physical but there is no doubt that he had often a humorous intention it was barlow the manofallwork who killed and plucked the poultry peeled the potatoes and picked the peas pulled the sweetcorn and the tomatoes kindled the kitchen fire harnessed the old splayfooted maresafe for ladies and children and intolerable for all others which formed the entire stud of the jocelyn house stablesdug the clams rowed and sailed the boat looked after the bathhouses and came in contact with the guests at so many points that he was on easy terms with them all this ease tended to an intimacy which he was himself powerless to repress and which from time to time required their intervention he now wore a simple costume of shirt and trousers the latter terminated by a pair of broken shoes and sustained by what he called a single gallows his broadbrimmed straw hat scooped down upon his shoulders behind and in front added to his congenital difficulty of getting people in focus how do you do this morning mrs maynard he said  oh im firstrate mr barlow what sort of day do you think its going to be for a sail  barlow came out to the edge of the piazza and looked at the sea and sky firstrate fogs most burnt away now you dont often see a fog at jocelyns after ten oclock in the mornin  he looked for approval to mrs maynard who said thats so the airs just splendid it s doing everything for me  its these pine woods back o here every breath on em does ye good its the balsam in it d you ever try he asked stretching his hand as far up the piazzapost as he could and swinging into a conversational postured you ever try whiskeygood odd bourbon whiskeywith whitepine chips in it  mrs maynard looked up with interest but shaking her head coughed for no  well i should like to have you try that  what does it do she gasped when she could get her breath  well its soothin t the cough and it builds ye up every ways why my brother continued the factotum he died of consumption when i was a boyreglar old new england consumption dont hardly ever hear of it any more round here well i dont suppose theres been a case of reglar old new england consumptionwell not the old new england kindsince these woods growed up he used to take whiskey with whitepine chips in it and i can remember hearin em say that it done him more good than all the doctors stuff hed been out to demarary and everywheres and he come home in the last stages and took up with this whiskey with whitepine chips in it well its just like this i presume its the balsam in the chips it dont make any difference how you git the balsam into your system so s t you git it there i should like to have you try whiskey with whitepine chips in it  he looked convincingly at mrs maynard who said she should like to try it its just bronchial with me you know but i should like to try it i know it would be soothing and ive always heard that whiskey was the very thing to build you up but she added lapsing from this vision of recovery i couldnt take it unless grace said so shed be sure to find it out  why look here said barlow as far forth as that goes you could keep the bottle in my room not but what i believe in going by your doctors directions it dont matter who your doctor is i aint sayin nothin against miss breen you understand  oh no cried mrs maynard  i never see much nicer ladies than her and her mother in the house but you just tell her about the whiskey with the whitepine chips in it maybe she never heard of it well she haint had a great deal of experience yet  no said mrs maynard and i think shell be glad to hear of it you may be sure ill tell her mr barlow grace is everything for the balsamic properties of the air down here thats what she said and as you say it doesnt matter how you get the balsam into your system so you get it there  no said the factotum in a tone of misgiving as if the repetition of the words presented the theory in a new light to him  what i think is and what im always telling grace pursued mrs maynard in that confidential spirit in which she helplessly spoke of her friends by their first names to every one that if i could once get my digestion all right then the cough would stop of itself the doctor saiddr nixon that isthat it was more than half the digestion any way but just as soon as i eat anythingor if i overeat a littlethen that tickling in my throat begins and then i commence coughing and im back just where i was its the digestion i oughtnt to have eaten that mince pie yesterday  no admitted barlow then he said in indirect defence of the kitchen i think you had nt ought to be out in the night airwell not a great deal  well i dont suppose it does do me much good mrs maynard said turning her eyes seaward  barlow let his hand drop from the piazza post and slouched indoors but he came out again as if pricked by conscience to return  after all you know it did nt cure him  what cure him asked mrs maynard  the whiskey with the whitepine chips in it  cure who  my brother  oh oh yes but mines only bronchial i think it might do me good i shall tell grace about it  barlow looked troubled as if his success in the suggestion of this remedy were not finally a pleasure but as mrs maynard kept her eyes persistently turned from him and was evidently tired he had nothing for it but to go indoors again he met grace and made way for her on the threshold to pass out  as she joined mrs maynard well grace said the latter i do believe you are right i have taken some more cold but that shows that it does nt get worse of itself and i think we ought to be encouraged by that im going to be more careful of the night air after this  i dont think the night air was the worst thing about it louise said grace bluntly  you mean the damp from the sand i put on my rubbers  i dont mean the damp sand said grace beginning to pull over some sewing which she had in her lap and looking down at it  mrs maynard watched her a while in expectation that she would say more but she did not speak ohwell she was forced to continue herself if youre going to go on with that  the question is said grace getting the thread she wanted whether you are going on with it  why i cant see any possible harm in it protested mrs maynard i suppose you dont exactly like my going with mr libby and i know that under some circumstances it would nt be quite the thing but did nt i tell you last night how he lived with us in europe and when we were all coming over on the steamer together mr libby and mr maynard were together the whole time smoking and telling stories they were the greatest friends why it isnt as if he was a stranger or an enemy of mr maynards  grace dropped her sewing into her lap really louise youre incredible she looked sternly at the invalid but broke into a laugh on which mrs maynard waited with a puzzled face as grace said nothing more she helplessly resumed  we did nt expect to go down the cliff when he first called in the evening but he said he would help me up again andhe did nicely i was nt exhausted a bit and how i took more cold i cant understand i was wrapped up warmly i think i took the cold when i was sitting there after our game of croquet with my shawl off dont you think so she wheedled  perhaps said grace  he did nothing but talk about you grace said mrs maynard with a sly look at the other hes awfully afraid of you and he kept asking about you  louise said the other gravely ignoring these facts i never undertook the care of you socially and i object very much to lecturing you you are nearly as old as i am and you have had a great deal more experience of life than i have mrs maynard sighed deeply in assent but it does nt seem to have taught you that if you will provoke people to talk of you you must expect criticism one after another youve told nearly every woman in the house your affairs and they have all sympathized with you and pitied you i shall have to be plain and tell you that i cant have them sneering and laughing at any one who is my guest i cant let you defy public opinion here  why grace said mrs maynard buoyed above offence at her friends words by her consciousness of the point she was about to make you defy public opinion yourself a good deal more than i do every minute  i how do i defy it demanded grace indignantly  by being a doctor  grace opened her lips to speak but she was not a ready person and she felt the thrust before she could say anything mrs maynard went on there isnt one of them that does nt think youre much more scandalous than if you were the greatest flirt alive but i dont mind them and why should you  the serious girl whom she addressed was in that helpless subjection to the truth in which so many new england women pass their lives she could not deny the truth which lurked in the exaggeration of these words and it unnerved her as the fact that she was doing what the vast majority of women considered unwomanly always unnerved her when she suffered herself to think of it you are right louise she said meekly and sadly they think as well of you as they do of me  yes thats just what i said cried mrs maynard glad of her successful argument  but however disabled her friend resumed the only safe way for you is to take the ground that so long as you wear your husbands name you must honor it no matter how cruel and indifferent to you he has been  yes assented mrs maynard ruefully of course  i mean that you must nt even have the appearance of liking admiration or what you call attentions its wicked  i suppose so murmured the culprit  you have been brought up to have such different ideas of divorce from what i have continued grace that i dont feel as if i had any right to advise you about what you are to do after you gain your suit  i shall not want to get married again for one while i know that much mrs maynard interpolated selfrighteously  but till you do gain it you ought not to regard it as emancipating you in the slightest degree  no came in sad assent from the victim of the laws delays  and i want you to promise me that you wont go walking with mr libby any more and that you wont even see him alone after this  why but grace cried mrs maynard as much in amazement as in annoyance you dont seem to understand have nt i told you he was a friend of the family hes quite as much mr maynards friend as he is mine im sure she added if i asked mr libby i should never think of getting divorced hes all for george and its as much as i can do to put up with him  no matter that does nt alter the appearance to people here i dont wish you to go with him alone any more  well grace i wont said mrs maynard earnestly i wont indeed and that makes me think he wanted you to go along this morning  to go along wanted mewhat are you talking about  why i suppose thats his boat out there now mrs maynard pointed to a little craft just coming to anchor inside the reef he said he wanted me to take a sail with him this morning and he said he would come up and ask you too i do hope youll go grace its just as calm and he always has a man with him to help sail the boat so there is nt the least danger grace looked at her in silent sorrow and mrs maynard went on with sympathetic seriousness oh theres one thing i want to ask you about grace i dont like to have any concealments from you grace did not speak but she permitted mrs maynard to proceed barlow recommended it and hes lived here a great while his brother took it and he had the regular old new england consumption i thought i shouldnt like to try it without your knowing it  try it what are you talking about louise  why whiskey with whitepine chips in it  grace rose and moved towards the door with the things dropping from her lap one of these was a spool that rolled down the steps and out upon the sandy road she turned to pursue it and recovered it at the cost of dropping her scissors and thimble out of opposite sides of her skirt which she had gathered up apronwise to hold her work when she rose from the complicated difficulty in which mrs maynard had amiably lent her aid she confronted mr libby who was coming towards them from the cliff she gave him a stiff nod and attempted to move away but in turning round and about she had spun herself into the folds of a stout linen thread escaping from its spool these gyves not only bound her skirts but involved her feet in an extraordinary mesh which tightened at the first step and brought her to a standstill  mrs maynard began to laugh and cough as mr libby came to her friends help he got the spool in his hand and walked around her in the endeavor to free her but in vain she extended him the scissors with the stern passivity of a fate cut it she commanded and mr libby knelt before her and obeyed thanks she said taking back the scissors and now she sat down again and began deliberately to put up her work in her handkerchief  i ll go out and get my things i wont be gone half a minute mr libby said mrs maynard with her first breath as she vanished indoors  mr libby leaned against the post lately occupied by the factotum in his talk with mrs maynard and looked down at grace as she bent over her work if he wished to speak to her and was wavering as to the appropriate style of address for a handsome girl who was at once a young lady and a physician she spared him the agony of a decision by looking up at him suddenly  i hope he faltered that you feel like a sail this morning did mrs maynard  i shall have to excuse myself answered grace with a conscience against saying she was sorry i am a very bad sailor  well so am i for that matter said mr libby but its smooth as a pond today  grace made no direct response and he grew visibly uncomfortable under the cold abstraction of the gaze with which she seemed to look through him mrs maynard tells me you came over with her from europe  oh yes cried the young man the light of pleasant recollection kindling in his gay eyes we had a good time maynard was along hes a firstrate fellow i wish he were here  yes said grace i wish so too she did not know what to make of this frankness of the young mans and she did not know whether to consider him very depraved or very innocent in her question she continued to stare at him without being aware of the embarrassment to which she was putting him  i heard of mrs maynards being here and i thought i should find him too i came over yesterday to get him to go into the woods with us  grace decided that this was mere effrontery it is a pity that he is not here she said and though it ought to have been possible for her to go on and rebuke the young fellow for bestowing upon mrs maynard the comradeship intended for her husband it was not so she could only look severely at him and trust that he might conceive the intention which she could not express she rebelled against the convention and against her own weakness which would not let her boldly interfere in what she believed a wrong she had defied society in the mass but here with this man whom as an atom of the mass she would have despised she was powerless  have you ever seen him libby asked perhaps clinging to maynard because he was a topic of conversation in default of which there might be nothing to say  no answered grace  he s funny hes got lots of that western humor and he tells a story better than any man i ever saw there was one story of his  i have no sense of humor interrupted grace impatiently mr libby she broke out i m sorry that youve asked mrs maynard to take a sail with you the sea airshe reddened with the shame of not being able to proceed without this wretched subterfugewont do her any good  then said the young man you must nt let her go  i dont choose to forbid her grace began  i beg your pardon he broke in ill be back in a moment  he turned and ran to the edge of the cliff over which he vanished and he did not reappear till mrs maynard had rejoined grace on the piazza  i hope you wont mind its being a little rough mrs maynard he said breathing quickly adams thinks were going to have it pretty fresh before we get back  indeed i dont want to go then cried mrs maynard in petulant disappointment letting her wraps fall upon a chair  mr libby looked at grace who haughtily rejected a part in the conspiracy i wish you to go louise she declared indignantly i will take the risk of all the harm that comes to you from the bad weather she picked up the shawls and handed them to mr libby on whom her eyes blazed their contempt and wonder it cost a great deal of persuasion and insistence now to make mrs maynard go and he left all this to grace not uttering a word till he gave mrs maynard his hand to help her down the steps then he said well i wonder what miss breen does want  i m sure i dont know said the other at first she did nt want me to go this morning and now she makes me i do hope it is nt going to be a storm  i dont believe it is a little fresh perhaps i thought you might be seasick  dont you remember im never seasick thats one of the worst signs  oh yes  if i could be thoroughly seasick once it would be the best thing i could do  is she capricious asked mr libby  grace cried mrs maynard releasing her hand halfway down the steps in order to enjoy her astonishment without limitation of any sort grace capricious  yes said mr libby thats what i thought better take my hand again and he secured that of mrs maynard who continued her descent i suppose i dont understand her exactly perhaps she did nt like my not calling her doctor i did nt call her anything i suppose she thought i was dodging it i was i should have had to call her miss breen if i called her anything  she wouldnt have cared she is nt a doctor for the name of it  i suppose you think its a pity he asked  what  her being a doctor  ill tell her you say so  no dont but dont you  well i would nt want to be one said mrs mayward candidly  i suppose its all right if she does it from a sense of duty as you say he suggested  oh yes shes all right and shes just as much of a girl as anybody though she dont know it mrs maynard added astutely why would nt she come with us were you afraid to ask her  she said she was nt a good sailor perhaps she thought we were too young she must be older than you  yes and you too cried mrs maynard with goodnatured derision  she doesnt look old returned mr libby  shes twentyeight how old are you  i promised the censustaker not to tell till his report came out  what is the color of her hair  brown  and her eyes  i dont know  you had better look out mr libby said mrs maynard putting her foot on the ground at last  they walked across the beach to where his dory lay and grace saw him pulling out to the sail boat before she went in from the piazza then she went to her mothers room the elderly lady was keeping indoors upon a theory that the dew was on and that it was not wholesome to go out till it was off she asked according to her habit when she met her daughter alone where is mrs maynard  why do you always ask that mother retorted grace with her growing irritation in regard to her patient intensified by the recent interview i cant be with her the whole time  i wish you could said mrs breen with noncommittal suggestion  grace could not keep herself from demanding why as her mother expected though she knew why too well  because she wouldnt be in mischief then returned mrs breen  shes in mischief now cried the girl vehemently and its my fault i did it i sent her off to sail with that ridiculous mr libby  why asked mrs breen in her turn with unbroken tranquillity  because i am a fool and i couldnt help him lie out of his engagement with her  did nt he want to go  i dont know yes they both wanted me to go with them simpletons and while she had gone upstairs for her wraps i managed to make him understand that i did nt wish her to go either and he ran down to his boat and came back with a story about its going to be rough and looked at me perfectly delighted as if i should be pleased of course then i made him take her  and is nt it going to be rough asked mrs green  why mother the seas like glass  mrs breen turned the subject you would have done better grace to begin as you had planned your going to fall river and beginning practice there among those factory children was the only thing that i ever entirely liked in your taking up medicine there was sense in that you had studied specially for it you could have done good there  oh yes sighed the girl i know but what was i to do when she came to us sick and poor i couldnt turn my back on her especially after always befriending her as i used to at school and getting her to depend on me  i dont see how you ever liked her said mrs breen  i never did like her i pitied her i always thought her a poor flimsy little thing but that ought nt to make any difference if she was in trouble  no mrs breen conceded and in compensation grace admitted something more on her side shes worse than she used to besillier i dont suppose she has a wrong thought but shes as light as foam  oh it is nt the wicked people who do the harm said mrs green  i was sure that this air would be everything for her and so it would with any ordinary case but a child would take better care of itself i have to watch her every minute like a child and i never know what she will do next  yes its a burden said mrs breen with a sympathy which she had not expressed before and youre a good girl grace she added in very unwonted recognition  the grateful tears stole into the daughters eyes but she kept a firm face even after they began to follow one another down her cheeks and if louise had nt come you know mother that i was anxious to have some older person with me when i went to fall river i was glad to have this respite it gives me a chance to think i felt a little timid about beginning alone  a man would nt mrs breen remarked  no i am not a man i have accepted that with all the rest i dont rebel against being a woman if i had been a man i should nt have studied medicine you know that i wished to be a physician because i was a woman and becausebecausei had failed whereother womens hopes are she said it out firmly and her mother softened to her in proportion to the girls own strength i might have been just a nurse you know i should have been willing to be that but i thought i could be something more but its no use talking she added after an interval in which her mother rocked to and fro with a gentle motion that searched the joints of her chair and brought out its most plaintive squeak in pathetic iteration and watched grace as she sat looking seaward through the open window i think its rather hard mother that you should be always talking as if i wished to take my calling mannishly all that i intend is not to take it womanishly but as for not being a woman about it or about anything thats simply impossible a woman is reminded of her insufficiency to herself every hour of the day and its always a man that comes to her help i dropped some things out of my lap down there and by the time i had gathered them up i was wound round and round with linen thread so that i could nt move a step and mr libby cut me loose i could have done it myself but it seemed right and natural that he should do it i dare say he plumed himself upon his service to methat would be natural too i have things enough to keep me meek mother  she did not look round at mrs breen who said i think you are morbid about it  yes and i have the satisfaction of knowing that whatever people think of louises giddiness im a great deal more scandalous to them than she is simply because i wish to do some good in the world in a way that women have nt done it usually  now you are morbid  oh yes talk about men being obstacles its other women there isnt a woman in the house that would nt sooner trust herself in the hands of the stupidest boy that got his diploma with me than she would in mine louise knows it and she feels that she has a claim upon me in being my patient and i ve no influence with her about her conduct because she understands perfectly well that they all consider me much worse she prides herself on doing me justice she patronizes me she tells me that im just as nice as if i hadnt been through all that grace rose and a laugh which was half a sob broke from her  mrs breen could not feel the humor of the predicament she puts you in a false position  i must go and see where that poor little wretch of a child is said grace going out of the room she returned in an hour and asked her mother for the arnica bella has had a bump she explained  why have you been all this time looking for her  no i couldnt find her and ive been reading barlow has just brought her in he could find her she fell out of a tree and shes frightfully bruised  she was making search on a closet shelf as she talked when she reappeared with the bottle in her hand her mother asked is nt it very hot and close  very said grace  i should certainly think they would perish said mrs breen hazarding the pronoun with a womans confidence that her interlocutor would apply it correctly  when grace had seen bella properly bathed and brownpapered and in the way to forgetfulness of her wounds in sleep she came down to the piazza and stood looking out to sea the ladies appeared one by one over the edge of the cliff and came up languidly stringing their shawls after them or clasping their novels to their bosoms  there isnt a breath down there they said one after another the last one added barlow says its the hottest day hes ever seen here  in a minute barlow himself appeared at the head of the steps with the ladies remaining wraps and confirmed their report in person i tell you he said wiping his forehead its a ripper  it must be an awful day in town said one of the ladies fanning herself with a newspaper  is that todays advertiser mrs alger asked another  oh dear no yesterdays we shant have todays till this afternoon it shows what a new arrival you are mrs scottyour asking  to be sure but its such a comfort being where you can see the advertiser the same morning i always look at the weather report the first thing i like to know what the weather is going to be  you cant at jocelyns you can only know what its been  well barlow interposed jealous for jocelyns you can most alays tell by the look o things  yes said one of the ladies but id rather trust the weather report its wonderful how it comes true i dont think there s anything that you miss more in europe than our american weather report  im sure you miss the oysters said another  yes the first admitted you do miss the oysters it was the last of the r months when we landed in new york and do you know what we did the first thing we drove to fulton market and had one of those fulton market broils my husband said we should have had it if it had been july he used to dream of the american oysters when we were in europe gentlemen are so fond of them  barlow from scanning the heavens turned round and faced the company which had drooped in several attitudes of exhaustion on the benching of the piazza well i can most alays tell about jocelyns as good as the weather report i told mrs maynard here this mornin that the fog was goin to burn off  burn off cried mrs alger i should think it had the other ladies laughed  and youll see added barlow that the wind ll change at noon and well have it cooler  if its as hot on the water as it is here said mrs scott i should think those people would get a sunstroke  well so should i mrs scott cordially exclaimed a little fat lady as if here at last were an opinion in which all might rejoice to sympathize  its never so hot on the water mrs merritt said mrs alger with the instructiveness of an old habitude  well not at jocelyns suggested barlow mrs alger stopped fanning herself with her newspaper and looked at him upon her motion the other ladies looked at barlow doubtless he felt that his social acceptability had ceased with his immediate usefulness but he appeared resolved to carry it off easily well he said i suppose i must go and pick my peas  no one said anything to this when the factotum had disappeared round the corner of the house mrs alger turned her head aside and glanced downward with an air of fatigue in this manner barlow was dismissed from the ladies minds  i presume said young mrs scott with a deferential glance at grace that the sun is good for a person with lungdifficulty  grace silently refused to consider herself appealed to and mrs merritt said better than the moon i should think  some of the others tittered but grace looked up at mrs merritt and said i dont think mrs maynards case is so bad that she need be afraid of either  oh i am so glad to hear it replied the other she looked round but was unable to form a party by twos or threes they might have liked to take mrs maynard to pieces but no one cares to make unkind remarks before a whole company of people some of the ladies even began to say pleasant things about mr libby as if he were graces friend  i always like to see these fair men when they get tanned said mrs alger their blue eyes look so very blue and the backs of their necksjust like my boys  do you admire such a very fightingclip as mr libby has on asked mrs scott  it must be nice for summer returned the elder lady  yes it certainly must admitted the younger  really said another i wish i could go in the fightingclip one does nt know what to do with ones hair at the seaside its always in the way  your hair would be a public loss mrs frost said mrs alger the others looked at her hair as if they had seen it now for the first time  oh i dont think so said mrs frost in a sort of flattered coo  oh dont have it cut off pleaded a young girl coming up and taking the beautiful mane hanging loose after the bath into her hand mrs frost put her arm round the girls waist and pulled her down against her shoulder upon reflection she also kissed her  through a superstition handed down from mother to daughter that it is uncivil and even unkind not to keep saying something they went on talking vapidities where the same number of men equally vacuous would have remained silent and some of them complained that the nervous strain of conversation took away all the good their bath had done them miss gleason who did not bathe was also not a talker she kept a brighteyed reticence but was apt to break out in rather enigmatical flashes which resolved the matter in hand into an abstraction and left the others with the feeling that she was a person of advanced ideas but that while rejecting historical christianity she believed in a god of love this deity was said upon closer analysis to have proved to be a god of sentiment and miss gleason was herself a heroworshiper or more strictly speaking a heroineworshiper at present dr breen was her cult and she was apt to lie in wait for her idol to beam upon it with her suggestive eyes and evidently to expect it to say or do something remarkable but not to suffer anything like disillusion or disappointment in any event she would sometimes offer it suddenly a muddled depth of sympathy in such phrases as too bad or i dont see how you keepup and darkly insinuate that she appreciated all that grace was doing she seemed to rejoice in keeping herself at a respectful distance to which she breathlessly retired as she did now after waylaying her at the top of the stairs and confidentially darting at her the words im so glad you dont like scandal     iii  after dinner the ladies tried to get a nap but such of them as reappeared on the piazza later agreed that it was perfectly useless they tested every corner for a breeze but the wind had fallen dead and the vast sweep of sea seemed to smoulder under the sun this is what mr barlow calls having it cooler said mrs alger  there are some clouds that look like thunderheads in the west said mrs frost returning from an excursion to the part of the piazza commanding that quarter  oh it wont rain today mrs alger decided  i thought there was always a breeze at jocelyns mrs scott observed in the critical spirit of a recent arrival  there always is the other explained except the first week youre here  a little breath scarcely more than a sentiment of breeze made itself felt i do believe the wind has changed said mrs frost its east the others owned one by one that it was so and she enjoyed the merit of a discoverer but her discovery was rapidly superseded the clouds mounted in the west and there came a time when the ladies disputed whether they had heard thunder or not a faction contended for the bowling alley and another faction held for a wagon passing over the bridge just before you reached jocelyns but those who were faithful to the theory of thunder carried the day by a sudden crash that broke over the forest and dying slowly away among the low hills left them deeply silent  some one said mrs alger ought to go for those children on this it appeared that there were two minds as to where the children werewhether on the beach or in the woods  was nt that thunder grace asked mrs breen with the accent by which she implicated her daughter in whatever happened  yes said grace from where she sat at her window looking seaward and waiting tremulously for her mothers next question  where is mrs maynard  she is nt back yet  then said mrs breen he really did expect rough weather  he must returned grace in a guilty whisper  its a pity remarked her mother that you made them go  yes she rose and stretching herself far out of the window searched the inexorable expanse of sea it had already darkened at the verge and the sails of some fishingcraft flecked a livid wall with their white but there was no small boat in sight  if anything happened to them her mother continued i should feel terribly for you  i should feel terribly for myself grace responded with her eyes still seaward  where do you think they went  i did nt ask said the girl i wouldnt she added in devotion to the whole truth  well it is all of the same piece said mrs breen grace did not ask what the piece was she remained staring at the dark wall across the sea and spiritually confronting her own responsibility no atom of which she rejected she held herself in every way responsiblefor doubting that poor young fellows word and then for forcing that reluctant creature to go with him and forbidding by her fierce insistence any attempt of his at explanation she condemned herself to perpetual remorse with even greater zeal than her mother would have sentenced her and she would not permit herself any respite when a little sail which she knew for theirs blew round the point it seemed to fly along just on the hither side of that mural darkness skilfully tacking to reach the end of thereef before the wall pushed it on the rocks suddenly the long low stretch of the reef broke into white foam and then passed from sight under the black wall against which the little sail still flickered the girl fetched a long silent breath they were inside the reef in comparatively smooth water and to her ignorance they were safe but the rain would be coming in another moment and mrs maynard would be drenched and grace would be to blame for her death she ran to the closet and pulled down her mothers indiarubber cloak and her own and fled outofdoors to be ready on the beach with the wrap against their landing she met the other ladies on the stairs and in the hall and they clamored at her but she glided through them like something in a dream and then she heard a shouting in her ear and felt herself caught and held up against the wind  where in land be you goin miss breen  barlow in a long yellow oilskin coat and souwester hat kept pushing her forward to the edge of the cliff as he asked  im going down to meet them she screamed  well i hope you will meet em but i guess you better go back to the house hey wunt well come along then if they aint past doctorin by the time they git ashore pretty well wrapped up any way he roared and she perceived that she had put on her waterproof and drawn the hood over her head  those steps to the beach had made her giddy when she descended with leisure for such dismay but now with the tempest flattening her against the staircase and her gossamer clutching and clinging to every surface and again twisting itself about her limbs she clambered down as swiftly and recklessly as barlow himself and followed over the beach beside the men who were pulling a boat down the sand at a run  let me get in she screamed i wish to go with you  take hold of the girl barlow shouted one of the men shes crazy  he tumbled himself with four others into the boat and they all struck out together through the froth and swirl of the waves she tried to free herself from barlow so as to fling the waterproof into the boat take this then shell be soaked through  barlow broke into a grim laugh she wont need it except for a windinsheet he roared dont you see the boats drivin right on t the sand shell be kindlin wood in a minute  but theyre inside the reef they can come to anchor she shrieked in reply he answered her with a despairing grin and a shake of the head they cant what has your boat gone out for then  to pick em up out the sea but theyll never git em alive look how she slaps her boom int the water well he does know how to handle a boat  it was libby at the helm as she could dimly see but what it was in his management that moved barlows praise she could not divine the boat seemed to be aimed for the shore and to be rushing head on upon the beach her broad sail was blown straight out over her bow and flapped there like a banner while the heavy boom hammered the water as she rose and fell a jagged line of red seamed the breast of the dark wall behind a rending crash came and as if fired upon the boat flung up her sail as a wild fowl flings up its wing when shot and lay tossing keel up on the top of the waves it all looked scarcely a stones cast away though it was vastly farther a figure was seen to drag itself up out of the sea and fall over into the boat hovering and pitching in the surrounding welter and struggling to get at two other figures clinging to the wreck suddenly the men in the boat pulled away and grace uttered a cry of despair and reproach why theyre leaving it theyre leaving it  dont expect em to tow the wreck ashore in this weather do ye shouted barlow theyve got the folks all safe enough i tell ye i see em he cried at a wild look of doubt in her eyes run to the house there and get everything in applepie order theres goin to be a chance for some of your doctorn now if ye know how to fetch folks to  it was the little house on the beach which the children were always prying and peering into trying the lock and wondering what the boat was like which grace had seen launched now the door yielded to her and within she found a fire kindled in the stove blankets laid in order and flasks of brandy in readiness in the cupboard she put the blankets to heat for instant use and prepared for the work of resuscitation when she could turn from them to the door she met there a procession that approached with difficulty heads down and hustled by the furious blast through which the rain now hissed and shot barlow and one of the boats crew were carrying mrs maynard and bringing up the rear of the huddling oilskins and souwesters came libby soaked and dripping as he walked his eyes and graces encountered with a mutual avoidance but whatever was their sense of blame their victim had no reproaches to make herself she was not in need of restoration she was perfectly alive and apparently stimulated by her escape from deadly peril to a vivid conception of the wrong that had been done her if the adventure had passed off prosperously she was the sort of woman to have owned to her friend that she ought not to have thought of going but the event had obliterated these scruples and she realized herself as a hapless creature who had been thrust on to dangers from which she would have shrunk well grace she began with a voice and look before which the other quailed i hope you are satisfied all the time i was clinging to that wretched boat i was wondering how you would feel yes my last thoughts were of you i pitied you i did nt see how you could ever have peace again  hold on mrs maynard cried libby theres no time for that now what had best be done miss green had nt she better be got up to the house  yes by all means answered grace  you might as well let me die here mrs maynard protested as grace wrapped the blankets round her dripping dress i m as wet as i can be now  libby began to laugh at these inconsequences to which he was probably well used you would nt have time to die here and we want to give this hydropathic treatment a fair trial youve tried the douche and now youre to have the pack he summoned two of the boatmen who had been considerately dripping outside in order to leave the interior to the shipwrecked company and they lifted mrs maynard finally wrapped in graces indiarubber cloak and looking like some sort of strange huge chrysalis and carried her out into the storm and up the steps  grace followed last with mr libby very heavyhearted and reckless she had not only that sore selfaccusal but the degradation of the affair its grotesqueness its spiritual squalor its utter gracelessness its entire want of dignity were bitter as death in her proud soul it was not in this shameful guise that she had foreseen the good she was to do and it had all come through her own wilfulness and selfrighteousness the tears could mix unseen with the rain that drenched her face but they blinded her and halfway up the steps she stumbled on her skirt and would have fallen if the young man had not caught her after that from time to time he put his arm about her and stayed her against the gusts  before they reached the top he said miss breen im awfully sorry for all this mrs maynard will be ashamed of what she said confound it if maynard were only here  why should she be ashamed demanded grace if she had been drowned i should have murdered her and im responsible if anything happens to heri am to blame she escaped from him and ran into the house he slunk round the piazza to the kitchen door under the eyes of the ladies watching at the parlor windows  i wonder he let the others carry her up said miss gleason of course he will marry her nowwhen she gets her divorce she spoke of mrs maynard whom her universal toleration not only included in the mercy which the opinions of the other ladies denied her but round whom her romance cast a halo of pretty possibilities as innocently sentimental as the hopes of a young girl     iv  the next morning grace was sitting beside her patient with whom she had spent the night it was possibly mrs maynards spiritual toughness which availed her for she did not seem much the worse for her adventure she had a little fever and she was slightly hoarser but she had died none of the deaths that she projected during the watches of the night and for which she had chastened the spirit of her physician by the repeated assurance that she forgave her everything and george maynard everything and hoped that they would be good to her poor little bella she had the child brought from its crib to her own bed and moaned over it but with the return of day and the duties of life she appeared to feel that she had carried her forgiveness far enough and was again remembering her injuries against grace as she lay in her morning gown on the lounge which had been brought in for her from the parlor  yes grace i shall always say if i had died and i may die yetthat i did not wish to go out with mr libby and that i went purely to please you you forced me to go i cant understand why you did it for i dont suppose you wanted to kill us whatever you did  grace could not lift her head she bowed it over the little girl whom she had on her knee and who was playing with the pin at her throat in apparent unconsciousness of all that was said but she had really followed it with glimpses of intelligence as children do and now at this negative accusal she lifted her hand and suddenly struck grace a stinging blow on the cheek  mrs maynard sprang from her lounge why bella you worthless little wretch she caught her from graces knee and shook her violently then casting the culprit from her at random she flung herself down again in a fit of coughing while the child fled to grace for consolation and wildly sobbing buried her face in the lap of her injured friend  i dont know what i shall do about that child cried mrs maynard she has george maynards temper right over again i feel dreadfully grace  oh never mind it said grace fondling the child and half addressing it i suppose bella thought i had been unkind to her mother  thats just it exclaimed louise when youve been kindness itself dont i owe everything to you i should nt be alive at this moment if it were not for your treatment oh grace she began to cough again the paroxysm increased in vehemence she caught her handkerchief from her lips it was spotted with blood she sprang to her feet and regarded it with impersonal sternness now she said i am sick and i want a doctor  a doctor grace meekly echoed  yes i cant be trifled with any longer i want a man doctor  grace had looked at the handkerchief very well she said with coldness i shall not stand in your way of calling another physician but if it will console you i can tell you that the blood on your handkerchief means nothing worth speaking of whom shall i send for she asked turning to go out of the roam i wish to be your friend still and i will do anything i can to help you  oh grace breen is that the way you talk to me whimpered mrs maynard you know that i dont mean to give you up im not a stone i have some feeling i did nt intend to dismiss you but i thought perhaps you would like to have a consultation about it i should think it was time to have a consultation should nt you of course im not alarmed but i know its getting serious and im afraid that your medicine is nt active enough thats it its perfectly good medicine but it is nt active theyve all been saying that i ought to have something active why not try the whiskey with the whitepine chips in it im sure its indicated in her long course of medication she had picked up certain professional phrases which she used with amusing seriousness it would be active at any rate  grace did not reply as she stood smoothing the head of the little girl who had followed her to the door and now leaned against her hiding her tearful face in graces dress she said i dont know of any homoeopathic physician in this neighborhood i dont believe theres one nearer than boston and i should make myself ridiculous in calling one so far for a consultation but im quite willing you should call one and i will send for you at once  and wouldnt you consult with him after he came  certainly not it would be absurd  i shouldnt like to have a doctor come all the way from boston mused mrs maynard sinking on the lounge again there must be a doctor in the neighborhood it cant be so healthy as that  theres an allopathic physician at corbitant said grace passively a very good one i believe she added  oh well then cried mrs maynard with immense relief consult with him  ive told you louise that i would not consult with anybody and i certainly wouldnt consult with a physician whose ideas and principles i knew nothing about  why but grace mrs maynard expostulated is nt that rather prejudiced she began to take an impartial interest in graces position and fell into an argumentative tone if two heads are better than oneand everybody says they arei dont see how you can consistently refuse to talk with another physician  i cant explain to you louise said grace but you can call dr mulbridge if you wish that will be the right way for you to do if you have lost confidence in me  i have nt lost confidence in you grace i dont see how you can talk so you can give me bread pills if you like or air pills and i will take them gladly i believe in you perfectly but i do think that in a matter of this kind where my health and perhaps my life is concerned i ought to have a little say i dont ask you to give up your principles and i dont dream of giving you up and yet you wont just to please meexchange a few words with another doctor about my case merely because hes allopathic i should call it bigotry and i dont see how you can call it anything else there was a sound of voices at the door outside and she called cheerily come in mr libbycome in theres nobody but grace here she added as the young man tentatively opened the door and looked in he wore an evening dress even to the white cravat and he carried in his hand a crush hat there was something anomalous in his appearance beyond the phenomenal character of his costume and he blushed consciously as he bowed to grace and then at her motion shook hands with her mrs maynard did not give herself the fatigue of rising she stretched her hand to him from the lounge and he took it without the joy which he had shown when grace made him the same advance how very swell you look going to an evening party this morning she cried and after she had given him a second glance of greater intensity why what in the world has come over you it was the dress which mr libby wore he was a young fellow far too well made and carried himself too alertly to look as if any clothes misfitted him his person gave their good cut elegance but he had the effect of having fallen away in them why you look as if you had been sick a month mrs maynard interpreted  the young man surveyed himself with a downward glance theyre johnsons he explained he had them down for a hop at the long beach house and sent over for them i had nothing but my camping flannels and they have nt been got into shape yet since yesterday i wanted to come over and see how you were  poor fellow exclaimed mrs maynard i never thought of you how in the world did you get to your camp  i walked  in all that rain  well i had been pretty well sprinkled already it was nt a question of wet and dry it was a question of wet and wet i was going off bareheaded i lost my hat in the water you knowbut your man here hailed me round the corner of the kitchen and lent me one ive been taking up collections of clothes ever since  mr libby spoke lightly and with a cry of barlows hat mrs maynard went off in a shriek of laughter but a deep distress kept grace silent it seemed to her that she had been lacking not only in thoughtfulness but in common humanity in suffering him to walk away several miles in the rain without making an offer to keep him and have him provided for in the house she remembered now her bewildered impression that he was without a hat when he climbed the stairs and helped her to the house she recalled the fact that she had thrust him on to the danger he had escaped and her heart was melted with grief and shame mr libbyshe began going up to him and drooping before him in an attitude which simply and frankly expressed the contrition she felt but she could not continue mrs maynards laugh broke into the usual cough and as soon as she could speak she seized the word  well there now we can leave it to mr libby its the principle of the thing that i look at and i want to see how it strikes him i want to know mr libby if you were a doctorhe looked at grace and flushedand a person was very sick and wanted you to consult with another doctor whether you would let the mere fact that you had nt been introduced have any weight with you the young man silently appealed to grace who darkened angrily and before he could speak mrs maynard interposed no no you shant ask her i want your opinion its just an abstract question she accounted for this fib with a wink at grace  really he said its rather formidable ive never been a doctor of any kind  oh yes we know that said mrs maynard but you are now and now would you do it  if the other fellow knew more i would  but if you thought he did nt  then i wouldnt what are you trying to get at mrs maynard im not going to answer any more of your questions  yesone more dont you think its a doctors place to get his patient well any way he can  why of course  there grace its just exactly the same case and ninetynine out of a hundred would decide against you every time  libby turned towards grace in confusion miss breeni did nt understandi dont presume to meddle in anythingyoure not fair mrs maynard i have nt any opinion on the subject miss breen i havent indeed  oh you cant back out now exclaimed mrs maynard joyously youve said it  and youre quite right mr libby said grace haughtily she bade him goodmorning but he followed her from the room and left mrs maynard to her triumph  miss breendo let me speak to you please upon my word and honor i didnt know what she was driving at i did nt indeed its pretty rough on me for i never dreamt of setting myself up as a judge of your affairs i know youre right whatever you think and i take it all back it was got out of me by fraud any way and i beg your pardon for not calling you doctorif you want me to do it the other comes more natural but i wish to recognize you in the way you prefer for i do feel most respectulreverent  he was so very earnest and so really troubled and he stumbled about so for the right word and hit upon the wrong one with such unfailing disaster that she must have been superhuman not to laugh her laughing seemed to relieve him even more than her hearty speech call me how you like mr libby i dont insist upon anything with you but i believe i prefer miss breen  youre very kind miss breen it is then and youll forgive my siding against you he demanded radiantly  dont speak of that again please ive nothing to forgive you  they walked downstairs and out on the piazza barlow stood before the steps holding by the bit a fine bay mare who twitched her head round a little at the sound of libbys voice and gave him a look he passed without noticing the horse im glad to find mrs maynard so well with that cold of hers hanging on so long i didnt know but shed be in an awful state this morning  yes said grace its a miraculous escape  the fact is i sent over to new leyden for my team yesterday i did nt know how things might turn out and youre so far from a lemon here that i thought i might be useful in going errands  grace turned her head and glanced at the equipage is that your team  yes said the young fellow with a smile of suppressed pride  what an exquisite creature said the girl  isnt she they both faced about and stood looking at the mare and the light shining open buggy behind her the sunshine had the afterstorm glister the air was brisk and the breeze blew balm from the heart of the pine forest miss breen he broke out i wish youd take a little dash through the woods with me ive got a broadtrack buggy thats just right for these roads i dont suppose its the thing at all to ask you on such short acquaintance but i wish you would i know youd enjoy it come  his joyous urgence gave her a strange thrill she had long ceased to imagine herself the possible subject of what young ladies call attentions and she did not think of herself in that way now there was something in the frank eager boyishness of the invitation that fascinated her and the sunny face turned so hopefully upon her had its amusing eloquence she looked about the place with an anxiety of which she was immediately ashamed all the ladies were out of sight and probably at the foot of the cliff  dont say no miss breen pleaded the gay voice  the answer seemed to come of itself oh thank you yes i should like to go  good he exclaimed and the word which riveted her consent made her recoil  but not this morning some other day iii want to think about mrs maynard iought nt to leave her excuse me this morning mr libby  why of course he tried to say with unaltered gayety but a note of disappointment made itself felt do you think shes going to be worse  no i dont think she is but she paused and waited a space before she continued i m afraid i cant be of use to her any longer she has lost confidence in meits important she should trust her physician libby blushed as he always did when required to recognize grace in her professional quality its more a matter of nerves than anything else and if she does nt believe in me i cant do her any good  yes i can understand that said the young man with gentle sympathy and she felt somehow that he delicately refrained from any leading or prompting comment  she has been urging me to have a consultation with some doctor about her case and iit would be ridiculous  then i would nt do it said mr libby you know a great deal better what she wants than she does you had better make her do what you say  i didnt mean to burden you with my affairs said grace but i wished to explain her motive in speaking to you as she did after she had said this it seemed to her rather weak and she could not think of anything else that would strengthen it the young man might think that she had asked advice of him she began to resent his telling her to make mrs maynard do what she said she was about to add something to snub him when she recollected that it was her own wilfulness which had precipitated the present situation and she humbled herself  she will probably change her mind said libby she would if you could let her carry her point he added with a light esteem for mrs maynard which set him wrong again in graces eyes he had no business to speak so to her  very likely she said in stiff withdrawal from all terms of confidence concerning mrs maynard she did not add anything more and she meant that the young fellow should perceive that his audience was at an end he did not apparently resent it but she fancied him hurt in his acquiescence  she went back to her patient whom she found languid and disposed to sleep after the recent excitement and she left her again taking little bella with her mrs maynard slept long but woke none the better for her nap towards evening she grew feverish and her fever mounted as the night fell she was restless and wakeful and between her dreamy dozes she was incessant in her hints for a consultation to grace who passed the night in her room and watched every change for the worse with a selfaccusing heart the impending trouble was in that indeterminate phase which must give the physician his most anxious moments and this inexperienced girl whose knowledge was all to be applied and who had hardly arrived yet at that dismaying stage when a young physician finds all the results at war with all the precepts began to realize the awfulness of her responsibility she had always thought of saving life and not of losing it     v  by morning grace was as nervous and anxious as her patient who had momentarily the advantage of her in having fallen asleep she went stealthily out and walked the length of the piazza bathing her eyes with the sight of the sea cool and dim under a clouded sky at the corner next the kitchen she encountered barlow who having kindled the fire for the cook had spent s moment of leisure in killing some chickens at the barn he appeared with a cluster of his victims in his hand but at sight of grace he considerately put them behind him  she had not noticed them mr barlow she said how far is it to corbitant  barlow slouched into a conversational posture easily resting on his raised hip the back of the hand in which he held the chickens well it s accordin to who you ask some says six mile and real clever folks makes it about four and a quarter  i ask you persisted grace  well the last time i was there i thought it was about sixty most froze my fingers goin round the point n all i was afraid of was gettin there too soon tell you a lee shore aint a pleasant neighbor in a regular old northeaster f you go by land i guess its about ten mile round through the woods want to send for dr mulbridge i thought mebbe  no no said grace she turned back into the house and then she came running out again but by this time barlow had gone into the kitchen where she heard him telling the cook that these were the last of the dommyneckers at breakfast several of the ladies came and asked after mrs maynard whose restless night they had somehow heard of when she came out of the diningroom miss gleason waylaid her in the hall  dr breen she said in a repressed tumult i hope you wont give way for womans sake i hope you wont you owe it to yourself not to give way im sure mrs maynard is as well off in your hands as she can be if i did nt think so i should be the last to advise your being firm but feeling as i do i do advise it most strongly everything depends on it  i dont know what you mean miss gleason said grace  im glad it hasnt come to you yet if it was a question of mere professional pride i should say by all means call him at once but i feel that a great deal more is involved if you yield you make it harder for other women to help themselves hereafter and you confirm such people as these in their distrust of female physicians looking at it in a large way i almost feel that it would be better for her to die than for you to give up and feeling as i do  are you talking of mrs maynard asked grace  they are all saying that you ought to give up the case to dr mulbridge but i hope you wont i should nt blame you for calling in another female physician  thank you answered grace there is no danger of her dying but it seems to me that she has too many female physicians already in this house i should think it better to call a man she left the barb to rankle in miss gleasons breast and followed her mother to her room who avenged miss gleason by a series of inquisitional tortures ending with the hope that whatever she did grace would not have that silly creatures blood on her hands the girl opened her lips to attempt some answer to this unanswerable aspiration when the unwonted sound of wheels on the road without caught her ear  what is that grace demanded her mother as if grace were guilty of the noise  mr libby answered grace rising  has he come for you  i dont know but i am going down to see him  at sight of the young mans face grace felt her heart lighten he had jumped from his buggy and was standing at his smiling ease on the piazza steps looking about as if for some one and he brightened joyfully at her coming he took her hand with eager friendliness and at her impulse began to move away to the end of the piazza with her the ladies had not yet descended to the beach apparently their interest in dr breens patient kept them  how is mrs maynard this morning he asked and she answered as they got beyond earshot  not better im afraid  oh im sorry said the young man then you wont be able to drive with me this morning i hope she is nt seriously worse he added recurring to mrs maynard at the sight of the trouble in graces face  i shall ask to drive with you she returned mr libby do you know where corbitant is  oh yes  and will you drive me there  why certainly he cried in polite wonder  thank you she turned half round and cast a womans look at the other women i shall be ready in half an hour will you go away and comeback then not sooner  anything you please miss breen he said laughing in his mystification in thirty minutes or thirty days  they went back to the steps and he mounted his buggy she sat down and taking some work from her pocket bent her head over it at first she was pale and then she grew red but these fluctuations of color could not keep her spectators long one by one they dispersed and descended the cliff and when she rose to go for her hat the last had vanished with a longing look at her it was miss gleason  grace briefly announced her purpose to her mother who said i hope you are not doing anything impulsive and she answered no i had quite made up my mind to it last night  mr libby had not yet returned when she went back to the piazza and she walked out on the road by which he must arrive she had not to walk far he drew in sight before she had gone a quarter of a mile driving rapidly am i late he asked turning and pulling up at the roadside with wellsubdued astonishment at encountering her  oh no not that i know she mounted to the seat and they drove off in a silence which endured for a long time if libby had been as vain as he seemed light he must have found it cruelly unflattering for it ignored his presence and even his existence she broke the silence at last with a deepdrawn sigh as frankly sad as if she had been quite alone but she returned to consciousness of him in it mr libby you must think it is very strange for me to ask you to drive me to corbitant without troubling myself to tell you my errand  oh not at all said the young man im glad to be of use on any terms it is nt often that one gets the chance  i am going to see dr mulbridge she began and then stopped so long that he perceived she wished him to say something  he said yes  yes i thought this morning that i should give mrs maynards case up to him i shouldnt be at all troubled at seeming to give it up under a pressure of opinion though i should not give it up for that of course she explained you dont know that all those women have been saying that i ought to call in dr mulbridge its one of those things she added bitterly that make it so pleasant for a woman to try to help women he made a little murmur of condolence and she realized that she had thrown herself on his sympathy when she thought she had been merely thinking aloud what i mean is that he is a man of experience and reputation and could probably be of more use to her than i for she would trust him more but i have known her a long time and i understand her temperament and her characterwhich goes for a good deal in such mattersand i have concluded not to give up the case i wish to meet dr mulbridge however and ask him to see her in consultation with me that is all she ended rather haughtily as if she had been dramatizing the fact to dr mulbridge in her own mind  i should think that would be the right thing said libby limply with uncalledfor approval but he left this dangerous ground abruptly as you say character goes for a great deal in these things ive seen mrs maynard at the point of death before as a general rule she does nt die if you have known her a long time you know what i mean she likes to share her sufferings with her friends ive seen poor old maynard  mr libby grace broke in you may speak of mr maynard as you like but i cannot allow your disrespectfulness to mrs maynard its shocking you had no right to be their friend if you felt toward them as you seem to have done  why there was no harm in them i liked them explained the young man  people have no right to like those they dont respect  libby looked as if this were rather a new and droll idea but he seemed not to object to her tutoring him well he said as far as mrs maynard was concerned i dont know that i liked her any more than i respected her  grace ought to have frowned at this but she had to check a smile in order to say gravely i know she is disagreeable at times and she likes to share her sufferings with others as you say but her husband was fully entitled to any share of them that he may have borne if he had been kinder to her she wouldnt be what and where she is now  kinder to her libby exclaimed hes the kindest fellow in the world now miss breen he said earnestly i hope mrs maynard hasnt been talking against her husband to you  is it possible demanded grace that you dont know theyre separated and that shes going to take steps for a divorce  a divorce no what in the world for  i never talk gossip i thought of course she had told you  she never told me a word she was ashamed to do it she knows that i know maynard was the best husband in the world to her all she told me was that he was out on his ranch and she had come on here for her health its some ridiculous little thing that no reasonable woman would have dreamt of caring for its one of her caprices its her own fickleness shes tired of himor thinks she is and thats all about it miss breen i beg you wont believe anything against maynard  i dont understand faltered grace astonished at his fervor and the light it cast upon her first doubts of him of course i only know the affair from her report and i havent concerned myself in it except as it affected her health and i dont wish to misjudge him and i like yourdefending him she said though it instantly seemed a patronizing thing to have said but i couldnt withhold my sympathy where i believed there had been neglect and systematic unkindness and finally desertion  oh i know mrs maynard i know her kind of talk ive seen maynards neglect and unkindness and i know just what his desertion would be if hes left her its because she wanted him to leave her he did it to humor her to please her i shall have a talk with mrs maynard when we get back  i m afraid i cant allow it at present said grace very seriously  she is worse today otherwise i should nt be giving you this trouble  oh its no troublebut im gladim glad weve had this understanding im very glad it makes me think worse of myself and better ofothers  libby gave a laugh and you like that youre easily pleased  she remained grave i ought to be able to tell you what i mean but it is nt possiblenow will you let me beg your pardon she urged with impulsive earnestness  why yes he answered smiling  and not ask me why  certainly  thank you yes she added hastily she is so much worse that some one of greater experience than i must see her and i have made up my mind dr mulbridge may refuse to consult with me i know very well that there is a prejudice against women physicians and i couldnt especially blame him for sharing it i have thought it all over if he refuses i shall know what to do she had ceased to address libby who respected her soliloquy he drove on rapidly over the soft road where the wheels made no sound and the track wandered with apparent aimlessness through the interminable woods of young oak and pine the low trees were full of the sunshine and dappled them with shadow as they dashed along the fresh green ferns springing from the brown carpet of the pineneedles were as if painted against it the breath of the pines was heavier for the recent rain and the woody smell of the oaks was pungent where the balsam failed they met no one but the solitude did not make itself felt through her preoccupation from time to time she dropped a word or two but for the most she was silent and he did not attempt to lead by and by they came to an opener place where there were many red fieldlilies tilting in the wind  would you like some of those he asked pulling up  i should very much she answered glad of the sight of the gay things but when he had gathered her a bunch of the flowers she looked down at them in her lap and said its silly in me to be caring for lilies at such a time and i should make an unfavorable impression on dr mulbridge if he saw me with them but i shall risk their effect on him he may think i have been botanizing  unless you tell him you have nt the young man suggested  i need nt do that  i dont think any one else would do it  she colored a little at the tribute to her candor and it pleased her though it had just pleased her as much to forget that she was not like any other young girl who might be simply and irresponsibly happy in flowers gathered for her by a young man i wont tell him either she cried willing to grasp the fleeting emotion again but it was gone and only a little residue of sad consciousness remained  the woods gave way on either side of the road which began to be a village street sloping and shelving down toward the curve of a quiet bay the neat weathergray dwellings shingled to the ground and brightened with dooryard flowers and creepers straggled off into the boathouses and fishinghuts on the shore and the village seemed to get afloat at last in the sloops and schooners riding in the harbor whose smooth plane rose higher to the eye than the town itself the salt and the sand were everywhere but though there had been no positive prosperity in corbitant for a generation the place had an impregnable neatness which defied decay if there had been a dog in the street there would not have been a stick to throw at him  one of the better but not the best of the village houses which did not differ from the others in any essential particular and which stood flush upon the street bore a doorplate with the name dr rufus mulbridge and libby drew up in front of it without having had to alarm the village with inquiries grace forbade his help in dismounting and ran to the door where she rang one of those bells which sharply respond at the back of the panel to the turn of a crank in front she observed in a difference of paint that this modern improvement had displaced an oldfashioned knocker the door was opened by a tall and strikingly handsome old woman whose black eyes still kept their keen light under her white hair and whose dress showed none of the incongruity which was offensive in the doorbell it was in the perfection of an antiquated taste which however came just short of characterizing it with gentle womanliness  is dr mulbridge at home asked grace  yes said the other with a certain hesitation and holding the door ajar  i should like to see him said grace mounting to the threshold  is it important asked the elder woman  quite replied grace with an accent at once of surprise and decision  you may come in said the other reluctantly and she opened a door into a room at the side of the hall  you may give dr mulbridge my card if you please said grace before she turned to go into this room and the other took it and left her to find a chair for herself it was a country doctors office with the usual country doctors supply of drugs on a shelf but very much more than the country doctors usual library the standard works were there and there were also the principal periodicals and the latest treatises of note in the medical world in a long upright case like that of an old hallclock was the anatomy of one who had long done with time a laryngoscope and some other professional apparatus of constant utility lay upon the leaf of the doctors desk there was nothing in the room which did not suggest his profession except the sword and the spurs which hung upon the wall opposite where grace sat beside one of the front windows she spent her time in study of the room and its appointments and in now and then glancing out at mr libby who sat statuesquely patient in the buggy his profile cut against the sky was blameless and a humorous shrewdness which showed in the wrinkle at his eye and in the droop of his yellow mustache gave its regularity life and charm it occurred to her that if dr mulbridge caught sight of mr libby before he saw her or before she could explain that she had got one of the gentlemen at the hotelshe resolved upon this prevaricationto drive her to corbitant in default of another conveyance he would have his impressions and conjectures which doubtless the bunch of lilies in her hand would do their part to stimulate she submitted to this possibility and waited for his coming which began to seem unreasonably delayed the door opened at last and a tall powerfully framed man of thirtyfive or forty dressed in an illfitting suit of gray canada homespun appeared he moved with a slow pondering step and carried his shaggy head bent downwards from shoulders slightly rounded his dark beard was already grizzled and she saw that his mustache was burnt and turned tawny at points by smoking of which habit his presence gave stale evidence to another sense he held graces card in his hand and he looked at her as he advanced out of gray eyes that if not sympathetic were perfectly intelligent and that at once sought to divine and class her she perceived that he took in the lilies and her coming color she felt that he noted her figure and her dress  she half rose in response to his questioning bow and he motioned her to her seat again i had to keep you waiting he said i was up all night with a patient and i was asleep when my mother called me he stopped here and definitively waited for her to begin  she did not find this easy as he took a chair in front of her and sat looking steadily in her face im sorry to have disturbed you oh not at all he interrupted the rule is to disturb a doctor  i mean she began again that i am not sure that i am justified in disturbing you  he waited a little while for her to go on and then he said well let us hear  i wish to consult with you she broke out and again she came to a sudden pause and as she looked into his vigilant face in which she was not sure there was not a hovering derision she could not continue she felt that she ought to gather courage from the fact that he had not started or done anything positively disagreeable when she had asked for a consultation but she could not and it did not avail her to reflect that she was rendering herself liable to all conceivable misconstructionthat she was behaving childishly with every appearance of behaving guiltily  he came to her aid again in a blunt fashion neither kind nor unkind but simply common sense what is the matter  what is the matter she repeated  yes what are the symptoms where and how are you sick  i am not sick she cried they stared at each other in reciprocal amazement and mystification  then excuse me if i ask you what you wish me to do  oh said grace realizing his natural error with a flush it is nt in regard to myself that i wish to consult with you its another persona friend  well said dr mulbridge laughing with the impatience of a physician used to making short cuts through the elaborate and reluctant statements of ladies seeking advice what is the matter with your friend  she has been an invalid for some time replied grace the laugh which had its edge of patronage and conceit stung her into selfpossession again and she briefly gave the points of mrs maynards case with the recent accident and the symptoms developed during the night he listened attentively nodding his head at times and now and then glancing sharply at her as one might at a surprisingly intelligent child  i must see her he said decidedly when she came to an end i will see her as soon as possible i will come over to jocelyns this afternoonas soon as i can get my dinner in fact  there was such a tone of dismissal in his words that she rose and he promptly followed her example she stood hesitating a moment then i dont know whether you understood that i wish merely to consult with you she said that i dont wish to relinquish the case to you  relinquish the caseconsultdr mulbridge stared at her no i dont understand what do you mean by not relinquishing the case if there is some one else in attendance  i am in attendance said the girl firmly i am mrs maynards physician  you physician  if you have looked at my cardshe began with indignant severity  he gave a sort of roar of amusement and apology and then he stared at her again with much of the interest of a naturalist in an extraordinary specimen  i beg your pardon he exclaimed i did nt look at it but he now did so where he held it crumpled in the palm of his left hand my mother said it was a young lady and i did nt look will you will you sit down dr breen he bustled in getting her several chairs i live off here in a corner and i have never happened to meet any ladies of our profession before excuse me if i spoke under amistaken impression iii should not haveahtaken you for a physician youhe checked himself as if he might have been going to say that she was too young and too pretty of course i shall have pleasure in consulting with you in regard to your friends case though ive no doubt you are doing all that can be done with a great show of deference he still betrayed something of the air of one who humors a joke and she felt this but felt that she could not openly resent it  thank you she returned with dignity indicating with a gesture of her hand that she would not sit down again i am sorry to ask you to come so far  oh not at all i shall be driving over in that direction at any rate ive a patient near there he smiled upon her with frank curiosity and seemed willing to detain her but at a loss how to do so if i had nt been stupid from my nap i should have inferred a scientific training from your statement of your friends case she still believed that he was laughing at her and that this was a mock but she was still helpless to resent it except by an assumption of yet colder state this had apparently no effect upon dr mulbridge he continued to look at her with hardly concealed amusement and visibly to grow more and more conscious of her elegance and style now that she stood before him there had been a time when in planning her career she had imagined herself studying a masculine simplicity and directness of address but the oversuccess of some young women her fellows at the school in this direction had disgusted her with it and she had perceived that after all there is nothing better for a girl even a girl who is a doctor of medicine than a ladylike manner now however she wished that she could do or say something aggressively mannish for she felt herself dwindling away to the merest femininity under a scrutiny which had its fascination whether agreeable or disagreeable you must he said with really unwarrantable patronage have found that the study of medicine has its difficultiesyou must have been very strongly drawn to it  oh no not at all i had rather an aversion at first she replied with the instant superiority of a woman where the man suffers any topic to become personal why did you think i was drawn to it  i dont knowi dont know that i thought so he stammered i believe i intended to ask he added bluntly but she had the satisfaction of seeing him redden and she did not volunteer anything in his relief she divined that it would leave him with an awkward sense of defeat if he quitted the subject there and in fact he had determined that he would not some of our ladies take up the study abroad he said and he went on to speak with a real deference of the eminent woman who did the american name honor by the distinction she achieved in the schools of paris  i have never been abroad said grace  no he exclaimed i thought all american ladies had been abroad and now he said with easy recognition of her resolution not to help him out i suppose you have your diploma from the philadelphia school  no she returned from the new york schoolthe homoeopathic school of new york  dr mulbridge instantly sobered and even turned a little pale but he did not say anything he remained looking at her as if she had suddenly changed from a piquant mystery to a terrible dilemma  she moved toward the door then i may expect you she said about the middle of the afternoon  he did not reply he stumbled upon the chairs in following her a pace or two with a face of acute distress then he broke out with i cant come i cant consult with you  she turned and looked at him with astonishment which he did his best to meet her astonishment congealed into hauteur and then dissolved into the helplessness of a lady who has been offered a rudeness but still she did not speak she merely looked at him while he halted and stammered on  personally iishould beobligedi should feel honorediiit has nothing to do with youryourbeing aaawoman lady i should not care for that no but surely you must know the reasonsthe obstacleswhich deter me  no i dont she said calm with the advantage of his perturbation but if you refuse that is sufficient i will not inquire your reasons i will simply withdraw my request  thank you but i beg you to understand that they have no reference whatever to you inyour owncapacitycharacterindividual quality they are purely professionalthat is technicali should say disciplinaryentirely disciplinary yes disciplinary the word seemed to afford dr mulbridge the degree of relief which can come only from an exactly significant and luminously exegetic word  i dont at all know what you mean said grace but it is not necessary that i should know will you allow me she asked for dr mulbridge had got between her and the door and stood with his hand on the latch  his face flushed and drops stood on his forehead surely missi mean doctorbreen you must know why i cant consult with you we belong to two diametrically opposite schoolstheoriesof medicine it would be impracticableimpossible for us to consult we could find no common ground have you never heard that theah regular practice cannot meet homoeopathists in this way if you had told meif i had knownyou were a homoeopathist i could nt have considered the matter at all i cant now express any opinion as to your management of the case but i have no doubt that you will know what to dofrom your point of viewand that you will prefer to call in some one of your ownpersuasion i hope that you dont hold me personally responsible for this result  oh no replied the girl with a certain dreamy abstraction i had heard that you made some such distinctioni remember now but i could nt realize anything so ridiculous  dr mulbridge colored excuse me he said if even under the circumstances i cant agree with you that the position taken by the regular practice is ridiculous  she did not make any direct reply but i supposed that you only made this distinction as you call it in cases where there is no immediate danger that in a matter of life and death you would waive it mrs maynard is really  there are no conditions under which i could not conscientiously refuse to waive it  then cried grace i withdraw the word it is not ridiculous it is monstrous atrocious inhuman  a light of humorous irony glimmered in dr mulbridges eye i must submit to your condemnation  oh it isnt a personal condemnation she retorted i have no doubt that personally you are not responsible we can lay aside our distinctions as allopathist and homoeopathist and you can advise with me  its quite impossible said dr mulbridge if i advised with you i might bea little while ago one of our school in connecticut was expelled from the state medical association for consulting withhe began to hesitate as if he had not hit upon a fortunate or appropriate illustration but he pushed onwith his own wife who was a physician of your school  she haughtily ignored his embarrassment i can appreciate your difficulty and pity any liberalminded person who is placed as you are and disapproves of such wretched bigotry  i am obliged to tell you said dr mulbridge that i dont disapprove of it  i am detaining you said grace i beg your pardon i was curious to know how far superstition and persecution can go in our day if the epithets were not very accurate she used them with a womans effectiveness and her intention made them descriptive goodday she added and she made a movement toward the door from which dr mulbridge retired but she did not open the door instead she sank into the chair which stood in the corner and passed her hand over her forehead as if she were giddy  dr mulbridges finger was instantly on her wrist are you faint  no no she gasped pulling her hand away i am perfectly well then she was silent for a time before she added by a supreme effort i have no right to endanger anothers life through any miserable pride and i never will mrs maynard needs greater experience than mine and she must have it i cant justify myself in the delay and uncertainty of sending to boston i relinquish the case i give it to you and i will nurse her under your direction obediently conscientiously oh she cried at his failure to make any immediate response surely you wont refuse to take the case  i wont refuse he said with an effect of difficult concession i will come i will drive over at once after dinner  she rose now and put her hand on the doorlatch do you object to my nursing your patient she is an old school friend but i could yield that point too if  oh no no i shall be only too glad of your help and yourhe was going to say advice but he stopped himself and repeatedhelp  they stood inconclusively a moment as if they would both be glad of something more to say then she said tentatively goodmorning and he responded experimentally goodmorning and with that they involuntarily parted and she went out of the door which he stood holding open even after she had got out of the gate  his mother came down the stairs what in the world were you quarrelling with that girl about rufus  we were not quarrelling mother  well it sounded like it who was she  who repeated her son absently dr breen  doctor breen that girl a doctor  yes  i thought she was some saucy thing well upon my word exclaimed mrs mulbridge so that is a female doctor is it was she sick  no said her son with what she knew to be professional finality mother if you can hurry dinner a little i shall be glad i have to drive over to jocelyns and i should like to start as soon as possible  who was the young man with her her beau i guess  was there a young man with her asked dr mulbridge  his mother went out without speaking she could be unsatisfactory too     vi  no one but mrs breen knew of her daughters errand and when grace came back she alighted from mr libbys buggy with an expression of thanks that gave no clew as to the direction or purpose of it he touched his hat to her with equal succinctness and drove away including all the ladies on the piazza in a cursory obeisance  we must ask you miss gleason said mrs alger your admiration of dr breen clothes you with authority and responsibility  i cant understand it at all miss gleason confessed but im sure theres nothing in it he isnt her equal she would feel that it wasnt rightunder the circumstances  but if mrs maynard was well it would be a fair game you mean said mrs alger  no returned miss gleason with the greatest air of candor i cant admit that i meant that  well said the elder lady the presumption is against them every young couple seen together must be considered in love till they prove the contrary  i like it in her said mrs frost it shows that she is human after all it shows that she is like other girls its a relief  she is nt like other girls contended miss gleason darkly  i would rather have mr libbys opinion said mrs merritt  grace went to mrs maynards room and told her that dr mulbridge was coming directly after dinner  i knew you would do it cried mrs maynard throwing her right arm round graces neck while the latter bent over to feel the pulse in her left i knew where you had gone as soon as your mother told me you had driven off with walter libby im so glad that youve got somebody to consult your theories are perfectly right and im sure that dr mulbridge will just tell you to keep on as youve been doing  grace withdrew from her caress dr mulbridge is not coming for a consultation he refused to consult with me  refused to consult why how perfectly ungentlemanly why did he refuse  because he is an allopathist and i am a homoeopathist  then what is he coming for i should like to know  i have given up the case to him said grace wearily  very well then cried mrs maynard i wont be given up i will simply die not a pill not a powder of his will i touch if he thinks himself too good to consult with another doctor and a lady at that merely because she doesnt happen to be allopathist he can go along i never heard of anything so conceited so disgustingly mean in my life no grace why its horrid she was silent and then why of course she added if he comes i shall have to see him i look like a fright i suppose  i will do your hair said grace with indifference to these vows and protests and without deigning further explanation or argument she made the invalids toilet for her if given time mrs maynard would talk herself into any necessary frame of mind and grace merely supplied the monosyllabic promptings requisite for her transition from mood to mood it was her final resolution that when dr mulbridge did come she should give him a piece of her mind and she received him with anxious submissiveness and hung upon all his looks and words with quaking and with an inclination to attribute her unfavorable symptoms to the treatment of her former physician she did not spare him certain apologies for the disorderly appearance of her person and her room  grace sat by and watched him with perfectly quiescent observance the large somewhat uncouth man gave evidence to her intelligence that he was all physicianthat he had not chosen his profession from any theory or motive however good but had been as much chosen by it as if he had been born a physician he was incredibly gentle and soft in all his movements and perfectly kind without being at any moment unprofitably sympathetic he knew when to listen and when not to listento learn everything from the quivering bundle of nerves before him without seeming to have learnt anything alarming he smiled when it would do her good to be laughed at and treated her with such grave respect that she could not feel herself trifled with nor remember afterwards any point of neglect when he rose and left some medicines with directions to grace for giving them and instructions for contingencies she followed him from the room  well she said anxiously  mrs maynard is threatened with pneumonia or i dont know why i should say threatened he added she has pneumonia  i supposedi was afraid so faltered the girl  yes he looked into her eyes with even more seriousness than he spoke  has she friends here he asked  no her husband is in cheyenne out on the plains  he ought to know said dr mulbridge a great deal will depend upon her nursingmissahdr breen  you need nt call me dr breen said grace at present i am mrs maynards nurse  he ignored this as he had ignored every point connected with the interview of the morning he repeated the directions he had already given with still greater distinctness and saying that he should come in the morning drove away she went back to louise inquisition for inquisition it was easier to meet that of her late patient than that of her mother and for once the girl spared herself  i know he thought i was very bad whimpered mrs maynard for a beginning what is the matter with me  your cold has taken an acute form you will have to go to bed  then i m going to be down sick i knew i was i knew it and what am i going to do off in such a place as this no one to nurse me or look after bella i should think you would be satisfied now grace with the result of your conscientiousness you were so very sure that mr libby was wanting to flirt with me that you drove us to our death because you thought he felt guilty and was trying to fib out of it  will you let me help to undress you asked grace gently bella shall be well taken care of and i am going to nurse you myself under dr mulbridges direction and once for all louise i wish to say that i hold myself to blame for all  oh yes much good that does now being got into bed with the sheet smoothed under her chin she said with the effect of drawing a strictly logical conclusion from the premises well i should think george maynard would want to be with his family  spent with this ordeal grace left her at last and went out on the piazza where she found libby returned in fact he had upon second thoughts driven back and put up his horse at jocelyns that he might be of service there in case he were needed the ladies with whom he had been making friends discreetly left him to grace when she appeared and she frankly walked apart with him and asked him if he could go over to new leyden and telegraph to mr maynard  has she asked for him he inquired laughing i knew it would come to that  she has not asked she has said that she thought he ought to be with his family repeated grace faithfully  oh i know how she said it as if he had gone away wilfully and kept away against her wishes and all the claims of honor and duty it wouldnt take her long to get round to that if she thought she was very sick is she so bad he inquired with light scepticism  shes threatened with pneumonia we cant tell how bad she may be  why of course ill telegraph but i dont think anything serious can be the matter with mrs maynard  dr mulbridge said that mr maynard ought to know  is that so asked libby in quite a different tone if she recognized the difference she was meekly far from resenting it he however must have wished to repair his blunder i think you need nt have given up the case to him i think youre too conscientious about it  please dont speak of that now she interposed  well i wont he consented can i be of any use here tonight  no we shall need nothing more the doctor will be here again in the morning  libby did not come in the morning till after the doctor had gone and then he explained that he had waited to hear in reply to his telegram so that they might tell mrs maynard her husband had started and he had only just now heard  and has he started grace asked  i heard from his partner maynard was at the ranch his partner had gone for him  then he will soon be here she said  he will if telegraphing can bring him i sat up half the night with the operator she was very obliging when she understood the case  she reputed grace with a slight frown  the operators are nearly all women in the country  oh she looked grave can they trust young girls with such important duties  they did nt in this instance relied libby she was a pretty old girl what made you think she was young  i dont know i thought you said she was young she blushed and seemed about to say more but she did not  he waited and then he said you can tell mrs maynard that i telegraphed on my own responsibility if you think its going to alarm her  well said grace with a helpless sigh  you dont like to tell her that he suggested after a moment in which he had watched her  how do you know  oh i know and some day i will tell you howif you will let me  it seemed a question and she did not know what it was that kept hersilent and breathless and hot in the throat i dont like to do it she said at last i hate myself whenever i have to feign anything i knew perfectly well that you did nt say she was young she broke out desperately  say mrs maynard was young he asked stupidly  no she cried she rose hastily from the bench where she had been sitting with him i must go back to her now  he mounted to his buggy and drove thoughtfully away at a walk  the ladies whose excited sympathies for mrs maynard had kept them from the beach till now watched him quite out of sight before they began to talk of grace  i hope dr breens new patient will be more tractable said mrs merritt it would be a pity if she had to give him up too to dr mulbridge  mrs scott failed of the point why is mr libby sick  not very answered mrs merritt with a titter of selfapplause  i should be sorry interposed mrs alger authoritatively if we had said anything to influence the poor thing in what she has done  oh i dont think we need distress ourselves about undue influence mrs merritt exclaimed  mrs alger chose to ignore the suggestion she had a very difficult part and i think she has acted courageously i always feel sorry for girls who attempt anything of that kind its a fearful ordeal  but they say miss breen was nt obliged to do it for a living mrs scott suggested  so much the worse said mrs merritt  no so much the better returned mrs alger  mrs merritt sitting on the edge of the piazza stooped over with difficulty and plucked a glassstraw which she bit as she looked rebelliously away  mrs frost had installed herself as favorite since mrs alger had praised her hair she now came forward and dropping fondly at her knee looked up to her for instruction dont you think that she showed her sense in giving up at the very beginning if she found she was nt equal to it she gave her head a little movement from side to side and put the mass of her back hair more on show  perhaps said mrs alger looking at the favorite not very favorably  oh i dont think shes given up miss gleason interposed in her breathless manner she waited to be asked why and then she added i think shes acting in consultation with dr mulbridge he may have a certain influence over heri think he has but i know they are acting in unison  mrs merritt flung her grassstraw away perhaps it is to be dr mulbridge after all and not mr libby  i have thought of that miss gleason assented candidly yes i have thought of that i have thought of their being constantly thrown together in this way it would not discourage me she could be quite as true to her vocation as if she remained single truer  talking of true said mrs scott always does make me think of blue they say that yellow will be worn on everything this winter  old gold asked mrs frost yes more than ever  dear cried the other lady i dont know what i shall do it perfectly kills my hair  oh miss gleason exclaimed the young girl  do you believe in character coming out in color  yes certainly i have always believed that  well ive got a friend and she wouldnt have anything to do with a girl that wore magenta more than she would fly  i should suppose explained miss gleason that all those aniline dyes implied something coarse in people  is nt it curious asked mrs frost how redhaired people have come in fashion i can recollect when i was a little girl that everybody laughed at red hair there was one girl at the first school i ever went tothe boys used to pretend to burn their fingers at her hair  i think dr breens hair is a very pretty shade of brown said the young girl  mrs merritt rose from the edge of the piazza i think that if she hasnt given up to him entirely shes the most submissive consulting physician i ever saw she said and walked out over the grass towards the cliff  the ladies looked after her is mrs merritt more pudgy when shes sitting down or when shes standing up asked mrs scott  miss gleason seized her first chance of speaking with grace alone oh do you know how much you are doing for us all  doing for you all how doing faltered grace whom she had whisperingly halted in a corner of the hall leading from the diningroom  by acting in unisonby solving the most perplexing problem in womens practising your profession she passed the edge of her fan over her lips before letting it fall furled upon her left hand and looked luminously into graces eyes  i dont at all know what you mean miss gleason said the other  miss gleason kicked out the skirt of her dress so as to leave herself perfectly free for the explanation practising in harmony with a physician of the other sex i have always felt that there was the great difficultyhow to bring that about i have always felt that the true physician must be dualhave both the womans nature and the mans the womans tender touch the mans firm grasp you have shown how the medical education of women can meet this want the physician can actually be dualbe two in fact hereafter i have no doubt we shall always call a physician of each sex but its wonderful how you could ever bring it about though you can do anything has nt it worn upon you miss gleason darted out her sentences in quick short breaths fixing grace with her eyes and at each clause nervously tapping her chest with her reopened fan  if you suppose said grace that dr mulbridge and i are acting professionally in unison as you call it you are mistaken he has entire charge of the case i gave it up to him and i am merely nursing mrs maynard under his direction  how splendid miss gleason exclaimed do you know that i admire you for giving upfor knowing when to give up so few women do that is nt he magnificent  magnificent  i mean psychically he is what i should call a strong soul you must have felt his masterfulness you must have enjoyed it dont you like to be dominated  no said grace i should nt at all like it  oh i do i like to meet one of those forceful masculine natures that simply bid you obey its delicious such a sense of selfsurrender miss gleason explained it is nt because they are men she added i have felt the same influence from some women i felt it in a certain degree on first meeting you  i am very sorry said grace coldly i should dislike being controlled myself and i should dislike still more to control others  youre doing it now cried miss gleason with delight i could not do a thing to resist your putting me down of course you dont know that youre doing it its purely involuntary and you wouldnt know that he was dominating you and he would nt  very probably dr mulbridge would not have recognized himself in the character of allcompelling ladysnovel hero which miss gleason imagined for him life presented itself rather simply to him as it does to most men and he easily dismissed its subtler problems from a mind preoccupied with active cares as far as grace was concerned she had certainly roused in him an unusual curiosity nothing less than her homoeopathy would have made him withdraw his consent to a consultation with her and his fear had been that in his refusal she should escape from his desire to know more about her her motives her purposes he had accepted without scruple the sacrifice of pride she had made to him but he had known how to appreciate her scientific training which he found as respectable as that of any clever young man of their profession he praised in his way the perfection with which she interpreted his actions and intentions in regard to the patient if there were such nurses as you miss breen there would be very little need of doctors he said with a sort of interogative fashion of laughing peculiar to him  i thought of being a nurse once she answered perhaps i may still be one the scientific training wont be lost  oh no its a pity that more of them have nt it but i suppose they think nursing is rather too humble an ambition  i dont think it so said grace briefly  then you did nt care for medical distinction  no  he looked at her quizzically as if this were much droller than if she had cared i dont understand why you should have gone into it you told me i think that it was repugnant to you and its hard work for a woman and very uncertain work for anyone you must have had a tremendous desire to benefit your race  his characterization of her motive was so distasteful that she made no reply and left him to his conjectures in which he did not appear unhappy how do you find mrs maynard today she asked  he looked at her with an instant coldness as if he did not like her asking and were hesitating whether to answer but he said at last she is no better she will be worse before she is better you see he added that i havent been able to arrest the disorder in its first stage we must hope for what can be done now in the second  she had gathered from the half jocose ease with which he had listened to mrs maynards account of herself and to her own report an encouragement which now fell to the ground yes she assented in her despair that is the only hope  he sat beside the table in the hotel parlor where they found themselves alone for the moment and drubbed upon it with an absent look have you sent for her husband he inquired returning to himself  yes mr libby telegraphed the evening we saw you  thats good said dr mulbridge with comfortable approval and he rose to go away  grace impulsively detained him iwontask you whether you consider mrs maynards case a serious one if you object to my doing so  i dont know that i object he said slowly with a teasing smile such as one might use with a persistent child whom one chose to baffle in that way  she disdained to avail herself of the implied permission what i meanwhat i wish to tell you isthat i feel myself responsible for her sickness and that if she dies i shall be guilty of her death  ah said dr mulbridge with more interest but the same smile what do you mean  she didnt wish to go that day when she was caught in the storm but i insisted i forced her to go she stood panting with the intensity of the feeling which had impelled her utterance  what do you mean by forcing her to go  i dont know iipersuaded her  dr mulbridge smiled as if he perceived her intention not to tell him something she wished to tell him he looked down into his hat which he carried in his hand  did you believe the storm was coming  no  and you did nt make it come  of course not  he looked at her and laughed  oh you dont at all understand she cried  im not a doctor of divinity he said good morning  wait wait she implored im afraidi dont knowperhaps my being near her is injurious to her perhaps i ought to let some one else nurse her i wished to ask you thisshe stopped breathlessly  i dont think you have done her any harm as yet he answered lightly  however he said after a moments consideration why dont you take a holiday some of the other ladies might look after her a while  do you really think she palpitated that i might do you think i ought im afraid i ought nt  not if your devotion is hurtful to her he asked send some one else to her for a while any one can take care of her for a few hours  i couldnt leave herfeeling as i do about her  i dont know how you feel about her said dr mulbridge but you cant go on at this rate i shall want your help by and by and mrs maynard doesnt need you now dont go back to her  but if she should get worse while i am away  you think your staying and feeling bad would make her better dont go back he repeated and he went out to his ugly rawboned horse and mounting his shabby wagon rattled away she lingered indescribably put to shame by the brutal common sense which she could not impeach but which she still felt was no measure of the case it was true that she had not told him everything and she could not complain that he had mocked her appeal for sympathy if she had trifled with him by a partial confession but she indignantly denied to herself that she had wished to appeal to him for sympathy  she wandered out on the piazza which she found empty and stood gazing at the sea in a revery of passionate humiliation she was in that mood familiar to us all when we long to be consoled and even flattered for having been silly in a woman this mood is near to tears at a touch of kindness the tears come and momentous questions are decided what was perhaps uppermost in the girls heart was a detestation of the man to whom she had seemed a simpleton her thoughts pursued him and divined the contempt with which he must be thinking of her and her pretensions she heard steps on the sand and libby came round the corner of the house from the stable     vii  libbys friends had broken up their camp on the beach and had gone to a lake in the heart of the woods for the fishing he had taken a room at the long beach house but he spent most of his time at jocelyns where he kept his mare for use in going upon errands for mrs maynard grace saw him constantly and he was always doing little things for her with a divination of her unexpressed desires which women find too rarely in men he brought her flowers which after refusing them for mrs maynard the first time she accepted for herself he sometimes brought her books the light sort which form the sentimental currency of young people and she lent them round among the other ladies who were insatiable of them she took a pleasure in these attentions as if they had been for some one else in this alien sense she liked to be followed up with a chair to the point where she wished to sit to have her hat fetched or her shawl to drop her work or her handkerchief secure that it would be picked up for her  it all interested her and it was a relief from the circumstances that would have forbidden her to recognize it as gallantry even if her own mind had not been so far from all thought of that his kindness followed often upon some application of hers for his advice or help for she had fallen into the habit of going to him with difficulties he had a prompt common sense that made him very useful in emergencies and a sympathy or an insight that was quick in suggestions and expedients perhaps she overrated other qualities of his in her admiration of the practical readiness which kept his amiability from seeming weak but the practical had so often been the unattainable with her that it was not strange she should overrate it and that she should rest upon it in him with a trust that included all he chose to do in her behalf  what is the matter mr libby she asked as he came toward her  is anything the matter he demanded in turn  yes you are looking downcast she cried reproachfully  i didnt know that i mustnt look downcast i did nt suppose it would be very polite under the circumstances to go round looking as bobbish as i feel  its the best thing you could possibly do but youre not feeling very bobbish now a woman respects the word a man uses not because she would have chosen it but because she thinks that he has an exact intention in it which could not be reconveyed in a more feminine phrase in this way slang arises is nt it time for mr maynard to be here  yes he answered then how did you know i was thinking of that  i did nt i only happened to think it was time what are you keeping back mr libby she pursued tremulously  nothing upon my honor i almost wish there were something to keep back but there is nt anything there have nt been any accidents reported and i should nt keep anything back from you  why  because you would be equal to it whatever it was  i dont see why you say that she weakly found comfort in the praise which she might once have resented as patronage  i dont see why i should nt he retorted  because i am not fit to be trusted at all  do you mean  oh i havent the strength to mean anything she said but i thank you thank you very much she added she turned her head away  confound maynard cried the young man i dont see why he does nt come he must have started four days ago he ought to have had sense enough to telegraph when he did start i did nt tell his partner to ask him you cant think of everything ive been trying to find out something im going over to leyden now to try to wake up somebody in cheyenne who knows maynard he looked ruefully at grace who listened with anxious unintelligence youre getting worn out miss breen he said i wish i could ask you to go with me to leyden it would do you good but my mares fallen lame ive just been to see her is there anything i can do for you over there  why how are you going she asked  in my boat he answered consciously  the same boat  yes ive had her put to rights she was nt much damaged  she was silent a moment while he stood looking down at her in the chair into which she had sunk does it take you long  oh no its shorter than it is by land i shall have the tide with me both ways i can make the run there and back in a couple of hours  two hours  yes  a sudden impulse unreasoned and unreasonable in which there seemed hope of some such atonement or expiation as the same ascetic nature would once have found in fasting or the scourge prevailed with her she rose mr libby she panted if you will let me i should like to go with you in your boat do you think it will be rough  no its a light breeze just right you need nt be afraid  im not afraid i should not care if it were rough i should not care if it stormed i hope iti will ask mother to stay with mrs maynard  mrs breen had not been pleased to have her daughter in charge of mrs maynards case but she had not liked her giving it up she had said more than once that she had no faith in dr mulbridge she willingly consented to graces prayer and went down into mrs maynards room and insinuated misgivings in which the sick woman found so much reason that they began for the first time to recognize each others good qualities they decided that the treatment was not sufficiently active and that she should either have something that would be more loosening to the cough or some applicationlike mustard plastersto her feet so as to take away that stuffed feeling about the head  at that hour of the afternoon when most of the ladies were lying down in their rooms grace met no one on the beach but miss gleason and mrs alger who rose from their beds of sand under the cliff at her passage with mr libby to his dory  dont you want to go to leyden he asked jocosely over his shoulder  you dont mean to say youre going miss gleason demanded of grace  yes certainly why not  well you are brave  she shut her novel upon her thumb that she might have nothing to do but admire graces courage as the girl walked away  it will do her good poor thing said the elder woman she looks wretchedly  i can understand just why she does it murmured miss gleason in adoring rapture  i hope she does it for pleasure said mrs alger  it is nt that returned miss gleason mysteriously  at any rate mr libby seemed pleased  oh she would never marry him said miss gleason  the other laughed and at that moment grace also laughed the strong current of her purpose the sense of escape from the bitter servitude of the past week and the wild hope of final expiation through the chances she was tempting gave her a buoyancy long unfelt she laughed in gayety of heart as she helped the young man draw his dory down the sand and then took her place at one end while he gave it the last push and then leaped in at the other he pulled out to where the boat lay tilting at anchor and held the dory alongside by the gunwale that she might step aboard but after rising she faltered looking intently at the boat as if she missed something there  i thought you had a man to sail your boat  i had but i let him go last week perhaps i ought to have told you he said looking up at her aslant are you afraid to trust my seamanship adams was a mere form he behaved like a fool that day  oh im not afraid said grace she stepped from the dory into the boat and he flung out the dorys anchor and followed the sail went up with a pleasant clucking of the tackle and the light wind filled it libby made the sheet fast and sitting down in the stern on the other side took the tiller and headed the boat toward the town that shimmered in the distance the water hissed at the bow and seethed and sparkled from the stern the land breeze that bent their sail blew cool upon her cheek and freshened it with a tinge of color  this will do you good he said looking into hers with his kind gay eyes  the color in her cheeks deepened a little oh i am better than i look i did nt come for  for medicinal purposes well i am glad of it weve a good hour between us and news or no news from maynard and i should like to think we were out for pleasure you dont object  no you can even smoke if that will heighten the illusion  it will make it reality but you dont mean it  yes why not  i dont know but i could nt have dreamt of smoking in your presence and we take the liberty to dream very strange things  yes she said its shocking what things we do dream of people but am i so forbidding she asked a little sadly  not now said libby he got out a pouch of tobacco and some cigarette papers and putting the tiller under his arm he made himself a cigarette  you seem interested he said as he lifted his eyes from his work on which he found her intent and struck his fusee  i was admiring your skill she answered  do you think it was worth a voyage to south america  i shouldnt have thought the voyage was necessary  oh perhaps you think you can do it he said handing her the tobacco and papers she took them and made a cigarette it took me a whole day to learn to make bad ones and this is beautiful but i will never smoke it i will keep this always  you had better smoke it if you want more she said  will you make some more i cant smoke the first one  then smoke the last she said offering him the things back  no go on ill smoke it  she lent herself to the idle humor of the time and went on making cigarettes till there were no more papers from time to time she looked up from this labor and scanned the beautiful bay which they had almost wholly to themselves they passed a collier lagging in the deep channel and signalling for a pilot to take her up to the town a yacht trim and swift cut across their course the ladies on board waved a salutation with their handkerchiefs and libby responded  do you know them asked grace  no he laughed but ladies like to take these liberties at a safe distance  yes thats a specimen of womans daring she said with a selfscornful curl of the lip which presently softened into a wistful smile how lovely it all is she sighed  yes theres nothing better in all the world than a sail it is all the world while it lasts a boats like your own fireside for snugness  a dreamier light came into her eye which wandered with a turn of the head giving him the tender curve of her cheek over the levels of the bay roughened everywhere by the breeze but yellowish green in the channels and dark with the thick growth of eelgrass in the shallows then she lifted her face to the pale blue heavens in an effort that slanted towards him the soft round of her chin and showed her full throat  this is the kind of afternoon she said still looking at the sky that you think will never end  i wish it would nt he answered  she lowered her eyes to his and asked do you have times when you are sorry that you ever tried to do anythingwhen it seems foolish to have tried  i have the other kind of timeswhen i wish that i had tried to do something  oh yes i have those too its wholesome to be ashamed of not having tried to do anything but to be ashamed of having triedits like death there seems no recovery from that  he did not take advantage of her confession or try to tempt her to further confidence and women like men who have this wisdom or this instinctive generosity and trust them further  and the worst of it is that you cant go back and be like those that have never tried at all if you could that would be some consolation for having failed there is nothing left of you but your mistake  well he said some people are not even mistakes i suppose that almost any sort of success looks a good deal like failure from the inside it must be a poor creature that comes up to his own mark the best way is not to have any mark and then youre in no danger of not coming up to it he laughed but she smiled sadly  you dont believe in thinking about yourself she said  oh i try a little introspection now and then but i soon get through there isnt much of me to think about  no dont talk in that way she pleaded and she was very charming in her earnestness it was there that her charm lay i want you to be serious with me and tell metell me how men feel when  a sudden splashing startled her and looking round she saw a multitude of curious greateyed black heads something like the heads of boys and something like the heads of dogs thrusting from the water and flashing under it again at sight of them with a swish that sent the spray into the air she sprang to her feet oh look at those things look at them look at them she laid vehement hands upon the young man and pushed him in the direction in which she wished him to look at some risk of pushing him overboard while he laughed at her ecstasy  theyre seals the bays full of them did you never see them on the reef at jocelyns  i never saw them before she cried how wonderful they are oh she shouted as one of them glanced sadly at her over its shoulder and then vanished with a whirl of the head the beatrice cenci attitude  they re always trying that said libby look yonder he pointed to a bank of mud which the tide had not yet covered and where a herd of seals lay basking in the sun they started at his voice and wriggling and twisting and bumping themselves over the earth to the waters edge they plunged in their walk isnt so graceful as their swim would you like one for a pet miss breen thats all they re good for since kerosene came in they cant compete with that and theyre not the kind that wear the cloaks  she was standing with her hand pressed hard upon his shoulder  did they ever kill them  they used to take that precaution  with those eyes it was murder she withdrew her hand and sat down  well they only catch them now i tried it myself once i set out at low tide about ten oclock one night and got between the water and the biggest seal on the bank we fought it out on that line till daylight  and did you get it she demanded absurdly interested  no it got me the tide came in and the seal beat  i am glad of that  thank you  what did you want with it  i dont think i wanted it at all at any rate thats what i always said i shall have to ask you to sit on this side he added loosening the sheet and preparing to shift the sail the wind has backed round a little more to the south and its getting lighter  if its going down we shall be late she said with an intimation of apprehension  we shall be at leyden on time if the wind falls then i can get a horse at the stable and have you driven back  well  he kept scanning the sky then did you ever hear them whistle for a wind he asked  no what is it like  when adams does it its like this he put on a furtive look and glanced once or twice at her askance well he said with the reproduction of a strong nasal of course i dont believe theres anything in it of course its all foolishness now you must urge me a little he added in his own manner  oh by all means go on mr adams she cried with a laugh  he rolled his head again to one side sheepishly  well i dont presume it does have anything to do with the windwell i dont presume it does he was silent long enough to whet an imagined expectation then he set his face towards the sky and began a soft low coaxing sibilation between his teeth ssss ssssss well it dont stand to reason it can bring the windsssssss ssss why of course it s all foolishness ssss he continued to emit these sibilants interspersing them with adamss protests suddenly the sail pulled the loose sheet taut and the boat leaped forward over the water  wonderful cried the girl  thats what i said to adams or words to that effect but i thought we should get it from the look of the sky before i proposed to whistle for it now then he continued i will be serious if you like  serious  yes didnt you ask me to be serious just before those seals interrupted you  oh she exclaimed coloring a little i dont think we can go back to that now he did not insist and she said presently i thought the sailors had a superstition about ships that are lucky and unlucky but youve kept your boat  i kept her for luck the lightning never strikes twice in the same place and i never saw a boat that behaved so well  do you call it behaving well to tip over  she behaved well before that she didnt tip over outside the reef  it certainly goes very smoothly said the girl she had in vain recurred to the tragic motive of her coming she could not revive it there had been nothing like expiation in this eventless voyage it had been a pleasure and no penance she abandoned herself with a weak luxury to the respite from suffering and anxiety she made herself the good comrade of the young man whom perhaps she even tempted to flatter her farther and farther out of the dreariness in which she had dwelt and if any woful current of feeling swept beneath she would not fathom it but resolutely floated as one may at such times on the surface they laughed together and jested they talked in the gay idleness of such rare moods  they passed a yacht at anchor and a young fellow in a white duck cap leaning over the rail saluted libby with the significant gravity which one young man uses towards another whom he sees in a sailboat with a pretty girl  she laughed at this do you know your friend she asked  yes this time i do  he fancies you are taking some young lady a sail what would he say if you were to stop and introduce me to him as dr breen  oh he knows who you are its johnson  the one whose clothes you came over in that morning  yes i suppose you laughed at me  i liked your having the courage to do it but how does he know me  ii described you hes rather an old friend this also amused her i should like to hear how you described me  i will tell you sometime it was an elaborate description i could nt get through with it now before we landed  the old town had come out of the haze of the distancea straggling village of weatherbeaten wood and weatherbeaten white paint picturesque but no longer a vision of gray stone and pale marble a coalyard and a brick locomotive house and rambling railroad sheds stretched along the waterfront they found their way easily enough through the sparse shipping to the steps at the end of the wooden pier where libby dropped the sail and made his boat fast  a little pleasant giddiness as if the lightness of her heart had mounted to her head made her glad of his arm up these steps and up the wharf and she kept it as they climbed the sloping elmshaded village street to the main thoroughfare with its brick sidewalks its shops and awnings and its cheerful stir and traffic  the telegraph office fronted the head of the street which they had ascended you can sit here in the apothecarys till i come down he said  do you think that will be professionally appropriate i am only a nurse now  no i wasnt thinking of that but i saw a chair in there and we can make a pretense of wanting some soda it is the proper thing to treat young ladies to soda when one brings them in from the country  it does have that appearance she assented with a smile she kept him waiting with what would have looked like coquettish hesitation in another while she glanced at the windows overhead pierced by a skein of converging wires suppose i go up with you  i should like that better he said and she followed him lightly up the stairs that led to the telegraph office a young man stood at the machine with a cigar in his mouth and his eyes intent upon the ribbon of paper unreeling itself before him  just hold on he said to libby without turning his head ive got something here for you he read despatch received yesterday coming right through george maynard  good cried libby  dated council bluffs want it written out  no what s to pay  paid said the operator  the laconically transacted business ended with this the wire began to cluck again like the anxious hen whose manner the most awful and mysterious of the elements assumes in becoming articulate and nothing remained for them but to come away  that was what i was afraid of said libby maynard was at his ranch and it must have been a good way out theyre fifty or sixty miles out sometimes that would account for the delay well mrs maynard doesnt know how long it takes to come from cheyenne and we can tell her hes on the way and has telegraphed they were walking rapidly down the street to the wharf where his boat lay oh he exclaimed halting abruptly i promised to send you back by land if you preferred  has the wind fallen  oh no we shall have a good breeze  i wont put you to the trouble of getting a horse i can go back perfectly well in the boat  well thats what i think he said cheerily  she did not respond and he could not be aware that any change had come over her mood but when they were once more seated in the boat and the sail was pulling in the fresh breeze she turned to him with a scarcely concealed indignation have you a fancy for experimenting upon people mr libby  experimenting i i dont know in the least what you mean  why did you tell me that the operator was a woman  because the other operator is he answered  oh she said and fell blankly silent  there is a good deal of business there they have to have two operators he explained after a pause  why of course she murmured in deep humiliation if he had suffered her to be silent as long as she would she might have offered him some reparation but he spoke  why did you think i had been experimenting on you he asked  why she repeated the sense of having put herself in the wrong exasperated her with him oh i dare say you were curious dont you suppose i have noticed that men are puzzled at me what did you mean by saying that you thought i would be equal to anything  i meanti thought you would like to be treated frankly  and you would nt treat everybody so  i wouldnt treat mrs maynard so  oh she said you treat me upon a theory  dont you like that we treat everybody upon a theory  yes i know  and i should tell you the worst of anything at once because i think you are one of the kind that dont like to have their conclusions made for them  and you would really let women make their own conclusions she said you are very peculiar she waited a while and then she asked and what is your theory of me  that you are very peculiar  how  you are proud  and is pride so very peculiar  yes in women  indeed you set up for a connoisseur of female character thats very common nowadays why dont you tell me something more about yourself were always talking about me  he might well have been doubtful of her humor he seemed to decide that she was jesting for he answered lightly why you began it  i know i did this time but now i wish to stop it too  he looked down at the tiller in his hands well he said i should like to tell you about myself i should like to know what you think of the kind of man i am will you be honest if i will  thats a very strange condition she answered meeting and then avoiding the gaze he lifted to her face  what being honest  well noor yes  it is nt for you  thank you but im not under discussion now  well in the first place he began i was afraid of you when we met  afraid of me  that is nt the word perhaps well say ashamed of myself mrs maynard told me about you and i thought you would despise me for not doing or being anything in particular i thought you must  indeed  he hesitated as if still uncertain of her mood from this intonation and then he went on but i had some little hope you would tolerate me after all you looked like a friend i used to havedo you mind my telling you  oh no though i cant say that its ever very comfortable to be told that you look like some one else  i dont suppose any one else would have been struck by the resemblance said libby with a laugh of reminiscence he was huge but he had eyes like a girli beg your pardonlike yours  you mean that i have eyes like a man  he laughed and said no and then turned grave as long as he lived  oh is he dead she asked more gently than she had yet spoken  yes he died just before i went abroad i went out on business for my fatherhes an importer and jobberand bought goods for him do you despise business  i dont know anything about it  i did it to please my father and he said i was a very good buyer he thinks theres nothing like buyingexcept selling he used to sell things himself over the counter and not so long ago either  i fancied it made a difference for me when i was in college and that the yardstick came between me and society i was an ass for thinking anything about it though i did nt really care much i never liked society and i did like boats and horses i thought of a profession once but it would nt work ive been round the world twice and ive done nothing but enjoy myself since i left collegeor try to when i first saw you i was hesitating about letting my father make me of use he wants me to become one of the most respectable members of society he wants me to be a cottonspinner you know there s nothing so irreproachable as cotton for a business  no i dont know about those things  well there is nt when i was abroad buying and selling i made a little discovery i found that there were goods we could make and sell in the european market cheaper than the english and that gave my father the notion of buying a mill to make them im boring you  no  well he bought it and he wants me to take charge of it  and shall you  do you think im fit for it  i how should i know  you dont know cotton but you know me a little do i strike you as fit for anything she made no reply to this and he laughed i assure you i felt small enough when i heard what you had done and thoughtwhat i had done it gave me a start and i wrote my father that night that i would go in for it  i once thought of going to a factory town she answered without wilful evasion to begin my practice there among the operatives children i should have done it if it had not been for coming here with mrs maynard it would have been better  come to my factory town miss breen there ought to be fevers there in the autumn with all the low lands that im allowed to flood mrs maynard told me about your plan  pray what else did mrs maynard tell you about me  about your taking up a profession in the way you did when you neednt and when you did nt particularly like it  oh she said then she added and because i was nt obliged to it and did nt like it you tolerated me  tolerated he echoed  this vexed her yes tolerate everybody interested or not has to make up his mind whether to tolerate me as soon as he hears what i am what excuse did you make for me  i did nt make any said libby  but you had your misgiving your surprise  i thought if you could stand it other people might i thought it was your affair  just as if i had been a young man  no that wasnt possible  she was silent then the conversation has got back into the old quarter she said you are talking about me again have you heard from your friends since they went away  what friends  those you were camping with  no  what did they say when they heard that you had found a young doctress at jocelyns how did you break the fact to them what jokes did they make you need nt be afraid to tell me she cried give me mr johnsons comments  he looked at her in surprise that incensed her still more and rendered her incapable of regarding the pain with which he answered her i m afraid he said that i have done something to offend you  oh no what could you have done  then you really mean to ask me whether i would let any one make a joke of you in my presence  yes why not  because it was impossible he answered  why was it impossible she pursued  becausei love you  she had been looking him defiantly in the eyes and she could not withdraw her gaze for the endless moment that ensued her breath was taken away then she asked in a low steady voice did you mean to say that  no  i believe you and i forgive you no no she cried at a demonstration of protest from him dont speak again  he obeyed instantly implicitly with the tiller in his hand he looked past her and guided the boats course it became intolerable  have i ever done anything that gave you the right totosay that she asked without the selfcommand which she might have wished to show  no he said you were only the most beautiful  i am not beautiful and if i were  it wasnt to be helped i saw from the first how good and noble you were and  this is absurd she exclaimed i am neither good nor noble and if i were  it wouldnt make any difference whatever you are you are the one woman in the world to me and you always will be  mr libby  oh i must speak now you were always thinking because you had studied a mans profession that no one would think of you as a woman as if that could make any difference to a man that had the soul of a man in him  no no she protested i did nt think that i always expected to be considered as a woman  but not as a woman to fall in love with i understood and that somehow made you all the dearer to me if you had been a girl like other girls i should nt have cared for you  oh  i did nt mean to speak to you today but sometime i did mean to speak because whatever i was i loved you and i thought you did nt dislike me  i did like you she murmured very much and i respected you but you cant say that i ever gave you any hope in thisthisway she almost asked him if she had  nonot purposely and if you did it s over now you have rejected me i understand that theres no reason why you shouldnt and i can hold my tongue he did not turn but looked steadily past her at the boats head  an emotion stirred in her breast which took the form of a reproach was it fair then to say this when neither of us could escape afterwards  i did nt mean to speak he said without looking up and i never meant to place you where you could nt escape  it was true that she had proposed to go with him in the boat and that she had chosen to come back with him when he had offered to have her driven home from leyden no you are not to blame she said at last i asked to some with you shall i tell you why her voice began to break in her pity for him and her shame for herself the tears started to her eyes she did not press her question but thank you for reminding me that i invited myself to go with you she said with feeble bitterness  he looked up at her in silent wonder and she broke into a sob he said gently i dont suppose you expect me to deny that you dont think me such a poor dog as that  why of course not she answered with quivering lips while she pressed her handkerchief to her eyes  i was only too glad to have you come i always meant to tell youwhat i have told but not when i should seem to trap you into listening  no she murmured i can believe that of you i do believe it i take back what i said dont let us speak of it any more now she continued struggling for her lost composure with what success appeared in the fresh outburst with which she recognized his forbearance to hint at any painfulness to himself in the situation  i dont mind it so much on my account but oh how could you for your own sake do let us get home as fast as we can  i am doing everything i can to release you he said if you will sit here he added indicating the place beside him in the stern you wont have to change so much when i want to tack  she took the other seat and for the first time she noticed that the wind had grown very light she watched him with a piteous impatience while he shifted the sail from side to side keeping the sheet in his hand for convenience in the frequent changes he scanned the sky and turned every current of the ebbing tide to account it was useless the boat crept and presently it scarcely moved  the wind is down he said making the sheet fast and relaxing his hold on the tiller  andand the tide is going out she exclaimed  the tide is going out he admitted  if we should get caught on these flats she began with rising indignation  we should have to stay till the tide turned  she looked wildly about for aid if there were a rowboat anywhere within hail she could be taken to jocelyns in that but they were quite alone on those lifeless waters  libby got out a pair of heavy oars from the bottom of the boat and setting the rowlocks on either side tugged silently at them  the futile effort suggested an idea to her which doubtless she would not have expressed if she had not been lacking as she once said in a sense of humor  why dont you whistle for a wind  he stared at her in sad astonishment to make sure that she was in earnest and then whistle he echoed forlornly and broke into a joyless laugh  you knew the chances of delay that i took in asking to come with you she cried and you should have warned me it was ungenerousit was ungentlemanly  it was whatever you like i must be to blame i suppose i was too glad to have you come if i thought anything i thought you must have some particular errand at leyden you seemed anxious to go even if it stormed  if it had stormed she retorted i should not have cared i hoped it would storm then at least i should have run the same dangeri hoped it would be dangerous  i dont understand what you mean he said  i forced that wretched creature to go with you that day when you said it was going to be rough and i shall have her blood upon my hands if she dies  is it possible cried libby pulling in his useless oars and leaning forward upon them that she has gone on letting you think i believed there was going to be a storm she knew perfectly well that i didnt mind what adams said he was always croaking she sat looking at him in a daze but she could not speak and he continued i see it happened by one chance in a million to turn out as he said and she has been making you pay for it why i suppose he added with a melancholy smile of intelligence shes had so much satisfaction in holding you responsible for whats happened that shes almost glad of it  she has tortured me cried the girl but youyou when you saw that i did nt believe there was going to be any storm why did youwhy didntyou  i did nt believe it either it was mrs maynard that proposed the sail but when i saw that you did nt like it i was glad of any excuse for putting it off i could nt help wanting to please you and i couldnt see why you urged us afterwards but i supposed you had some reason  she passed her hand over her forehead as if to clear away the confusion in which all this involved her but whywhy did you let me go on thinking myself to blame  how could i know what you were thinking heaven knows i didnt dream of such a thing though i remember now your saying  oh i see she cried you are a man but i cant forgive itno i cant forgive it you wished to deceive her if you did nt wish to deceive me how can you excuse yourself for repeating what you did nt believe  i was willing she should think adams was right  and that was deceit what can you say to it  there is only one thing i could say he murmured looking hopelessly into her eyes and thats of no use  she turned her head away her tragedy had fallen to nothing or rather it had never been all her remorse all her suffering was mere farce now but his guilt in the matter was the greater a fierce resentment burned in her heart she longed to make him feel something of the anguish she had needlessly undergone  he sat watching her averted face miss breen he said huskily will you let me speak to you  oh you have me in your power she answered cruelly say what you like  he did not speak nor make any motion to do so  a foolish idle curiosity to know what after all that had happened he could possibly have to say stirred within her but she disdainfully stifled it they were both so still that a company of seals found it safe to put their heads above water and approach near enough to examine her with their round soft eyes she turned from the silly things in contempt that they should even have interested her she felt that from time to time her companion lifted an anxious glance to the dull heavens at last the limp sail faintly stirred it flapped it filled shallowly the boat moved the sail seemed to have had a prescience of the wind before it passed over the smooth water like a shadow  when a woman says she never will forgive a man she always has a condition of forgiveness in her heart now that the wind had risen again i have no right to forbid you to speak she said as if no silence had elapsed and she turned round and quietly confronted him she no longer felt so impatient to escape  he did not meet her eye at once and he seemed in no haste to avail himself of the leave granted him a heavy sadness blotted the gayety of a face whose sunny sympathy had been her only cheer for many days she fancied a bewilderment in its hopelessness which smote her with still sharper pathos of course she said i appreciate your wish to do what i wanted about mrs maynard i remember my telling you that she ought nt to go out that day but that was not the way to do it  there was no other he said  no she assented upon reflection then it ought nt to have been done  he showed no sign of intending to continue and after a moment of restlessness she began again  if i have been rude or hasty in refusing to hear you mr libby i am very wrong i must hear anything you have to say  oh not unless you wish  i wish whatever you wish  im not sure that i wish that now i have thought it over i should only distress you for nothing you are letting me say why sentence shouldnt be passed upon me sentence is going to be passed any way i should only repeat what i have said you would pity me but you couldnt help me and that would give you pain for nothing no it would be useless  it would be useless to talk to me aboutloving she took the word on her lips with a certain effect of adopting it for convenience sake in her vocabulary all that was ended for me long agoten years ago and my whole life since then has been shaped to do without it i will tell you my story if you like perhaps its your due i wish to be just you may have a right to know  no i havent butperhaps i ought to say that mrs maynard told me something  well i am glad of that though she had no right to do it then you can understand  oh yes i can understand i dont pretend that i had any reason in it  he forbore again to urge any plea for himself and once more she was obliged to interfere in his behalf mr libby i have never confessed that i once wronged you in a way that im very sorry for  about mrs maynard yes i know i wont try to whitewash myself but it didnt occur to me how it would look i wanted to talk with her about you  you ought to have considered her though she said gently  she ought to have considered herself he retorted with his unfailing bitterness for mrs maynard but it doesnt matter whose fault it was im sufficiently punished for i know that it injured me with you  it did at first but now i can see that i was wrong i wished to tell you that it isnt creditable to me that i thought you intended to flirt with her if i had been better myself  you he could not say more  that utter faith in her was very charming it softened her more and more it made her wish to reason with him and try gently to show him how impossible his hope was and you know she said recurring to something that had gone before that even if i had cared for you in the way you wish it could nt be you would nt want to have people laughing and saying i had been a doctress  i shouldnt have minded i know how much peoples talk is worth  yes she said i know you would be generous and brave about thatabout anything but whatwhat if i could nt give up my careermy hopes of being useful in the way i have planned you would nt have liked me to go on practising medicine  i thought of that he answered simply i didnt see how it could be done but if you saw any way i was willingno that was my great trouble i knew that it was selfish in me and very conceited to suppose you would give up your whole life for me and whenever i thought of that i determined not to ask you but i tried not to think of that  well dont you see but if i could have answered you as you wish it wouldnt have been anything to give up everything for you a woman isnt something else first and a woman afterwards i understand how unselfishly you meant and indeed indeed i thank you but dont lets talk of it any more it couldnt have been and there is nothing but misery in thinking of it come she said with a struggle for cheerfulness let us forget it let it be just as if you hadnt spoken to me i know you did nt intend to do it and let us go on as if nothing had happened  oh we cant go on he answered i shall get away as soon as maynard comes and rid you of the sight of me  are you going away she softly asked why need you i know that people always seem to think they cant be friends aftersuch a thing as this but why shouldnt we i respect you and i like you very much you have shown me more regard and more kindness than any other friend  but i wasnt your friend he interrupted i loved you  well she sighed in gentle perplexity then you cant be my friend  never but i shall always love you if it would do any good i would stay as you ask it i should nt mind myself but i should be a nuisance to you  no no she exclaimed i will take the risk of that i need your advice yoursympathy youryou wont trouble me indeed you wont perhaps you have mistaken yourfeeling about me its such a very little time since we met she pleaded  that makes no differencethe time and im not mistaken  well stay at least till mrs maynard is well and we can all go away together promise me that she instinctively put out her hand toward him in entreaty he took it and pressing it to his lips covered it with kisses  oh she grieved in reproachful surprise  there he cried you see that i must go  yes she sighed in assent you must go  they did not look at each other again but remained in a lamentable silence while the boat pushed swiftly before the freshening breeze and when they reached the place where the dory lay he dropped the sail and threw out the anchor without a word  he was haggard to the glance she stole at him when they had taken their places in the dory and he confronted her pulling hard at the oars he did not lift his eyes to hers but from time to time he looked over his shoulder at the boats prow and he rowed from one point to another for a good landing a dreamy pity for him filled her through the memories of her own suffering she divined the soreness of his heart  she started from her reverie as the bottom of the dory struck the sand the shoal water stretched twenty feet beyond he pulled in the oars and rose desperately its of no use i shall have to carry you ashore  she sat staring up into his face and longing to ask him something to accuse him of having done this purposely but she had erred in so many doubts her suspicions of him had all recoiled so pitilessly upon her that she had no longer the courage to question or reproach him oh no thank you she said weakly i wont trouble you ii will wait till the tide is out  the tides out now he answered with coldness and you cant wade  she rose desperately why of course she cried in selfcontempt glancing at the water into which he promptly stepped to his boottops a woman must nt get her feet wet     viii  grace went to her own room to lay aside her shawl and hat before going to mrs maynard and found her mother sewing there  why who is with mrs maynard she asked  miss gleason is reading to her said mrs breen if she had any sort of active treatment she could get well at once i couldnt take the responsibility of doing anything for her and it was such a worry to stay and see everything going wrong that when miss gleason came in i was glad to get away miss gleason seems to believe in your dr mulbridge  my dr mulbridge echoed grace  she talked of him as if he were yours i dont know what youve been saying to her about him but you had better be careful the woman is a fool she now looked up at her daughter for the first time why what is the matter with you what kept you so long you look perfectly wild  i feel wild said grace calmly the wind went down  was that all i dont see why that should make you feel wild said her mother dropping her spectacles to her sewing again  it was nt all answered the girl sinking provisionally upon the side of a chair with her shawl still on her arm and her hat in her hand mother have you noticed anything peculiar about mr libby  hes the only person who seems to be of the slightest use about here ive noticed that said mrs breen hes always going and coming for you and mrs maynard where is that worthless husband of hers has nt he had time to come from cheyenne yet  hes on the way he was out at his ranch when mr libby telegraphed first and had to be sent for we found a despatch from him at leyden saying he had started grace explained  what business had he to be so far away at all demanded her mother it was plain that mrs breen was in her most censorious temper which had probably acquired a sharper edge towards maynard from her reconciliation with his wife  grace seized her chance to meet the worst do you think that i have done anything to encourage mr libby she asked looking bravely at her mother  encourage him to do what asked mrs breen without lifting her eyes from her work  encouraged him tothink i cared for him toto be in love with me  mrs breen lifted her head now and pushed her spectacles up on her forehead while she regarded her daughter in silence has he been making love to you  yes  her mother pushed her spectacles down again and turning the seam which she had been sewing flattened it with her thumbnail she made this action expressive of having foreseen such a result and of having struggled against it neglected and alone very well then i hope you accepted him she asked quietly  mother  why not you must like him she continued in the same tone you have been with him every moment the last week that you have nt been with mrs maynard at least ive seen nothing of you except when you came to tell me you were going to walk or to drive with him you seem to have asked him to take you most of the time  how can you say such a thing mother cried the girl  did nt you ask him to let you go with him this afternoon you told me you did  yes i did i did it for a purpose  ah for a purpose said mrs breen taking a survey of the new seam which she pulled from her knee where one end of it was pinned towards her chin she left the word to her daughter who was obliged to take it  i asked him to let me go with him because louise had tortured me about making her go out in his boat till i could nt bear it any longer it seemed to me that if i took the same risk myself it would be something and i hoped there would be a storm  i should think you had taken leave of your senses mrs breen observed with her spectacles intent upon her seam did you think it would be any consolation to him if you were drowned or to her and if she added her conscience rising equal to the vicarious demand upon it you hoped there would be danger had you any right to expose him to it even if you chose to risk your own life you had no right to risk his she lifted her spectacles again and turned their austere glitter upon her daughter  yes it all seems very silly now said the girl with a hopeless sigh  silly cried her mother im glad you can call it silly  and it seemed worse still when he told me that he had never believed it was going to storm that day when he took louise out his man said it was and he repeated it because he saw i did nt want her to go  perhaps suggested mrs breen if he was willing to deceive her then he is willing to deceive you now  he didnt deceive her he said what he had heard and he said it because hei wished it  i call it deceiving truth is truth that is what i was taught and thats what i supposed i had taught you  i would trust mr libby in anything returned the daughter he is perfectly frank about himself he confessed that he had done it to please me he said that nothing else could excuse it  oh then you have accepted him  no mother i havent i have refused him and he is going away as soon as mr maynard comes she sat looking at the window and the tears stole into her eyes and blurred the sea and sky together where she saw their meeting at the horizon line  well said her mother their that is the end of it i presume  yes thats the end said grace buti felt sorry for him mother once she went on i thought i had everything clear before me but now i seem only to have made confusion of my life yes she added drearily it was foolish and wicked and it was perfectly useless too i cant escape from the consequences of what i did it makes no difference what he believed or any one believed i drove them on to risk their lives because i thought myself so much better than they because i was selfrighteous and suspicious and stubborn well i must bear the penalty and oh if i could only bear it alone with a long sigh she took back the burden which she had been struggling to cast off and from which for a time she had actually seemed to escape she put away her hat and shawl and stood before the glass smoothing her hair when will it ever end she moaned to the reflection there rather than to her mother who did not interrupt this spiritual ordeal in another age such a new england girl would have tortured herself with inquisition as to some neglected duty to godin ours when religion is so largely humanified this puritan soul could only wreak itself in a sense of irreparable wrong to her fellowcreature  when she went out she met miss gleason halfway down the corridor to mrs maynards door the latter had a book in her hand and came forward whispering shes asleep she said very sibilantly i have read her to sleep and shes sleeping beautifully have you ever read it she asked with hoarse breaks from her undertone as she held up one of those cheap libraryeditions of a novel toward grace  jane eyre why of course long ago  so have i said miss gleason but i sent and got it again to refresh my impressions of rochester we all think dr mulbridge is just like him rochester is my ideal charactera perfect conception of a man so abrupt so rough so savage oh i like those men dont you she fluted mrs maynard sees the resemblance as well as the rest of us but i know you dont approve of them i suppose they cant be defended on some grounds but i can see how even in such a case as this the perfect mastery of the manphysician constitutes the highest usefulness of the womanphysician the advancement of women must be as women male and female created he them and it is only in remembering this that we are helping gawd whether as an anthropomorphic conception or a universally pervading instinct of love dont you think  with her novel clapped against her breast she leaned winningly over toward grace and fixed her with her wide eyes which had rings of white round the pupils  do tell me she ran on without waiting an answer didnt you go with mr libby because you hoped it might storm and wished to take the same risk as mrs maynard i told mrs alger you did  grace flushed guiltily and miss gleason cowered a little perhaps interpreting the color as resentment i should consider that a very silly motive she said helplessly ashamed that she was leaving the weight of the blow upon miss gleasons shoulders instead of her own  of course said miss gleason enthusiastically you cant confess it but i know you are capable of such a thingof anything heroic do forgive me she said seizing graces hand she held it a moment gazing with a devouring fondness into her face which she stooped a little sidewise to peer up into then she quickly dropped her hand and whirling away glided slimly out of the corridor  grace softly opened mrs maynards door and the sick woman opened her eyes i was nt asleep she said hoarsely but i had to pretend to be or that woman would have killed me  grace went to her and felt her hands and her flushed forehead  i am worse this evening said mrs maynard  oh no sighed the girl dropping into a chair at the bedside with her eyes fixed in a sort of fascination on the lurid face of the sick woman  after getting me here continued mrs maynard in the same low hoarse murmur you might at least stay with me a little what kept you so long  the wind fell we were becalmed  we were not becalmed the day i went out with mr libby but perhaps nobody forced you to go  having launched this dart she closed her eyes again with something more like content than she had yet shown it had an aim of which she could always be sure  we have heard from mr maynard said grace humbly there was a despatch waiting for mr libby at leyden he is on his way  mrs maynard betrayed no immediate effect of this other than to say he had better hurry and did not open her eyes  grace went about the room with a leaden weight in every fibre putting the place in order and mrs maynard did not speak again till she had finished then she said i want you to tell me just how bad dr mulbridge thinks i am  he has never expressed any anxiety grace began with her inaptness at evasion  of course he has nt murmured the sick woman he isnt a fool what does he say  this passed the sufferance even of remorse he says you mustnt talk the girl flashed out and if you insist upon doing so i will leave you and send some one else to take care of you  very well then i know what that means when a doctor tells you not to talk its because he knows he cant do you any good as soon as george maynard gets here i will have some one that can cure me or i will know the reason why the conception of her husband as a champion seemed to commend him to her in novel degree she shed some tears and after a little reflection she asked how soon will he be here  i dont know said grace he seems to have started yesterday morning  he can be here by day after tomorrow mrs maynard computed there will be some one to look after poor little bella then she added as if during her sickness bella must have been wholly neglected dont let the child be all dirt when her father comes  mother will look after bella grace replied too meek again to resent the implication after a pause oh louise she added beseechingly ive suffered so much from my own wrongheadedness and obstinacy that i couldnt bear to see you taking the same risk and im so glad that you are going to meet your husband in the right spirit  what right spirit croaked mrs maynard  the wish to please him to  i dont choose to have him say that his child disgraces him replied mrs maynard in the low husky monotonous murmur in which she was obliged to utter everything  but dear louise cried the other you choose something else too dont you you wish to meet him as if no unkindness had parted you and as if you were to be always together after this i hope you do then i should feel that all this suffering and trouble was a mercy  other peoples misery is always a mercy to them hoarsely suggested mrs maynard  yes i know that grace submitted with meek conviction but louise she pleaded you will make up with your husband wont you whatever he has done that will surely be best i know that you love him and that he must love you yet its the only way if you were finally separated from him and you and he could be happy apart what would become of that poor child who will take a fathers place with her thats the worst about it oh louise i feel so badly for youfor what you have lost and may lose marriage must change people so that unless they live to each other their lives will be maimed and useless it ought to be so much easier to forgive any wrong your husband does you than to punish it for that perpetuates the wrong and forgiveness ends it and its the only thing that can end a wrong i am sure that your husband will be ready to do or say anything you wish but if he shouldnt louise you will receive him forgivingly and make the first advance its a womans right to make the advances in forgiving  mrs maynard lay with her hands stretched at her side under the covering and only her face visible above it she now turned her head a little so as to pierce the earnest speaker with a gleam from her dull eye have you accepted walter libby she asked  louise cried grace with a blush that burned like fire  thats the way i used to talk when i was first engaged wait till youre married a while i want bella to have on her pique and her pink sashnot the cherry one i should think you would have studied to be a minister instead of a doctor but you need nt preach to me i shall know how to behave to george maynard when he comesif he ever does come and now i should think you had made me talk enough  yes yes said grace recalled to her more immediate duty in alarm  all her helpfulness was soon to be needed the disease which had lingered more than usual in the early stages suddenly approached a crisis that night mrs maynard grew so much worse that grace sent libby at daybreak for dr mulbridge and the young man after leading out his own mare to see if her lameness had abated ruefully put her back in the stable and set off to corbitant with the splayfoot at a rate of speed unparalleled probably in the animals recollection of a long and useful life in the two anxious days that followed libby and grace were associated in the freedom of a common interest outside of themselves she went to him for help and suggestion and he gave them as if nothing had passed to restrict or embarrass their relations there was that in fact in the awe of the time and an involuntary disoccupation of hers that threw them together even more constantly than before dr mulbridge remained with his patient well into the forenoon in the afternoon he came again and that night he did not go away he superseded grace as a nurse no less completely than he had displaced her as a physician he let her relieve him when he flung himself down for a few minutes sleep or when he went out for the huge meals which he devoured preferring the unwholesome things with a depravity shocking to the tender physical consciences of the ladies who looked on but when he returned to his charge he showed himself jealous of all that grace had done involving the exercise of more than a servile discretion when she asked him once if there were nothing else that she could do he said fires keep those women and children quiet in a tone that classed her with both she longed to ask him what he thought of mrs may nards condition but she had not the courage to invoke the intelligence that ignored her so completely and she struggled in silence with such disheartening auguries as her theoretical science enabled her to make  the next day was a sunday and the sabbath hush which always hung over jocelyns was intensified to the sense of those who ached between hope and fear for the life that seemed to waver and flicker in that still air dr mulbridge watched beside his patient noting every change with a wary intelligence which no fact escaped and no anxiety clouded alert gentle prompt suffering no question and absolutely silent as to all impressions he allowed grace to remain with him when she liked and let her do his bidding in minor matters but when from time to time she escaped from the intolerable tension in which his reticence and her own fear held her he did not seem to see whether she went or came toward nightfall she met him coming out of mrs maynards room as she drew near in the narrow corridor  where is your friendthe young manthe one who smokes he asked as if nothing unusual had occupied him i want him to give me a cigar  dr mulbridge she said i will not bear this any longer i must know the worstyou have no right to treat me in this way tell me nowtell me instantly will she live  he looked at her with an imaginable apprehension of hysterics but as she continued firm and placed herself resolutely in his way he relaxed his scrutiny and said with a smile oh i think so what made you think she would nt  she drew herself aside and made way far him  go she cried she would have said more but her indignation choked her  he did not pass at once and he did not seem troubled at her anger dr breen he said i saw a good deal of pneumonia in the army and i dont remember a single case that was saved by the anxiety of the surgeon  he went now as people do when they fancy themselves to have made a good point and she heard him asking barlow for libby outside and then walking over the gravel toward the stable at that moment she doubted and hated him so much that she world have been glad to keep libby from talking or even smoking with him but she relented a little toward him afterwards when he returned and resumed the charge of his patient with the gentle vigilant cheerfulness which she had admired in him from the first omitting no care and betraying none he appeared to take it for granted that grace saw an improvement but he recognized it by nothing explicit till he rose and said i think i will leave mrs maynard with you tonight dr breen  the sick womans eyes turned to him imploringly from her pillow and grace spoke the terror of both when she faltered in return are youyou are not going home  i shall sleep in the house  oh thank you she cried fervently  and you can call me if you wish but there wont be any occasion mrs maynard is very much better he waited to give in a sort of absentminded way certain directions then he went out and grace sank back into the chair from which she had started at his rising and wept long and silently with a hidden face when she took away her hands and dried her tears she saw mrs maynard beckoning to her she went to the bedside  what is it dear she asked tenderly  stoop down whispered the other and as grace bowed her ear mrs maynard touched her cheek with her dry lips in this kiss doubtless she forgave the wrong which she had hoarded in her heart and there perverted into a deadly injury but they both knew upon what terms the pardon was accorded and that if mrs maynard had died she would have died holding grace answerable for her undoing     ix  in the morning dr mulbridge drove back to corbitant and in the evening libby came over from new leyden with maynard in a hired wagon he was a day later than his wife had computed but as she appeared to have reflected she had left the intervening sunday out of her calculation this was one of the few things she taxed herself to say for the rest she seemed to be hoarding her strength against his coming  grace met him at a little distance from the house whither she had walked with bella for a breath of the fresh air after her long day in the sickroom and did not find him the boisterous and jovial hoosier she had imagined him it was in fact hardly the moment for the expression of western humor he arrived a sleepbroken travelcreased figure with more than the western mans usual indifference to dress with sad dull eyes and an untrimmed beard that hung in points and tags and thinly hid the corners of a large mouth he took her hand laxly in his and bowing over her from his lank height listened to her report of his wifes state while he held his little girl on his left arm and the child fondly pressed her cheek against his bearded face to which he had quietly lifted her as soon as he alighted from libbys buggy  libby introduced grace as dr breen and drove on and maynard gave her the title whenever he addressed her with a perfect effect of singlemindedness in his gravity as if it were an everyday thing with him to meet young ladies who were physicians he had a certain neighborly manner of having known her a long time and of being on good terms with her and somewhere there resided in his loosely knit organism a powerful energy she had almost to run in keeping at his side as he walked on to the house carrying his little girl on his arm and glancing about him and she was not sure at last that she had succeeded in making him understand how serious the case had been  i dont know whether i ought to let you go in she said without preparing her  shes been expecting me has nt she he asked  yes but  and shes awake  then ill just go in and prepare her myself im a pretty good hand at preparing people to meet me youve a beautiful location here dr breen and your town has a chance to grow i like to see a town have some chance he added with a sadness past tears in his melancholy eyes bella can show me the way to the room i reckon he said setting the little one down on the piazza and following her indoors and when grace ventured later to knock at the door maynards voice bade her come in  he sat beside his wifes pillow with her hand in his left on his right arm perched the little girl and rested her head on his shoulder they did not seem to have been talking and they did not move when grace entered the room but apparently mrs maynard had known how to behave to george maynard and peace was visibly between them  now you tell me about the medicines dr breen and then you go and get some rest said maynard in his mild soothing voice i used to understand mrs maynards ways pretty well and i can take care of her libby told me all about you and your doings and i know you must feel as pale as you look  but you cant have had any sleep on the way grace began  sleep maynard repeated looking wanly at her i never sleep id as soon think of digesting  after she had given him the needed instructions he rose from the rockingchair inwhich he had been softly swinging to and fro and followed her out into the corridor caressing with his large hand the child that lay on his shoulder of course she said mrs maynard is still very sick and needs the greatest care and attention  yes i understand that but i reckon it will come out all right in the end he said with the optimistic fatalism which is the real religion of our orientalizing west goodnight doctor  she went away feeling suddenly alone in this exclusion from the cares that had absorbed her there was no one on the piazza which the moonlight printed with the shadows of the posts and the fanciful jigsaw work of the arches between them she heard a step on the sandy walk round the corner and waited wistfully  it was barlow who came in sight as she knew at once but she asked mr barlow  yesm said barlow what can i do for you  nothing i thought it might be mr libby at first do you know where he is  well i know where he aint said barlow and having ineffectually waited to be questioned further he added he aint here for one place hes gone back to leyden he had to take that horse back  oh she said  n i guess hes goin to stay  to stay where  well there youve got me again all i know is ive got to drive that mare of hisn over tomorrow if i can git off and next day if i cant did nt you know he was goin asked barlow willing to recompense himself for the information he had given  well he added sympathetically at a little hesitation of hers  then she said i knew he must go goodnight mr barlow and went indoors she remembered that he had said he would go as soon as maynard came and that she had consented that this would be best but his going now seemed abrupt though she approved it she thought that she had something more to say to him which might console him or reconcile him she could not think what this was but it left an indefinite longing an unsatisfied purpose in her heart and there was somewhere a tremulous sense of support withdrawn perhaps this was a mechanical effect of the cessation of her anxiety for mrs maynard which had been a support as well as a burden the house was strangely quiet as if some great noise had just been hushed and it seemed empty she felt timid in her room but she dreaded the next day more than the dark her life was changed and the future which she had once planned so clearly and had felt so strong to encounter had fallen to a ruin in which she vainly endeavored to find some clew or motive of the past she felt remanded to the conditions of the girlhood that she fancied she had altogether outlived she turned her face upon her pillow in a grief of bewildered aspiration and broken pride and shed tears scarcely predicable of a doctor of medicine  but there is no lapse or aberration of character which can be half so surprising to others as it is to ones self she had resented libbys treating her upon a theory but she treated herself upon a theory and we all treat ourselves upon a theory we proceed each of us upon the theory that he is very brave or generous or gentle or liberal or truthful or loyal or just we may have the defects of our virtues but nothing is more certain than that we have our virtues till there comes a fatal juncture not at all like the juncture in which we had often imagined ourselves triumphing against temptation it passes and the hero finds to his dismay and horror that he has run away the generous man has been niggard the gentleman has behaved like a ruffian and the liberal like a bigot the champion of truth has foolishly and vainly lied the steadfast friend has betrayed his neighbor the just person has oppressed him this is the fruitful moment apparently so sterile in which character may spring and flower anew but the mood of abject humility in which the theorist of his own character is plunged and struggles for his lost selfrespect is full of deceit for others it cannot last it may end in disowning and retrieving the error or it may end in justifying it and building it into the reconstructed character as something upon the whole unexpectedly fine but it must end for after all it is only a mood in such a mood in the anguish of her disappointment at herself a woman clings to whatever support offers and it is at his own risk that the man who chances to be this support accepts the weight with which she casts herself upon him as the measure of her dependence though he may make himself necessary to her if he has the grace or strength to do it  without being able to understand fully the causes of the dejection in which this girl seemed to appeal to him mulbridge might well have believed himself the man to turn it in his favor if he did not sympathize with her distress or even clearly divine it still his bold generalizations he found always had their effect with women whose natures are often to themselves such unknown territory that a man who assumes to know them has gone far to master them he saw that a rude moral force alone seemed to have a charm with his lady patientswomen who had been bred to ease and wealth and who had cultivated if not very disciplined minds their intellectual dissipation had apparently made them a different race from the simplerhearted womenkind of his neighbors apt to judge men in a sharp ignorance of what is fascinating in heroes and it would not be strange if he included grace in the sort of contemptuous amusement with which he regarded theseflatteringly dependent and submissive invalids he at least did not conceive of her as she conceived of herself but this may be impossible to any man with regard to any woman  with his experience of other womens explicit and even eager obedience the resistance which he had at first encountered in grace gave zest to her final submission since he had demolished the position she had attempted to hold against him he liked her for having imagined she could hold it and she had continued to pique and interest him he relished all her scruples and misgivings and the remorse she had tried to confide to him and if his enjoyment of these foibles of hers took too little account of her pain it was never his characteristic to be tender of people in good health he was indeed as alien to her puritan spirit as if he had been born in naples instead of corbitant he came of one of those families which one finds in nearly every new england community as thoroughly new england in race as the rest but flourishing in a hardy scepticism and contempt of the general sense whatever relation such people held to the old puritan commonwealth when puritanism was absolute they must later have taken an active part in its disintegration and were probably always a destructive force at its heart  mulbridges grandfather was one of the last captains who sailed a slaver from corbitant when this commerce became precarious he retired from the seas took a young wife in second marriage and passed his declining days in robust inebriety he lived to cast a dying vote for general jackson and his son the first dr mulbridge survived to illustrate the magnanimity of his fellowtownsmen during the first year of the civil war as a tolerated copperhead then he died and his son who was in the west looking up a location for practice was known to have gone out as surgeon with one of the regiments there it was not supposed that he went from patriotism but when he came back a year before the end of the struggle and settled in his native place his service in the army was accepted among his old neighbors as evidence of a better disposition of some sort than had hitherto been attributable to any of his name  in fact the lazy goodnatured boy whom they chiefly remembered before his college days had always been well enough liked among those who had since grown to be first mates and ship captains in the little port where he was born and grew up they had now all retired from the sea and having survived its manifold perils were patiently waiting to be drowned in sailboats on the bay they were of the second generation of ships captains still living in corbitant but they would be the last the commerce of the little port had changed into the whaling trade in their time this had ceased in turn and the wharves had rotted away dr mulbridge found little practice among them while attending their appointed fate they were so thoroughly salted against decay as to preserve even their families but he gradually gathered into his hands from the clairvoyant and the indian doctor the business which they had shared between them since his fathers death there was here and there a tragical case of consumption among the farming families along the coast and now and then a frightful accident among the fishermen the spring and autumn brought their typhoid the city people who came down to the neighboring hotels were mostly sick or fell sick and with the small property his father had left he and his mother contrived to live  they dwelt very harmoniously together for his mother who had passed more than a quarter of a century in strong resistance to her husbands will had succumbed as not uncommonly happens with such women to the authority of her son whom she had no particular pleasure or advantage in thwarting in the phrase and belief of his neighbors he took after her rather than his father but there was something ironical and baffling in him which the local experts could not trace to either the mulbridges or the gardiners they had a quiet indifferent faith in his ability to make himself a position and name anywhere but they were not surprised that he had come back to live in corbitant which was so manifestly the best place in the world and which if somewhat lacking in opportunity was ample in the leisure they believed more congenial to him than success some of his lady patients at the hotels who felt at times that they could not live without him would have carried him back to the city with them by a gentle violence but there was nothing in anything he said or did that betrayed ambition on his part he liked to hear them talk especially of their ideas of progress as they called them at which with the ready adaptability of their sex they joined him in laughing when they found that he could not take them seriously the social the emotional expression of the new scientific civilization struck him as droll particularly in respect to the emancipation of women and he sometimes gave these ladies the impression that he did not value womans intellect at its true worth he was far from light treatment of them he was considerate of the distances that should be guarded but he conveyed the sense of his scepticism as to their fitness for some things to which the boldest of them aspired  his mother would have been willing to have him go to the city if he wished but she was too ignorant of the world outside of corbitant to guess at his possibilities in it and such people as she had seen from it had not pleased her with it those summerboarding lady patients who came to see him were sometimes suffered to wait with her till he came in and they used to tell her how happy she must be to keep such a son with her and twittered their patronage of her and her nice oldfashioned parlor and their praises of his skill in such wise against her echoless silence that she conceived a strong repugnance for all their tribe in which she naturally included grace when she appeared she had decided the girl to be particularly forthputting from something prompt and selfreliant in her manner that day and she viewed with tacit disgust her sons toleration of a handsome young woman who had taken up a mans profession they were not people who gossiped together or confided in each other and she would have known nothing and asked nothing from him about her further than she had seen for herself but barlow had folks as he called them at corbitant and without her own connivance she had heard from them of all that was passing at jocelyns  it was her fashion to approach any subject upon which she wished her son to talk as if they had already talked of it and he accepted this convention with a perfect understanding that she thus expressed at once her deference to him and her resolution to speak whether he liked it or not she had not asked him about mrs maynards sickness or shown any interest in it but after she learned from the barlows that she was no longer in danger she said to her son one morning before he drove away upon his daily visit is her husband going to stay with her or is he going back  i dont know really he answered glancing at her where she sat erect across the table from him with her hand on the lid of the coffeepot and her eyes downcast it was the face of silent determination not to be put off which he knew i dont suppose you care mother he added pleasantly  shes nothing to me she assented whats that friend of hers going to do  which friend  you know the one that came after you  oh dr breen yes what did you think of her  i dont see why you call her doctor  oh i do it out of politeness besides she is one sort of doctor little pills he added with an enjoyment of his mothers grimness on this point  i should like to see a daughter of mine pretending to be a doctor said mrs mulbridge  then you would nt like dr breen for a daughter returned her son in the same tone as before  she wouldnt like me for a mother mrs mulbridge retorted  her son laughed and helped himself to more baked beans and a fresh slice of ryeandindian he had the homely tastes and the strong digestion of the people from whom he sprung and he handed his cup to be filled with his mothers strong coffee in easy defiance of consequences as he took it back from her he said i should like to see you and mrs breen together you would make a strong team he buttered his bread with another laugh in appreciation of his conceit if you happened to pull the same way if you did nt something would break mrs breen is a lady of powerful convictions she thinks you ought to be good and you ought to be very sorry for it but not so sorry as you ought to be for being happy i dont think she has given her daughter any reason to complain on the last score he broke into his laugh again and watched his mothers frown with interest i suspect that she does nt like me very well you could meet on common ground there you dont like her daughter  they must be a pair of them said mrs mulbridge immovably did her mother like her studying for a doctor  yes i understand so her mother is progressive she believes in the advancement of women she thinks the men would oppress them if they got a chance  if one half the bold things that are running about the country had masters it would be the best thing said mrs mulbridge opening the lid of the coffeepot and clapping it to with force after a glance inside  thats where mrs green wouldnt agree with you perhaps because it would make the bold things happy to have masters though she does nt say so probably she wants the women to have women doctors so they wont be so well and can have more time to think whether they have been good or not you ought to hear some of the ladies over there talk mother  i have heard enough of their talk  well you ought to hear miss gleason there are very few things that miss gleason does nt think can be done with cut flowers from a wedding to a funeral  mrs mulbridge perceived that her son was speaking figuratively of miss gleasons sentimentality but she was not very patient with the sketch he enjoyed giving of her is she a friend of that breen girls she interrupted to ask  shes an humble friend an admirer a worshipper the breen girl is her ideal woman she thinks the breen girl is so superior to any man living that she would like to make a match for her his mother glanced sharply at him but he went on in the tone of easy generalization and with a certain pleasure in the projection of these strange figures against her distorting imagination you see mother that the most advanced thinkers among those ladies are not so very different after all from you oldfashioned people when they try to think of the greatest good fortune that can befall an ideal woman it is to have her married the only trouble is to find a man good enough and if they cant find one theyre apt to invent one they have strong imaginations  i should think they would make you sick amongst them said his mother are you going to have anything more to eat she asked with a housekeepers latent impatience to get her table cleared away  yes said dr mulbridge i have nt finished yet and im in no hurry this morning sit still mother i want you to hear something more about my lady friends at jocelyns dr breens mother and miss gleason dont feel alike about her her mother thinks she was weak in giving up mrs maynards case to me but miss gleason told me about their discussion and she thinks it is the great heroic act of dr breens life  it showed some sense at least mrs mulbridge replied she had tacitly offered to release her son from telling her anything when she had made her motion to rise if he chose to go on now it was his own affair she handed him the plate of biscuit and he took one  it showed inspiration miss gleason says the tears came into her eyes i understood her to say it was godlike and only to think doctor he continued with a clumsy but unmistakable suggestion of miss gleasons perfervid manner that such a girl should be dragged down by her own mother to the level of petty everyday cares and duties and should be blamed for the most beautiful act of selfsacrifice is nt it too bad  rufus rufus cried his mother i cant stun it stop  oh dr breen is nt so badnot half so divine as miss gleason thinks her and mrs maynard does nt consider her surrendering the case an act of selfsacrifice at all  i should hope not said mrs mulbridge i guess she would nt have been alive to tell the tale if it had nt been for you  oh you cant be sure of that you must nt believe too much in doctors mother mrs maynard is pretty tough and shes had wonderfully good nursing youve only heard the barlow side of the matter said her sun betraying now for the first time that he had been aware of any knowledge of it on her part that was their way though they seldom told each other anything and went on as if they knew nothing of each others affairs yet when they recognized this knowledge it was without surprise on either side i could tell you a different story shes a very fine girl mother cool and careful under instruction and perfectly tractable and intelligent shes as different from those other women youve seen as you are you would like her he had suddenly grown earnest and crushing the crust of a biscuit in the strong left hand which he rested on the table he gazed keenly at her undemonstrative face shes no baby either shes got a will and a temper of her own shes the only one of them i ever saw that was worth her salt  i thought you did nt like selfwilled women said his mother impassively  she knows when to give up he answered with unrelaxed scrutiny  his mother did not lift her eyes yet how long shall you have to visit over there  ive made my last professional visit  where are you going this morning  to jocelyns  mrs mulbridge now looked up and met her sons eye what makes you think shell have you  he did not shrink at her coming straight to the point the moment the way was clear he had intended it and he liked it but he frowned a little as he said because i want her to have me for one thing his jaw closed heavily but his face lost a certain brutal look almost as quickly as it had assumed it i guess he said with a smile that its the only reason ive got  you no need to say that said his mother resenting the implication that any woman would not have him  oh im not pretty to look at mother and im not particularly young and for a while i thought there might be some one else  who  the young fellow that came with her that day  that whippersnapper  dr mulbridge assented by his silence but i guess i was mistaken i guess hes tried and missed it the field is clear for all i can see and shes made a failure in one way and then you know a woman is in the humor to try it in another she wants a good excuse for giving up thats what i think  well said his mother i presume you know what youre about rufus  she took up the coffeepot on the lid of which she had been keeping her hand and went into the kitchen with it she removed the dishes and left him sitting before the empty tablecloth when she came for that he took hold of her hand and looked up into her face over which a scarcely discernible tremor passed well mother  its what i always knew i had got to come to first or last and i suppose i ought to feel glad enough i did nt have to come to it at first  no said her son im not a stripling any longer he laughed keeping his mothers hand  she freed it and taking up the tablecloth folded it lengthwise and then across and laid it neatly away in the cupboard i shant interfere with you nor any woman that you bring here to be your wife ive had my day and im not one of the old fools that think theyre going to have and to hold forever youve always been a good boy to me and i guess you haint ever had to complain of your mother stanin in your way i shant now but i did think  she stopped and shut her lips firmly speak up mother he cried  i guess i better not she answered setting her chair back against the wall  i know what you mean you mean about my laughing at women that try to take mens places in the world well i did laugh at them theyre ridiculous i dont want to marry this girl because shes a doctor that was the principal drawback in my mind but it does nt make any difference and wouldnt now if she was a dozen doctors  his mother let down the leaves of the table and pushed it against the wall and he rose from the chair in which he was left sitting in the middle of the room i presume she said with her back toward him as she straightened the table accurately against the mopboard that you can let me have the little house at grants corner  why mother he cried you dont suppose i should ever let you be turned out of house and home you can stay here as long as you live but it has nt come to that yet i dont know that she cares anything about me but there are chances and there are signs the chances are that she wont have the courage to take up her plan of life again and that shell consider any other thats pressed home upon her and i take it for a good sign that shes sent that fellow adrift if her mind had nt been set on some one else shed have taken him in this brokenup state of hers besides she has formed the habit of doing what i say and theres a great deal in mere continuity of habit it will be easier for her to say yes than to say no it would be very hard for her to say no  while he eagerly pressed these arguments his mother listened stonily without apparent interest or sympathy but at the end she asked how are you going to support a wife your practice here wont do it has she got anything  she has property i believe replied her son she seems to have been brought up in that way  she wont want to come and live here then shell have notions of her own if shes like the rest of them shell never have you  if she were like the rest of them id never have her but she is nt as far as im concerned its nothing against her that shes studied medicine she did nt do it from vanity or ambition or any abnormal love of it she did it so far so i can find out because she wished to do good that way shes been a little notional shes had her head addled by womens talk and shes in a queer freak but its only a girls freak after all you cant say anything worse of her shes a splendid woman and her propertys neither here nor there i could support her  i presume replied his mother that shes been used to ways that aint like our ways ive always stuck up for you rufus stiff enough i guess but i aint agoin to deny that youre country born and bred i can see that and she can see it too it makes a great difference with girls i dont know as shed call you what they call a gentleman  dr mulbridge flushed angrily every american of whatever standing or breeding thinks of himself as a gentleman and nothing can gall him more than the insinuation that he is less what do you mean mother  you haint ever been in such ladies society as hers in the same way i know that they all think the world of you and flatter you up and theyre as biddable as you please when youre doctorin em but i guess it would be different if you was to set up for one of their own kind amongst em  there is nt one of them he retorted that i dont believe i could have for the turn of my hand especially if it was doubled into a fist they like force  oh youve only seen the sick married ones i guess youll find a well girl is another thing  theyre all alike and i think i should be something of a relief if i was nt like what shes been used to hearing called a gentleman shed prefer me on that account but if you come to blood i guess the mulbridges and gardiner can hold up their heads with the best anywhere  yes like the camfers and rafllins these were people of ancestral consequence and local history who had gone up to boston from corbitant and had succeeded severally as greengrocers and retail drygoods men with the naturally attendant social distinction  pshaw cried her son if she cares for me at all she wont care for the cut of my clothes or my table manners  yes thats so t aint on my account that i want you should make sure she doos care  he looked hard at her immovable face with its fallen eyes and then went out of the room he never quarrelled with his mother because his anger like her own was dumb and silenced him as it mounted her misgivings had stung him deeply and at the bottom of his indolence and indifference was a fiery pride not easily kindled but unquenchable he flung the harness upon his old unkempt horse and tackled him to the mudencrusted buggy for whose shabbiness he had never cared before he was tempted to go back into the house and change his uncouth canada homespun coat for the broadcloth frock which he wore when he went to boston but he scornfully resisted it and drove off in his accustomed figure  his mothers last words repeated themselves to him and in that dialogue in which he continued to dramatize their different feelings he kept replying well the way to find out whether she cares is to ask her     x  during her convalescence mrs maynard had the time and inclination to give grace some good advice she said that she had thought a great deal about it throughout her sickness and she had come to the conclusion that grace was throwing away her life  youre not fit to be a doctor grace she said youre too nervous and youre too conscientious it is nt merely your want of experience no matter how much experience you had if you saw a case going wrong in your hands youd want to call in some one else to set it right do you suppose dr mulbridge would have given me up to another doctor because he was afraid he couldnt cure me no indeed hed have let me die first and i should nt have blamed him of course i know what pressure i brought to bear upon you but you had no business to mind me you oughtnt to have minded my talk any more than the buzzing of a mosquito and no real doctor would if he wants to be a success he must be hardhearted as hardhearted asshe paused for a comparison and failing any other addedas all possessed to the like largeminded and impartial effect she ran on at great length no grace she concluded what you want to do is to get married you would be a good wife and you would be a good mother the only trouble is that i dont know any man worthy of you or half worthy no i dont  now that her recovery was assured mrs maynard was very forgiving and sweet and kind with every one the ladies who came in to talk with her said that she was a changed creature she gave them all the best advice and she had absolutely no shame whatever for the inconsistency involved by her reconciliation with her husband she rather flaunted the happiness of her reunion in the face of the public and she vouchsafed an explanation to no one there had never been anything definite in her charges against him even to grace and her tacit withdrawal of them succeeded perfectly well the ladies after some cynical tittering forgot them and rejoiced in the spectacle of conjugal harmony afforded them women are generous creatures and there is hardly any offence which they are not willing another woman should forgive her husband when once they have said that they do not see how she could ever forgive him  mrs maynards silence seemed insufficient to none but mrs breen and her own husband the former vigorously denounced its want of logic to grace as all but criminal though she had no objection to mr maynard he in fact treated her with a filial respect which went far to efface her preconceptions and he did what he could to retrieve himself from the disgrace of a separation in graces eyes perhaps he thought that the late situation was known to her alone when he casually suggested one day that mrs maynard was peculiar  yes said grace mercifully but she has been out of health so long that makes a great difference shes going to be better now  oh its going to come out all right in the end he said with his unbuoyant hopefulness and i reckon ive got to help it along why i suppose every mans a trial at times doctor  i dare say i know that every woman is said the girl  is that so well may be youre partly right but you dont suppose but what a man generally begins it do you there was adam you know he did nt pull the apple but he fell off into that sleep and woke up with one of his ribs dislocated and thats what really commenced the trouble if it had nt been for adam there would nt have been any woman you know and you could nt blame her for what happened after she got going there was no gleam of insinuation in his melancholy eye and grace listened without quite knowing what to make of it all and then i suppose he was nt punctual at meals and stood round talking politics at night when he ought to have been at home with his family  who asked grace  adam replied mr maynard lifelessly well they got along pretty well outside he continued some of the children didnt turn out just what you might have expected but raising children is mighty uncertain business yes they got along he ended his parable with a sort of weary sigh as if oppressed by experience grace looked at his slovenly figure his smoky complexion and the shaggy outline made by his untrimmed hair and beard and she wondered how louise could marry him but she liked him and she was willing to accept for all reason the cause of unhappiness at which he further hinted you see doctor an incompatibility is a pretty hard thing to manage you cant forgive it like a real grievance you have to try other things and find out that there are worse things and then you come back to it and stand it were talking wyoming and cattle range now and mrs maynard is all for the new deal its going to make us healthy wealthy and wise well i suppose the air will be good for her out there you doctors are sending lots of your patients our way now the gravity with which he always assumed that grace was a physician in full and regular practice would have had its edge of satire coming from another but from him if it was ironical it was also caressing and she did not resent it ive had some talk with your colleague here dr mulbridge and he seems to think it will be the best thing for her i suppose you agree with him  oh yes said grace his opinion would be of great value it wouldnt be at all essential that i should agree with him  well i dont know about that said maynard i reckon he thinks a good deal of your agreeing with him ive been talking with him about settling out our way weve got a magnificent country and theres bound to be plenty of sickness there sooner or later why doctor it would be a good opening for you it s just the place for you you re off here in a corner in new england and you have nt got any sort of scope but at cheyenne youd have the whole field to yourself there is nt another lady doctor in cheyenne now you come out with us bring your mother with you and grow up with the country your mother would like it theres enough moral obliquity in cheyenne to keep her conscience in a state of healthful activity all the time yes youd get along out there  grace laughed and shook her head it was part of the joke which life seemed to be with mr maynard that the inhabitants of new england were all eager to escape from their native section and that they ought to be pitied and abetted in this desire as soon as his wifes convalescence released him from constant attendance upon her he began an inspection of the region from the compassionate point of view the small frugal husbandry appealed to his commiseration and he professed to have found the use of canvas caps upon the haycocks intolerably pathetic why im told he said that they have to blanket the appletrees while the fruit is setting and they kill off our colorado bugs by turning them loose one at a time on the potatopatches the bug starves to death in fortyeight hours but youve got plenty of schoolhouses doctor it does beat all about the schoolhouses and its an awful pity that there are no children to go to school in them why of course the people go west as fast as they can but they ought to be helped the government ought to do something theyre good people make firstrate citizens when you get them waked up out there but they ought all to be got away and let somebody run new england as a summer resort its pretty and its cool and pleasant and the fishing is excellent milk eggs and all kinds of berries and historical associations on the premises and it could be made very attractive three months of the year but my goodness you oughtnt to ask anybody to live here you come out with us doctor and see that country and youll know what i mean  his boasts were always uttered with a wan lacklustre irony as if he were burlesquing the conventional western brag and enjoying the mystifications of his listener whose feeble sense of humor often failed to seize his intention and to whom any depreciation of new england was naturally unintelligible she had not come to her final liking for him without a season of serious misgiving but after that she rested in peace upon what every one knowing him felt to be his essential neighborliness her wonder had then come to be how he could marry louise when they sat together on the seaward piazza and he poured out his easy talk unwearied and unwearying while with one long lank leg crossed upon the other he swung his unblacked thinsoled boot to and fro  well he was this kind of a fellow when we were in switzerland he was always climbing some mountain or other they could nt have hired me to climb one of their mountains if theyd given me all their scenery and thrown their goitres in i used to tell him that the side of a house was good enough for me but nothing but the tallest mountains would do him and one day when he was up there on the comb of the roof somewhere tied with a rope round his waist to the guide and a frenchman the guides foot slipped and he commenced going down the frenchman was just going to cut the rope and let the guide play it alone but he knocked the knife out of his hand with his longhandled axe and when the jerk came he was on the other side of the comb where he could brace himself and brought them both up standing well hes got muscles like bunches of steel wire did nt he ever tell you about it  no said grace sadly  well somebody ought to expose libby i dont suppose i should ever have known about it myself if i hadnt happened to see the guides friends and relations crying over him next day as if he was the guides funeral hello theres the doctor he unlimbered his lank legs and rose with an effect of opening his person like a pocketknife as i understand it this is an unprofessional visit and the doctor is here among us as a guest i dont know exactly what to do under the circumstances whether we ought to talk about mrs maynards health or the opera but i reckon if we show our good intentions it will come out all right in the end  he went forward to meet the doctor who came up to shake hands with grace and then followed him indoors to see mrs maynard grace remained in her place and she was still sitting there when dr mulbridge returned without him he came directly to her and said i want to speak with you miss breen can i see you alone  isis mrs maynard worse she asked rising in a little trepidation  no it has nothing to do with her shes practically well now i can remand the case to you i wish to see youabout yourself she hesitated at this peculiar summons but some pressure was upon her to obey dr mulbridge as there was upon most people where he wished to obey him i want to talk with you he added about what you are going to doabout your future will you come  oh yes she answered and she suffered him to lead the way down from the piazza and out upon one of the sandy avenues toward the woods in which it presently lost itself but there will be very little to talk about she continued as they moved away if you confine yourself to my future i have none  i dont see how youve got rid of it he rejoined youve got a future as much as you have a past and theres this advantagethat you can do something with your future  do you think so she asked with a little bitterness that has nt been my experience  its been mine he said and you can make it yours come i want to talk with you about your future because i have been thinking very seriously about my own i want to ask your advice and to give you mine ill commence by asking yours what do you think of me as a physician i know you are able to judge  she was flattered in spite of herself there were long arrears of cool indifference to her own claims in that direction which she might very well have resented but she did not there was that flattery in his question which the junior in any vocation feels in the appeal of his senior and there was the flattery which any woman feels in a mans recourse to her judgment still she contrived to parry it with a little thrust i dont suppose the opinion of a mere homoeopathist can be of any value to a regular practitioner  he laughed you have been a regular practitioner yourself for the last three weeks what do you think of my management of the case  i have never abandoned my principles she began  oh i know all about that what do you think of me as a doctor he persisted  of course i admire you why do you ask me that  because i wished to know and because i wished to ask you something else you have been brought up in a city and i have always lived here in the country except the two years i was out with the army do you think i should succeed if i pulled up here and settled in boston  i have not lived in boston she answered my opinion wouldnt be worth much on that point  yes it would you know city people and what they are i have seen a good deal of them in my practice at the hotels about here and some of the ladieswhen they happened to feel more comfortablehave advised me to come to boston his derision seemed to throw contempt on all her sex but he turned to her and asked again earnestly what do you think some of the profession know me there when i left the school some of the faculty urged me to try my chance in the city  she waited a moment before she answered you know that i must respect your skill and i believe that you could succeed anywhere i judge your fitness by my own deficiency the first time i saw you with mrs maynard i saw that you had everything that i hadnt i saw that i was a failure and why and that it would be foolish for me to keep up the struggle  do you mean that you have given it up he demanded with a triumph in which there was no sympathy  it has given me up i never liked iti told you that beforeand i never took it up from any ambitious motive it seemed a shame for me to be of no use in the world and i hoped that i might do something in a way that seemed natural for women and i dont give up because im unfit as a woman i might be a man and still be impulsive and timid and nervous and everything that i thought i was not  yes you might be all that and be a man but youd be an exceptional man and i dont think youre an exceptional woman if youve failed it is nt your temperament thats to blame  i think it is the wrong is somewhere in me individually i know it is  dr mulbridge walking beside her with his hands clasped behind him threw up his head and laughed well have it your own way miss breen only i dont agree with you why should you wish to spare your sex at your own expense but thats the way with some ladies ive noticed they approve of what women attempt because women attempt it and they believe the attempt reflects honor on them its tremendous to think what men could accomplish for their sex if they only hung together as women do but they cant they havent the generosity  i think you dont understand me said grace with a severity that amused him i wished to regard myself in taking up this profession entirely as i believed a man would have regarded himself  and were you able to do it  no she unintentionally replied to this unexpected question  haw haw haw laughed dr mulbridge at her helpless candor and are you sure that you give it up as a man would  i dont know how you mean she said vexed and bewildered  do you do it fairly and squarely because you believe that youre a failure or because you partly feel that you have nt been fairly dealt with  i believe that if mrs maynard had had the same confidence in me that she would have had in any man i should not have failed but every woman physician has a double disadvantage that i hadnt the strength to overcomeher own inexperience and the distrust of other women  well whose fault is that  not the mens it is the men alone who give women any chance they are kind and generous and liberalminded i have no blame for them and i have no patience with women who want to treat them as the enemies of womens advancement women cant move a step forwards without their sufferance and help dr mulbridge she cried i wish to apologize for the hasty and silly words i used to you the day i came to ask you to consult with me i ought to have been grateful to you for consenting at first and when you took back your consent i ought to have considered your position you were entirely right we had no common ground to meet on and i behaved like a petulant foolish vulgar girl  no no he protested laughing in recollection of the scene you were all right and i was in a fix and if your own fears had nt come to the rescue i dont know how i should have got out of it it would have been disgraceful wouldnt it to refuse a ladys request you dont know how near i was to giving way i can tell you now that its all over i had never seen a lady of our profession before he added hastily and my curiosity was up i always had my doubts about the thoroughness of womens study and i should have liked to see where your training failed i must say i found it very goodive told you that you wouldnt fail individually you would fail because you are a woman  i dont believe that said grace  well then because your patients are women its all one what will you do  i shall not do anything i shall give it all up  but what shall you do then  idont know  what are you going to be a fashionable woman or are you going to europe and settle down there with the other american failures ive heard about themin rome and florence and paris are you going to throw away the study youve put into this profession you took it up because you wanted to do good dont you want to do good any more has the human race turned out unworthy  she cowered at this arraignment in which she could not separate the mocking from the justice what do you advise me to do do you think i could ever succeed  you could never succeed alone  yes i know that i felt that from the first but i have planned to unite with a woman physician older than myself  and double your deficiency sit down here he said i wish to talk business they had entered the border of the woods encompassing jocelyns and he painted to a stump beside which lay the fallen tree she obeyed mechanically and he remained standing near her with one foot lifted to the log he leaned forward over her and seemed to seize a physical advantage in the posture from your own point of view you would have no right to give up your undertaking if there was a chance of success in it you would have no more right to give up than a woman who had gone out as a missionary  i dont pretend to compare myself with such a woman but i should have no more right to give up she answered helpless against the logic of her fate which he had somehow divined  well then listen to me i can give you this chance are you satisfied that with my advice you could have succeeded in mrs maynards case  yes i think so but what  i think so too dont rise  his will overcame the impulse that had betrayed itself and she sank back to her seat i offer you my advice from this time forward i offer you my help  that is very good of you she murmured and i appreciate your generosity more than i can say i know the prejudice you must have had to overcome in regard to women physicians before you could bring yourself to do this and i know how you must have despised me for failing in my attempt and giving myself up to my feeble temperament but  oh we wont speak of all that he interrupted of course i felt the prejudice against women entering the profession which we all feel it was ridiculous and disgusting to me till i saw you i wont urge you from any personal motive to accept my offer but i know that if you do you can realize all your hopes of usefulness and i ask you to consider that certainly but you know the only way it could be done  she looked him in the eyes with dismay in her growing intelligence  whatwhat do you mean  i mean that i ask you to let me help you carry out your plan of life and to save all you have done and all you have hoped from wasteas your husband think  she struggled to her feet as if he were opposing a palpable resistance so strongly she felt the pressure of his will it cant be dr mulbridge oh it cant indeed let us go back i wish to go back  but he had planted himself in her way and blocked her advance unless she chose to make it a flight  i expected this he said with a smile as if her wild trepidation interested him as an anticipated symptom the whole idea is new and startling to you but i know you wont dismiss it abruptly and i wont be discouraged  yes yes you must i will not think of it i cant i do dismiss it at once let me go  then you really choose to be like the resta thing of hysterical impulses without conscience or reason i supposed the weakest woman would be equal to an offer of marriage and you had dreamt of being a physician and useful  i tell you she cried half quelled by his derision that i have found out that i am not fit for itthat i am a failure and a disgrace and you had no right to expect me to be anything else  you are no failure and i had a right to expect anything of you after the endurance and the discretion you have shown in the last three weeks without your help i should have failed myself you owe it to other women to go on  they must take care of themselves she said if my weakness throws shame on them they must bear it i thank you for what you say i believe you mean it but if i was of any use to you i did nt know it  it was probably inspiration then he interrupted coolly come this isnt a thing to be frightened at youre not obliged to do what i say but i think you ought to hear me out i havent spoken without serious thought and i didnt suppose you would reject me without a reason  reason she repeated there is no reason in it  there ought to be there is on my side i have all kinds of reasons for asking you to be my wife i believe that i can make you happy in the fulfilment of your plans i admire you and respect you more than any other woman i ever saw and i love you  i dont love you and that is reason enough  yes between boys and girls but between men and women it isnt enough do you dislike me  no  am i repulsive in any way  no no  i know that i am not very young and that i am not very goodlooking  it is nt that at all  of course i know that such things weigh with women and that personal traits and habits are important in an affair like this i am slovenly and indifferent about my dress but its only because i have lived where every sort of spirit and ambition was useless i dont know about city ways but i could pick up all of them that were worth while i spoke of going to boston but i would go anywhere else with you east or west that you chose and i know that i should succeed i havent done what i might have done with myself because ive never had an object in life ive always lived in the one little place and ive never been out of it except when i was in the army ive always liked my profession but nothing has seemed worth while you were a revelation to me you have put ambition and hope into me i never saw any woman before that i would have turned my hand to have they always seemed to me fit to be the companions of fools or the playthings of men but of all the simpletons the women who were trying to do something for woman as they called it trying to exemplify and illustrate a cause were the silliest that i came across i never happened to have met a woman doctor before you came to me but i had imagined them and i could nt believe in you when i saw you you were not supersensitive you were not presumptuous and you gave up not because you distrusted yourself but because your patient distrusted you that was right i should have done the same thing myself under my direction you have shown yourself faithful docile patient intelligent beyond anything i have seen i have watched you and i know and i know what your peculiar trials have been from that woman you have taught me a lessoni m not ashamed to say it and youve given me a motive i was wrong to ask you to marry me so that you might carry out your plans that was no way to appeal to you what i meant was that i might make your plans my own and that we might carry them out together i dont care for making money i have always been poor and i had always expected to be so and i am not afraid of hard work there is nt any selfsacrifice youve dreamed of that i wouldnt gladly and proudly share with you you cant do anything by yourself but we could do anything together if you have any scruple about giving up your theory of medicine you neednt do it and the state medical association may go to the devil ive said my say what do you say  she looked all round as if seeking escape from a mesh suddenly flung about her and then she looked imploringly up at him i have nothing to say she whispered huskily i cant answer you  well thats all i ask he said moving a few steps away and suffering her to rise dont answer me now take timeall the time you want all the time there is  no she said rising and gathering some strength from the sense of being on foot again i dont mean that i mean that i donti cant consent  you dont believe in me you dont think i would do it  i dont believe in myself i have no right to doubt you i know that i ought to honor you for what you propose  i dont think it calls for any great honor of course i shouldnt propose it to every lady physician he smiled with entire serenity and selfpossession tell me one thing was there ever a time when you would have consented she did not answer then you will consent yet  no dont deceive yourself i shall never consent  ill leave that to the logic of your own conscience you will do what seems your duty  you must nt trust to my conscience i fling it away i wont have anything to do with it ive been tortured enough by it there is no sense or justice in it  he laughed easily at her vehemence i ll trust your conscience but i wont stay to worry you now im coming again day after tomorrow and im not afraid of what you will say then  he turned and left her tearing his way through the sweetfern and low blackberry vines with long strides a shape of uncouth force after he was out of sight she followed scared and trembling at herself as if she had blasphemed     xi  grace burst into the room where her mother sat and flung her hat aside with a desperate gesture now mother you have got to listen to me dr mulbridge has asked me to marry him  mrs green put up her spectacles on her forehead and stared at her daughter while some strong expressions out of the plebeian or rustic past which lies only a generation or two behind most of us rose to her lips i will not repeat them here she had long denied them to herself as an immoral selfindulgence and it must be owned that such things have a fearful effect coming from old ladies what has got into all the men what in nature does he want you to marry him for  oh for the best reasons in the world exclaimed the daughter for reasons that will make you admire and respect him she added ironically for great and unselfish and magnanimous reasons  i should want to believe they were the real ones first interrupted mrs breen  he wants to marry me because he knows that i cant fulfil my plans of life alone and because we could fulfil them together we shall not only be husband and wife but we shall be physicians in partnership i may continue a homoeopath he says and the state medical association may go to the devil she used his language that would have been shocking to her ordinary moods without blenching and in their common agitation her mother accepted it as fit and becoming he counts upon my accepting him because i must see it as my duty and my conscience wont let me reject the only opportunity i shall have of doing some good and being of some use in the world what do you think i ought to do mother  theres reason in what he says it is an opportunity you could be of use in that way and perhaps its the only way yes she continued fascinated by the logic of the position and its capabilities for vicarious selfsacrifice i dont see how you can get out of it you have spent years and years of study and a great deal of money to educate yourself for a profession that youre too weak to practise alone you cant say that i ever advised your doing it it was your own idea and i did nt oppose it but when youve gone so far youve formed an obligation to go on its your duty not to give up if you know of any means to continue thats your duty as plain as can be to say nothing of the wicked waste of your giving up now youre bound to consider the effect it would have upon other women who are trying to do something for themselves the only thing she added with some misgiving is whether you believe he was in earnest and would keep his word to you  i think he was secretly laughing at me and that he would expect to laugh me out of his promise  well then you ought to take time to reflect and you ought to be sure that youre right about him  is that what you really think mother  i am always governed by reason grace and by right and i have brought you up on that plan if you have ever departed from it it has not been with my consent nor for want of my warning i have simply laid the matter before you  then you wish me to marry him  this was perhaps a point that had not occurred to mrs breen in her recognition of the strength of dr mulbridges position it was one thing to trace the path of duty another to support the aspirant in treading it you ought to take time to reflect mrs green repeated with evasion that she never used in behalf of others  well mother answered grace i didnt take time to reflect and i should nt care whether i was right about him or not i refused him because i did nt love him if i had loved him that would have been the only reason i needed to marry him but all the duty in the world wouldnt be enough without it duty i am sick of duty let the other women who are trying to do something for themselves take care of themselves as men would i dont owe them more than a man would owe other men and i wont be hoodwinked into thinking i do as for the waste the past is gone at any rate and the waste that i lament is the years i spent in working myself up to an undertaking that i was never fit for i wont continue that waste and i wont keep up the delusion that because i was very unhappy i was useful and that it was doing good to be miserable i like pleasure and i like dress i like pretty things there is no harm in them why should nt i have them  there is harm in them for youher mother began  because i have tried to make my life a horror there is no other reason and that is no reason when we go into boston this winter i shall go to the theatre i shall go to the opera and i hope there will be a ballet and next summer i am going to europe i am going to italy she whirled away toward the door as if she were setting out  i should think you had taken leave of your conscience cried her mother  i hope i have mother i am going to consult my reason after this  your reason  well then my inclination i have had enough of conscienceof my own and of yours too that is what i told him and that is what i mean there is such a thing as having too much conscience and of getting stupefied by it so that you cant really see whats right but i dont care i believe i should like to do wrong for a while and i will do wrong if its doing right to marry him  she had her hand on the doorknob and now she opened the door and closed it after her with something very like a bang  she naturally could not keep within doors in this explosive state and she went downstairs and out upon the piazza mr maynard was there smoking with his boots on top of the verandarail and his person thrown back in his chair at the angle requisite to accomplish this elevation of the feet he took them down as he saw her approach and rose with the respect in which he never failed for women and threw his cigar away  mr maynard she asked abruptly do you know where mr libby is  no i dont doctor im sorry to say if i did i would send and borrow some more cigars of him i think that the brand our landlord keeps must have been invented by mr track the great antitobacco reformer  is he coming back is nt he coming back she demanded breathlessly  why yes i reckon he must be coming back libby generally sees his friends through and hell have some curiosity to know how mrs maynard and i have come out of it all he looked at her with something latent in his eye but what his eye expressed was merely a sympathetic regret that he could not be more satisfactory  perhaps she suggested mr barlow might know something  well now said maynard perhaps he might that very thing ill go round and ask him he went to the stable and she waited for his return barlow says he reported that he guesses hes somewhere about leyden at any rate his mares there yet in the stable where barlow left her he saw her there yesterday  thanks thats all i wished to know said grace i wished to write to him she added boldly  she shut herself in her room and spent the rest of the forenoon in writing a letter which when first finished was very long but in its ultimate phase was so short as to occupy but a small space on a square correspondencecard having got it written on the card she was dissatisfied with it in that shape and copied it upon a sheet of notepaper then she sealed and addressed it and put it into her pocket after dinner she went down to the beach and walked a long way upon the sands she thought at first that she would ask barlow to get it to him somehow and then she determined to find out from barlow the address of the people who had mr libbys horse and send it to them for him by the driver of the barge she would approach the driver with a nonchalant imperious air and ask him to please have that delivered to mr libby immediately and in case he learned from the stablepeople that he was not in leyden to bring the letter back to her she saw how the driver would take it and then she figured libby opening and reading it she sometimes figured him one way and sometimes another sometimes he rapidly scanned the lines and then instantly ordered his horse and feverishly hastened the men again he deliberately read it and then tore it into stall pieces with a laugh and flung them away this conception of his behavior made her heart almost stop beating but there was a luxury in it too and she recurred to it quite as often as to the other which led her to a dramatization of their meeting with all their parley minutely realized and every most intimate look and thought imagined there is of course no means of proving that this sort of mental exercise was in any degree an exercise of the reason or that dr breen did not behave unprofessionally in giving herself up to it she could only have claimed in selfdefence that she was no longer aiming at a professional behavior that she was in fact abandoning herself to a recovered sense of girlhood and all its sweetest irresponsibilities those who would excuse so weak and capricious a character may urge if they like that she was behaving as wisely as a young physician of the other sex would have done in the circumstances  she concluded to remain on the beach where only the children were playing in the sand and where she could easily escape any other companionship that threatened after she had walked long enough to spend the first passion of her reverie she sat down under the cliff and presently grew conscious of his boat swinging at anchor in its wonted place and wondered that she had not thought he must come back for that then she had a mind to tear up her letter as superfluous but she did not she rose from her place under the cliff and went to look for the dory she found it drawn up on the sand in a little cove it was the same place and the water was so shoal for twenty feet out that no one could have rowed the dory to land it must be dragged up she laughed and blushed and then boldly amused herself by looking for footprints but the tide must have washed them out long ago there were only the light small footprints of the children who had been playing about the dory she brushed away some sand they had scattered over the seat and got into the boat and sat down there it was a good seat and commanded a view of the sailboat in the foreground of the otherwise empty ocean she took out her letter and let it lie in the open hands which she let lie in her lap  she was not impatient to have the time pass it went only too soon though she indulged that luxury of terror in imagining her letter torn up and scornfully thrown away she really rested quite safe as to the event but she liked this fond delay and the soft blue afternoon might have lasted forever to her entire content  a little whiff of breeze stole up and suddenly caught the letter from her open hands and whisked it out over the sand with a cry she fled after it and when she had recaptured it she thought to look at her watch it was almost time for the barge and now she made such needless haste in order not to give herself chance for misgiving or retreat that she arrived too soon at the point where she meant to intercept the driver on his way to the house for in her present mutiny she had resolved to gratify a little natural liking for manoeuvre long starved by the rigid discipline to which she had subjected herself she had always been awkward at it but she liked it and now it pleased her to think that she should give her letter secretly to the driver and on her way to meet him she forgot that she had meant to ask barlow for part of the address she did not remember this till it was too late to go back to the hotel and she suddenly resolved not to consult barlow but to let the driver go about from one place to another with the letter till he found the right one she kept walking on out into the forest through which the road wound and she had got a mile away before she saw the weary bowing of the horses heads as they tugged the barge through the sand at a walk she stopped involuntarily with some impulses to flight and as the vehicle drew nearer she saw the driver turned round upon his seat and talking to a passenger behind she had never counted upon his having a passenger and the fact undid all  she remained helpless in the middle of the road the horses came to a standstill a few paces from her and the driver ceased from the high key of conversation and turned to see what was the matter  my grief he shouted if it had nt been for them horses o mine i shd a run right over ye  i wished to speak with you she began i wished to send  she stopped and the passenger leaned forward to learn what was going on miss breen he exclaimed and leaped out of the back of the barge and ran to her  youyou got my letter she gasped  no what letter is there anything the matter  she did not answer she had become conscious of the letter which she had never ceased to hold in the hand that she had kept in her pocket for that purpose she crushed it into a small wad  libby turned his head and said to the driver of the barge go ahead  will you take my arm he added to her its heavy walking in this sand  no thank you she murmured recoiling im not tired  are you well have you been quite well  oh yes perfectly i did nt know you were coming back  yes i had to come back im going to europe next week and i had to come to look after my boat here and i wanted to say goodby to maynard i was just going to speak to maynard and then sail my boat over to leyden  it will be very pleasant she said without looking at him its moonlight now  oh i shant have any use for the moon i shall get over before nightfall if this breeze holds  she tried to think of something else and to get away from this talk of a sail to leyden but she fatally answered i saw your boat this afternoon i had nt noticed before that it was still here  he hesitated a moment and then asked did you happen to notice the dory  yes it was drawn up on the sand  i suppose its all rightif its in the same place  it seemed to be she answered faintly  im going to give the boat to johnson  she did not say anything for she could think of nothing to say but that she had looked for seals on the reef but had not seen any and this would have been too shamelessly leading that left the word to him and he asked timidly  i hope my coming dont seem intrusive miss breen  she did not heed this but you are going to be gone a great while she asked in turn  i dont know he replied in an uncertain tone as if troubled to make out whether she was vexed with him or not i thought he added i would go up the nile this time ive never been up the nile you know  no i didnt know that well she added to herself i wish you had not come back you had better not have come back if you had nt come you would have got my letter and now it can never be done no i cant go through it all again and no one has the right to ask it we have missed the only chance she cried to herself in such keen reproach of him that she thought she must have spoken aloud  is mrs maynard all right again he asked  yes she is very much better she answered confusedly as if he had heard her reproach and had ignored it  i hope youre not so tired as you were  no i m not tired now  i thought you looked a little pale he said sympathetically and now she saw that he was so it irritated her that she should be so far from him in all helpfulness and she could scarcely keep down the wish that ached in her heart  we are never nearer doing the thing we long to do than when we have proclaimed to ourselves that it must not and cannot be  why are you so pale she demanded almost angrily  i i didnt know that i was he answered i supposed i was pretty well i dare say i ought to be ashamed of showing it in that way but if you ask me well i will tell you i dont find it any easier than i did at first  you are to blame then she cried if i were a man i should not let such a thing wear upon me for a moment  oh i dare say i shall live through it he answered with the national whimsicality that comes to our aid in most emergencies  a little pang went through her heart but she retorted i would nt go to europe to escape it nor up the nile i would stay and fight it where i was stay he seemed to have caught hopefully at the word  i thought you were stronger if you give up in this way how can you expect meshe stopped she hardly knew what she had intended to say she feared that he knew  but he only said im sorry i didnt intend to trouble you with the sight of me i had a plan for getting over the cliff without letting you know and having maynard come down to me there  and did you really mean she cried piteously to go away without trying to see me again  yes he owned simply i thought i might catch a glimpse of you but i did nt expect to speak to you  did you hate me so badly as that what had i done to you  done he gave a sorrowful laugh and added with an absent air yes its really like doing something to me and sometimes it seems as if you had done it purposely  you know i did nt now then she cried you have insulted me and you never did that before you were very good and noble and generous and would nt let me blame myself for anything i wanted always to remember that of you for i did nt believe that any man could be so magnanimous but it seems that you dont care to have me respect you  respect he repeated in the same vague way no i should nt care about that unless it was included in the other but you know whether i have accused you of anything or whether i have insulted you i wont excuse myself i think that ought to be insulting to your common sense  then why should you have wished to avoid seeing me today was it to spare yourself she demanded quite incoherently now or did you think i should not be equal to the meeting  i dont know what to say to you answered the young man i think i must be crazy he halted and looked at her in complete bewilderment i dont understand you at all  i wished to see you very much i wanted your advice asasa friend he shook his head yes you shall be my friend in this at least i can claim itdemand it you had no right totomake metrust you so much andand thendesert me  oh very well he answered if any advice of minebut i couldnt go through that sacrilegious farce of being near you and notshe waited breathlessly a condensed eternity for him to go on but he stopped at that word and added how can i advise you  the disappointment was so cruel that the tears came into her eyes and ran down her face which she averted from him when she could control herself she said i have an opportunity of going on in my profession now in a way that makes me sure of success  i am very glad on your account you must be glad to realize  no no she retorted wildly i am not glad  i thought you  but there are conditions he says he will go with me anywhere and we can practise our profession together and i can carry out all my plans but firstfirsthe wants me tomarry him  who  dont you know dr mulbridge  thati beg your pardon ive no right to call him names the young fellow halted and looked at her downcast face well do you want me to tell you to take him that is too much i did nt know you were cruel  you make me cruel you leave me to be cruel  i leave you to be cruel  oh dont play upon my words if you wont ask me what i answered  how can i ask that i have no right to know  but you shall know she cried i told him that i had no plans i have given them all up becausebecause im too weak for them and because i abhor him and becausebut it was nt enough he would not take what i said for answer and he is coming again for an answer  coming again  yes he is a man who believes that women may change for reason or no reason and  youyou mean to take him when he comes back gasped the young man  never not if he came a thousand times  then what is it you want me to advise you about he faltered  nothing she answered with freezing hauteur she suddenly put up her arms across her eyes with the beautiful artless action of a shamesmitten child and left her young figure in bewildering relief oh dont you see that i love you  could nt you understandcouldnt you see what i meant she asked again that night as they lost themselves on the long stretch of the moonlit beach with his arm close about that lovely shape they would have seemed but one person to the inattentive observer as they paced along in the white splendor  i couldnt risk anything i had spoken once for all i always thought that for a man to offer himself twice was indelicate and unfair i could never have done it  thats very sweet in you she said and perhaps she would have praised in the same terms the precisely opposite sentiment its some comfort she added with a deepfetched sigh to think i had to speak  he laughed you didnt find it so easy to make love  oh nothing is easy that men have to do she answered with passionate earnestness  there are moments of extreme concession of magnanimous admission that come but once in a lifetime     xii  dr mulbridge did not wait for the time he had fixed for his return he may have judged that her tendency against him would strengthen by delay or he may have yielded to his own impatience in coming the next day he asked for grace with his wonted abruptness and waited for her coming in the little parlor of the hotel walking up and down the floor with his shaggy head bent forward and his big hands clasped behind him  as she hovered at the door before entering she could watch him while he walked the whole rooms length away and she felt a pang at sight of him if she could have believed that he loved her she could not have faced him but must have turned and run away and even as it was she grieved for him such a man would not have made up his mind to this step without a deep motive if not a deep feeling her heart had been softened so that she could not think of frustrating his ambition if it were no better than that without pity one man had made her feel very kindly toward all other men she wished in the tender confusion of the moment that she need not reject her importunate suitor whose importunity even she could not resent  he caught sight of her as soon as he made his turn at the end of the room and with a quick ah ah he hastened to meet her with the smile in which there was certainly something attractive you see ive come back a day sooner than i promised i havent the sort of turnout youve been used to but i want you to drive with me i cant drive with you dr mulbridge she faltered  well walk then i should prefer to walk  you must excuse me she answered and remained standing before him  sit down he bade her and pushed up a chair towards her his audacity if it had been a finer courage would have been splendid and as it was she helplessly obeyed him as if she were his patient and must do so if i were superstitious i should say that you receive me ominously he said fixing his gray eyes keenly upon her  i do she forced herself to reply i wish you had not come  thats explicit at any rate have you thought it over  no i had no need to do that i had fully resolved when i spoke yesterday dr mulbridge why didnt you spare me this its unkind of you to insist after what i said you know that i must hate to repeat it i do value you so highly in some ways that i blame you for obliging me to hurt youif it does hurtby telling you again that i dont love you  he drew in a long breath and set his teeth hard upon his lip you may depend upon its hurting he said but i was glad to risk the pain whatever it was for the chance of getting you to reconsider i presume im not the conventional wooer im too old for it and im too blunt and plain a man ive been thirtyfive years making up my mind to ask you to marry me youre the first woman and you shall be the last you couldnt suppose i was going to give you up for one no  you had better  not for twenty i can understand very well how you never thought of me in this way but theres no reason why you shouldnt come its a matter that we can reason about like anything else  no i told you its something we cant reason about or yes it is i will reason with you you say that you love me  yes  if you did nt love me you would nt ask me to marry you  no  then how can you expect me to marry you without loving you  i dont all that i ask is that you wont refuse me i know that you can love me  no no never  and i only want you to take time to try  i dont wish to try if you persist i must leave the room we had better part i was foolish to see you but i thoughti was sorryi hoped to make it less unkind to you  in spite of yourself you were relenting  not at all  but if you pitied me you did care for me a little  you know that i had the highest respect for you as a physician i tell you that you were my ideal in that way and i will tell you that ifshe stopped and he continued for her  if you had not resolved to give it up you might have done what i asked  i did not say that she answered indignantly  but why do you give it up  because i am not equal to it  how do you know it who told you  you have told meby every look and act of yoursand im grateful to you for it  and if i told you now by word that you were fit for it  i shouldnt believe you  you would nt believe my word she did not answer i see he said presently that you doubt me somehow as a man what is it you think of me  you wouldnt like to know  oh yes i should  well i will tell you i think you are a tyrant and that you want a slave not a wife you wish to be obeyed you despise women i dont mean their mindsthey re despicable enough in most cases as mens arebut their nature  this is news to me he said laughing i never knew that i despised womens nature  its true whether you knew it or not  do i despise you  you would if you saw that i was afraid of you oh why do you force me to say such things why dont you spare mespare yourself  in this cause i couldnt spare myself i cant bear to give you up im what i am whatever you say but with you i could be whatever you would i could show you that you are wrong if you gave me the chance i know that i could make you happy listen to me a moment  its useless  no if you have taken the trouble to read me in this way there must have been a time when you might have cared  there never was any such time i read you from the first  i will go away he said after a pause in which she had risen and began a retreat towards the door but i will noti cannotgive you up i will see you again  no sir you shall not see me again i will not submit to it i will not be persecuted she was trembling and she knew that he saw her tremor  well he said with a smile that recognized her trepidation i will not persecute you ill renounce these pretensions but ill ask you to see me once more as a friendan acquaintance  i will not see you again  you are rather hard with me i think he urged gently i dont think im playing the tyrant with you now  you arethe baffled tyrant  but if i promised not to offend again why should you deny me your acquaintance  because i dont believe you she was getting nearer the door and as she put her hand behind her and touched the knob the wild terror she had felt lest he should reach it first and prevent her escape left her you are treating me like a child that does nt know its own mind or has none to know you are laughing at meplaying with me you have shown me that you despise me  he actually laughed well youve shown that you are not afraid of me why are you not afraid  because she answered and she dealt the blow now without pity im engagedengaged to mr libby she whirled about and vanished through the door ashamed indignant fearing that if she had not fled he would somehow have found means to make his will prevail even yet  he stood stupefied looking at the closed door and he made a turn or two about the room before he summoned intelligence to quit it when death itself comes the sense of continuance is not at once broken in the survivors in these moral deaths which men survive in their own lives there is no immediate consciousness of an end for a while habit and the automatic tendency of desire carry them on  he drove back to corbitant perched on the rickety seat of his rattling open buggy and bowed forward as his wont was his rounded shoulders bringing his chin well over the dashboard as he passed down the long sandy street toward the corner where his own house stood the brooding group of loafers waiting in hacketts store for the distribution of the mail watched him through the open door and from under the boughs of the weatherbeaten poplar before it hackett had been cutting a pound of cheese out of the thick yellow disk before him for the widow holman and he stared at the street after mulbridge passed as if his mental eye had halted him there for the public consideration while he leaned over the counter and held by the point the long knife with which he had cut the cheese  i see some the folks from over to jocelyns yistdy he said in a spasm of sharp crackling speech and they seemed to think t mis mulbridged got to step round pretty spry f she did nt want another the same name in the house with her  a long silence followed in which no one changed in any wise the posture in which he found himself when hackett began to speak capn george wray tilted back against the wall in his chair continued to stare at the storekeeper capn jabez wray did not look up from whittling the chair between his legs their cousin capn wray storrell seated on a nailkeg near the stove went on fretting the rust on the pipe with the end of a stiff castoff envelope two other captains more or less akin to them continued their game of checkers the widow seth wrays boy rested immovable with his chin and hand on the counter where he had been trying since the widow holman went out to catch hacketts eye and buy a cornball old capn billy wray was the first to break the spell he took his cigar from his mouth and held it between his shaking thumb and forefinger while he pursed his lips for speech jabez he said did capn saml git that coalier  no answered the whittler cutting deeper into his chair she did nt signal for him till she got into the channel and then hed got a couple o passengers for leyden and capn jim brought her up  i dont know said capn billy with a stiff yet tremulous reference of himself to the storekeeper as spryness would help her as long as he took the notion i guess hes master of his own ship whos he going to marry the grahswidow got well enough  no as i understand crackled the storekeeper her husbands turned up folks over there seem to thinkt hes got his eye on the other doctor  going to marry with her hey well if either of em gets sick they wont have to go far for advice and they wont have any doctors bills to pay still i shouldnt ha picked out just that kind of a wife for him  as i understand the storekeeper began but here he caught sight of widow seth wrays boy and asked whats wanted bub cornball and turning to take that sweetmeat from the shelf behind him he added the rest in the mouth of the hollowly reverberating jar shes got propty  well i never knew a mulbridge yet t objected to proptyespecially other folkss  barlow hes tellin round that she s very fine appearin he handed the cornball to widow seth wrays boy who went noiselessly out on his bare feet  capn billy drew several long breaths when another man might have been supposed to have dismissed the subject he said well i never knew a mulbridge that objected to good looks in women folks theyve all merried hahnsome wives ever since the old gentleman set em the example with his second one they got their own looks from the first well he added i hope shes a tough one shes got either to bend or to break  they say said capn george wray like one rising from the dead to say it so dumb and motionless had he been till now that mis mulbridge was too much for the old doctor  i dont know about that capn billy replied but i guess her sons too much for her shes only gardiner and hes gardiner and mulbridge both  no one changed countenance but a sense of capn billys wit sparely yet satisfyingly glimmered from the eyes of capn george and the storekeeper and capn jabez closed his knife with a snap and looked up perhaps he suggested shes seen enough of him to know beforehand that there would be too much of him  i never rightly understood said hackett just what it was about him there in the armycoming out a year beforehand that way  i guess you never willfrom him said capn jabez  laziness i guesstoo much work said old capn billy what he wants is a wife with money there aint a better doctor anywhere ive heard t up to boston where he got his manifest they thought everything of him hes smart enough but hes lazy and he always was lazy and hardern a nut hes a curious mixtur n i guess hes been on the lookout for somethin of this kind ever sence he begun practising among the summer boarders guess hes had an eye out  they say hes poplar among em observed the storekeeper thoughtfully  hes been pooty pticlar or they have said capn jabez  well most on ems merried women hackett urged its astonishin how they do come off and leave their husbands the whole summer long they say theyre all out o health though  i wonder said old capn billy if them coaliers is goin to make a settled thing of haulin inside before they signal a pilot  i know one thing answered capn jabez that if any coalier signals me in the channel ill see her in hell first he slipped his smooth warm knife into his pocket and walked out of the store amid a general silence  hes considble worked up about them coaliers said old capn billy i dont know as ive heard jabez swear beforenot since he was mate of the gallatin he used to swear then considable  them coaliers is enough to make any one swear said capn george if its any ways fair weather they wont take you outside and they cut you down from twentyfive dollars to two dollars if they take you inside  old capn billy did not answer before he had breathed awhile and then having tried his cigar and found it out he scraped a match on his coatsleeve he looked at the flame while it burned from blue to yellow well i guess if anybodys been pticlar its been him there aint any doubt but what hes got a takin way with the women they like him hes masterful and he aint a fool and women most genly like a man that aint a fool i guess if he s got his eye on the girls propty shell have to come along hed begin by havin his own way about her answer hed hang on till she said yes if she did nt say it firstoff and hed keep on as hed begun i guess if he wants her its a match and capn billy threw his own into the square box of tobaccostained sawdust under the stove  mrs maynard fully shared the opinion which rocked dr mulbridges defeat with a belief in his invincible will when it became necessary in the course of events which made grace and libby resolve upon a short engagement to tell her that they were going to be married she expressed a frank astonishment walter libby she cried well i am surprised when i was talking to you the other day about getting married of course i supposed it was going to be dr mulbridge i did nt want you to marry him but i thought you were going to  and why demanded grace with mounting sensation did you think that  oh i thought you would have to  have to  oh you have such a weak will or i always thought you had but perhaps its only a weak will with other women i dont know but walter libby i knew he was perfectly gone upon you and i told you so at the beginning but i never dreamt of your caring for him why it seems too ridiculous  indeed im glad that it amuses you  oh no youre not grace but you know what i mean he seems so much younger  younger hes half a year older than i am  i did nt say he was younger but youre so very grave and hes so very light well i always told walter libby i should get him a wife but you were the last person i should have thought of whats going to become of all your high purposes you cant do anything with them when youre married but you wont have any occasion for them thats one comfort  its not my idea of marriage that any high purpose will be lost in it  oh it is nt anybodys before they get married i had such high purposes i couldnt rest i felt like hiring a hall as george says all the time walter libby is nt going to let you practise is he you mustnt let him i know hed be willing to do anything you said but a husband ought to be something more than a mere  co  grace laughed at the impudent cynicism of all this for she was too happy to be vexed with any one just then im glad youve come to think so well of husbands rights at last louise she said  mrs maynard took the little puncture in good part oh yes george and i have had a good deal of light let in on us i dont suppose my character was much changed outwardly in my sickness she suggested  it was not answered grace warmly it was intensified that was all  mrs maynard laughed in her turn with real enjoyment of the conception well i wasnt going to let on unless it came to the worst i did nt say much but i kept up an awful thinking it would have been easy enough to get a divorce and george would nt have opposed it but i looked at it in this way that the divorce wouldnt have put us back where we were anyway as i had supposed it would we had broken into each others lives and we couldnt get out again with all the divorces under the sun thats the worst of getting married you break into each others lives you said something like it to me that day when you came back from your sail with walter libby and i just concluded that there could nt be any trial that would nt be a great deal easier to bear than getting rid of all your trials and i just made up my mind that if any divorce was to be got george maynard might get it himself a temporary separation was bad enough for me and i told him so about the first words i could speak and were going to try the new departure on that platform we dont either of us suspect we can have things perfectly smooth but weve agreed to rough it together when we cant weve found out that we cant marry and then become single any more than we could die and come to life again and dont you forget it grace you dont half know yourself now you know what you have been but getting married lets loose all your possibilities you dont know what a temper youve got nor how badly you can behavehow much like a naughty goodfornothing little girl for a husband and wife are just two children together thats what makes the sweetness of it and thats what makes the dreadfulness oh youll have need of all your good principles i can tell you and if youve a mind to do anything practical in the way of high purposes i reckon therell be use for them all  another lady who was astonished at graces choice was more incurably disappointed and more grieved for the waste of those noble aims with which her worshipping fancy had endowed the girl even more richly than her own ambition it was graces wish to pass a year in europe before her husband should settle down in charge of his mills and their engagement marriage and departure followed so swiftly upon one another that miss gleason would have had no opportunity to proffer remonstrance or advice she could only account for graces course on the theory that dr mulbridge had failed to offer himself but this explained her failure to marry him without explaining her marriage with mr libby that remained for some time a mystery for miss gleason firmly refused to believe that such a girl could be in love with a man so much her inferior the conception disgraced not only her idol but cast shame upon all other women whose course in such matters is notoriously governed by motives of the highest sagacity and judgment  mrs breen hesitated between the duty of accompanying the young couple on their european travels and that of going to the village where libbys mills were situatedin southern new hampshire she was not strongly urged to a decision by her children and she finally chose the latter course the mill property had been a long time abandoned before libbys father bought it and put it in a repair which he did not hasten to extend to the village this had remained in a sort of picturesque neglect which harmonized with the scenery of the wild little valley where it nestled and mrs breen found upon the vigorous inquiry which she set on foot that the operatives were deplorably destitute of culture and drainage she at once devoted herself to the establishment of a circulating library and an enlightened system of cesspools to such an effect of ingratitude in her beneficiaries that she was quite ready to remand them to their former squalor when her soninlaw returned but he found her work all so good that he mediated between her and the inhabitants and adopted it with a hearty appreciation that went far to console her and finally popularized it in fact he entered into the spirit of all practical reforms with an energy and intelligence that quite reconciled her to him it was rather with grace than with him that she had fault to find she believed that the girl had returned from europe materialized and corrupted and she regarded the souvenirs of travel with which the house was filled as so many tokens of moral decay it is undeniable that grace seemed for a time to have softened to a certain degree of selfindulgence during the brief opera season the first winter after her return she spent a week in boston she often came to the city and went to the theatres and the exhibitions of pictures it was for some time miss gleasons opinion that these escapades were the struggles of a magnanimous nature unequally mated to forget itself when they met she indulged the habit of regarding mrs libby with eyes of latent pity till one day she heard something that gave her more relief than she could ever have hoped for this was the fact perfectly ascertained by some summer sojourners in the neighborhood that mrs libby was turning her professional training to account by treating the sick children among her husbands operatives  in the fall miss gleason saw her heroine at an exhibition of pictures she rushed across the main hall of the museum to greet her congratulate you she deeply whispered on realizing your dream now you are happy now you can be at peace  happy at peace  in the good work you have taken up oh nothing under gawd is lost she exclaimed getting ready to run away and speaking with her face turned over her shoulder towards mrs libby  dream good work what do you mean  those factory children  oh said mrs libby coldly that was my husbands idea  your husbands cried miss gleason facing about again and trying to let a whole history of suddenly relieved anxiety speak in her eyes how happy you make me do let me thank you  in the effort to shake hands with mrs libby she knocked the catalogue out of her hold and vanished in the crowd without knowing it some gentleman picked it up and gave it to her again with a bow of burlesque devotion  mrs libby flushed tenderly i might have known it would be you walter where did you spring from  ive been here ever since you came  what in the world doing  oh enjoying myself  looking at the pictures  watching you walk round  i thought you couldnt be enjoying the pictures she said simply im not  she was not happy indeed in any of the aesthetic dissipations into which she had plunged and it was doubtless from a shrewder knowledge of her nature than she had herself that her husband had proposed this active usefulness which she once intended under such different conditions at the end of the ends she was a puritan belated misdated if the reader will and cast upon good works for the consolation which the puritans formerly found in a creed riches and ease were sinful to her and somehow to be atoned for and she had no real love for anything that was not of an immediate humane and spiritual effect under the shelter of her husbands name the benevolent use of her skill was no queerer than the charity to which many ladies devote themselves though they are neither of them people to have felt the anguish which comes from the fear of what other people will think they go their way in life and are probably not disturbed by any misgivings concerning them it is thought on one hand that he is a man of excellent head and of a heart so generous that his deference to her in certain matters is part of the devoted flattery which would spoil any other woman but that she consults his judgment in every action of her life and trusts his sense with the same completeness that she trusts his love on the other hand when it is felt that she ought to have done for the sake of woman what she could not do
