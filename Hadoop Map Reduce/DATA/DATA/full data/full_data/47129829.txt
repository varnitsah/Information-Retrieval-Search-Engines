47129829	old christmas  by washington irving   but is old old good old christmas gone nothing but the hair of his good gray old head and beard left well i will have that seeing that i cannot have more of him  hue and cry after christmas     contents   christmas  the stagecoach  christmas eve  christmas day  the christmas dinner        a man might then behold        at christmas in each hall      good fires to curb the cold        and meat for great and small      the neighbours were friendly bidden        and all had welcome true      the poor from the gates were not chidden        when this old cap was new       old song     christmas   there is nothing in england that exercises a more delightful spell over my imagination than the lingerings of the holiday customs and rural games of former times they recall the pictures my fancy used to draw in the may morning of life when as yet i only knew the world through books and believed it to be all that poets had painted it and they bring with them the flavour of those honest days of yore in which perhaps with equal fallacy i am apt to think the world was more homebred social and joyous than at present i regret to say that they are daily growing more and more faint being gradually worn away by time but still more obliterated by modern fashion they resemble those picturesque morsels of gothic architecture which we see crumbling in various parts of the country partly dilapidated by the waste of ages and partly lost in the additions and alterations of latter days poetry however clings with cherishing fondness about the rural game and holiday revel from which it has derived so many of its themesas the ivy winds its rich foliage about the gothic arch and mouldering tower gratefully repaying their support by clasping together their tottering remains and as it were embalming them in verdure  of all the old festivals however that of christmas awakens the strongest and most heartfelt associations there is a tone of solemn and sacred feeling that blends with our conviviality and lifts the spirit to a state of hallowed and elevated enjoyment the services of the church about this season are extremely tender and inspiring they dwell on the beautiful story of the origin of our faith and the pastoral scenes that accompanied its announcement they gradually increase in fervour and pathos during the season of advent until they break forth in full jubilee on the morning that brought peace and goodwill to men i do not know a grander effect of music on the moral feelings than to hear the full choir and the pealing organ performing a christmas anthem in a cathedral and filling every part of the vast pile with triumphant harmony  it is a beautiful arrangement also derived from days of yore that this festival which commemorates the announcement of the religion of peace and love has been made the season for gathering together of family connections and drawing closer again those bands of kindred hearts which the cares and pleasures and sorrows of the world are continually operating to cast loose of calling back the children of a family who have launched forth in life and wandered widely asunder once more to assemble about the paternal hearth that rallyingplace of the affections there to grow young and loving again among the endearing mementoes of childhood  there is something in the very season of the year that gives a charm to the festivity of christmas at other times we derive a great portion of our pleasures from the mere beauties of nature our feelings sally forth and dissipate themselves over the sunny landscape and we live abroad and everywhere the song of the bird the murmur of the stream the breathing fragrance of spring the soft voluptuousness of summer the golden pomp of autumn earth with its mantle of refreshing green and heaven with its deep delicious blue and its cloudy magnificence all fill us with mute but exquisite delight and we revel in the luxury of mere sensation but in the depth of winter when nature lies despoiled of every charm and wrapped in her shroud of sheeted snow we turn for our gratifications to moral sources the dreariness and desolation of the landscape the short gloomy days and darksome nights while they circumscribe our wanderings shut in our feelings also from rambling abroad and make us more keenly disposed for the pleasures of the social circle our thoughts are more concentrated our friendly sympathies more aroused we feel more sensibly the charm of each others society and are brought more closely together by dependence on each other for enjoyment heart calleth unto heart and we draw our pleasures from the deep wells of living kindness which lie in the quiet recesses of our bosoms and which when resorted to furnish forth the pure element of domestic felicity  the pitchy gloom without makes the heart dilate on entering the room filled with the glow and warmth of the evening fire the ruddy blaze diffuses an artificial summer and sunshine through the room and lights up each countenance into a kindlier welcome where does the honest face of hospitality expand into a broader and more cordial smilewhere is the shy glance of love more sweetly eloquentthan by the winter fireside and as the hollow blast of wintry wind rushes through the hall claps the distant door whistles about the casement and rumbles down the chimney what can be more grateful than that feeling of sober and sheltered security with which we look around upon the comfortable chamber and the scene of domestic hilarity  the english from the great prevalence of rural habits throughout every class of society have always been fond of those festivals and holidays which agreeably interrupt the stillness of country life and they were in former days particularly observant of the religious and social rites of christmas it is inspiring to read even the dry details which some antiquarians have given of the quaint humours the burlesque pageants the complete abandonment to mirth and goodfellowship with which this festival was celebrated it seemed to throw open every door and unlock every heart it brought the peasant and the peer together and blended all ranks in one warm generous flow of joy and kindness the old halls of castles and manorhouses resounded with the harp and the christmas carol and their ample boards groaned under the weight of hospitality even the poorest cottage welcomed the festive season with green decorations of bay and hollythe cheerful fire glanced its rays through the lattice inviting the passenger to raise the latch and join the gossip knot huddled around the hearth beguiling the long evening with legendary jokes and ofttold christmas tales  one of the least pleasing effects of modern refinement is the havoc it has made among the hearty old holiday customs it has completely taken off the sharp touchings and spirited reliefs of these embellishments of life and has worn down society into a more smooth and polished but certainly a less characteristic surface many of the games and ceremonials of christmas have entirely disappeared and like the sherris sack of old falstaff are become matters of speculation and dispute among commentators they flourished in times full of spirit and lustihood when men enjoyed life roughly but heartily and vigorously times wild and picturesque which have furnished poetry with its richest materials and the drama with its most attractive variety of characters and manners the world has become more worldly there is more of dissipation and less of enjoyment pleasure has expanded into a broader but a shallower stream and has forsaken many of those deep and quiet channels where it flowed sweetly through the calm bosom of domestic life society has acquired a more enlightened and elegant tone but it has lost many of its strong local peculiarities its homebred feelings its honest fireside delights the traditionary customs of goldenhearted antiquity its feudal hospitalities and lordly wassailings have passed away with the baronial castles and stately manorhouses in which they were celebrated they comported with the shadowy hall the great oaken gallery and the tapestried parlour but are unfitted to the light showy saloons and gay drawingrooms of the modern villa  shorn however as it is of its ancient and festive honours christmas is still a period of delightful excitement in england it is gratifying to see that home feeling completely aroused which seems to hold so powerful a place in every english bosom the preparations making on every side for the social board that is again to unite friends and kindred the presents of good cheer passing and repassing those tokens of regard and quickeners of kind feelings the evergreens distributed about houses and churches emblems of peace and gladness all these have the most pleasing effect in producing fond associations and kindling benevolent sympathies even the sound of the waits rude as may be their minstrelsy breaks upon the midwatches of a winter night with the effect of perfect harmony as i have been awakened by them in that still and solemn hour when deep sleep falleth upon man i have listened with a hushed delight and connecting them with the sacred and joyous occasion have almost fancied them into another celestial choir announcing peace and goodwill to mankind  how delightfully the imagination when wrought upon by these moral influences turns everything to melody and beauty the very crowing of the cock who is sometimes heard in the profound repose of the country telling the nightwatches to his feathery dames was thought by the common people to announce the approach of this sacred festival       some say that ever gainst that season comes      wherein our saviours birth is celebrated      this bird of dawning singeth all night long      and then they say no spirit dares stir abroad      the nights are wholesomethen no planets strike      no fairy takes no witch hath power to charm      so hallowd and so gracious is the time  amidst the general call to happiness the bustle of the spirits and stir of the affections which prevail at this period what bosom can remain insensible it is indeed the season of regenerated feelingthe season for kindling not merely the fire of hospitality in the hall but the genial flame of charity in the heart  the scene of early love again rises green to memory beyond the sterile waste of years and the idea of home fraught with the fragrance of homedwelling joys reanimates the drooping spiritas the arabian breeze will sometimes waft the freshness of the distant fields to the weary pilgrim of the desert  stranger and sojourner as i am in the landthough for me no social hearth may blaze no hospitable roof throw open its doors nor the warm grasp of friendship welcome me at the thresholdyet i feel the influence of the season beaming into my soul from the happy looks of those around me surely happiness is reflective like the light of heaven and every countenance bright with smiles and glowing with innocent enjoyment is a mirror transmitting to others the rays of a supreme and ever shining benevolence he who can turn churlishly away from contemplating the felicity of his fellow beings and sit down darkling and repining in his loneliness when all around is joyful may have his moments of strong excitement and selfish gratification but he wants the genial and social sympathies which constitute the charm of a merry christmas     the stagecoach           omne bene          sine poena      tempus est ludendi          venit hora          absque mora      libros deponendi           old holiday school song  in the preceding paper i have made some general observations on the christmas festivities of england and am tempted to illustrate them by some anecdotes of a christmas passed in the country in perusing which i would most courteously invite my reader to lay aside the austerity of wisdom and to put on that genuine holiday spirit which is tolerant of folly and anxious only for amusement  in the course of a december tour in yorkshire i rode for a long distance in one of the public coaches on the day preceding christmas the coach was crowded both inside and out with passengers who by their talk seemed principally bound to the mansions of relations or friends to eat the christmas dinner it was loaded also with hampers of game and baskets and boxes of delicacies and hares hung dangling their long ears about the coachmans boxpresents from distant friends for the impending feast i had three fine rosycheeked schoolboys for my fellow passengers inside full of the buxom health and manly spirit which i have observed in the children of this country they were returning home for the holidays in high glee and promising themselves a world of enjoyment it was delightful to hear the gigantic plans of pleasure of the little rogues and the impracticable feats they were to perform during their six weeks emancipation from the abhorred thraldom of book birch and pedagogue they were full of anticipations of the meeting with the family and household down to the very cat and dog and of the joy they were to give their little sisters by the presents with which their pockets were crammed but the meeting to which they seemed to look forward with the greatest impatience was with bantam which i found to be a pony and according to their talk possessed of more virtues than any steed since the days of bucephalus how he could trot how he could run and then such leaps as he would takethere was not a hedge in the whole country that he could not clear  they were under the particular guardianship of the coachman to whom whenever an opportunity presented they addressed a host of questions and pronounced him one of the best fellows in the whole world indeed i could not but notice the more than ordinary air of bustle and importance of the coachman who wore his hat a little on one side and had a large bunch of christmas greens stuck in the buttonhole of his coat he is always a personage full of mighty care and business but he is particularly so during this season having so many commissions to execute in consequence of the great interchange of presents  and here perhaps it may not be unacceptable to my untravelled readers to have a sketch that may serve as a general representation of this very numerous and important class of functionaries who have a dress a manner a language an air peculiar to themselves and prevalent throughout the fraternity so that wherever an english stagecoachman may be seen he cannot be mistaken for one of any other craft or mystery  he has commonly a broad full face curiously mottled with red as if the blood had been forced by hard feeding into every vessel of the skin he is swelled into jolly dimensions by frequent potations of malt liquors and his bulk is still further increased by a multiplicity of coats in which he is buried like a cauliflower the upper one reaching to his heels he wears a broadbrimmed lowcrowned hat a huge roll of coloured handkerchief about his neck knowingly knotted and tucked in at the bosom and has in summertime a large bouquet of flowers in his buttonhole the present most probably of some enamoured country lass his waistcoat is commonly of some bright colour striped and his smallclothes extend far below the knees to meet a pair of jockey boots which reach about halfway up his legs  all this costume is maintained with much precision he has a pride in having his clothes of excellent materials and notwithstanding the seeming grossness of his appearance there is still discernible that neatness and propriety of person which is almost inherent in an englishman he enjoys great consequence and consideration along the road has frequent conferences with the village housewives who look upon him as a man of great trust and dependence and he seems to have a good understanding with every brighteyed country lass the moment he arrives where the horses are to be changed he throws down the reins with something of an air and abandons the cattle to the care of the hostler his duty being merely to drive from one stage to another  when off the box his hands are thrust in the pockets of his greatcoat and he rolls about the innyard with an air of the most absolute lordliness here he is generally surrounded by an admiring throng of hostlers stableboys shoeblacks and those nameless hangerson that infest inns and taverns and run errands and do all kinds of odd jobs for the privilege of battening on the drippings of the kitchen and the leakage of the taproom these all look up to him as to an oracle treasure up his cant phrases echo his opinions about horses and other topics of jockey lore and above all endeavour to imitate his air and carriage every ragamuffin that has a coat to his back thrusts his hands in the pockets rolls in his gait talks slang and is an embryo coachey  perhaps it might be owing to the pleasing serenity that reigned in my own mind that i fancied i saw cheerfulness in every countenance throughout the journey a stagecoach however carries animation always with it and puts the world in motion as it whirls along the horn sounded at the entrance of a village produces a general bustle some hasten forth to meet friends some with bundles and bandboxes to secure places and in the hurry of the moment can hardly take leave of the group that accompanies them in the meantime the coachman has a world of small commissions to execute sometimes he delivers a hare or pheasant sometimes jerks a small parcel or newspaper to the door of a publichouse and sometimes with knowing leer and words of sly import hands to some halfblushing halflaughing housemaid an oddshaped billetdoux from some rustic admirer as the coach rattles through the village every one runs to the window and you have glances on every side of fresh country faces and blooming giggling girls at the corners are assembled juntas of village idlers and wise men who take their stations there for the important purpose of seeing company pass but the sagest knot is generally at the blacksmiths to whom the passing of the coach is an event fruitful of much speculation the smith with the horses heel in his lap pauses as the vehicle whirls by the cyclops round the anvil suspend their ringing hammers and suffer the iron to grow cool and the sooty spectre in brown paper cap labouring at the bellows leans on the handle for a moment and permits the asthmatic engine to heave a longdrawn sigh while he glares through the murky smoke and sulphureous gleams of the smithy  perhaps the impending holiday might have given a more than usual animation to the country for it seemed to me as if everybody was in good looks and good spirits game poultry and other luxuries of the table were in brisk circulation in the villages the grocers butchers and fruiterers shops were thronged with customers the housewives were stirring briskly about putting their dwellings in order and the glossy branches of holly with their bright red berries began to appear at the windows the scene brought to mind an old writers account of christmas preparationsnow capons and hens besides turkeys geese and ducks with beef and muttonmust all die for in twelve days a multitude of people will not be fed with a little now plums and spice sugar and honey square it among pies and broth now or never must music be in tune for the youth must dance and sing to get them a heat while the aged sit by the fire the country maid leaves half her market and must be sent again if she forgets a pack of cards on christmas eve great is the contention of holly and ivy whether master or dame wears the breeches dice and cards benefit the butler and if the cook do not lack wit he will sweetly lick his fingers  i was roused from this fit of luxurious meditation by a shout from my little travelling companions they had been looking out of the coachwindows for the last few miles recognising every tree and cottage as they approached home and now there was a general burst of joytheres john and theres old carlo and theres bantam cried the happy little rogues clapping their hands  at the end of a lane there was an old soberlooking servant in livery waiting for them he was accompanied by a superannuated pointer and by the redoubtable bantam a little old rat of a pony with a shaggy mane and long rusty tail who stood dozing quietly by the roadside little dreaming of the bustling times that awaited him  i was pleased to see the fondness with which the little fellows leaped about the steady old footman and hugged the pointer who wriggled his whole body for joy but bantam was the great object of interest all wanted to mount at once and it was with some difficulty that john arranged that they should ride by turns and the eldest should ride first  off they set at last one on the pony with the dog bounding and barking before him and the others holding johns hands both talking at once and overpowering him by questions about home and with school anecdotes i looked after them with a feeling in which i do not know whether pleasure or melancholy predominated for i was reminded of those days when like them i had neither known care nor sorrow and a holiday was the summit of earthly felicity we stopped a few moments afterward to water the horses and on resuming our route a turn of the road brought us in sight of a neat country seat i could just distinguish the forms of a lady and two young girls in the portico and i saw my little comrades with bantam carlo and old john trooping along the carriage road i leaned out of the coachwindow in hopes of witnessing the happy meeting but a grove of trees shut it from my sight  in the evening we reached a village where i had determined to pass the night as we drove into the great gateway of the inn i saw on one side the light of a rousing kitchen fire beaming through a window i entered and admired for the hundredth time that picture of convenience neatness and broad honest enjoyment the kitchen of an english inn it was of spacious dimensions hung round with copper and tin vessels highly polished and decorated here and there with a christmas green hams tongues and flitches of bacon were suspended from the ceiling a smokejack made its ceaseless clanking beside the fireplace and a clock ticked in one corner a well scoured deal table extended along one side of the kitchen with a cold round of beef and other hearty viands upon it over which two foaming tankards of ale seemed mounting guard  travellers of inferior order were preparing to attack this stout repast while others sat smoking and gossiping over their ale on two highbacked oaken seats beside the fire trim housemaids were hurrying backwards and forwards under the directions of a fresh bustling landlady but still seizing an occasional moment to exchange a flippant word and have a rallying laugh with the group round the fire the scene completely realised poor robins humble idea of the comforts of midwinter       now trees their leafy hats do bare      to reverence winters silver hair      a handsome hostess merry host      a pot of ale now and a toast      tobacco and a good coal fire      are things this season doth require         poor robins almanack 1684  i had not been long at the inn when a postchaise drove up to the door a young gentleman stepped out and by the light of the lamps i caught a glimpse of a countenance which i thought i knew i moved forward to get a nearer view when his eye caught mine i was not mistaken it was frank bracebridge a sprightly goodhumoured young fellow with whom i had once travelled on the continent our meeting was extremely cordial for the countenance of an old fellow traveller always brings up the recollection of a thousand pleasant scenes odd adventures and excellent jokes to discuss all these in a transient interview at an inn was impossible and finding that i was not pressed for time and was merely making a tour of observation he insisted that i should give him a day or two at his fathers countryseat to which he was going to pass the holidays and which lay at a few miles distance it is better than eating a solitary christmas dinner at an inn said he and i can assure you of a hearty welcome in something of the oldfashion style his reasoning was cogent and i must confess the preparation i had seen for universal festivity and social enjoyment had made me feel a little impatient of my loneliness i closed therefore at once with his invitation the chaise drove up to the door and in a few moments i was on my way to the family mansion of the bracebridges     christmas eve       saint francis and saint benedight      blesse this house from wicked wight      from the nightmare and the goblin      that is hight goodfellow robin      keep it from all evil spirits      fairies weezels rats and ferrets             from curfew time             to the next prime                             cartwright  it was a brilliant moonlight night but extremely cold our chaise whirled rapidly over the frozen ground the postboy smacked his whip incessantly and a part of the time his horses were on a gallop he knows where he is going said my companion laughing and is eager to arrive in time for some of the merriment and good cheer of the servants hall my father you must know is a bigoted devotee of the old school and prides himself upon keeping up something of old english hospitality he is a tolerable specimen of what you will rarely meet with nowadays in its purity the old english country gentleman for our men of fortune spend so much of their time in town and fashion is carried so much into the country that the strong rich peculiarities of ancient rural life are almost polished away my father however from early years took honest peacham for his textbook instead of chesterfield he determined in his own mind that there was no condition more truly honourable and enviable than that of a country gentleman on his paternal lands and therefore passes the whole of his time on his estate he is a strenuous advocate for the revival of the old rural games and holiday observances and is deeply read in the writers ancient and modern who have treated on the subject indeed his favourite range of reading is among the authors who flourished at least two centuries since who he insists wrote and thought more like true englishmen than any of their successors he even regrets sometimes that he had not been born a few centuries earlier when england was itself and had its peculiar manners and customs as he lives at some distance from the main road in rather a lonely part of the country without any rival gentry near him he has that most enviable of all blessings to an englishman an opportunity of indulging the bent of his own humour without molestation being representative of the oldest family in the neighbourhood and a great part of the peasantry being his tenants he is much looked up to and in general is known simply by the appellation of the squire a title which has been accorded to the head of the family since time immemorial i think it best to give you these hints about my worthy old father to prepare you for any little eccentricities that might otherwise appear absurd        peachams complete gentleman 1622  we had passed for some time along the wall of a park and at length the chaise stopped at the gate it was in a heavy magnificent old style of iron bars fancifully wrought at top into flourishes and flowers the huge square columns that supported the gate were surmounted by the family crest close adjoining was the porters lodge sheltered under dark firtrees and almost buried in shrubbery  the postboy rang a large porters bell which resounded through the still frosty air and was answered by the distant barking of dogs with which the mansionhouse seemed garrisoned an old woman immediately appeared at the gate as the moonlight fell strongly upon her i had full view of a little primitive dame dressed very much in the antique taste with a neat kerchief and stomacher and her silver hair peeping from under a cap of snowy whiteness she came curtseying forth with many expressions of simple joy at seeing her young master her husband it seems was up at the house keeping christmas eve in the servants hall they could not do without him as he was the best hand at a song and story in the household  my friend proposed that we should alight and walk through the park to the hall which was at no great distance while the chaise should follow on our road wound through a noble avenue of trees among the naked branches of which the moon glittered as she rolled through the deep vault of a cloudless sky the lawn beyond was sheeted with a slight covering of snow which here and there sparkled as the moonbeams caught a frosty crystal and at a distance might be seen a thin transparent vapour stealing up from the low grounds and threatening gradually to shroud the landscape  my companion looked round him with transporthow often said he have i scampered up this avenue on returning home on school vacations how often have i played under these trees when a boy i feel a degree of filial reverence for them as we look up to those who have cherished us in childhood my father was always scrupulous in exacting our holidays and having us around him on family festivals he used to direct and superintend our games with the strictness that some parents do the studies of their children he was very particular that we should play the old english games according to their original form and consulted old books for precedent and authority for every merrie disport yet i assure you there never was pedantry so delightful it was the policy of the good old gentleman to make his children feel that home was the happiest place in the world and i value this delicious homefeeling as one of the choicest gifts a parent can bestow  we were interrupted by the clangour of a troop of dogs of all sorts and sizes mongrel puppy whelp and hound and curs of low degree that disturbed by the ringing of the porters bell and the rattling of the chaise came bounding openmouthed across the lawn                    the little dogs and all          tray blanch and sweetheartsee they bark at me  cried bracebridge laughing at the sound of his voice the bark was changed into a yelp of delight and in a moment he was surrounded and almost overpowered by the caresses of the faithful animals  we had now come in full view of the old family mansion partly thrown in deep shadow and partly lit up by the cold moonshine it was an irregular building of some magnitude and seemed to be of the architecture of different periods one wing was evidently very ancient with heavy stoneshafted bow windows jutting out and overrun with ivy from among the foliage of which the small diamondshaped panes of glass glittered with the moonbeams the rest of the house was in the french taste of charles the seconds time having been repaired and altered as my friend told me by one of his ancestors who returned with that monarch at the restoration the grounds about the house were laid out in the old formal manner of artificial flowerbeds clipped shrubberies raised terraces and heavy stone balustrades ornamented with urns a leaden statue or two and a jet of water the old gentleman i was told was extremely careful to preserve this obsolete finery in all its original state he admired this fashion in gardening it had an air of magnificence was courtly and noble and befitting good old family style the boasted imitation of nature in modern gardening had sprung up with modern republican notions but did not suit a monarchical government it smacked of the levelling system i could not help smiling at this introduction of politics into gardening though i expressed some apprehension that i should find the old gentleman rather intolerant in his creed frank assured me however that it was almost the only instance in which he had ever heard his father meddle with politics and he believed that he had got this notion from a member of parliament who once passed a few weeks with him the squire was glad of any argument to defend his clipped yewtrees and formal terraces which had been occasionally attacked by modern landscape gardeners  as we approached the house we heard the sound of music and now and then a burst of laughter from one end of the building this bracebridge said must proceed from the servants hall where a great deal of revelry was permitted and even encouraged by the squire throughout the twelve days of christmas provided everything was done comformably to ancient usage here were kept up the old games of hoodman blind shoe the wild mare hot cockles steal the white loaf bob apple and snapdragon the yule log and christmas candle were regularly burnt and the mistletoe with its white berries hung up to the imminent peril of all the pretty housemaids       1 see note a  so intent were the servants upon their sports that we had to ring repeatedly before we could make ourselves heard on our arrival being announced the squire came out to receive us accompanied by his two other sons one a young officer in the army home on leave of absence the other an oxonian just from the university the squire was a fine healthylooking old gentleman with silver hair curling lightly round an open florid countenance in which a physiognomist with the advantage like myself of a previous hint or two might discover a singular mixture of whim and benevolence  the family meeting was warm and affectionate as the evening was far advanced the squire would not permit us to change our travelling dresses but ushered us at once to the company which was assembled in a large oldfashioned hall it was composed of different branches of a numerous family connection where there were the usual proportion of old uncles and aunts comfortably married dames superannuated spinsters blooming country cousins halffledged striplings and brighteyed boardingschool hoydens they were variously occupied some at a round game of cards others conversing around the fireplace at one end of the hall was a group of the young folks some nearly grown up others of a more tender and budding age fully engrossed by a merry game and a profusion of wooden horses penny trumpets and tattered dolls about the floor showed traces of a troop of little fairy beings who having frolicked through a happy day had been carried off to slumber through a peaceful night  while the mutual greetings were going on between bracebridge and his relatives i had time to scan the apartment i have called it a hall for so it had certainly been in old times and the squire had evidently endeavoured to restore it to something of its primitive state over the heavy projecting fireplace was suspended a picture of a warrior in armour standing by a white horse and on the opposite wall hung helmet buckler and lance at one end an enormous pair of antlers were inserted in the wall the branches serving as hooks on which to suspend hats whips and spurs and in the corners of the apartment were fowlingpieces fishingrods and other sporting implements the furniture was of the cumbrous workmanship of former days though some articles of modern convenience had been added and the oaken floor had been carpeted so that the whole presented an odd mixture of parlour and hall  the grate had been removed from the wide overwhelming fireplace to make way for a fire of wood in the midst of which was an enormous log glowing and blazing and sending forth a vast volume of light and heat this i understood was the yulelog which the squire was particular in having brought in and illumined on a christmas eve according to ancient custom       2 see note b  it was really delightful to see the old squire seated in his hereditary elbowchair by the hospitable fireside of his ancestors and looking around him like the sun of a system beaming warmth and gladness to every heart even the very dog that lay stretched at his feet as he lazily shifted his position and yawned would look fondly up in his masters face wag his tail against the floor and stretch himself again to sleep confident of kindness and protection there is an emanation from the heart in genuine hospitality which cannot be described but is immediately felt and puts the stranger at once at his ease i had not been seated many minutes by the comfortable hearth of the worthy cavalier before i found myself as much at home as if i had been one of the family  supper was announced shortly after our arrival it was served up in a spacious oaken chamber the panels of which shone with wax and around which were several family portraits decorated with holly and ivy beside the accustomed lights two great wax tapers called christmas candles wreathed with greens were placed on a highlypolished buffet among the family plate the table was abundantly spread with substantial fare but the squire made his supper of frumenty a dish made of wheat cakes boiled in milk with rich spices being a standing dish in old times for christmas eve i was happy to find my old friend mincedpie in the retinue of the feast and finding him to be perfectly orthodox and that i need not be ashamed of my predilection i greeted him with all the warmth wherewith we usually greet an old and very genteel acquaintance  the mirth of the company was greatly promoted by the humours of an eccentric personage whom mr bracebridge always addressed with the quaint appellation of master simon he was a tight brisk little man with the air of an arrant old bachelor his nose was shaped like the bill of a parrot his face slightly pitted with the smallpox with a dry perpetual bloom on it like a frostbitten leaf in autumn he had an eye of great quickness and vivacity with a drollery and lurking waggery of expression that was irresistible he was evidently the wit of the family dealing very much in sly jokes and innuendoes with the ladies and making infinite merriment by harpings upon old themes which unfortunately my ignorance of the family chronicles did not permit me to enjoy it seemed to be his great delight during supper to keep a young girl next him in a continual agony of stifled laughter in spite of her awe of the reproving looks of her mother who sat opposite indeed he was the idol of the younger part of the company who laughed at everything he said or did and at every turn of his countenance i could not wonder at it for he must have been a miracle of accomplishments in their eyes he could imitate punch and judy make an old woman of his hand with the assistance of a burnt cork and pockethandkerchief and cut an orange into such a ludicrous caricature that the young folks were ready to die with laughing  i was let briefly into his history by frank bracebridge he was an old bachelor of a small independent income which by careful management was sufficient for all his wants he revolved through the family system like a vagrant comet in its orbit sometimes visiting one branch and sometimes another quite remote as is often the case with gentlemen of extensive connections and small fortunes in england he had a chirping buoyant disposition always enjoying the present moment and his frequent change of scene and company prevented his acquiring those rusty unaccommodating habits with which old bachelors are so uncharitably charged he was a complete family chronicle being versed in the genealogy history and intermarriages of the whole house of bracebridge which made him a great favourite with the old folks he was a beau of all the elder ladies and superannuated spinsters among whom he was habitually considered rather a young fellow and he was a master of the revels among the children so that there was not a more popular being in the sphere in which he moved than mr simon bracebridge of late years he had resided almost entirely with the squire to whom he had become a factotum and whom he particularly delighted by jumping with his humour in respect to old times and by having a scrap of an old song to suit every occasion we had presently a specimen of his last mentioned talent for no sooner was supper removed and spiced wines and other beverages peculiar to the season introduced than master simon was called on for a good old christmas song he bethought himself for a moment and then with a sparkle of the eye and a voice that was by no means bad excepting that it ran occasionally into a falsetto like the notes of a split reed he quavered forth a quaint old ditty                 now christmas is come                 let us beat up the drum          and call all our neighbours together                 and when they appear                 let us make them such cheer          as will keep out the wind and the weather                 etc  the supper had disposed every one to gaiety and an old harper was summoned from the servants hall where he had been strumming all the evening and to all appearance comforting himself with some of the squires homebrewed he was a kind of hangeron i was told of the establishment and though ostensibly a resident of the village was oftener to be found in the squires kitchen than his own home the old gentleman being fond of the sound of harp in hall  the dance like most dances after supper was a merry one some of the older folks joined in it and the squire himself figured down several couples with a partner with whom he affirmed he had danced at every christmas for nearly half a century master simon who seemed to be a kind of connecting link between the old times and the new and to be withal a little antiquated in the taste of his accomplishments evidently piqued himself on his dancing and was endeavouring to gain credit by the heel and toe rigadoon and other graces of the ancient school but he had unluckily assorted himself with a little romping girl from boardingschool who by her wild vivacity kept him continually on the stretch and defeated all his sober attempts at elegancesuch are the illassorted matches to which antique gentlemen are unfortunately prone  the young oxonian on the contrary had led out one of his maiden aunts on whom the rogue played a thousand little knaveries with impunity he was full of practical jokes and his delight was to tease his aunts and cousins yet like all madcap youngsters he was a universal favourite among the women the most interesting couple in the dance was the young officer and a ward of the squires a beautiful blushing girl of seventeen from several shy glances which i had noticed in the course of the evening i suspected there was a little kindness growing up between them and indeed the young soldier was just the hero to captivate a romantic girl he was tall slender and handsome and like most young british officers of late years had picked up various small accomplishments on the continenthe could talk french and italiandraw landscapessing very tolerablydance divinely but above all he had been wounded at waterloowhat girl of seventeen well read in poetry and romance could resist such a mirror of chivalry and perfection  the moment the dance was over he caught up a guitar and lolling against the old marble fireplace in an attitude which i am half inclined to suspect was studied began the little french air of the troubadour the squire however exclaimed against having anything on christmas eve but good old english upon which the young minstrel casting up his eye for a moment as if in an effort of memory struck into another strain and with a charming air of gallantry gave herricks nightpiece to julia           her eyes the glowworm lend thee           the shooting stars attend thee             and the elves also             whose little eyes glow           like the sparks of fire befriend thee           no willothewisp mislight thee           nor snake or glowworm bite thee             but on on thy way             not making a stay           since ghost there is none to affright thee           then let not the dark thee cumber           what though the moon does slumber             the stars of the night             will lend thee their light           like tapers clear without number           then julia let me woo thee           thus thus to come unto me             and when i shall meet             thy silvery feet           my soul ill pour into thee  the song might have been intended in compliment to the fair julia for so i found his partner was called or it might not she however was certainly unconscious of any such application for she never looked at the singer but kept her eyes cast upon the floor her face was suffused it is true with a beautiful blush and there was a gentle heaving of the bosom but all that was doubtless caused by the exercise of the dance indeed so great was her indifference that she was amusing herself with plucking to pieces a choice bouquet of hothouse flowers and by the time the song was concluded the nosegay lay in ruins on the floor  the party now broke up for the night with the kindhearted old custom of shaking hands as i passed through the hall on the way to my chamber the dying embers of the yuleclog still sent forth a dusky glow and had it not been the season when no spirit dares stir abroad i should have been half tempted to steal from my room at midnight and peep whether the fairies might not be at their revels about the hearth  my chamber was in the old part of the mansion the ponderous furniture of which might have been fabricated in the days of the giants the room was panelled with cornices of heavy carved work in which flowers and grotesque faces were strangely intermingled and a row of black looking portraits stared mournfully at me from the walls the bed was of rich though faded damask with a lofty tester and stood in a niche opposite a bow window i had scarcely got into bed when a strain of music seemed to break forth in the air just below the window i listened and found it proceeded from a band which i concluded to be the waits from some neighbouring village they went round the house playing under the windows  i drew aside the curtains to hear them more distinctly the moonbeams fell through the upper part of the casement partially lighting up the antiquated apartment the sounds as they receded became more soft and aerial and seemed to accord with quiet and moonlight i listened and listenedthey became more and more tender and remote and as they gradually died away my head sank upon the pillow and i fell asleep     christmas day       dark and dull night flie hence away      and give the honour to this day      that sees december turnd to may                                        why does the chilling winters morne      smile like a field beset with corn      or smell like to a meade newshorne      thus on the suddencome and see      the cause why things thus fragrant be       herrick  when i awoke the next morning it seemed as if all the events of the preceding evening had been a dream and nothing but the identity of the ancient chamber convinced me of their reality while i lay musing on my pillow i heard the sound of little feet pattering outside of the door and a whispering consultation presently a choir of small voices chanted forth an old christmas carol the burden of which was       rejoice our saviour he was born      on christmas day in the morning  i rose softly slipped on my clothes opened the door suddenly and beheld one of the most beautiful little fairy groups that a painter could imagine  it consisted of a boy and two girls the eldest not more than six and lovely as seraphs they were going the rounds of the house and singing at every chamberdoor but my sudden appearance frightened them into mute bashfulness they remained for a moment playing on their lips with their fingers and now and then stealing a shy glance from under their eyebrows until as if by one impulse they scampered away and as they turned an angle of the gallery i heard them laughing in triumph at their escape  everything conspired to produce kind and happy feelings in this stronghold of oldfashioned hospitality the window of my chamber looked out upon what in summer would have been a beautiful landscape there was a sloping lawn a fine stream winding at the foot of it and a tract of park beyond with noble clumps of trees and herds of deer at a distance was a neat hamlet with the smoke from the cottage chimneys hanging over it and a church with its dark spire in strong relief against the clear cold sky the house was surrounded with evergreens according to the english custom which would have given almost an appearance of summer but the morning was extremely frosty the light vapour of the preceding evening had been precipitated by the cold and covered all the trees and every blade of grass with its fine crystallisations the rays of a bright morning sun had a dazzling effect among the glittering foliage a robin perched upon the top of a mountainash that hung its clusters of red berries just before my window was basking himself in the sunshine and piping a few querulous notes and a peacock was displaying all the glories of his train and strutting with the pride and gravity of a spanish grandee on the terracewalk below  i had scarcely dressed myself when a servant appeared to invite me to family prayers he showed me the way to a small chapel in the old wing of the house where i found the principal part of the family already assembled in a kind of gallery furnished with cushions hassocks and large prayerbooks the servants were seated on benches below the old gentleman read prayers from a desk in front of the gallery and master simon acted as clerk and made the responses and i must do him the justice to say that he acquitted himself with great gravity and decorum  the service was followed by a christmas carol which mr bracebridge himself had constructed from a poem of his favourite author herrick and it had been adapted to an old church melody by master simon as there were several good voices among the household the effect was extremely pleasing but i was particularly gratified by the exaltation of heart and sudden sally of grateful feeling with which the worthy squire delivered one stanza his eyes glistening and his voice rambling out of all the bounds of time and tune          tis thou that crownst my glittering hearth             with guiltlesse mirth           and givst me wassaile bowles to drink             spiced to the brink           lord tis thy plentydropping hand             that soiles my land           and givst me for my bushell sowne             twice ten for one  i afterwards understood that early morning service was read on every sunday and saints day throughout the year either by mr bracebridge or by some member of the family it was once almost universally the case at the seats of the nobility and gentry of england and it is much to be regretted that the custom is fallen into neglect for the dullest observer must be sensible of the order and serenity prevalent in those households where the occasional exercise of a beautiful form of worship in the morning gives as it were the keynote to every temper for the day and attunes every spirit to harmony  our breakfast consisted of what the squire denominated true old english fare he indulged in some bitter lamentations over modern breakfasts of teaandtoast which he censured as among the causes of modern effeminacy and weak nerves and the decline of old english heartiness and though he admitted them to his table to suit the palates of his guests yet there was a brave display of cold meats wine and ale on the sideboard  after breakfast i walked about the grounds with frank bracebridge and master simon or mr simon as he was called by everybody but the squire we were escorted by a number of gentlemanlike dogs that seemed loungers about the establishment from the frisking spaniel to the steady old staghound the last of which was of a race that had been in the family time out of mind they were all obedient to a dogwhistle which hung to master simons buttonhole and in the midst of their gambols would glance an eye occasionally upon a small switch he carried in his hand  the old mansion had a still more venerable look in the yellow sunshine than by pale moonlight and i could not but feel the force of the squires idea that the formal terraces heavily moulded balustrades and clipped yewtrees carried with them an air of proud aristocracy there appeared to be an unusual number of peacocks about the place and i was making some remarks upon what i termed a flock of them that were basking under a sunny wall when i was gently corrected in my phraseology by master simon who told me that according to the most ancient and approved treatise on hunting i must say a muster of peacocks in the same way added he with a slight air of pedantry we say a flight of doves or swallows a bevy of quails a herd of deer of wrens or cranes a skulk of foxes or a building of rooks he went on to inform me that according to sir anthony fitzherbert we ought to ascribe to this bird both understanding and glory for being praised he will presently set up his tail chiefly against the sun to the intent you may the better behold the beauty thereof but at the fall of the leaf when his tail falleth he will mourn and hide himself in corners till his tail come again as it was  i could not help smiling at this display of small erudition on so whimsical a subject but i found that the peacocks were birds of some consequence at the hall for frank bracebridge informed me that they were great favourites with his father who was extremely careful to keep up the breed partly because they belonged to chivalry and were in great request at the stately banquets of the olden time and partly because they had a pomp and magnificence about them highly becoming an old family mansion nothing he was accustomed to say had an air of greater state and dignity than a peacock perched upon an antique stone balustrade  master simon had now to hurry off having an appointment at the parish church with the village choristers who were to perform some music of his selection there was something extremely agreeable in the cheerful flow of animal spirits of the little man and i confess i had been somewhat surprised at his apt quotations from authors who certainly were not in the range of everyday reading i mentioned this last circumstance to frank bracebridge who told me with a smile that master simons whole stock of erudition was confined to some halfadozen old authors which the squire had put into his hands and which he read over and over whenever he had a studious fit as he sometimes had on a rainy day or a long winter evening sir anthony fitzherberts book of husbandry markhams country contentments the tretyse of hunting by sir thomas cockayne knight izaak waltons angler and two or three more such ancient worthies of the pen were his standard authorities and like all men who know but a few books he looked up to them with a kind of idolatry and quoted them on all occasions as to his songs they were chiefly picked out of old books in the squires library and adapted to tunes that were popular among the choice spirits of the last century his practical application of scraps of literature however had caused him to be looked upon as a prodigy of bookknowledge by all the grooms huntsmen and small sportsmen of the neighbourhood  while we were talking we heard the distant toll of the village bell and i was told that the squire was a little particular in having his household at church on a christmas morning considering it a day of pouring out of thanks and rejoicing for as old tusser observed       at christmas be merry and thankful withal      and feast thy poor neighbours the great and the small  if you are disposed to go to church said frank bracebridge i can promise you a specimen of my cousin simons musical achievements as the church is destitute of an organ he has formed a band from the village amateurs and established a musical club for their improvement he has also sorted a choir as he sorted my fathers pack of hounds according to the directions of jervaise markham in his country contentments for the bass he has sought out all the deep solemn mouths and for the tenor the loud ringing mouths among the country bumpkins and for sweet mouths he has culled with curious taste among the prettiest lasses in the neighbourhood though these last he affirms are the most difficult to keep in tune your pretty female singer being exceedingly wayward and capricious and very liable to accident  as the morning though frosty was remarkably fine and clear the most of the family walked to the church which was a very old building of gray stone and stood near a village about half a mile from the park gate adjoining it was a low snug parsonage which seemed coeval with the church the front of it was perfectly matted with a yewtree that had been trained against its walls through the dense foliage of which apertures had been formed to admit light into the small antique lattices as we passed this sheltered nest the parson issued forth and preceded us  i had expected to see a sleek wellconditioned pastor such as is often found in a snug living in the vicinity of a rich patrons table but i was disappointed the parson was a little meagre blacklooking man with a grizzled wig that was too wide and stood off from each ear so that his head seemed to have shrunk away within it like a dried filbert in its shell he wore a rusty coat with great skirts and pockets that would have held the church bible and prayerbook and his small legs seemed still smaller from being planted in large shoes decorated with enormous buckles  i was informed by frank bracebridge that the parson had been a chum of his fathers at oxford and had received this living shortly after the latter had come to his estate he was a complete blackletter hunter and would scarcely read a work printed in the roman character the editions of caxton and wynkin de worde were his delight and he was indefatigable in his researches after such old english writers as have fallen into oblivion from their worthlessness in deference perhaps to the notions of mr bracebridge he had made diligent investigations into the festive rites and holiday customs of former times and had been as zealous in the inquiry as if he had been a boon companion but it was merely with that plodding spirit with which men of adust temperament follow up any track of study merely because it is denominated learning indifferent to its intrinsic nature whether it be the illustration of the wisdom or of the ribaldry and obscenity of antiquity he had pored over these old volumes so intensely that they seemed to have been reflected into his countenance indeed which if the face be an index of the mind might be compared to a titlepage of blackletter  on reaching the church porch we found the parson rebuking the grayheaded sexton for having used mistletoe among the greens with which the church was decorated it was he observed an unholy plant profaned by having been used by the druids in their mystic ceremonies and though it might be innocently employed in the festive ornamenting of halls and kitchens yet it had been deemed by the fathers of the church as unhallowed and totally unfit for sacred purposes so tenacious was he on this point that the poor sexton was obliged to strip down a great part of the humble trophies of his taste before the parson would consent to enter upon the service of the day  the interior of the church was venerable but simple on the walls were several mural monuments of the bracebridges and just beside the altar was a tomb of ancient workmanship on which lay the effigy of a warrior in armour with his legs crossed a sign of his having been a crusader i was told it was one of the family who had signalised himself in the holy land and the same whose picture hung over the fireplace in the hall  during service master simon stood up in the pew and repeated the responses very audibly evincing that kind of ceremonious devotion punctually observed by a gentleman of the old school and a man of old family connections i observed too that he turned over the leaves of a folio prayerbook with something of a flourish possibly to show off an enormous sealring which enriched one of his fingers and which had the look of a family relic but he was evidently most solicitous about the musical part of the service keeping his eye fixed intently on the choir and beating time with much gesticulation and emphasis  the orchestra was in a small gallery and presented a most whimsical grouping of heads piled one above the other among which i particularly noticed that of the village tailor a pale fellow with a retreating forehead and chin who played on the clarionet and seemed to have blown his face to a point and there was another a short pursy man stooping and labouring at a bass viol so as to show nothing but the top of a round bald head like the egg of an ostrich there were two or three pretty faces among the female singers to which the keen air of a frosty morning had given a bright rosy tint but the gentlemen choristers had evidently been chosen like old cremona fiddles more for tone than looks and as several had to sing from the same book there were clusterings of odd physiognomies not unlike those groups of cherubs we sometimes see on country tombstones  the usual services of the choir were managed tolerably well the vocal parts generally lagging a little behind the instrumental and some loitering fiddler now and then making up for lost time by travelling over a passage with prodigious celerity and clearing more bars than the keenest foxhunter to be in at the death but the great trial was an anthem that had been prepared and arranged by master simon and on which he had founded great expectation unluckily there was a blunder at the very outset the musicians became flurried master simon was in a fever everything went on lamely and irregularly until they came to a chorus beginning now let us sing with one accord which seemed to be a signal for parting company all became discord and confusion each shifted for himself and got to the end as well or rather as soon as he could excepting one old chorister in a pair of horn spectacles bestriding and pinching a long sonorous nose who happening to stand a little apart and being wrapped up in his own melody kept on a quavering course wriggling his head ogling his book and winding all up by a nasal solo of at least three bars duration  the parson gave us a most erudite sermon on the rites and ceremonies of christmas and the propriety of observing it not merely as a day of thanksgiving but of rejoicing supporting the correctness of his opinions by the earliest usages of the church and enforcing them by the authorities of theophilus of cesarea st cyprian st chrysostom st augustine and a cloud more of saints and fathers from whom he made copious quotations i was a little at a loss to perceive the necessity of such a mighty array of forces to maintain a point which no one present seemed inclined to dispute but i soon found that the good man had a legion of ideal adversaries to contend with having in the course of his researches on the subject of christmas got completely embroiled in the sectarian controversies of the revolution when the puritans made such a fierce assault upon the ceremonies of the church and poor old christmas was driven out of the land by proclamation of parliament the worthy parson lived but with times past and knew but a little of the present       3 see note c  shut up among wormeaten tomes in the retirement of his antiquated little study the pages of old times were to him as the gazettes of the day while the era of the revolution was mere modern history he forgot that nearly two centuries had elapsed since the fiery persecution of poor mincepie throughout the land when plumporridge was denounced as mere popery and roast beef as antichristian and that christmas had been brought in again triumphantly with the merry court of king charles at the restoration he kindled into warmth with the ardour of his contest and the host of imaginary foes with whom he had to combat had a stubborn conflict with old prynne and two or three other forgotten champions of the roundheads on the subject of christmas festivity and concluded by urging his hearers in the most solemn and affecting manner to stand to the traditionary customs of their fathers and feast and make merry on this joyful anniversary of the church  i have seldom known a sermon attended apparently with more immediate effects for on leaving the church the congregation seemed one and all possessed with the gaiety of spirit so earnestly enjoined by their pastor the elder folks gathered in knots in the churchyard greeting and shaking hands and the children ran about crying ule ule and repeating some uncouth rhymes which the parson who had joined us informed me had been handed down from days of yore the villagers doffed their hats to the squire as he passed giving him the good wishes of the season with every appearance of heartfelt sincerity and were invited by him to the hall to take something to keep out the cold of the weather and i heard blessings uttered by several of the poor which convinced me that in the midst of his enjoyments the worthy old cavalier had not forgotten the true christmas virtue of charity        ule ule      three puddings in a pule      crack nuts and cry ule  on our way homeward his heart seemed overflowing with generous and happy feelings as we passed over a rising ground which commanded something of a prospect the sounds of rustic merriment now and then reached our ears the squire paused for a few moments and looked around with an air of inexpressible benignity the beauty of the day was of itself sufficient to inspire philanthropy notwithstanding the frostiness of the morning the sun in his cloudless journey had acquired sufficient power to melt away the thin covering of snow from every southern declivity and to bring out the living green which adorns an english landscape even in midwinter large tracts of smiling verdure contrasted with the dazzling whiteness of the shaded slopes and hollows every sheltered bank on which the broad rays rested yielded its silver rill of cold and limpid water glittering through the dripping grass and sent up slight exhalations to contribute to the thin haze that hung just above the surface of the earth there was something truly cheering in this triumph of warmth and verdure over the frosty thraldom of winter it was as the squire observed an emblem of christmas hospitality breaking through the chills of ceremony and selfishness and thawing every heart into a flow he pointed with pleasure to the indications of good cheer reeking from the chimneys of the comfortable farmhouses and low thatched cottages i love said he to see this day well kept by rich and poor it is a great thing to have one day in the year at least when you are sure of being welcome wherever you go and of having as it were the world all thrown open to you and i am almost disposed to join with poor robin in his malediction of every churlish enemy to this honest festival       those who at christmas do repine      and would fain hence despatch him      may they with old duke humphry dine      or else may squire ketch catch em  the squire went on to lament the deplorable decay of the games and amusements which were once prevalent at this season among the lower orders and countenanced by the higher when the old halls of castles and manorhouses were thrown open at daylight when the tables were covered with brawn and beef and humming ale when the harp and the carol resounded all day long and when rich and poor were alike welcome to enter and make merry our old games and local customs said he had a great effect in making the peasant fond of his home and the promotion of them by the gentry made him fond of his lord they made the times merrier and kinder and better and i can truly say with one of our old poets       i like them wellthe curious preciseness      and allpretended gravity of those      that seek to banish hence these harmless sports      have thrust away much ancient honesty        4 see note d  the nation continued he is altered we have almost lost our simple truehearted peasantry they have broken asunder from the higher classes and seem to think their interests are separate they have become too knowing and begin to read newspapers listen to alehouse politicians and talk of reform i think one mode to keep them in good humour in these hard times would be for the nobility and gentry to pass more time on their estates mingle more among the country people and set the merry old english games going again  such was the good squires project for mitigating public discontent and indeed he had once attempted to put his doctrine in practice and a few years before had kept open house during the holidays in the old style the country people however did not understand how to play their parts in the scene of hospitality many uncouth circumstances occurred the manor was overrun by all the vagrants of the country and more beggars drawn into the neighbourhood in one week than the parish officers could get rid of in a year since then he had contented himself with inviting the decent part of the neighbouring peasantry to call at the hall on christmas day and distributing beef and bread and ale among the poor that they might make merry in their own dwellings  we had not been long home when the sound of music was heard from a distance a band of country lads without coats their shirtsleeves fancifully tied with ribands their hats decorated with greens and clubs in their hands were seen advancing up the avenue followed by a large number of villagers and peasantry they stopped before the hall door where the music struck up a peculiar air and the lads performed a curious and intricate dance advancing retreating and striking their clubs together keeping exact time to the music while one whimsically crowned with a foxs skin the tail of which flaunted down his back kept capering around the skirts of the dance and rattling a christmasbox with many antic gesticulations  the squire eyed this fanciful exhibition with great interest and delight and gave me a full account of its origin which he traced to the times when the romans held possession of the island plainly proving that this was a lineal descendant of the sworddance of the ancients it was now he said nearly extinct but he had accidentally met with traces of it in the neighbourhood and had encouraged its revival though to tell the truth it was too apt to be followed up by rough cudgelplay and broken heads in the evening  after the dance was concluded the whole party was entertained with brawn and beef and stout homebrewed the squire himself mingled among the rustics and was received with awkward demonstrations of deference and regard  it is true i perceived two or three of the younger peasants as they were raising their tankards to their mouths when the squires back was turned making something of a grimace and giving each other the wink but the moment they caught my eye they pulled grave faces and were exceedingly demure with master simon however they all seemed more at their ease  his varied occupations and amusements had made him well known throughout the neighbourhood he was a visitor at every farmhouse and cottage gossiped with the farmers and their wives romped with their daughters and like that type of a vagrant bachelor the bumblebee tolled the sweets from all the rosy lips of the country around  the bashfulness of the guests soon gave way before good cheer and affability there is something genuine and affectionate in the gaiety of the lower orders when it is excited by the bounty and familiarity of those above them the warm glow of gratitude enters into their mirth and a kind word or a small pleasantry frankly uttered by a patron gladdens the heart of the dependant more than oil and wine when the squire had retired the merriment increased and there was much joking and laughter particularly between master simon and a hale ruddyfaced whiteheaded farmer who appeared to be the wit of the village for i observed all his companions to wait with open mouths for his retorts and burst into a gratuitous laugh before they could well understand them  the whole house indeed seemed abandoned to merriment as i passed to my room to dress for dinner i heard the sound of music in a small court and looking through a window that commanded it i perceived a band of wandering musicians with pandean pipes and tambourine a pretty coquettish housemaid was dancing a jig with a smart country lad while several of the other servants were looking on in the midst of her sport the girl caught a glimpse of my face at the window and colouring up ran off with an air of roguish affected confusion     the christmas dinner       lo now is come the joyfulst feast        let every man be jolly      eache roome with yvie leaves is drest        and every post with holly      now all our neighbours chimneys smoke        and christmas blocks are burning      their ovens they with bakt meats choke        and all their spits are turning          without the door let sorrow lie            and if for cold it hap to die          well buryt in a christmas pye            and evermore be merry                       witherss juvenilia  i had finished my toilet and was loitering with frank bracebridge in the library when we heard a distant thwacking sound which he informed me was a signal for the serving up of the dinner the squire kept up old customs in kitchen as well as hall and the rollingpin struck upon the dresser by the cook summoned the servants to carry in the meats       just in this nick the cook knockd thrice      and all the waiters in a trice        his summons did obey      each serving man with dish in hand      marchd boldly up like our trainband        presented and away         sir john suckling  the dinner was served up in the great hall where the squire always held his christmas banquet a blazing crackling fire of logs had been heaped on to warm the spacious apartment and the flame went sparkling and wreathing up the widemouthed chimney the great picture of the crusader and his white horse had been profusely decorated with greens for the occasion and holly and ivy had likewise been wreathed around the helmet and weapons on the opposite wall which i understood were the arms of the same warrior i must own by the by i had strong doubts about the authenticity of painting and armour as having belonged to the crusader they certainly having the stamp of more recent days but i was told that the painting had been so considered time out of mind and that as to the armour it had been found in a lumber room and elevated to its present situation by the squire who at once determined it to be the armour of the family hero and as he was absolute authority on all such subjects to his own household the matter had passed into current acceptation a sideboard was set out just under this chivalric trophy on which was a display of plate that might have vied at least in variety with belshazzars parade of the vessels of the temple flagons cans cups beakers goblets basins and ewers the gorgeous utensils of good companionship that had gradually accumulated through many generations of jovial housekeepers before these stood the two yule candles beaming like two stars of the first magnitude other lights were distributed in branches and the whole array glittered like a firmament of silver  we were ushered into this banqueting scene with the sound of minstrelsy the old harper being seated on a stool beside the fireplace and twanging his instrument with a vast deal more power than melody never did christmas board display a more goodly and gracious assemblage of countenances those who were not handsome were at least happy and happiness is a rare improver of your hardfavoured visage  i always consider an old english family as well worth studying as a collection of holbeins portraits or albert durers prints there is much antiquarian lore to be acquired much knowledge of the physiognomies of former times perhaps it may be from having continually before their eyes those rows of old family portraits with which the mansions of this country are stocked certain it is that the quaint features of antiquity are often most faithfully perpetuated in these ancient lines and i have traced an old family nose through a whole picturegallery legitimately handed down from generation to generation almost from the time of the conquest something of the kind was to be observed in the worthy company around me many of their faces had evidently originated in a gothic age and been merely copied by succeeding generations and there was one little girl in particular of staid demeanour with a high roman nose and an antique vinegar aspect who was a great favourite of the squires being as he said a bracebridge all over and the very counterpart of one of his ancestors who figured in the court of henry viii  the parson said grace which was not a short familiar one such as is commonly addressed to the deity in these unceremonious days but a long courtly wellworded one of the ancient school  there was now a pause as if something was expected when suddenly the butler entered the hall with some degree of bustle he was attended by a servant on each side with a large waxlight and bore a silver dish on which was an enormous pigs head decorated with rosemary with a lemon in its mouth which was placed with great formality at the head of the table the moment this pageant made its appearance the harper struck up a flourish at the conclusion of which the young oxonian on receiving a hint from the squire gave with an air of the most comic gravity an old carol the first verse of which was as follows             caput apri defero             reddens laudes domino         the boars head in hand bring i         with garlands gay and rosemary             i pray you all synge merily             qui estis in convivio  though prepared to witness many of these little eccentricities from being apprised of the peculiar hobby of mine host yet i confess the parade with which so odd a dish was introduced somewhat perplexed me until i gathered from the conversation of the squire and the parson that it was meant to represent the bringing in of the boars head a dish formerly served up with much ceremony and the sound of minstrelsy and song at great tables on christmas day i like the old custom said the squire not merely because it is stately and pleasing in itself but because it was observed at the college of oxford at which i was educated when i hear the old song chanted it brings to mind the time when i was young and gamesomeand the noble old collegehalland my fellow students loitering about in their black gowns many of whom poor lads are now in their graves  the parson however whose mind was not haunted by such associations and who was always more taken up with the text than the sentiment objected to the oxonians version of the carol which he affirmed was different from that sung at college he went on with the dry perseverance of a commentator to give the college reading accompanied by sundry annotations addressing himself at first to the company at large but finding their attention gradually diverted to other talk and other objects he lowered his tone as his number of auditors diminished until he concluded his remarks in an under voice to a fatheaded old gentleman next him who was silently engaged in the discussion of a huge plateful of turkey       5 see note e  the table was literally loaded with good cheer and presented an epitome of country abundance in this season of overflowing larders a distinguished post was allotted to ancient sirloin as mine host termed it being as he added the standard of old english hospitality and a joint of goodly presence and full of expectation  there were several dishes quaintly decorated and which had evidently something traditionary in their embellishments but about which as i did not like to appear over curious i asked no questions i could not however but notice a pie magnificently decorated with peacocks feathers in imitation of the tail of that bird which overshadowed a considerable tract of the table this the squire confessed with some little hesitation was a pheasantpie though a peacockpie was certainly the most authentical but there had been such a mortality among the peacocks this season that he could not prevail upon himself to have one killed       6 see note f  it would be tedious perhaps to my wiser readers who may not have that foolish fondness for odd and obsolete things to which i am a little given were i to mention the other makeshifts of this worthy old humourist by which he was endeavouring to follow up though at humble distance the quaint customs of antiquity i was pleased however to see the respect shown to his whims by his children and relatives who indeed entered readily into the full spirit of them and seemed all well versed in their parts having doubtless been present at many a rehearsal i was amused too at the air of profound gravity with which the butler and other servants executed the duties assigned them however eccentric they had an oldfashioned look having for the most part been brought up in the household and grown into keeping with the antiquated mansion and the humours of its lord and most probably looked upon all his whimsical regulations as the established laws of honourable housekeeping when the cloth was removed the butler brought in a huge silver vessel of rare and curious workmanship which he placed before the squire its appearance was hailed with acclamation being the wassail bowl so renowned in christmas festivity the contents had been prepared by the squire himself for it was a beverage in the skilful mixture of which he particularly prided himself alleging that it was too abstruse and complex for the comprehension of an ordinary servant it was a potation indeed that might well make the heart of a toper leap within him being composed of the richest and raciest wines highly spiced and sweetened with roasted apples bobbing about the surface       7 see note g  the old gentlemans whole countenance beamed with a serene look of indwelling delight as he stirred this mighty bowl having raised it to his lips with a hearty wish of a merry christmas to all present he sent it brimming around the board for every one to follow his example according to the primitive style pronouncing it the ancient fountain of good feeling where all hearts met together       8 see note h  there was much laughing and rallying as the honest emblem of christmas joviality circulated and was kissed rather coyly by the ladies when it reached master simon he raised it in both hands and with the air of a boon companion struck up an old wassail chanson       the browne bowle      the merry browne bowle      as it goes round abouta           fill           still      let the world say what it will      and drink your fill all outa       the deep canne      the merry deep canne      as thou dost freely quaffa           sing           fling      be as merry as a king      and sound a lusty laugha         from poor robins almanack  much of the conversation during dinner turned upon family topics to which i was a stranger there was however a great deal of rallying of master simon about some gay widow with whom he was accused of having a flirtation this attack was commenced by the ladies but it was continued throughout the dinner by the fatheaded old gentleman next the parson with the persevering assiduity of a slowhound being one of those longwinded jokers who though rather dull at starting game are unrivalled for their talents in hunting it down at every pause in the general conversation he renewed his bantering in pretty much the same terms winking hard at me with both eyes whenever he gave master simon what he considered a home thrust the latter indeed seemed fond of being teased on the subject as old bachelors are apt to be and he took occasion to inform me in an undertone that the lady in question was a prodigiously fine woman and drove her own curricle  the dinnertime passed away in this flow of innocent hilarity and though the old hall may have resounded in its time with many a scene of broader rout and revel yet i doubt whether it ever witnessed more honest and genuine enjoyment how easy it is for one benevolent being to diffuse pleasure around him and how truly is a kind heart a fountain of gladness making everything in its vicinity to freshen into smiles the joyous disposition of the worthy squire was perfectly contagious he was happy himself and disposed to make all the world happy and the little eccentricities of his humour did but season in a manner the sweetness of his philanthropy  when the ladies had retired the conversation as usual became still more animated many good things were broached which had been thought of during dinner but which would not exactly do for a ladys ear and though i cannot positively affirm that there was much wit uttered yet i have certainly heard many contests of rare wit produce much less laughter wit after all is a mighty tart pungent ingredient and much too acid for some stomachs but honest good humour is the oil and wine of a merry meeting and there is no jovial companionship equal to that where the jokes are rather small and the laughter abundant the squire told several long stories of early college pranks and adventures in some of which the parson had been a sharer though in looking at the latter it required some effort of imagination to figure such a little dark anatomy of a man into the perpetrator of a madcap gambol indeed the two college chums presented pictures of what men may be made by their different lots in life the squire had left the university to live lustily on his paternal domains in the vigorous enjoyment of prosperity and sunshine and had flourished on to a hearty and florid old age whilst the poor parson on the contrary had dried and withered away among dusty tomes in the silence and shadows of his study  still there seemed to be a spark of almost extinguished fire feebly glimmering in the bottom of his soul and as the squire hinted at a sly story of the parson and a pretty milkmaid whom they once met on the banks of the isis the old gentleman made an alphabet of faces which as far as i could decipher his physiognomy i verily believe was indicative of laughterindeed i have rarely met with an old gentleman who took absolutely offence at the imputed gallantries of his youth  i found the tide of wine and wassail fast gaining on the dry land of sober judgment the company grew merrier and louder as their jokes grew duller master simon was in as chirping a humour as a grasshopper filled with dew his old songs grew of a warmer complexion and he began to talk maudlin about the widow he even gave a long song about the wooing of a widow which he informed me he had gathered from an excellent blackletter work entitled cupids solicitor for love containing store of good advice for bachelors and which he promised to lend me the first verse was to this effect       he that will woo a widow must not dally      he must make hay while the sun doth shine      he must not stand with her shall i shall i      but boldly say widow thou must be mine  this song inspired the fatheaded old gentleman who made several attempts to tell a rather broad story out of joe miller that was pat to the purpose but he always stuck in the middle everybody recollecting the latter part excepting himself the parson too began to show the effects of good cheer having gradually settled down into a doze and his wig sitting most suspiciously on one side just at this juncture we were summoned to the drawingroom and i suspect at the private instigation of mine host whose joviality seemed always tempered with a proper love of decorum  after the dinnertable was removed the hall was given up to the younger members of the family who prompted to all kind of noisy mirth by the oxonian and master simon made its old walls ring with their merriment as they played at romping games i delight in witnessing the gambols of children and particularly at this happy holidayseason and could not help stealing out of the drawingroom on hearing one of their peals of laughter i found them at the game of blindmans buff master simon who was the leader of their revels and seemed on all occasions to fulfil the office of that ancient potentate the lord of misrule was blinded in the midst of the hall the little beings were as busy about him as the mock fairies about falstaff pinching him plucking at the skirts of his coat and tickling him with straws one fine blueeyed girl of about thirteen with her flaxen hair all in beautiful confusion her frolic face in a glow her frock half torn off her shoulders a complete picture of a romp was the chief tormentor and from the slyness with which master simon avoided the smaller game and hemmed this wild little nymph in corners and obliged her to jump shrieking over chairs i suspected the rogue of being not a whit more blinded than was convenient       9 see note i  when i returned to the drawingroom i found the company seated around the fire listening to the parson who was deeply ensconced in a highbacked oaken chair the work of some cunning artificer of yore which had been brought from the library for his particular accommodation from this venerable piece of furniture with which his shadowy figure and dark weazen face so admirably accorded he was dealing forth strange accounts of popular superstitions and legends of the surrounding country with which he had become acquainted in the course of his antiquarian researches i am half inclined to think that the old gentleman was himself somewhat tinctured with superstition as men are very apt to be who live a recluse and studious life in a sequestered part of the country and pore over blackletter tracts so often filled with the marvellous and supernatural he gave us several anecdotes of the fancies of the neighbouring peasantry concerning the effigy of the crusader which lay on the tomb by the church altar as it was the only monument of the kind in that part of the country it had always been regarded with feelings of superstition by the goodwives of the village it was said to get up from the tomb and walk the rounds of the churchyard in stormy nights particularly when it thundered and one old woman whose cottage bordered on the churchyard had seen it through the windows of the church when the moon shone slowly pacing up and down the aisles it was the belief that some wrong had been left unredressed by the deceased or some treasure hidden which kept the spirit in a state of trouble and restlessness some talked of gold and jewels buried in the tomb over which the spectre kept watch and there was a story current of a sexton in old times who endeavoured to break his way to the coffin at night but just as he reached it received a violent blow from the marble hand of the effigy which stretched him senseless on the pavement these tales were often laughed at by some of the sturdier among the rustics yet when night came on there were many of the stoutest unbelievers that were shy of venturing alone in the footpath that led across the churchyard from these and other anecdotes that followed the crusader appeared to be the favourite hero of ghost stories throughout the vicinity his picture which hung up in the hall was thought by the servants to have something supernatural about it for they remarked that in whatever part of the hall you went the eyes of the warrior were still fixed on you the old porters wife too at the lodge who had been born and brought up in the family and was a great gossip among the maid servants affirmed that in her young days she had often heard say that on midsummer eve when it is well known all kinds of ghosts goblins and fairies become visible and walk abroad the crusader used to mount his horse come down from his picture ride about the house down the avenue and so to the church to visit the tomb on which occasion the church door most civilly swung open of itself not that he needed it for he rode through closed gates and even stone walls and had been seen by one of the dairymaids to pass between two bars of the great park gate making himself as thin as a sheet of paper  all these superstitions i found had been very much countenanced by the squire who though not superstitious himself was very fond of seeing others so he listened to every goblin tale of the neighbouring gossips with infinite gravity and held the porters wife in high favour on account of her talent for the marvellous he was himself a great reader of old legends and romances and often lamented that he could not believe in them for a superstitious person he thought must live in a kind of fairyland  whilst we were all attention to the parsons stories our ears were suddenly assailed by a burst of heterogeneous sounds from the hall in which was mingled something like the clang of rude minstrelsy with the uproar of many small voices and girlish laughter the door suddenly flew open and a train came trooping into the room that might almost have been mistaken for the breaking up of the court of fairy that indefatigable spirit master simon in the faithful discharge of his duties as lord of misrule had conceived the idea of a christmas mummery or masking and having called in to his assistance the oxonian and the young officer who were equally ripe for anything that should occasion romping and merriment they had carried it into instant effect the old housekeeper had been consulted the antique clothespresses and wardrobes rummaged and made to yield up the relics of finery that had not seen the light for several generations the younger part of the company had been privately convened from the parlour and hall and the whole had been bedizened out into a burlesque imitation of an antique masque       10 see note j  master simon led the van as ancient christmas quaintly apparelled in a ruff a short cloak which had very much the aspect of one of the old housekeepers petticoats and a hat that might have served for a village steeple and must indubitably have figured in the days of the covenanters from under this his nose curved boldly forth flushed with a frostbitten bloom that seemed the very trophy of a december blast he was accompanied by the blueeyed romp dished up as dame mincepie in the venerable magnificence of faded brocade long stomacher peaked hat and highheeled shoes the young officer appeared as robin hood in a sporting dress of kendal green and a foraging cap with a gold tassel the costume to be sure did not bear testimony to deep research and there was an evident eye to the picturesque natural to a young gallant in the presence of his mistress the fair julia hung on his arm in a pretty rustic dress as maid marian the rest of the train had been metamorphosed in various ways the girls trussed up in the finery of the ancient belles of the bracebridge line and the striplings bewhiskered with burnt cork and gravely clad in broad skirts hanging sleeves and fullbottomed wigs to represent the characters of roast beef plum pudding and other worthies celebrated in ancient maskings the whole was under the control of the oxonian in the appropriate character of misrule and i observed that he exercised rather a mischievous sway with his wand over the smaller personages of the pageant  the irruption of this motley crew with beat of drum according to ancient custom was the consummation of uproar and merriment master simon covered himself with glory by the stateliness with which as ancient christmas he walked a minuet with the peerless though giggling dame mincepie it was followed by a dance of all the characters which from its medley of costumes seemed as though the old family portraits had skipped down from their frames to join in the sport different centuries were figuring at cross hands and right and left the dark ages were cutting pirouettes and rigadoons and the days of queen bess jigging merrily down the middle through a line of succeeding generations  the worthy squire contemplated these fantastic sports and this resurrection of his old wardrobe with the simple relish of childish delight he stood chuckling and rubbing his hands and scarcely hearing a word the parson said notwithstanding that the latter was discoursing most authentically on the ancient and stately dance at the paon or peacock from which he conceived the minuet to be derived for my part i was in a continual excitement from the varied scenes of whim and innocent gaiety passing before me it was inspiring to see wildeyed frolic and warmhearted hospitality breaking out from among the chills and glooms of winter and old age throwing off his apathy and catching once more the freshness of youthful enjoyment i felt also an interest in the scene from the consideration that these fleeting customs were posting fast into oblivion and that this was perhaps the only family in england in which the whole of them were still punctiliously observed there was a quaintness too mingled with all this revelry that gave it a peculiar zest it was suited to the time and place and as the old manor house almost reeled with mirth and wassail it seemed echoing back the joviality of longdeparted years       11 see note k  but enough of christmas and its gambols it is time for me to pause in this garrulity methinks i hear the questions asked by my graver readers to what purpose is all thishow is the world to be made wiser by this talk alas is
