extract from a letter written by mr coleridge in february 1818 to a gentleman who attended the course of lectures given in the spring of that year  see the canterbury magazine september 1834 ed   my next fridays lecture will if i do not grossly flatterblind myself be interesting and the points of view not only original but new to the audience i make this distinction because sixteen or rather seventeen years ago i delivered eighteen lectures on shakspeare at the royal institution threefourths of which appeared at that time startling paradoxes although they have since been adopted even by men who then made use of them as proofs of my flighty and paradoxical turn of mind all tending to prove that shakspeares judgment was if possible still more wonderful than his genius or rather that the contradistinction itself between judgment and genius rested on an utterly false theory this and its proofs and grounds have beeni should not have said adopted but produced as their own legitimate children by some and by others the merit of them attributed to a foreign writer whose lectures were not given orally till two years after mine rather than to their countryman though i dare appeal to the most adequate judges as sir george beaumont the bishop of durham mr sotheby and afterwards to mr rogers and lord byron whether there is one single principle in schlegels work which is not an admitted drawback from its merits that was not established and applied in detail by me plutarch tells us that egotism is a venial fault in the unfortunate and justifiable in the calumniated c        extract from a letter to j britton esq   28th feb 1819 highgate  dear sir  first permit me to remove a very natural indeed almost inevitable mistake relative to my lectures namely that i have them or that the lectures of one place or season are in any way repeated in another so far from it that on any point that i had ever studied and on no other should i dare discoursei mean that i would not lecture on any subject for which i had to acquire the main knowledge even though a months or three months previous time were allowed me on no subject that had not employed my thoughts for a large portion of my life since earliest manhood free of all outward and particular purposeon any point within my habit of thought i should greatly prefer a subject i had never lectured on to one which i had repeatedly given and those who have attended me for any two seasons successively will bear witness that the lecture given at the london philosophical society on the romeo and juliet for instance was as different from that given at the crown and anchor as if they had been by two individuals who without any communication with each other had only mastered the same principles of philosophic criticism this was most strikingly evidenced in the coincidence between my lectures and those of schlegel such and so close that it was fortunate for my moral reputation that i had not only from five to seven hundred ear witnesses that the passages had been given by me at the royal institution two years before schlegel commenced his lectures at vienna but that notes had been taken of these by several men and ladies of high rank the fact is this during a course of lectures i faithfully employ all the intervening days in collecting and digesting the materials whether i have or have not lectured on the same subject before making no difference the day of the lecture till the hour of commencement i devote to the consideration what of the mass before me is best fitted to answer the purposes of a lecture that is to keep the audience awake and interested during the delivery and to leave a sting behind that is a disposition to study the subject anew under the light of a new principle several times however partly from apprehension respecting my health and animal spirits partly from the wish to possess copies that might afterwards be marketable among the publishers i have previously written the lecture but before i had proceeded twenty minutes i have been obliged to push the ms away and give the subject a new turn nay this was so notorious that many of my auditors used to threaten me when they saw any number of written papers on my desk to steal them away declaring they never felt so secure of a good lecture as when they perceived that i had not a single scrap of writing before me i take far far more pains than would go to the set composition of a lecture both by varied reading and by meditation but for the words illustrations c i know almost as little as any one of the audience that is those of anything like the same education with myself what they will be five minutes before the lecture begins such is my way for such is my nature and in attempting any other i should only torment myself in order to disappoint my auditorstorment myself during the delivery i mean for in all other respects it would be a much shorter and easier task to deliver them from writing i am anxious to preclude any semblance of affectation and have therefore troubled you with this lengthy preface before i have the hardihood to assure you that you might as well ask me what my dreams were in the year 1814 as what my course of lectures was at the surrey institution  fuimus troes       shakspeare  with introductory matter on poetry the drama and the stage   definition of poetry  poetry is not the proper antithesis to prose but to science poetry is opposed to science and prose to metre the proper and immediate object of science is the acquirement or communication of truth the proper and immediate object of poetry is the communication of immediate pleasure this definition is useful but as it would include novels and other works of fiction which yet we do not call poems there must be some additional character by which poetry is not only divided from opposites but likewise distinguished from disparate though similar modes of composition now how is this to be effected in animated prose the beauties of nature and the passions and accidents of human nature are often expressed in that natural language which the contemplation of them would suggest to a pure and benevolent mind yet still neither we nor the writers call such a work a poem though no work could deserve that name which did not include all this together with something else what is this it is that pleasurable emotion that peculiar state and degree of excitement which arises in the poet himself in the act of compositionand in order to understand this we must combine a more than ordinary sympathy with the objects emotions or incidents contemplated by the poet consequent on a more than common sensibility with a more than ordinary activity of the mind in respect of the fancy and the imagination hence is produced a more vivid reflection of the truths of nature and of the human heart united with a constant activity modifying and correcting these truths by that sort of pleasurable emotion which the exertion of all our faculties gives in a certain degree but which can only be felt in perfection under the full play of those powers of mind which are spontaneous rather than voluntary and in which the effort required bears no proportion to the activity enjoyed this is the state which permits the production of a highly pleasurable whole of which each part shall also communicate for itself a distinct and conscious pleasure and hence arises the definition which i trust is now intelligible that poetry or rather a poem is a species of composition opposed to science as having intellectual pleasure for its object and as attaining its end by the use of language natural to us in a state of excitementbut distinguished from other species of composition not excluded by the former criterion by permitting a pleasure from the whole consistent with a consciousness of pleasure from the component partsand the perfection of which is to communicate from each part the greatest immediate pleasure compatible with the largest sum of pleasure on the whole this of course will vary with the different modes of poetryand that splendour of particular lines which would be worthy of admiration in an impassioned elegy or a short indignant satire would be a blemish and proof of vile taste in a tragedy or an epic poem  it is remarkable by the way that milton in three incidental words has implied all which for the purposes of more distinct apprehension which at first must be slowpaced in order to be distinct i have endeavoured to develope in a precise and strictly adequate definition speaking of poetry he says as in a parenthesis which is simple sensuous passionate how awful is the power of wordsfearful often in their consequences when merely felt not understood but most awful when both felt and understoodhad these three words only been properly understood by and present in the minds of general readers not only almost a library of false poetry would have been either precluded or stillborn but what is of more consequence works truly excellent and capable of enlarging the understanding warming and purifying the heart and placing in the centre of the whole being the germs of noble and manlike actions would have been the common diet of the intellect instead for the first condition simplicitywhile on the one hand it distinguishes poetry from the arduous processes of science labouring towards an end not yet arrived at and supposes a smooth and finished road on which the reader is to walk onward easily with streams murmuring by his side and trees and flowers and human dwellings to make his journey as delightful as the object of it is desirable instead of having to toil with the pioneers and painfully make the road on which others are to travelprecludes on the other hand every affectation and morbid peculiaritythe second condition sensuousness insures that framework of objectivity that definiteness and articulation of imagery and that modification of the images themselves without which poetry becomes flattened into mere didactics of practice or evaporated into a hazy unthoughtful daydreaming and the third condition passion provides that neither thought nor imagery shall be simply objective but that the passio vera of humanity shall warm and animate both  to return however to the previous definition this most general and distinctive character of a poem originates in the poetic genius itself and though it comprises whatever can with any propriety be called a poem unless that word be a mere lazy synonyme for a composition in metre it yet becomes a just and not merely discriminative but full and adequate definition of poetry in its highest and most peculiar sense only so far as the distinction still results from the poetic genius which sustains and modifies the emotions thoughts and vivid representations of the poem by the energy without effort of the poets own mindby the spontaneous activity of his imagination and fancy and by whatever else with these reveals itself in the balancing and reconciling of opposite or discordant qualities sameness with difference a sense of novelty and freshness with old or customary objects a more than usual state of emotion with more than usual order selfpossession and judgment with enthusiasm and vehement feelingand which while it blends and harmonizes the natural and the artificial still subordinates art to nature the manner to the matter and our admiration of the poet to our sympathy with the images passions characters and incidents of the poem     doubtless this could not be but that she turns   bodies to spirit by sublimation strange   as fire converts to fire the things it burns   as we our food into our nature change    from their gross matter she abstracts their forms   and draws a kind of quintessence from things   which to her proper nature she transforms   to bear them light on her celestial wings    thus doth she when from individual states   she doth abstract the universal kinds   which then reclothed in diverse names and fates   steal access thro our senses to our minds 1   footnote 1 sir john davies on the immortality of the soul sect iv the words and lines in italics between are substituted to apply these verses to the poetic genius the greater part of this latter paragraph may be found adopted with some alterations in the biographia literaria vol ii c 14 but i have thought it better in this instance and some others to run the chance of bringing a few passages twice over to the recollection of the reader than to weaken the force of the original argument by breaking the connection ed      greek drama  it is truly singular that platowhose philosophy and religion were but exotic at home and a mere opposition to the finite in all things genuine prophet and anticipator as he was of the protestant christian aerashould have given in his dialogue of the banquet a justification of our shakspeare for he relates that when all the other guests had either dispersed or fallen asleep socrates only together with aristophanes and agathon remained awake and that while he continued to drink with them out of a large goblet he compelled them though most reluctantly to admit that it was the business of one and the same genius to excel in tragic and comic poetry or that the tragic poet ought at the same time to contain within himself the powers of comedy 1 now as this was directly repugnant to the entire theory of the ancient critics and contrary to all their experience it is evident that plato must have fixed the eye of his contemplation on the innermost essentials of the drama abstracted from the forms of age or country in another passage he even adds the reason namely that opposites illustrate each others nature and in their struggle draw forth the strength of the combatants and display the conqueror as sovereign even on the territories of the rival power  nothing can more forcibly exemplify the separative spirit of the greek arts than their comedy as opposed to their tragedy but as the immediate struggle of contraries supposes an arena common to both so both were alike ideal that is the comedy of aristophanes rose to as great a distance above the ludicrous of real life as the tragedy of sophocles above its tragic events and passionsand it is in this one point of absolute ideality that the comedy of shakspeare and the old comedy of athens coincide in this also alone did the greek tragedy and comedy unite in every thing else they were exactly opposed to each other tragedy is poetry in its deepest earnest comedy is poetry in unlimited jest earnestness consists in the direction and convergence of all the powers of the soul to one aim and in the voluntary restraint of its activity in consequence the opposite therefore lies in the apparent abandonment of all definite aim or end and in the removal of all bounds in the exercise of the mindattaining its real end as an entire contrast most perfectly the greater the display is of intellectual wealth squandered in the wantonness of sport without an object and the more abundant the life and vivacity in the creations of the arbitrary will  the later comedy even where it was really comic was doubtless likewise more comic the more free it appeared from any fixed aim misunderstandings of intention fruitless struggles of absurd passion contradictions of temper and laughable situations there were but still the form of the representation itself was serious it proceeded as much according to settled laws and used as much the same means of art though to a different purpose as the regular tragedy itself but in the old comedy the very form itself is whimsical the whole work is one great jest comprehending a world of jests within it among which each maintains its own place without seeming to concern itself as to the relation in which it may stand to its fellows in short in sophocles the constitution of tragedy is monarchical but such as it existed in elder greece limited by laws and therefore the more venerableall the parts adapting and submitting themselves to the majesty of the heroic sceptrein aristophanes comedy on the contrary is poetry in its most democratic form and it is a fundamental principle with it rather to risk all the confusion of anarchy than to destroy the independence and privileges of its individual constituentsplace verse characters even single thoughts conceits and allusions each turning on the pivot of its own free will  the tragic poet idealizes his characters by giving to the spiritual part of our nature a more decided preponderance over the animal cravings and impulses than is met with in real life the comic poet idealizes his characters by making the animal the governing power and the intellectual the mere instrument but as tragedy is not a collection of virtues and perfections but takes care only that the vices and imperfections shall spring from the passions errors and prejudices which arise out of the soulso neither is comedy a mere crowd of vices and follies but whatever qualities it represents even though they are in a certain sense amiable it still displays them as having their origin in some dependence on our lower nature accompanied with a defect in true freedom of spirit and selfsubsistence and subject to that unconnection by contradictions of the inward being to which all folly is owing  the ideal of earnest poetry consists in the union and harmonious melting down and fusion of the sensual into the spiritualof man as an animal into man as a power of reason and selfgovernment and this we have represented to us most clearly in the plastic art or statuary where the perfection of outward form is a symbol of the perfection of an inward idea where the body is wholly penetrated by the soul and spiritualized even to a state of glory and like a transparent substance the matter in its own nature darkness becomes altogether a vehicle and fixure of light a mean of developing its beauties and unfolding its wealth of various colors without disturbing its unity or causing a division of the parts the sportive ideal on the contrary consists in the perfect harmony and concord of the higher nature with the animal as with its ruling principle and its acknowledged regent the understanding and practical reason are represented as the willing slaves of the senses and appetites and of the passions arising out of them hence we may admit the appropriateness to the old comedy as a work of defined art of allusions and descriptions which morality can never justify and only with reference to the author himself and only as being the effect or rather the cause of the circumstances in which he wrote can consent even to palliate  the old comedy rose to its perfection in aristophanes and in him also it died with the freedom of greece then arose a species of drama more fitly called dramatic entertainment than comedy but of which nevertheless our modern comedy shakspeares altogether excepted is the genuine descendant euripides had already brought tragedy lower down and by many steps nearer to the real world than his predecessors had ever done and the passionate admiration which menander and philemon expressed for him and their open avowals that he was their great master entitle us to consider their dramas as of a middle species between tragedy and comedynot the tragicomedy or thing of heterogeneous parts but a complete whole founded on principles of its own throughout we find the drama of menander distinguishing itself from tragedy but not as the genuine old comedy contrasting with and opposing it tragedy indeed carried the thoughts into the mythologic world in order to raise the emotions the fears and the hopes which convince the inmost heart that their final cause is not to be discovered in the limits of mere mortal life and force us into a presentiment however dim of a state in which those struggles of inward free will with outward necessity which form the true subject of the tragedian shall be reconciled and solvedthe entertainment or new comedy on the other hand remained within the circle of experience instead of the tragic destiny it introduced the power of chance even in the few fragments of menander and philemon now remaining to us we find many exclamations and reflections concerning chance and fortune as in the tragic poets concerning destiny in tragedy the moral law either as obeyed or violated above all consequencesits own maintenance or violation constituting the most important of all consequencesforms the ground the new comedy and our modern comedy in general shakspeare excepted as before lies in prudence or imprudence enlightened or misled selflove the whole moral system of the entertainment exactly like that of fable consists in rules of prudence with an exquisite conciseness and at the same time an exhaustive fulness of sense an old critic said that tragedy was the flight or elevation of life comedy that of menander its arrangement or ordonnance  add to these features a portraitlike truth of characternot so far indeed as that a bona fide individual should be described or imagined but yet so that the features which give interest and permanence to the class should be individualized the old tragedy moved in an ideal worldthe old comedy in a fantastic world as the entertainment or new comedy restrained the creative activity both of the fancy and the imagination it indemnified the understanding in appealing to the judgment for the probability of the scenes represented the ancients themselves acknowledged the new comedy as an exact copy of real life the grammarian aristophanes somewhat affectedly exclaimedo life and menander which of you two imitated the other in short the form of this species of drama was poetry the stuff or matter was prose it was prose rendered delightful by the blandishments and measured motions of the muse yet even this was not universal the mimes of sophron so passionately admired by plato were written in prose and were scenes out of real life conducted in dialogue the exquisite feast of adonis greek transliterated surakousiai ae adoniazousai in theocritus we are told with some others of his eclogues were close imitations of certain mimes of sophronfree translations of the prose into hexameters  it will not be improper in this place to make a few remarks on the remarkable character and functions of the chorus in the greek tragic drama  the chorus entered from below close by the orchestra and there pacing to and fro during the choral odes performed their solemn measured dance in the centre of the orchestra directly over against the middle of the scene there stood an elevation with steps in the shape of a large altar as high as the boards of the logeion or moveable stage this elevation was named the thymele greek transliterated thumelae and served to recall the origin and original purpose of the chorus as an altarsong in honour of the presiding deity here and on these steps the persons of the chorus sate collectively when they were not singing attending to the dialogue as spectators and acting as what in truth they were the ideal representatives of the real audience and of the poet himself in his own character assuming the supposed impressions made by the drama in order to direct and rule them but when the chorus itself formed part of the dialogue then the leader of the band the foreman or coryphaeus ascended as some think the level summit of the thymele in order to command the stage or perhaps the whole chorus advanced to the front of the orchestra and thus put themselves in ideal connection as it were with the dramatis personæ there acting this thymele was in the centre of the whole edifice all the measurements were calculated and the semicircle of the amphitheatre was drawn from this point it had a double use a twofold purpose it constantly reminded the spectators of the origin of tragedy as a religious service and declared itself as the ideal representative of the audience by having its place exactly in the point to which all the radii from the different seats or benches converged in this double character as constituent parts and yet at the same time as spectators of the drama the chorus could not but tend to enforce the unity of placenot on the score of any supposed improbability which the understanding or common sense might detect in a change of placebut because the senses themselves put it out of the power of any imagination to conceive a place coming to and going away from the persons instead of the persons changing their place yet there are instances in which during the silence of the chorus the poets have hazarded this by a change in that part of the scenery which represented the more distant objects to the eye of the spectatora demonstrative proof that this alternately extolled and ridiculed unity as ignorantly ridiculed as extolled was grounded on no essential principle of reason but arose out of circumstances which the poet could not remove and therefore took up into the form of the drama and coorganized it with all the other parts into a living whole  the greek tragedy may rather be compared to our serious opera than to the tragedies of shakspeare nevertheless the difference is far greater than the likeness in the opera all is subordinated to the music the dresses and the scenerythe poetry is a mere vehicle for articulation and as little pleasure is lost by ignorance of the italian language so is little gained by the knowledge of it but in the greek drama all was but as instruments and accessaries to the poetry and hence we should form a better notion of the choral music from the solemn hymns and psalms of austere church music than from any species of theatrical singing a single flute or pipe was the ordinary accompaniment and it is not to be supposed that any display of musical power was allowed to obscure the distinct hearing of the words on the contrary the evident purpose was to render the words more audible and to secure by the elevations and pauses greater facility of understanding the poetry for the choral songs are and ever must have been the most difficult part of the tragedy there occur in them the most involved verbal compounds the newest expressions the boldest images the most recondite allusions is it credible that the poets would one and all have been thus prodigal of the stores of art and genius if they had known that in the representation the whole must have been lost to the audienceat a time too when the means of after publication were so difficult and expensive and the copies of their works so slowly and narrowly circulated  the masks also must be consideredtheir vast variety and admirable workmanship of this we retain proof by the marble masks which represented them but to this in the real mask we must add the thinness of the substance and the exquisite fitting on to the head of the actor so that not only were the very eyes painted with a single opening left for the pupil of the actors eye but in some instances even the iris itself was painted when the colour was a known characteristic of the divine or heroic personage represented  finally i will note down those fundamental characteristics which contradistinguish the ancient literature from the modern generally but which more especially appear in prominence in the tragic drama the ancient was allied to statuary the modern refers to painting in the first there is a predominance of rhythm and melody in the second of harmony and counterpoint the greeks idolized the finite and therefore were the masters of all grace elegance proportion fancy dignity majestyof whatever in short is capable of being definitely conveyed by defined forms or thoughts the moderns revere the infinite and affect the indefinite as a vehicle of the infinitehence their passions their obscure hopes and fears their wandering through the unknown their grander moral feelings their more august conception of man as man their future rather than their pastin a word their sublimity   footnote 1 greek transliterated

scheme to ridicule a third and either take advantage of or invent some story for that purpose and mimicry will have already produced a sort of rude comedy it becomes an inviting treat to the populace and gains an additional zest and burlesque by following the already established plan of tragedy and the first man of genius who seizes the idea and reduces it into forminto a work of artby metre and music is the aristophanes of the country  how just this account is will appear from the fact that in the first or old comedy of the athenians most of the dramatis personæ were living characters introduced under their own names and no doubt their ordinary dress manner person and voice were closely mimicked in less favourable states of society as that of england in the middle ages the beginnings of comedy would be constantly taking place from the mimics and satirical minstrels but from want of fixed abode popular government and the successive attendance of the same auditors it would still remain in embryo i shall perhaps have occasion to observe that this remark is not without importance in explaining the essential differences of the modern and ancient theatres  phænomena similar to those which accompanied the origin of tragedy and comedy among the greeks would take place among the romans much more slowly and the drama would in any case have much longer remained in its first irregular form from the character of the people their continual engagements in wars of conquest the nature of their government and their rapidly increasing empire but however this might have been the conquest of greece precluded both the process and the necessity of it and the roman stage at once presented imitations or translations of the greek drama this continued till the perfect establishment of christianity some attempts indeed were made to adapt the persons of scriptural or ecclesiastical history to the drama and sacred plays it is probable were not unknown in constantinople under the emperors of the east the first of the kind is i believe the only one preservednamely the greek transliterated christos paschon or christ in his sufferings by gregory nazianzenpossibly written in consequence of the prohibition of profane literature to the christians by the apostate julian 1 in the west however the enslaved and debauched roman world became too barbarous for any theatrical exhibitions more refined than those of pageants and chariotraces while the spirit of christianity which in its most corrupt form still breathed general humanity whenever controversies of faith were not concerned had done away the cruel combats of the gladiators and the loss of the distant provinces prevented the possibility of exhibiting the engagements of wild beasts  i pass therefore at once to the feudal ages which soon succeeded confining my observation to this country though indeed the same remark with very few alterations will apply to all the other states into which the great empire was broken ages of darkness succeedednot indeed the darkness of russia or of the barbarous lands unconquered by rome for from the time of honorius to the destruction of constantinople and the consequent introduction of ancient literature into europe there was a continued succession of individual intellectsthe golden chain was never wholly broken though the connecting links were often of baser metal a dark cloud like another sky covered the entire cope of heavenbut in this place it thinned away and white stains of light showed a half eclipsed star behind itin that place it was rent asunder and a star passed across the opening in all its brightness and then vanished such stars exhibited themselves only surrounding objects did not partake of their light there were deep wells of knowledge but no fertilizing rills and rivulets for the drama society was altogether a state of chaos out of which it was for a while at least to proceed anew as if there had been none before it  and yet it is not undelightful to contemplate the eduction of good from evil the ignorance of the great mass of our countrymen was the efficient cause of the reproduction of the drama and the preceding darkness and the returning light were alike necessary in order to the creation of a shakspeare  the drama recommenced in england as it first began in greece in religion the people were not able to readthe priesthood were unwilling that they should read and yet their own interest compelled them not to leave the people wholly ignorant of the great events of sacred history they did that therefore by scenic representations which in after ages it has been attempted to do in roman catholic countries by pictures they presented mysteries and often at great expense and reliques of this system still remain in the south of europe and indeed throughout italy where at christmas the convents and the great nobles rival each other in the scenic representation of the birth of christ and its circumstances i heard two instances mentioned to me at different times one in sicily and the other in rome of noble devotees the ruin of whose fortunes was said to have commenced in the extravagant expense which had been incurred in presenting the præsepe or manger but these mysteries in order to answer their design must not only be instructive but entertaining and as when they became so the people began to take pleasure in acting them themselvesin interlopingagainst which the priests seem to have fought hard and yet in vain the most ludicrous images were mixed with the most awful personations and whatever the subject might be however sublime however pathetic yet the vice and the devil who are the genuine antecessors of harlequin and the clown were necessary component parts i have myself a piece of this kind which i transcribed a few years ago at helmstadt in germany on the education of eves children in which after the fall and repentance of adam the offended maker as in proof of his reconciliation condescends to visit them and to catechise the childrenwho with a noble contempt of chronology are all brought together from abel to noah the good children say the ten commandments the belief and the lords prayer but cain and his rout after he had received a box on the ear for not taking off his hat and afterwards offering his left hand is prompted by the devil so to blunder in the lords prayer as to reverse the petitions and say it backward 2  unaffectedly i declare i feel pain at repetitions like these however innocent as historical documents they are valuable but i am sensible that what i can read with my eye with perfect innocence i cannot without inward fear and misgivings pronounce with my tongue  let me however be acquitted of presumption if i say that i cannot agree with mr malone that our ancestors did not perceive the ludicrous in these things or that they paid no separate attention to the serious and comic parts indeed his own statement contradicts it for what purpose should the vice leap upon the devils back and belabour him but to produce this separate attention the people laughed heartily no doubt nor can i conceive any meaning attached to the words separate attention that is not fully answered by one part of an exhibition exciting seriousness or pity and the other raising mirth and loud laughter that they felt no impiety in the affair is most true for it is the very essence of that system of christian polytheism which in all its essentials is now fully as gross in spain in sicily and the south of italy as it ever was in england in the days of henry vinay more so for a wicliffe had then not appeared only but scattered the good seed widely it is an essential part i say of that system to draw the mind wholly from its own inward whispers and quiet discriminations and to habituate the conscience to pronounce sentence in every case according to the established verdicts of the church and the casuists i have looked through volume after volume of the most approved casuistsand still i find disquisitions whether this or that act is right and under what circumstances to a minuteness that makes reasoning ridiculous and of a callous and unnatural immodesty to which none but a monk could harden himself who has been stripped of all the tender charities of life yet is goaded on to make war against them by the unsubdued hauntings of our meaner nature even as dogs are said to get the hydrophobia from excessive thirst i fully believe that our ancestors laughed as heartily as their posterity do at grimaldiand not having been told that they would be punished for laughing they thought it very innocentand if their priests had left out murder in the catalogue of their prohibitions as indeed they did under certain circumstances of heresy the greater part of themthe moral instincts common to all men having been smothered and kept from developmentwould have thought as little of murder however this may be the necessity of at once instructing and gratifying the people produced the great distinction between the greek and the english theatresfor to this we must attribute the origin of tragicomedy or a representation of human events more lively nearer the truth and permitting a larger field of moral instruction a more ample exhibition of the recesses of the human heart under all the trials and circumstances that most concern us than was known or guessed at by Æschylus sophocles or euripidesand at the same time we learn to account for andrelatively to the authorperceive the necessity of the fool or clown or both as the substitutes of the vice and the devil which our ancestors had been so accustomed to see in every exhibition of the stage that they could not feel any performance perfect without them even to this day in italy every operaeven metastasio obeyed the claim throughoutmust have six characters generally two pairs of cross lovers a tyrant and a confidant or a father and two confidants themselves loversand when a new opera appears it is the universal fashion to askwhich is the tyrant which the lover c  it is the especial honour of christianity that in its worst and most corrupted form it cannot wholly separate itself from moralitywhereas the other religions in their best form i do not include mohammedanism which is only an anomalous corruption of christianity like swedenborgianism have no connection with it the very impersonation of moral evil under the name of vice facilitated all other impersonations and hence we see that the mysteries were succeeded by moralities or dialogues and plots of allegorical personages again some character in real history had become so famous so proverbial as nero for instance that they were introduced instead of the moral quality for which they were so notedand in this manner the stage was moving on to the absolute production of heroic and comic real characters when the restoration of literature followed by the everblessed reformation let in upon the kingdom not only new knowledge but new motive a useful rivalry commenced between the metropolis on the one hand the residence independently of the court and nobles of the most active and stirring spirits who had not been regularly educated or who from mischance or otherwise had forsaken the beaten track of prefermentand the universities on the other the latter prided themselves on their closer approximation to the ancient rules and ancient regularitytaking the theatre of greece or rather its dim reflection the rhetorical tragedies of the poet seneca as a perfect ideal without any critical collation of the times origin or circumstanceswhilst in the mean time the popular writers who could not and would not abandon what they had found to delight their countrymen sincerely and not merely from inquiries first put to the recollection of rules and answered in the affirmative as if it had been an arithmetical sum did yet borrow from the scholars whatever they advantageously could consistently with their own peculiar means of pleasing  and here let me pause for a moments contemplation of this interesting subject  we call for we see and feel the swan and the dove both transcendantly beautiful as absurd as it would be to institute a comparison between their separate claims to beauty from any abstract rule common to both without reference to the life and being of the animals themselvesor as if having first seen the dove we abstracted its outlines gave them a false generalization called them the principles or ideal of birdbeauty and then proceeded to criticise the swan or the eaglenot less absurd is it to pass judgment on the works of a poet on the mere ground that they have been called by the same classname with the works of other poets in other times and circumstances or on any ground indeed save that of their inappropriateness to their own end and being their want of significance as symbols or physiognomy  o few have there been among critics who have followed with the eye of the imagination the imperishable yet ever wandering spirit of poetry through its various metempsychoses and consequent metamorphosesor who have rejoiced in the light of clear perception at beholding with each new birth with each rare avatar the human race frame to itself a new body by assimilating materials of nourishment out of its new circumstances and work for itself new organs of power appropriate to the new sphere of its motion and activity  i have before spoken of the romance or the language formed out of the decayed roman and the northern tongues and comparing it with the latin we find it less perfect in simplicity and relationthe privileges of a language formed by the mere attraction of homogeneous partsbut yet more rich more expressive and various as one formed by more obscure affinities out of a chaos of apparently heterogeneous atoms as more than a metaphoras an analogy of this i have named the true genuine modern poetry the romantic and the works of shakspeare are romantic poetry revealing itself in the drama if the tragedies of sophocles are in the strict sense of the word tragedies and the comedies of aristophanes comedies we must emancipate ourselves from a false association arising from misapplied names and find a new word for the plays of shakspeare for they are in the ancient sense neither tragedies nor comedies nor both in onebut a different genus diverse in kind and not merely different in degree they may be called romantic dramas or dramatic romances  a deviation from the simple forms and unities of the ancient stage is an essential principle and of course an appropriate excellence of the romantic drama for these unities were to a great extent the natural form of that which in its elements was homogeneous and the representation of which was addressed preeminently to the outward sensesand though the fable the language and the characters appealed to the reason rather than to the mere understanding inasmuch as they supposed an ideal state rather than referred to an existing realityyet it was a reason which was obliged to accommodate itself to the senses and so far became a sort of more elevated understanding on the other hand the romantic poetrythe shakspearian dramaappealed to the imagination rather than to the senses and to the reason as contemplating our inward nature and the workings of the passions in their most retired recesses but the reason as reason is independent of time and space it has nothing to do with them and hence the certainties of reason have been called eternal truths as for examplethe endless properties of the circlewhat connection have they with this or that age with this or that countrythe reason is aloof from time and spacethe imagination is an arbitrary controller over bothand if only the poet have such power of exciting our internal emotions as to make us present to the scene in imagination chiefly he acquires the right and privilege of using time and space as they exist in imagination and obedient only to the laws by which the imagination itself acts these laws it will be my object and aim to point out as the examples occur which illustrate them but here let me remark what can never be too often reflected on by all who would intelligently study the works either of the athenian dramatists or of shakspeare that the very essence of the former consists in the sternest separation of the diverse in kind and the disparate in the degree whilst the latter delights in interlacing by a rainbowlike transfusion of hues the one with the other  and here it will be necessary to say a few words on the stage and on stageillusion  a theatre in the widest sense of the word is the general term for all places of amusement through the ear or eye in which men assemble in order to be amused by some entertainment presented to all at the same time and in common thus an old puritan divine saysthose who attend public worship and sermons only to amuse themselves make a theatre of the church and turn gods house into the devils theatra ædes diabololatricæ the most important and dignified species of this genus is doubtless the stage res theatralis histrionica which in addition to the generic definition above given may be characterized in its idea or according to what it does or ought to aim at as a combination of several or of all the fine arts in an harmonious whole having a distinct end of its own to which the peculiar end of each of the component arts taken separately is made subordinate and subservientthat namely of imitating realitywhether external things actions or passionsunder a semblance of reality thus claude imitates a landscape at sunset but only as a picture while a forestscene is not presented to the spectators as a picture but as a forest and though in the full sense of the word we are no more deceived by the one than by the other yet are our feelings very differently affected and the pleasure derived from the one is not composed of the same elements as that afforded by the other even on the supposition that the quantum of both were equal in the former a picture it is a condition of all genuine delight that we should not be deceived in the latter stagescenery inasmuch as its principal end is not in or for itself as is the case in a picture but to be an assistance and means to an end out of itself its very purpose is to produce as much illusion as its nature permits these and all other stage presentations are to produce a sort of temporary halffaith which the spectator encourages in himself and supports by a voluntary contribution on his own part because he knows that it is at all times in his power to see the thing as it really is i have often observed that little children are actually deceived by stagescenery never by pictures though even these produce an effect on their impressible minds which they do not on the minds of adults the child if strongly impressed does not indeed positively think the picture to be the reality but yet he does not think the contrary as sir george beaumont was shewing me a very fine engraving from rubens representing a storm at sea without any vessel or boat introduced my litte boy then about five years old came dancing and singing into the room and all at once if i may so say tumbled in upon the print he instantly started stood silent and motionless with the strongest expression first of wonder and then of grief in his eyes and countenance and at length said and where is the ship but that is sunk and the men are all drowned still keeping his eyes fixed on the print now what pictures are to little children stageillusion is to men provided they retain any part of the childs sensibility except that in the latter instance the suspension of the act of comparison which permits this sort of negative belief is somewhat more assisted by the will than in that of a child respecting a picture  the true stageillusion in this and in all other things consistsnot in the minds judging it to be a forest but in its remission of the judgment that it is not a forest and this subject of stageillusion is so important and so many practical errors and false criticisms may arise and indeed have arisen either from reasoning on it as actual delusion the strange notion on which the french critics built up their theory and on which the french poets justify the construction of their tragedies or from denying it altogether which seems the end of dr johnsons reasoning and which as extremes meet would lead to the very same consequences by excluding whatever would not be judged probable by us in our coolest state of feeling with all our faculties in even balance that these few remarks will i hope be pardoned if they should serve either to explain or to illustrate the point for not only are we never absolutely deludedor any thing like it but the attempt to cause the highest delusion possible to beings in their senses sitting in a theatre is a gross fault incident only to low minds which feeling that they cannot affect the heart or head permanently endeavour to call forth the momentary affections there ought never to be more pain than is compatible with coexisting pleasure and to be amply repaid by thought  shakspeare found the infant stage demanding an intermixture of ludicrous character as imperiously as that of greece did the chorus and high language accordant and there are many advantages in thisa greater assimilation to nature a greater scope of power more truths and more feelingsthe effects of contrast as in lear and the fool and especially this that the true language of passion becomes sufficiently elevated by your having previously heard in the same piece the lighter conversation of men under no strong emotion the very nakedness of the stage too was advantageousfor the drama thence became something between recitation and a representation and the absence or paucity of scenes allowed a freedom from the laws of unity of place and unity of time the observance of which must either confine the drama to as few subjects as may be counted on the fingers or involve gross improbabilities far more striking than the violation would have caused thence also was precluded the danger of a false idealof aiming at more than what is possible on the whole what play of the ancients with reference to their ideal does not hold out more glaring absurdities than any in shakspeare on the greek plan a man could more easily be a poet than a dramatist upon our plan more easily a dramatist than a poet   footnote 1 a d 363 but i believe the prevailing opinion amongst scholars now is that the greek christos paschon is not genuine ed  footnote 2 see vol i p 76 where this is told more at length and attributed to hans sachs ed      the drama generally and public taste  unaccustomed to address such an audience and having lost by a long interval of confinement the advantages of my former short schooling i had miscalculated in my last lecture the proportion of my matter to my time and by bad economy and unskilful management the several heads of my discourse failed in making the entire performance correspond with the promise publicly circulated in the weekly annunciation of the subjects to be treated it would indeed have been wiser in me and perhaps better on the whole if i had caused my lectures to be announced only as continuations of the main subject but if i be as perforce i must be gratified by the recollection of whatever has appeared to give you pleasure i am conscious of something better though less flattering a sense of unfeigned gratitude for your forbearance with my defects like affectionate guardians you see without disgust the awkwardness and witness with sympathy the growing pains of a youthful endeavour and look forward with a hope which is its own reward to the contingent results of practiceto its intellectual maturity  in my last address i defined poetry to be the art or whatever better term our language may afford of representing external nature and human thoughts both relatively to human affections so as to cause the production of as great immediate pleasure in each part as is compatible with the largest possible sum of pleasure on the whole now this definition applies equally to painting and music as to poetry and in truth the term poetry is alike applicable to all three the vehicle alone constitutes the difference and the term poetry is rightly applied by eminence to measured words only because the sphere of their action is far wider the power of giving permanence to them much more certain and incomparably greater the facility by which men not defective by nature or disease may be enabled to derive habitual pleasure and instruction from them on my mentioning these considerations to a painter of great genius who had been from a most honourable enthusiasm extolling his own art he was so struck with their truth that he exclaimed i want no other argumentspoetry that is verbal poetry must be the greatest all that proves final causes in the world proves this it would be shocking to think otherwiseand in truth deeply o far more than words can express as i venerate the last judgment and the prophets of michel angelo buonarotiyet the very pain which i repeatedly felt as i lost myself in gazing upon them the painful consideration that their having been painted in fresco was the sole cause that they had not been abandoned to all the accidents of a dangerous transportation to a distant capital and that the same caprice which made the neapolitan soldiery destroy all the exquisite masterpieces on the walls of the church of the trinitado monte after the retreat of their antagonist barbarians might as easily have made vanish the rooms and open gallery of raffael and the yet more unapproachable wonders of the sublime florentine in the sixtine chapel forced upon my mind the reflection how grateful the human race ought to be that the works of euclid newton plato milton shakspeare are not subjected to similar contingenciesthat they and their fellows and the great though inferior peerage of undying intellect are securedsecured even from a second irruption of goths and vandals in addition to many other safeguards by the vast empire of english language laws and religion founded in america through the overflow of the power and the virtue of my countryand that now the great and certain works of genuine fame can only cease to act for mankind when men themselves cease to be men or when the planet on which they exist shall have altered its relations or have ceased to be lord bacon in the language of the gods if i may use an homeric phrase has expressed a similar thought   lastly leaving the vulgar arguments that by learning man excelleth man in that wherein man excelleth beasts that by learning man ascendeth to the heavens and their motions where in body he cannot come and the like let us conclude with the dignity and excellency of knowledge and learning in that whereunto mans nature doth most aspire which is immortality or continuance for to this tendeth generation and raising of houses and families to this tend buildings foundations and monuments to this tendeth the desire of memory fame and celebration and in effect the strength of all other human desires we see then how far the monuments of wit and learning are more durable than the monuments of power or of the hands for have not the verses of homer continued twentyfive hundred years or more without the loss of a syllable or letter during which time infinite palaces temples castles cities have been decayed and demolished it is not possible to have the true pictures or statues of cyrus alexander caesar no nor of the kings or great personages of much later years for the originals cannot last and the copies cannot but lose of the life and truth but the images of mens wits and knowledges remain in books exempted from the wrong of time and capable of perpetual renovation neither are they fitly to be called images because they generate still and cast their seeds in the minds of others provoking and causing infinite actions and opinions in succeeding ages so that if the invention of the ship was thought so noble which carrieth riches and commodities from place to place and consociateth the most remote regions in participation of their fruits how much more are letters to be magnified which as ships pass through the vast seas of time and make ages so distant to participate of the wisdom illuminations and inventions the one of the other 1   but let us now consider what the drama should be and first it is not a copy but an imitation of nature this is the universal principle of the fine arts in all well laid out grounds what delight do we feel from that balance and antithesis of feelings and thoughts how natural we saybut the very wonder that caused the exclamation implies that we perceived art at the same moment we catch the hint from nature itself whenever in mountains or cataracts we discover a likeness to any thing artificial which yet we know is not artificialwhat pleasure and so it is in appearances known to be artificial which appear to be natural this applies in due degrees regulated by steady good sense from a clump of trees to the paradise lost or othello it would be easy to apply it to painting and even though with greater abstraction of thought and by more subtle yet equally just analogiesto music but this belongs to otherssuffice it that one great principle is common to all the fine artsa principle which probably is the condition of all consciousness without which we should feel and imagine only by discontinuous moments and be plants or brute animals instead of meni mean that evervarying balance or balancing of images notions or feelings conceived as in opposition to each otherin short the perception of identity and contrariety the least degree of which constitutes likeness the greatest absolute difference but the infinite gradations between these two form all the play and all the interest of our intellectual and moral being till it leads us to a feeling and an object more awful than it seems to me compatible with even the present subject to utter aloud though i am most desirous to suggest it for there alone are all things at once different and the same there alone as the principle of all things does distinction exist unaided by division there are will and reason succession of time and unmoving eternity infinite change and ineffable rest     return alpheus the dread voice is past   which shrunk thy streamsthou honourd flood   smoothflowing avon crownd with vocal reeds   that strain i heard was of a higher mood   but now my voice proceeds   we may divide a dramatic poets characteristics before we enter into the component merits of any one work and with reference only to those things which are to be the materials of all into language passion and character always bearing in mind that these must act and react on each otherthe language inspired by the passion and the language and the passion modified and differenced by the character to the production of the highest excellencies in these three there are requisite in the mind of the authorgood sense talent sensibility imaginationand to the perfection of a work we should add two faculties of lesser importance yet necessary for the ornaments and foliage of the column and the rooffancy and a quick sense of beauty  as to languageit cannot be supposed that the poet should make his characters say all that they would or that his whole drama considered each scene or paragraph should be such as on cool examination we can conceive it likely that men in such situations would say in that order or with that perfection and yet according to my feelings it is a very inferior kind of poetry in which as in the french tragedies men are made to talk in a style which few indeed even of the wittiest can be supposed to converse in and which both is and on a moments reflection appears to be the natural produce of the hotbed of vanity namely the closet of an author who is actuated originally by a desire to excite surprise and wonderment at his own superiority to other meninstead of having felt so deeply on certain subjects or in consequence of certain imaginations as to make it almost a necessity of his nature to seek for sympathyno doubt with that honorable desire of permanent action which distinguishes geniuswhere then is the differencein this that each part should be proportionate though the whole may be perhaps impossible at all events it should be compatible with sound sense and logic in the mind of the poet himself  it is to be lamented that we judge of books by books instead of referring what we read to our own experience one great use of books is to make their contents a motive for observation the german tragedies have in some respects been justly ridiculed in them the dramatist often becomes a novelist in his directions to the actors and thus degrades tragedy into pantomime yet still the consciousness of the poets mind must be diffused over that of the reader or spectator but he himself according to his genius elevates us and by being always in keeping prevents us from perceiving any strangeness though we feel great exultation many different kinds of style may be admirable both in different men and in different parts of the same poem  see the different language which strong feelings may justify in shylock and learn from shakspeares conduct of that character the terrible force of very plain and calm diction when known to proceed from a resolved and impassioned man  it is especially with reference to the drama and its characteristics in any given nation or at any particular period that the dependence of genius on the public taste becomes a matter of the deepest importance i do not mean that taste which springs merely from caprice or fashionable imitation and which in fact genius can and by degrees will create for itself but that which arises out of widegrasping and heartenrooted causes which is epidemic and in the very air that all breathe this it is which kills or withers or corrupts socrates indeed might walk arm and arm with hygeia whilst pestilence with a thousand furies running to and fro and clashing against each other in a complexity and agglomeration of horrors was shooting her darts of fire and venom all around him even such was milton yea and such in spite of all that has been babbled by his critics in pretended excuse for his damning because for them too profound excellenciessuch was shakspeare but alas the exceptions prove the rule for who will dare to force his way out of the crowdnot of the mere vulgarbut of the vain and banded aristocracy of intellect and presume to join the almost supernatural beings that stand by themselves aloof  of this diseased epidemic influence there are two forms especially preclusive of tragic worth the first is the necessary growth of a sense and love of the ludicrous and a morbid sensibility of the assimilative poweran inflammation produced by cold and weaknesswhich in the boldest bursts of passion will lie in wait for a jeer at any phrase that may have an accidental coincidence in the mere words with something base or trivial for instanceto express woods not on a plain but clothing a hill which overlooks a valley or dell or river or the seathe trees rising one above another as the spectators in an ancient theatrei know no other word in our language bookish and pedantic terms out of the question but hanging woods the sylvæ superimpendentes of catullus 2 yet let some wit call out in a slang tonethe gallows and a peal of laughter would damn the play hence it is that so many dull pieces have had a decent run only because nothing unusual above or absurd below mediocrity furnished an occasiona spark for the explosive materials collected behind the orchestra but it would take a volume of no ordinary size however laconically the sense were expressed if it were meant to instance the effects and unfold all the causes of this disposition upon the moral intellectual and even physical character of a people with its influences on domestic life and individual deportment a good document upon this subject would be the history of paris society and of french that is parisian literature from the commencement of the latter half of the reign of louis xiv to that of buonaparte compared with the preceding philosophy and poetry even of frenchmen themselves  the second form or more properly perhaps another distinct cause of this diseased disposition is matter of exultation to the philanthropist and philosopher and of regret to the poet the painter and the statuary alone and to them only as poets painters and statuariesnamely the security the comparative equability and ever increasing sameness of human life men are now so seldom thrown into wild circumstances and violences of excitement that the language of such states the laws of association of feeling with thought the starts and strange farflights of the assimilative power on the slightest and least obvious likeness presented by thoughts words or objectsthese are all judged of by authority not by actual experienceby what men have been accustomed to regard as symbols of these states and not the natural symbols or selfmanifestations of them  even so it is in the language of man and in that of nature the sound sun or the figures s u n are purely arbitrary modes of recalling the object and for visual mere objects they are not only sufficient but have infinite advantages from their very nothingness per se but the language of nature is a subordinate logos that was in the beginning and was with the thing it represented and was the thing it represented  now the language of shakspeare in his lear for instance is a something intermediate between these two or rather it is the former blended with the latterthe arbitrary not merely recalling the cold notion of the thing but expressing the reality of it and as arbitrary language is an heirloom of the human race being itself a part of that which it manifests what shall i deduce from the preceding positions even thisthe appropriate the never to be too much valued advantage of the theatre if only the actors were what we know they have beena delightful yet most effectual remedy for this dead palsy of the public mind what would appear mad or ludicrous in a book when presented to the senses under the form of reality and with the truth of nature supplies a species of actual experience this is indeed the special privilege of a great actor over a great poet no part was ever played in perfection but nature justified herself in the hearts of all her children in what state soever they were short of absolute moral exhaustion or downright stupidity there is no time given to ask questions or to pass judgments we are taken by storm and though in the histrionic art many a clumsy counterfeit by caricature of one or two features may gain applause as a fine likeness yet never was the very thing rejected as a counterfeit o when i think of the inexhaustible mine of virgin treasure in our shakspeare that i have been almost daily reading him since i was ten years oldthat the thirty intervening years have been unintermittingly and not fruitlessly employed in the study of the greek latin english italian spanish and german belle lettrists and the last fifteen years in addition far more intensely in the analysis of the laws of life and reason as they exist in manand that upon every step i have made forward in taste in acquisition of facts from history or my own observation and in knowledge of the different laws of being and their apparent exceptions from accidental collision of disturbing forcesthat at every new accession of information after every successful exercise of meditation and every fresh presentation of experience i have unfailingly discovered a proportionate increase of wisdom and intuition in shakspearewhen i know this and know too that by a conceivable and possible though hardly to be expected arrangement of the british theatres not all indeed but a large a very large proportion of this indefinite allround which no comprehension has yet drawn the line of circumscription so as to say to itself i have seen the wholemight be sent into the heads and heartsinto the very souls of the mass of mankind to whom except by this living comment and interpretation it must remain for ever a sealed volume a deep well without a wheel or a windlassit seems to me a pardonable enthusiasm to steal away from sober likelihood and share in so rich a feast in the faery world of possibility yet even in the grave cheerfulness of a circumspect hope much very much might be done enough assuredly to furnish a kind and strenuous nature with ample motives for the attempt to effect what may be effected   footnote advancement of learning book 1 sub fine  footnote 2 confestim peneos adest viridantia tempe tempe quae cingunt sylvae superimpendentes epith pel et th 286      shakspeare a poet generally   clothed in radiant armour and authorized by titles sure and manifold as a poet shakspeare came forward to demand the throne of fame as the dramatic poet of england his excellencies compelled even his contemporaries to seat him on that throne although there were giants in those days contending for the same honor hereafter i would fain endeavour to make out the title of the english drama as created by and existing in shakspeare and its right to the supremacy of dramatic excellence in general but he had shown himself a poet previously to his appearance as a dramatic poet and had no lear no othello no henry iv no twelfth night ever appeared we must have admitted that shakspeare possessed the chief if not every requisite of a poetdeep feeling and exquisite sense of beauty both as exhibited to the eye in the combinations of form and to the ear in sweet and appropriate melody that these feelings were under the command of his own will that in his very first productions he projected his mind out of his own particular being and felt and made others feel on subjects no way connected with himself except by force of contemplation and that sublime faculty by which a great mind becomes that on which it meditates to this must be added that affectionate love of nature and natural objects without which no man could have observed so steadily or painted so truly and passionately the very minutest beauties of the external world     when them hast on foot the purblind hare   mark the poor wretch to overshoot his troubles   how he outruns the wind and with what care   he cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles   the many musits through the which he goes   are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes    sometimes he runs among the flock of sheep   to make the cunning hounds mistake their smell   and sometime where earthdelving conies keep

a copse that neighbours by   a breeding jennet lusty young and proud c   is much more admirable but in parts less fitted for quotation  moreover shakspeare had shown that he possessed fancy considered as the faculty of bringing together images dissimilar in the main by some one point or more of likeness as in such a passage as this     full gently now she takes him by the hand   a lily prisoned in a jail of snow   or ivory in an alabaster band   so white a friend ingirts so white a foe  ib   and still mounting the intellectual ladder he had as unequivocally proved the indwelling in his mind of imagination or the power by which one image or feeling is made to modify many others and by a sort of fusion to force many into onethat which afterwards showed itself in such might and energy in lear where the deep anguish of a father spreads the feeling of ingratitude and cruelty over the very elements of heavenand which combining many circumstances into one moment of consciousness tends to produce that ultimate end of all human thought and human feeling unity and thereby the reduction of the spirit to its principle and fountain who is alone truly one various are the workings of this the greatest faculty of the human mind both passionate and tranquil in its tranquil and purely pleasurable operation it acts chiefly by creating out of many things as they would have appeared in the description of an ordinary mind detailed in unimpassioned succession a oneness even as nature the greatest of poets acts upon us when we open our eyes upon an extended prospect thus the flight of adonis in the dusk of the evening     look how a bright star shooteth from the sky   so glides he in the night from venus eye   how many images and feelings are here brought together without effort and without discord in the beauty of adonis the rapidity of his flight the yearning yet hopelessness of the enamored gazer while a shadowy ideal character is thrown over the whole or this power acts by impressing the stamp of humanity and of human feelings on inanimate or mere natural objects     lo here the gentle lark weary of rest   from his moist cabinet mounts up on high   and wakes the morning from whose silver breast   the sun ariseth in his majesty   who doth the world so gloriously behold   the cedartops and hills seem burnishd gold   or again it acts by so carrying on the eye of the reader as to make him almost lose the consciousness of wordsto make him see every thing flashed as wordsworth has grandly and appropriately said     flashed upon that inward eye which is the bliss of solitude   and this without exciting any painful or laborious attention without any anatomy of description a fault not uncommon in descriptive poetrybut with the sweetness and easy movement of nature this energy is an absolute essential of poetry and of itself would constitute a poet though not one of the highest classit is however a most hopeful symptom and the venus and adonis is one continued specimen of it  in this beautiful poem there is an endless activity of thought in all the possible associations of thought with thought thought with feeling or with words of feelings with feelings and of words with words     even as the sun with purplecolourd face   had taen his last leave of the weeping morn   rosecheekd adonis hied him to the chase   hunting he loved but love he laughed to scorn   sickthoughted venus makes amain unto him   and like a boldfaced suitor gins to woo him   remark the humanizing imagery and circumstances of the first two lines and the activity of thought in the play of words in the fourth line the whole stanza presents at once the time the appearance of the morning and the two persons distinctly characterized and in six simple verses puts the reader in possession of the whole argument of the poem     over one arm the lusty coursers rein   under the other was the tender boy   who blushd and pouted in a dull disdain   with leaden appetite unapt to toy   she red and hot as coals of glowing fire   he red for shame but frosty to desire   this stanza and the two following afford good instances of that poetic power which i mentioned above of making every thing present to the imaginationboth the forms and the passions which modify those forms either actually as in the representations of love or anger or other human affections or imaginatively by the different manner in which inanimate objects or objects unimpassioned themselves are caused to be seen by the mind in moments of strong excitement and according to the kind of the excitementwhether of jealousy or rage or love in the only appropriate sense of the word or of the lower impulses of our nature or finally of the poetic feeling itself it is perhaps chiefly in the power of producing and reproducing the latter that the poet stands distinct  the subject of the venus and adonis is unpleasing but the poem itself is for that very reason the more illustrative of shakspeare there are men who can write passages of deepest pathos and even sublimity on circumstances personal to themselves and stimulative of their own passions but they are not therefore on this account poets read that magnificent burst of womans patriotism and exultation deborahs song of victory it is glorious but nature is the poet there it is quite another matter to become all things and yet remain the sameto make the changeful god be felt in the river the lion and the flamethis it is that is the true imagination shakspeare writes in this poem as if he were of another planet charming you to gaze on the movements of venus and adonis as you would on the twinkling dances of two vernal butterflies  finally in this poem and the rape of lucrece shakspeare gave ample proof of his possession of a most profound energetic and philosophical mind without which he might have pleased but could not have been a great dramatic poet chance and the necessity of his genius combined to lead him to the drama his proper province in his conquest of which we should consider both the difficulties which opposed him and the advantages by which he was assisted      shakspeares judgment equal to his genius  thus then shakspeare appears from his venus and adonis and rape of lucrece alone apart from all his great works to have possessed all the conditions of the true poet let me now proceed to destroy as far as may be in my power the popular notion that he was a great dramatist by mere instinct that he grew immortal in his own despite and sank below men of second or thirdrate power when he attempted aught beside the dramaeven as bees construct their cells and manufacture their honey to admirable perfection but would in vain attempt to build a nest now this mode of reconciling a compelled sense of inferiority with a feeling of pride began in a few pedants who having read that sophocles was the great model of tragedy and aristotle the infallible dictator of its rules and finding that the lear hamlet othello and other masterpieces were neither in imitation of sophocles nor in obedience to aristotleand not having with one or two exceptions the courage to affirm that the delight which their country received from generation to generation in defiance of the alterations of circumstances and habits was wholly groundlesstook upon them as a happy medium and refuge to talk of shakspeare as a sort of beautiful lusus naturæ a delightful monsterwild indeed and without taste or judgment but like the inspired idiots so much venerated in the east uttering amid the strangest follies the sublimest truths in nine places out of ten in which i find his awful name mentioned it is with some epithet of wild irregular pure child of nature c if all this be true we must submit to it though to a thinking mind it cannot but be painful to find any excellence merely human thrown out of all human analogy and thereby leaving us neither rules for imitation nor motives to imitatebut if false it is a dangerous falsehoodfor it affords a refuge to secret selfconceitenables a vain man at once to escape his readers indignation by general swoln panegyrics and merely by his ipse dixit to treat as contemptible what he has not intellect enough to comprehend or soul to feel without assigning any reason or referring his opinion to any demonstrative principlethus leaving shakspeare as a sort of grand lama adored indeed arid his very excrements prized as relics but with no authority or real influence i grieve that every late voluminous edition of his works would enable me to substantiate the present charge with a variety of facts one tenth of which would of themselves exhaust the time allotted to me every critic who has or has not made a collection of black letter booksin itself a useful and respectable amusementputs on the sevenleague boots of selfopinion and strides at once from an illustrator into a supreme judge and blind and deaf fills his threeounce phial at the waters of niagara and determines positively the greatness of the cataract to be neither more nor less than his threeounce phial has been able to receive  i think this a very serious subject it is my earnest desiremy passionate endeavourto enforce at various times and by various arguments and instances the close and reciprocal connexion of just taste with pure morality without that acquaintance with the heart of man or that docility and childlike gladness to be made acquainted with it which those only can have who dare look at their own heartsand that with a steadiness which religion only has the power of reconciling with sincere humilitywithout this and the modesty produced by it i am deeply convinced that no man however wide his erudition however patient his antiquarian researches can possibly understand or be worthy of understanding the writings of shakspeare  assuredly that criticism of shakspeare will alone be genial which is reverential the englishman who without reverence a proud and affectionate reverence can utter the name of william shakspeare stands disqualified for the office of critic he wants one at least of the very senses the language of which he is to employ and will discourse at best but as a blind man while the whole harmonious creation of light and shade with all its subtle interchange of deepening and dissolving colours rises in silence to the silent fiat of the uprising apollo however inferior in ability i may be to some who have followed me i own i am proud that i was the first in time who publicly demonstrated to the full extent of the position that the supposed irregularity and extravagancies of shakspeare were the mere dreams of a pedantry that arraigned the eagle because it had not the dimensions of the swan in all the successive courses of lectures delivered by me since my first attempt at the royal institution it has been and it still remains my object to prove that in all points from the most important to the most minute the judgment of shakspeare is commensurate with his geniusnay that his genius reveals itself in his judgment as in its most exalted form and the more gladly do i recur to this subject from the clear conviction that to judge aright and with distinct consciousness of the grounds of our judgment concerning the works of shakspeare implies the power and the means of judging rightly of all other works of intellect those of abstract science alone excepted  it is a painful truth that not only individuals but even whole nations are ofttimes so enslaved to the habits of their education and immediate circumstances as not to judge disinterestedly even on those subjects the very pleasure arising from which consists in its disinterestedness namely on subjects of taste and polite literature instead of deciding concerning their own modes and customs by any rule of reason nothing appears rational becoming or beautiful to them but what coincides with the peculiarities of their education in this narrow circle individuals may attain to exquisite discrimination as the french critics have done in their own literature but a true critic can no more be such without placing himself on some central point from which he may command the whole that is some general rule which founded in reason or the faculties common to all men must therefore apply to eachthan an astronomer can explain the movements of the solar system without taking his stand in the sun and let me remark that this will not tend to produce despotism but on the contrary true tolerance in the critic he will indeed require as the spirit and substance of a work something true in human nature itself and independent of all circumstances but in the mode of applying it he will estimate genius and judgment according to the felicity with which the imperishable soul of intellect shall have adapted itself to the age the place and the existing manners the error he will expose lies in reversing this and holding up the mere circumstances as perpetual to the utter neglect of the power which can alone animate them for art cannot exist without or apart from nature and what has man of his own to give to his fellowman but his own thoughts and feelings and his observations so far as they are modified by his own thoughts or feelings  let me then once more submit this question to minds emancipated alike from national or party or sectarian prejudiceare the plays of shakspeare works of rude uncultivated genius in which the splendour of the parts compensates if aught can compensate for the barbarous shapelessness and irregularity of the wholeor is the form equally admirable with the matter and the judgment of the great poet not less deserving our wonder than his geniusor again to repeat the question in other wordsis shakspeare a great dramatic poet on account only of those beauties and excellencies which he possesses in common with the ancients but with diminished claims to our love and honour to the full extent of his differences from themor are these very differences additional proofs of poetic wisdom at once results and symbols of living power as contrasted with lifeless mechanismof free and rival originality as contradistinguished from servile imitation or more accurately a blind copying of effects instead of a true imitation of the essential principlesimagine not that i am about to oppose genius to rules no the comparative value of these rules is the very cause to be tried the spirit of poetry like all other living powers must of necessity circumscribe itself by rules were it only to unite power with beauty it must embody in order to reveal itself but a living body is of necessity an organized one and what is organization but the connection of parts in and for a whole so that each part is at once end and meansthis is no discovery of criticismit is a necessity of the human mind and all nations have felt and obeyed it in the invention of metre and measured sounds as the vehicle and involucrum of poetryitself a fellowgrowth from the same lifeeven as the bark is to the tree  no work of true genius dares want its appropriate form neither indeed is there any danger of this as it must not so genius cannot be lawless for it is even this that constitutes it geniusthe power of acting creatively under laws of its own origination how then comes it that not only single zoili but whole nations have combined in unhesitating condemnation of our great dramatist as a sort of african nature rich in beautiful monstersas a wild heath where islands of fertility look the greener from the surrounding waste where the loveliest plants now shine out among unsightly weeds and now are choked by their parasitic growth so intertwined that we cannot disentangle the weed without snapping the flowerin this statement  i have had no reference to the vulgar abuse of voltaire 1 save as far as his charges are coincident with the decisions of shakspeares own commentators and so they would tell you almost idolatrous admirers the true ground of the mistake lies in the confounding mechanical regularity with organic form the form is mechanic when on any given material we impress a predetermined form not necessarily arising out of the properties of the materialas when to a mass of wet clay we give whatever shape we wish it to retain when hardened the organic form on the other hand is innate it shapes as it developes itself from within and the fulness of its development is one and the same with the perfection of its outward form such as the life is such is the form nature the prime genial artist inexhaustible in diverse powers is equally inexhaustible in formseach exterior is the physiognomy of the being withinits true image reflected and thrown out from the concave mirrorand even such is the appropriate excellence of her chosen poet of our own shakspearehimself a nature humanized a genial understanding directing selfconsciously a power and an implicit wisdom deeper even than our consciousness  i greatly dislike beauties and selections in general but as proof positive of his unrivalled excellence i should like to try shakspeare by this criterion make out your amplest catalogue of all the human faculties as reason or the moral law the will the feeling of the coincidence of the two a feeling sui generis et demonstratio clemontrationum called the conscience the understanding or prudence wit fancy imagination judgmentand then of the objects on which these are to be employed as the beauties the terrors and the seeming caprices of nature the realities and the capabilities that is the actual and the ideal of the human mind conceived as an individual or as a social being as in innocence or in guilt in a playparadise or in a warfield of temptationand then compare with shakspeare under each of these heads all or any of the writers in prose and verse that have ever lived who that is competent to judge doubts the resultand ask your own heartsask your own commonsenseto conceive the possibility of this man beingi say not the drunken savage of that wretched sciolist whom frenchmen to their shame have honoured before their elder and better worthiesbut the anomalous the wild the irregular genius of our daily criticism what are we to have miracles in sportor i speak reverently does god choose idiots by whom to convey divine truths to man   footnote 1 take a slight

recapitulation and summary of the characteristics of shakspeares dramas 1  in lectures of which amusement forms a large part of the object there are some peculiar difficulties the architect places his foundation out of sight and the musician tunes his instrument before he makes his appearance but the lecturer has to try his chords in the presence of the assembly an operation not likely indeed to produce much pleasure but yet indispensably necessary to a right understanding of the subject to be developed  poetry in essence is as familiar to barbarous as to civilized nations the laplander and the savage indian are cheered by it as well as the inhabitants of london and parisits spirit takes up and incorporates surrounding materials as a plant clothes itself with soil and climate whilst it exhibits the working of a vital principle within independent of all accidental circumstances and to judge with fairness of an authors works we ought to distinguish what is inward and essential from what is outward and circumstantial it is essential to poetry that it be simple and appeal to the elements and primary laws of our nature that it be sensuous and by its imagery elicit truth at a flash that it be impassioned and be able to move our feelings and awaken our affections in comparing different poets with each other we should inquire which have brought into the fullest play our imagination and our reason or have created the greatest excitement and produced the completest harmony if we consider great exquisiteness of language and sweetness of metre alone it is impossible to deny to pope the character of a delightful writer but whether he be a poet must depend upon our definition of the word and doubtless if every thing that pleases be poetry popes satires and epistles must be poetry this i must say that poetry as distinguished from other modes of composition does not rest in metre and that it is not poetry if it make no appeal to our passions or our imagination one character belongs to all true poets that they write from a principle within not originating in any thing without and that the true poets work in its form its shapings and its modifications is distinguished from all other works that assume to belong to the class of poetry as a natural from an artificial flower or as the mimic garden of a child from an enamelled meadow in the former the flowers are broken from their stems and stuck into the ground they are beautiful to the eye and fragrant to the sense but their colours soon fade and their odour is transient as the smile of the planterwhile the meadow may be visited again and again with renewed delight its beauty is innate in the soil and its bloom is of the freshness of nature  the next ground of critical judgment and point of comparison will be as to how far a given poet has been influenced by accidental circumstances as a living poet must surely write not for the ages past but for that in which he lives and those which are to follow it is on the one hand natural that he should not violate and on the other necessary that he should not depend on the mere manners and modes of his day see how little does shakspeare leave us to regret that he was born in his particular age the great aera in modern times was what is called the restoration of lettersthe ages preceding it are called the dark ages but it would be more wise perhaps to call them the ages in which we were in the dark it is usually overlooked that the supposed dark period was not universal but partial and successive or alternate that the dark age of england was not the dark age of italy but that one country was in its light and vigour whilst another was in its gloom and bondage but no sooner had the reformation sounded through europe like the blast of an archangels trumpet than from king to peasant there arose an enthusiasm for knowledge the discovery of a manuscript became the subject of an embassy erasmus read by moonlight because he could not afford a torch and begged a penny not for the love of charity but for the love of learning the three great points of attention were religion morals and taste men of genius as well as men of learning who in this age need to be so widely distinguished then alike became copyists of the ancients and this indeed was the only way by which the taste of mankind could be improved or their understandings informed whilst dante imagined himself a humble follower of virgil and ariosto of homer they were both unconscious of that greater power working within them which in many points carried them beyond their supposed originals all great discoveries bear the stamp of the age in which they are madehence we perceive the effects of the purer religion of the moderns visible for the most part in their lives and in reading their works we should not content ourselves with the mere narratives of events long since passed but should learn to apply their maxims and conduct to ourselves  having intimated that times and manners lend their form and pressure to genius let me once more draw a slight parallel between the ancient and modern stage the stages of greece and of england the greeks were polytheists their religion was local almost the only object of all their knowledge art and taste was their gods and accordingly their productions were if the expression may be allowed statuesque whilst those of the moderns are picturesque the greeks reared a structure which in its parts and as a whole fitted the mind with the calm and elevated impression of perfect beauty and symmetrical proportion the moderns also produced a whole a more striking whole but it was by blending materials and fusing the parts together and as the pantheon is to york minster or westminster abbey so is sophocles compared with shakspeare in the one a completeness a satisfaction an excellence on which the mind rests with complacency in the other a multitude of interlaced materials great and little magnificent and mean accompanied indeed with the sense of a falling short of perfection and yet at the same time so promising of our social and individual progression that we would not if we could exchange it for that repose of the mind which dwells on the forms of symmetry in the acquiescent admiration of grace  this general characteristic of the ancient and modern drama might be illustrated by a parallel of the ancient and modern musicthe one consisting of melody arising from a succession only of pleasing soundsthe modern embracing harmony also the result of combination and the effect of a whole  i have said and i say it again that great as was the genius of shakspeare his judgment was at least equal to it of this any one will be convinced who attentively considers those points in which the dramas of greece and england differ from the dissimilitude of circumstances by which each was modified and influenced the greek stage had its origin in the ceremonies of a sacrifice such as of the goat to bacchus whom we most erroneously regard as merely the jolly god of winefor among the ancients he was venerable as the symbol of that power which acts without our consciousness in the vital energies of naturethe vinum mundias apollo was that of the conscious agency of our intellectual being the heroes of old under the influence of this bacchic enthusiasm performed more than human actionshence tales of the favorite champions soon passed into dialogue on the greek stage the chorus was always before the audience the curtain was never dropped as we should say and change of place being therefore in general impossible the absurd notion of condemning it merely as improbable in itself was never entertained by any one if we can believe ourselves at thebes in one act we may believe ourselves at athens in the next if a story lasts twentyfour hours or twentyfour years it is equally improbable there seems to be no just boundary but what the feelings prescribe but on the greek stage where the same persons were perpetually before the audience great judgment was necessary in venturing on any such change the poets never therefore attempted to impose on the senses by bringing places to men but they did bring men to places as in the well known instance in the eumenides where during an evident retirement of the chorus from the orchestra the scene is changed to athens and orestes is first introduced in the temple of minerva and the chorus of furies come in afterwards in pursuit of him 2  in the greek drama there were no formal divisions into scenes and acts there were no means therefore of allowing for the necessary lapse of time between one part of the dialogue and another and unity of time in a strict sense was of course impossible to overcome that difficulty of accounting for time which is effected on the modern stage by dropping a curtain the judgment and great genius of the ancients supplied music and measured motion and with the lyric ode filled up the vacuity in the story of the agamemnon of Æschylus the capture of troy is supposed to be announced by a fire lighted on the asiatic shore and the transmission of the signal by successive beacons to mycené the signal is first seen at the 2lst line and the herald from troy itself enters at the 486th and agamemnon himself at the 783rd line but the practical absurdity of this was not felt by the audience who in imagination stretched minutes into hours while they listened to the lofty narrative odes of the chorus which almost entirely fill up the interspace another fact deserves attention here namely that regularly on the greek stage a drama or acted story consisted in reality of three dramas called together a trilogy and performed consecutively in the course of one day now you may conceive a tragedy of shakspeares as a trilogy connected in one single representation divide lear into three parts and each would be a play with the ancients or take the three Æschylean dramas of agamemnon and divide them into or call them as many acts and they together would be one play the first act would comprise the usurpation of Ægisthus and the murder of agamemnon the second the revenge of orestes and the murder of his mother and the third the penance and absolution of orestesoccupying a period of twentytwo years  the stage in shakspeares time was a naked room with a blanket for a curtain but he made it a field for monarchs that law of unity which has its foundations not in the factitious necessity of custom but in nature itself the unity of feeling is every where and at all times observed by shakspeare in his plays read romeo and julietall is youth and springyouth with its follies its virtues its precipitanciesspring with its odours its flowers and its transiency it is one and the same feeling that commences goes through and ends the play the old men the capulets and the montagues are not common old men they have an eagerness a heartiness a vehemence the effect of spring with romeo his change of passion his sudden marriage and his rash death are all the effects of youthwhilst in juliet love has all that is tender and melancholy in the nightingale all that is voluptuous in the rose with whatever is sweet in the freshness of spring but it ends with a long deep sigh like the last breeze of the italian evening this unity of feeling and character pervades every drama of shakspeare  it seems to me that his plays are distinguished from those of all other dramatic poets by the following characteristics  1 expectation in preference to surprise it is like the true reading of the passagegod said let there be light and there was lightnot there was light as the feeling with which we startle at a shooting star compared with that of watching the sunrise at the preestablished moment such and so low is surprise compared with expectation  2 signal adherence to the great law of nature that all opposites tend to attract and temper each other passion in shakspeare generally displays libertinism but involves morality and if there are exceptions to this they are independently of their intrinsic value all of them indicative of individual character and like the farewell admonitions of a parent have an end beyond the parental relation thus the countesss beautiful precepts to bertram by elevating her character raise that of helena her favorite and soften down the point in her which shakspeare does not mean us not to see but to see and to forgive and at length to justify and so it is in polonius who is the personified memory of wisdom no longer actually possessed this admirable character is always misrepresented on the stage shakspeare never intended to exhibit him as a buffoon for although it was natural that hamleta young man of fire and genius detesting formality and disliking polonius on political grounds as imagining that he had assisted his uncle in his usurpationshould express himself satiricallyyet this must not be taken as exactly the poets conception of him in polonius a certain induration of character had arisen from long habits of business but take his advice to laertes and ophelias reverence for his memory and we shall see that he was meant to be represented as a statesman somewhat past his facultieshis recollections of life all full of wisdom and showing a knowledge of human nature whilst what immediately takes place before him and escapes from him is indicative of weakness  but as in homer all the deities are in armour even venus so in shakspeare all the characters are strong hence real folly and dullness are made by him the vehicles of wisdom there is no difficulty for one being a fool to imitate a fool but to be remain and speak like a wise man and a great wit and yet so as to give a vivid representation of a veritable foolhic labor hoc opus est a drunken constable is not uncommon nor hard to draw but see and examine what goes to make up a dogberry  3 keeping at all times in the high road of life shakspeare has no innocent adulteries no interesting incests no virtuous vicehe never renders that amiable which religion and reason alike teach us to detest or clothes impurity in the garb of virtue like beaumont and fletcher the kotzebues of the day shakspeares fathers are roused by ingratitude his husbands stung by unfaithfulness in him in short the affections are wounded in those points in which all may nay must feel let the morality of shakspeare be contrasted with that of the writers of his own or the succeeding age or of those of the present day who boast their superiority in this respect no one can dispute that the result of such a comparison is altogether in favour of shakspeareeven the letters of women of high rank in his age were often coarser than his writings if he occasionally disgusts a keen sense of delicacy he never injures the mind he neither excites nor flatters passion in order to degrade the subject of it he does not use the faulty thing for a faulty purpose nor carries on warfare against virtue by causing wickedness to appear as no wickedness through the medium of a morbid sympathy with the unfortunate in shakspeare vice never walks as in twilight nothing is purposely out of its placehe inverts not the order of nature and proprietydoes not make every magistrate a drunkard or glutton nor every poor man meek humane and temperate he has no benevolent butchers nor any sentimental ratcatchers  4 independence of the dramatic interest on the plot the interest in the plot is always in fact on account of the characters not vice versa as in almost all other writers the plot is a mere canvass and no more hence arises the true justification of the same stratagem being used in regard to benedict and beatricethe vanity in each being alike take away from the much ado about nothing all that which is not indispensable to the plot either as having little to do with it or at best like dogberry and his comrades forced into the service when any other less ingeniously absurd watchmen and nightconstables would have answered the mere necessities of the actiontake away benedict beatrice dogberry and the reaction of the former on the character of heroand what will remain in other writers the main agent of the plot is always the prominent character in shakspeare it is so or is not so as the character is in itself calculated or not calculated to form the plot don john is the mainspring of the plot of this play but he is merely shown and then withdrawn  5 independence of the interest on the story as the groundwork of the plot hence shakspeare never took the trouble of inventing stories it was enough for him to select from those that had been already invented or recorded such as had one or other or both of two recommendations namely suitableness to his particular purpose and their being parts of popular traditionnames of which we had often heard and of their fortunes and as to which all we wanted was to see the man himself so it is just the man himself the lear the shylock the richard that shakspeare makes us for the first time acquainted with omit the first scene in lear and yet every thing will remain so the first and second scenes in the merchant of venice indeed it is universally true  6 interfusion of the lyricalthat which in its very essence is poeticalnot only with the dramatic as in the plays of metastasio where at the end of the scene comes the aria as the exit speech of the character but also in and through the dramatic songs in shakspeare are introduced as songs only just as songs are in real life beautifully as some of them are characteristic of the person who has sung or called for them as desdemonas willow and ophelias wild snatches and the sweet carollings in as you like it but the whole of the midsummer nights dream is one continued specimen of the dramatized lyrical and observe how exquisitely the dramatic of hotspur    marry and im glad ont with all my heart   i had rather be a kitten and crymew c  melts away into the lyric of mortimer    i understand thy looks that pretty welsh   which thou pourest down from these swelling heavens   i am too perfect in c    henry iv part i act iii sc i   7 the characters of the dramatis personæ like those in real life are to be inferred by the readerthey are not told to him and it is well worth remarking that shakspeares characters like those in real life are very commonly misunderstood and almost always understood by different persons in different ways the causes are the same in either case if you take only what the friends of the character say you may be deceived and still more so if that which his enemies say nay even the character himself sees himself through the medium of his character and not exactly as he is take all together not omitting a shrewd hint from the clown or the fool and perhaps your impression will be right and you may know whether you have in fact discovered the poets own idea by all the speeches receiving light from it and attesting its reality by reflecting it  lastly in shakspeare the heterogeneous is united as it is in nature you must not suppose a pressure or passion always acting on or in the characterpassion in shakspeare is that by which the individual is distinguished from others not that which makes a different kind of him shakspeare followed the main march of the human affections he entered into no analysis of the passions or faiths of men but assured himself that such and such passions and faiths were grounded in our common nature and not in the mere accidents of ignorance or disease this is an important consideration and constitutes our shakspeare the morning star the guide and the pioneer of true philosophy   footnote 1 for the most part

simulacrum venerans paulo post autem eum consequantur eumenides c schiitzs note the recessions of the chorus were termed peravaoraneu there is another instance in the ajax v 814 ed     order of shakspeares plays  various attempts have been made to arrange the plays of shakspeare each according to its priority in time by proofs derived from external documents how unsuccessful these attempts have been might easily be shown not only from the widely different results arrived at by men all deeply versed in the blackletter books old plays pamphlets manuscript records and catalogues of that age but also from the fallacious and unsatisfactory nature of the facts and assumptions on which the evidence rests in that age when the press was chiefly occupied with controversial or practical divinitywhen the law the church and the state engrossed all honour and respectabilitywhen a degree of disgrace levior quædam infamiæ macula was attached to the publication of poetry and even to have sported with the muse as a private relaxation was supposed to bea venial fault indeed yetsomething beneath the gravity of a wise manwhen the professed poets were so poor that the very expenses of the press demanded the liberality of some wealthy individual so that two thirds of spensers poetic works and those most highly praised by his learned admirers and friends remained for many years in manuscript and in manuscript perishedwhen the amateurs of the stage were comparatively few and therefore for the greater part more or less known to each otherwhen we know that the plays of shakspeare both during and after his life were the property of the stage and published by the players doubtless according to their notions of acceptability with the visitants of the theatrein such an age and under such circumstances can an allusion or reference to any drama or poem in the publication of a contemporary be received as conclusive evidence that such drama or poem had at that time been published or further can the priority of publication itself prove any thing in favour of actually prior composition  we are tolerably certain indeed that the venus and adonis and the rape of lucrece were his two earliest poems and though not printed until 1593 in the twenty ninth year of his age yet there can be little doubt that they had remained by him in manuscript many years for mr malone has made it highly probable that he had commenced a writer for the stage in 1591 when he was twenty seven years old and shakspeare himself assures us that the venus and adonis was the first heir of his invention1  baffled then in the attempt to derive any satisfaction from outward documents we may easily stand excused if we turn our researches towards the internal evidences furnished by the writings themselves with no other positive data than the known facts that the venus and adonis was printed in 1593 the rape of lucrece in 1594 and that the romeo and juliet had appeared in 1595and with no other presumptions than that the poems his very first productions were written many years earlierfor who can believe that shakspeare could have remained to his twentyninth or thirtieth year without attempting poetic composition of any kindand that between these and romeo and juliet there had intervened one or two other dramas or the chief materials at least of them although they may very possibly have appeared after the success of the romeo and juliet and some other circumstances had given the poet an authority with the proprietors and created a prepossession in his favour with the

labours of his youth the example of titus andronicus which as well as jeronymo was most popular in shakspeares first epoch had led the young dramatist to the lawless mixture of dates and manners in this same epoch i should place the comedy of errors remarkable as being the only specimen of poetical farce in our language that is intentionally such so that all the distinct kinds of drama which

merciful wondermaking heaven what a man was this shakspeare myriadminded indeed he was       notes on the tempest  there is a sort of improbability with which we are shocked in dramatic representation not less than in a narrative of real life consequently there must be rules respecting it and as rules are nothing but means to an end previously ascertainedinattention to which simple truth has been the occasion of all the pedantry of the french schoolwe must first determine what the immediate end or object of the drama is and here as i have previously remarked i find two extremes of critical decisionthe french which evidently presupposes that a perfect delusion is to be aimed atan opinion which needs no fresh confutation and the exact opposite to it brought forward by dr johnson who supposes the auditors throughout in the full reflective knowledge of the contrary in evincing the impossibility of delusion he makes no sufficient allowance for an intermediate state which i have before distinguished by the term illusion and have attempted to illustrate its quality and character by reference to our mental state when dreaming in both cases we simply do not judge the imagery to be unreal there is a negative reality and no more whatever therefore tends to prevent the mind from placing itself or being placed gradually in that state in which the images have such negative reality for the auditor destroys this illusion and is dramatically improbable  now the production of this effecta sense of improbabilitywill depend on the degree of excitement in which the mind is supposed to be many things would be intolerable in the first scene of a play that would not at all interrupt our enjoyment in the height of the interest when the narrow cockpit may be made to hold    the vasty field of france or we may cram   within its wooden o the very casques   that did affright the air at agincourt  again on the other hand many obvious improbabilities will be endured as belonging to the groundwork of the story rather than to the drama itself in the first scenes which would disturb or disentrance us from all illusion in the acme of our excitement as for instance lears division of his kingdom and the banishment of cordelia  but although the other excellencies of the drama besides this dramatic probability as unity of interest with distinctness and subordination of the characters and appropriateness of style are all so far as they tend to increase the inward excitement means towards accomplishing the chief end that of producing and supporting this willing illusionyet they do not on that account cease to be ends themselves and we must remember that as such they carry their own justification with them as long as they do not contravene or interrupt the total illusion it is not even always or of necessity an objection to them that they prevent the illusion from rising to as great a height as it might otherwise have attainedit is enough that they are simply compatible with as high a degree of it as is requisite for the purpose nay upon particular occasions a palpable improbability may be hazarded by a great genius for the express purpose of keeping down the interest of a merely instrumental scene which would otherwise make too great an impression for the harmony of the entire illusion had the panorama been invented in the time of pope leo x raffael would still i doubt not have smiled in contempt at the regret that the broomtwigs and scrubby bushes at the back of some of his grand pictures were not as probable trees as those in the exhibition  the tempest is a specimen of the purely romantic drama in which the interest is not historical or dependent upon fidelity of portraiture or the natural connexion of eventsbut is a birth of the imagination and rests only on the coaptation and union of the elements granted to or assumed by the poet it is a species of drama which owes no allegiance to time or space and in which therefore errors of chronology and geographyno mortal sins in any speciesare venial faults and count for nothing it addresses itself entirely to the imaginative faculty and although the illusion may be assisted by the effect on the senses of the complicated scenery and decorations of modern times yet this sort of assistance is dangerous for the principal and only genuine excitement ought to come from withinfrom the moved and sympathetic imagination whereas where so much is addressed to the mere external senses of seeing and hearing the spiritual vision is apt to languish and the attraction from without will withdraw the mind from the proper and only legitimate interest which is intended to spring from within  the romance opens with a busy scene admirably appropriate to the kind of drama and giving as it were the keynote to the whole harmony it prepares and initiates the excitement required for the entire piece and yet does not demand any thing from the spectators which their previous habits had not fitted them to understand it is the bustle of a tempest from which the real horrors are abstractedtherefore it is poetical though not in strictness naturalthe distinction to which i have so often alludedand is purposely restrained from concentering the interest on itself but used merely as an induction or tuning for what is to follow  in the second scene prosperos speeches till the entrance of ariel contain the finest example i remember of retrospective narration for the purpose of exciting immediate interest and putting the audience in possession of all the information necessary for the understanding of the plot1 observe too the perfect probability of the moment chosen by prospero the very shakspeare himself as it were of the tempest to open out the truth to his daughter his own romantic bearing and how completely any thing that might have been disagreeable to us in the magician is reconciled and shaded in the humanity and natural feelings of the father in the very first speech of miranda the simplicity and tenderness of her character are at once laid openit would have been lost in direct contact with the agitation of the first scene the opinion once prevailed but happily is now abandoned that fletcher alone wrote for womenthe truth is that with very few and those partial exceptions the female characters in the plays of beaumont and fletcher are when of the light kind not decent when heroic complete viragos but in shakspeare all the elements of womanhood are holy and there is the sweet yet dignified feeling of all that continuates society as sense of ancestry and of sex with a purity unassailable by sophistry because it rests not in the analytic processes but in that sane equipoise of the faculties during which the feelings are representative of all past experiencenot of the individual only but of all those by whom she has been educated and their predecessors even up to the first mother that lived shakspeare saw that the want of prominence which pope notices for sarcasm was the blessed beauty of the womans character and knew that it arose not from any deficiency but from the more exquisite harmony of all the parts of the moral being constituting one living total of head and heart he has drawn it indeed in all its distinctive energies of faith patience constancy fortitudeshown in all of them as following the heart which gives its results by a nice tact and happy intuition without the intervention of the discursive facultysees all things in and by the light of the affections and errs if it ever err in the exaggerations of love alone in all the shakspearian women there is essentially the same foundation and principle the distinct individuality and variety are merely the result of the modification of circumstances whether in miranda the maiden in imogen the wife or in katharine the queen  but to return the appearance and characters of the super or ultranatural servants are finely contrasted ariel has in every thing the airy tint which gives the name and it is worthy of remark that miranda is never directly brought into comparison with ariel lest the natural and human of the one and the supernatural of the other should tend to neutralize each other caliban on the other hand is all earth all condensed and gross in feelings and images he has the dawnings of understanding without reason or the moral sense and in him as in some brute animals this advance to the intellectual faculties without the moral sense is marked by the appearance of vice for it is in the primacy of the moral being only that man is truly human in his intellectual powers he is certainly approached by the brutes and mans whole system duly considered those powers cannot be considered other than means to an end that is to morality  in this scene as it proceeds is displayed the impression made by ferdinand and miranda on each other it is love at first sight    at the first sight they have changd eyes  and it appears to me that in all cases of real love it is at one moment that it takes place that moment may have been prepared by previous esteem admiration or even affectionyet love seems to require a momentary act of volition by which a tacit bond of devotion is imposeda bond not to be thereafter broken without violating what should be sacred in our nature how finely is the true shakspearian scene contrasted with drydens vulgar alteration of it in which a mere ludicrous psychological experiment as it were is trieddisplaying nothing but indelicacy without passion prosperos interruption of the courtship has often seemed to me to have no sufficient motive still his alleged reason    lest too light winning make the prize light  is enough for the ethereal connexions of the romantic imagination although it would not be so for the historical 2 the whole courting scene indeed in the beginning of the third act between the lovers is a masterpiece and the first dawn of disobedience in the mind of miranda to the command of her father is very finely drawn so as to seem the working of the scriptural command thou shall leave father and mother c o with what exquisite purity this scene is conceived and executed shakspeare may sometimes be gross but i boldly say that he is always moral and modest alas in this our day decency of manners is preserved at the expense of morality of heart and delicacies for vice are allowed whilst grossness against it is hypocritically or at least morbidly condemned  in this play are admirably sketched the vices generally accompanying a low degree of civilization and in the first scene of the second act shakspeare has as in many other places shown the tendency in bad men to indulge in scorn and contemptuous expressions as a mode of getting rid of their own uneasy feelings of inferiority to the good and also by making the good ridiculous of rendering the transition of others to wickedness easy shakspeare never puts habitual scorn into the mouths of other than bad men as here in the instances of antonio and sebastian the scene of the intended assassination of alonzo and gonzalo is an exact counterpart of the scene between macbeth and his lady only pitched in a lower key throughout as designed to be frustrated and concealed and exhibiting the same profound management in the manner of familiarizing a mind not immediately recipient to the suggestion of guilt by associating the proposed crime with something ludicrous or out of placesomething not habitually matter of reverence by this kind of sophistry the imagination and fancy are first bribed to contemplate the suggested act and at length to become acquainted with it observe how the effect of this scene is heightened by contrast with another counterpart of it in low lifethat between the conspirators stephano caliban and trinculo in the second scene of the third act in which there are the same essential characteristics  in this play and in this scene of it are also shown the springs of the vulgar in politicsof that kind of politics which is inwoven with human nature in his treatment of this subject wherever it occurs shakspeare is quite peculiar in other writers we find the particular opinions of the individual in massinger it is rank republicanism in beaumont and fletcher even jure divino principles are carried to excessbut shakspeare never promulgates any party tenets he is always the philosopher and the moralist but at the same time with a profound veneration for all the established institutions of society and for those classes which form the permanent elements of the stateespecially never introducing a professional character as such otherwise than as respectable if he must have any name he should be styled a philosophical aristocrat delighting in those hereditary institutions which have a tendency to bind one age to another and in that distinction of ranks of which although few may be in possession all enjoy the advantages hence again you will observe the good nature with which he seems always to make sport with the passions and follies of a mob as with an irrational animal he is never angry with it but hugely content with holding up its absurdities to its face and sometimes you may trace a tone of almost affectionate superiority something like that in which a father speaks of the rogueries of a child see the goodhumoured way in which he describes stephano passing from the most licentious freedom to absolute despotism over trinculo and caliban the truth is shakspeares characters are all genera intensely individualized the results of meditation of which observation supplied the drapery and the colors necessary to combine them with each other he had virtually surveyed all the great component powers and impulses of human naturehad seen that their different combinations and subordinations were in fact the individualizers of men and showed how their harmony was produced by reciprocal disproportions of excess or deficiency the language in which these truths are expressed was not drawn from any set fashion but from the profoundest depths of his moral being and is therefore for all ages  footnote 1    pro  mark his condition and th event then tell me if this might           be a brother    mira i should sin to think but nobly of my grandmother good wombs

remarks that no body was lost in the wreck and yet that no such character is introduced in the fable as the duke of milans son mr c notes must not ferdinand have believed he was lost in the fleet that the tempest scattereded      loves labours lost  the characters in this play are either impersonated out of shakspeares own multiformity by imaginative selfposition or out of such as a country town and a schoolboys observation might supplythe curate the schoolmaster the armado who even in my time was not extinct in the cheaper inns of north wales and so on the satire is chiefly on follies of words biron and rosaline are evidently the preexistent state of benedict and beatrice and so perhaps is boyet of lafeu and costard of the tapster in measure for measure and the frequency of the rhymes the sweetness as well as the smoothness of the metre and the number of acute and fancifully illustrated aphorisms are all as they ought to be in a poets youth true genius begins by generalizing and condensing it ends in realizing and expanding it first collects the seeds  yet if this juvenile drama had been the only one extant of our shakspeare and we possessed the tradition only of his riper works or accounts of them in writers who had not even mentioned this playhow many of shakspeares characteristic features might we not still have discovered in loves labours lost though as in a portrait taken of him in his boyhood  i can never sufficiently admire the wonderful activity of thought throughout the whole of the first scene of the play rendered natural as it is by the choice of the characters and the whimsical determination on which the drama is founded a whimsical determination certainlyyet not altogether so very improbable to those who are conversant in the history of the middle ages with their courts of love and all that lighter drapery of chivalry which engaged even mighty kings with a sort of seriocomic interest and may well be supposed to have occupied more completely the smaller princes at a time when the nobles or princes court contained the only theatre of the domain or principality this sort of story too was admirably suited to shakspeares times when the english court was still the fostermother of the state and the muses and when in consequence the courtiers and men of rank and fashion affected a display of wit point and sententious observation that would be deemed intolerable at presentbut in which a hundred years of controversy involving every great political and every dear domestic interest had trained all but the lowest classes to participate add to this the very style of the sermons of the time and the eagerness of the protestants to distinguish themselves by long and frequent preaching and it will be found that from the reign of henry viii to the abdication of james ii no country ever received such a national education as england  hence the comic matter chosen in the first instance is a ridiculous imitation or apery of this constant striving after logical precision and subtle opposition of thoughts together with a making the most of every conception or image by expressing it under the least expected property belonging to it and this again rendered specially absurd by being applied to the most current subjects and occurrences the phrases and modes of combination in argument were caught by the most ignorant from the custom of the age and their ridiculous misapplication of them is most amusingly exhibited in costard whilst examples suited only to the gravest propositions and impersonations or apostrophes to abstract thoughts impersonated which are in fact the natural language only of the most vehement agitations of the mind are adopted by the coxcombry of armado as mere artifices of ornament  the same kind of intellectual action is exhibited in a more serious and elevated strain in many other parts of this play birons speech at the end of the fourth act is an excellent specimen of it it is logic clothed in rhetoricbut observe how shakspeare in his twofold being of poet and philosopher avails himself of it to convey profound truths in the most lively imagesthe whole remaining faithful to the character supposed to utter the lines and the expressions themselves constituting a further developement of that character  other slow arts entirely keep the brain and therefore finding barren practisers scarce shew a harvest of their heavy toil but love first learned in a ladys eyes lives not alone immured in the brain but with the motion of all elements courses as swift as thought in every power and gives to every power a double power above their functions and their offices it adds a precious seeing to the eye a lovers eyes will gaze an eagle blind a lovers ear will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious tread of theft is stoppd loves feeling is more soft and sensible than are the tender horns of cockled snails loves tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste for valour is not love a hercules still climbing trees in the hesperides subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical as bright apollos lute strung with his hair and when love speaks the voice of all the gods makes heaven drowsy with the harmony never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink were temperd with loves sighs o then his lines would ravish savage ears and plant in tyrants mild humility from womens eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academes that shew contain and nourish all the world else none at all in aught proves excellent then fools you were these women to forswear or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools for wisdoms sake a word that all men love or for loves sake a word that loves all men or for mens sake the authors of these women or womens sake by whom we men are men let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths it is religion to be thus forsworn for charity itself fulfills the law and who can sever love from charity   this is quite a studysometimes you see this youthful god of poetry connecting disparate thoughts purely by means of resemblances in the words expressing thema thing in character in lighter comedy especially of that kind in which shakspeare delights namely the purposed display of wit though sometimes too disfiguring his graver scenesbut more often you may see him doubling the natural connection or order of logical consequence in the thoughts by the introduction of an artificial and sought for resemblance in the words as for instance in the third line of the play    and then grace us in the disgrace of death  this being a figure often having its force and propriety as justified by the law of passion which inducing in the mind an unusual activity seeks for means to waste its superfluitywhen in the highest degreein lyric repetitions and sublime tautologyat her feet he bowed he fell he lay down at her feet he bowed he fell where he bowed there he fell down deadand in lower degrees in making the words themselves the subjects and materials of that surplus action and for the same cause that agitates our limbs and forces our very gestures into a tempest in states of high excitement  the mere style of narration in loves labours lost like that of Ægeon in the first scene of the comedy of errors and of the captain in the second scene of macbeth seems imitated with its defects and its beauties from sir philip sidney whose arcadia though not then published was already well known in manuscript copies and could hardly have escaped the notice and admiration of shakspeare as the friend and client of the earl of southampton the chief defect consists in the parentheses and parenthetic thoughts and descriptions suited neither to the passion of the speaker nor the purpose of the person to whom the information is to be given but manifestly betraying the author himselfnot by way of continuous undersong butpalpably and so as to show themselves addressed to the general reader however it is not unimportant to notice how strong a presumption the diction and allusions of this play afford that though shakspeares acquirements in the dead languages might not be such as we suppose in a learned education his habits had nevertheless been scholastic and those of a student for a young authors first work almost always bespeaks his recent pursuits and his first observations of life are either drawn from the immediate employments of his youth and from the characters and images most deeply impressed on his mind in the situations in which those employments had placed himor else they are fixed on such objects and occurrences in the world as are easily connected with and seem to bear upon his studies and the hitherto exclusive subjects of his meditation just as ben jonson who applied himself to the drama after having served in flanders fills his earliest plays with true or pretended soldiers the wrongs and neglects of the former and the absurd boasts and knavery of their counterfeits so lessings first comedies are placed in the universities and consist of events and characters conceivable in an academic life  i will only further remark the sweet and tempered gravity with which shakspeare in the end draws the only fitting moral which such a drama afforded here rosaline rises up to the full height of beatrice  ros oft have i heard of you my lord biron before i saw you and the worlds large tongue proclaims you for a man replete with mocks full of comparisons and wounding flouts which you

retains it but i do not agree with warburton and others in striking out the preceding line also it is quite in birons character and rosaline not answering it immediately dumain takes up the question for him and after he and longaville are answered biron with evident propriety says    studies my mistress c      midsummer nights dream  act i sc 1     her o cross too high to be enthralld to low

authority for any alterationbut i never can help feeling how great an improvement it would be if the two former of hermias exclamations were omittedthe third and only appropriate one would then become a beauty and most natural  ib helenas speech    i wilt go tell him of fair hermias flight c  i am convinced that shakspeare availed himself of the title of this play in his own mind and worked upon it as a dream throughout but especially and perhaps unpleasingly in this broad determination of ungrateful treachery in helena so undisguisedly avowed to herself and this too after the witty cool philosophizing that precedes the act itself is natural and the resolve so to act is i fear likewise too true a picture of the lax hold which principles have on a womans heart when opposed to or even separated from passion and inclination for women are less hypocrites to their own minds than men are because in general they feel less proportionate abhorrence of moral evil in and for itself and more of its outward consequences as detection and loss of character than mentheir natures being almost wholly extroitive still however just in itself the representation of this is not poetical we shrink

of errors  the myriadminded man our and all mens shakspeare has in this piece presented us with a legitimate farce in exactest consonance with the philosophical principles and character of farce as distinguished from comedy and from entertainments a proper farce is mainly distinguished from comedy by the license allowed and even required in the fable in order to produce strange and laughable situations the story need not be probable it is enough that it is possible a comedy would scarcely allow even the two antipholises because although there have been instances of almost indistinguishable likeness in two persons yet these are mere individual accidents casus ludentis naturæ and the verum will not excuse the inverisimile but farce dares add the two dromios and is

supposed defects of great men 1810  it is too venturous to charge a passage in shakspeare with want of truth to nature and yet at first sight this speech of olivers expresses truths which it seems almost impossible that any mind should so distinctly so livelily and so voluntarily have presented to itself in connection with feelings and intentions so malignant and so contrary to those which the qualities expressed would naturally have called forth but i dare not say that this seeming unnaturalness is not in the nature of an abused wilfulness when united with a strong intellect in such characters there is sometimes a gloomy selfgratification in making the absoluteness of the will sit pro ratione voluntas evident to themselves by setting the reason and the conscience in full array

bedimmed and overwhelmed spirit recked not of its own immortality still to seek to beto be a mind a will  as fame is to reputation so heaven is to an estate or immediate advantage the difference is that the selflove of the former cannot exist but by a complete suppression and habitual supplantation of immediate selfishness in one point of view the miser is more estimable than the spendthriftonly that the misers present feelings are as much of the present as the spendthrifts but caeteris paribus that is upon the supposition that whatever is good or lovely in the one coexists equally in the other then doubtless the master of the present is less a selfish being an animal than he who lives for the moment with no inheritance in the future whatever can degrade man is supposed in the latter case whatever can elevate him in the former and as to selfstrange and generous self that can only be such a self by a complete divestment of all that men call selfof all that can make it either practically to others or consciously to the individual himself different from the human race in its ideal such self is but a perpetual religion an inalienable acknowledgment of god the sole basis and

there can be little doubt of mr tyrwhitts emendations of courtiers and king as to the senseonly it is not impossible that shakspeares dramatic language may allow of the word brows or faces being understood after the word courtiers which might then remain in the genitive case plural but the nominative plural makes excellent sense and is sufficiently elegant and sounds to my ear shakspearian what however is meant by our bloods no more obey the heavensdr johnsons assertion that bloods signify countenances is i think mistaken both in the thought conveyedfor it was never a popular belief that the stars governed mens countenances and in the usage which requires an antithesis of the bloodor the temperament of the four humours choler melancholy phlegm and the red globules or the sanguine portion which was supposed not to be in our own power but to be dependent on the influences of the heavenly bodiesand the countenances which are in our power really though from flattery we bring them into a no less apparent dependence on the sovereign than the former are in actual dependence on the constellations  i have sometimes thought that the word courtiers was a misprint for countenances arising from an anticipation by foreglance of the compositors eye of the word courtier a few lines below the written r is easily and often confounded with the written n the compositor read the first syllable court andhis eye at the same time catching the word courtier lower downhe completed the word without reconsulting the copy it is not unlikely that shakspeare intended first to express generally the same thought which a little afterwards he repeats with a particular application to the persons meanta common usage of the pronominal our where the speaker does not really mean to include himself and the word you is an additional confirmation of the our being used in this place for men generally and indefinitely just as you do not meet is the same as one does not meet  act i sc 2

dr farmers umberd which i had proposed before i ever heard of its having been already offered by him but i do not adopt his interpretation of the word which i think is not derived from umbra a shade

has occurred to me just barely worth mentioningthat the twinnd stones are the augrim stones upon the numberd beech that is the astronomical tables of beechwood  act v sc 5     sooth when as a lions whelp c   it is not easy to conjecture why shakspeare should have introduced this ludicrous scroll which answers no one purpose either propulsive or explicatory unless as a joke on etymology       titus andronicus  act i sc 1 theobalds note   i never heard it so much as intimated that he shakspeare had turned his genius to stagewriting before he associated with the players and became one of their body   that shakspeare never turned his genius to stage writing as theobald most theobaldice phrases it before he became an actor is an assertion of about as much authority as the precious story that he left stratford for deerstealing and that he lived by holding gentlemens horses at the doors of the theatre and other trash of that archgossip old aubrey the metre is an argument against titus andronicus being shakspeares worth a score such chronological surmises yet i incline to think that both in this play and in jeronymo shakspeare wrote some passages and that they are the earliest of his compositions  act v sc 2  i think it not improbable that the lines from     i am not mad i know thee well enough      so thou destroy rapine and   murder there   were written by shakspeare in his earliest period but instead of the text            revenge which makes the foul offender quake    tit art thou revenge and art thou sent to me   the words in italics between underscores ought to be omitted      troilus and cressida   mr pope after dryden informs us that the story of troilus and cressida was originally the work of one lollius a lombard but dryden goes yet further he declares it to have been written in latin verse and that chaucer translated itlollius was a historiographer of urbino in italy note in stockdales edition 1807   lollius was a historiographer of urbino in italy so affirms the notary to whom the sieur stockdale committed the disfacimento of ayscoughs excellent edition of shakspeare pity that the researchful notary has not either told us in what century and of what history he was a writer or been simply content to depose that lollius if a writer of that name existed at all was a somewhat somewhere the notary speaks of the troy boke or lydgate printed in 1513 i have never seen it but i deeply regret that chalmers did not substitute the whole of lydgates works from the mss extant for the almost worthless gower  the troilus and cressida of shakspeare can scarcely be classed with his dramas of greek and roman history but it forms an intermediate link between the fictitious greek and roman histories which we may call legendary dramas and the proper ancient histories that is between the pericles or titus andronicus and the coriolanus or julius caesar cymbeline is a congener with pericles and distinguished from lear by not having any declared prominent object but where shall we class the timon of athens perhaps immediately below lear it is a lear of the satirical drama a lear of domestic or ordinary lifea local eddy of passion on the high road of society while all around is the weekday goings on of wind and weather a lear therefore without its soulsearching flashes its earcleaving thunderclaps its meteoric splendorswithout the contagion and the fearful sympathies of nature the fates the furies the frenzied elements dancing in and out now breaking through and scatteringnow hand in hand withthe fierce or fantastic group of human passions crimes and anguishes reeling on the unsteady ground in a wild harmony to the shock and the swell of an earthquake but my present subject was troilus and cressida and i suppose that scarcely knowing what to say of it i by a cunning of instinct ran off to subjects on which i should find it difficult not to say too much though certain after all that i should still leave the better part unsaid and the gleaning for others richer than my own harvest  indeed there is no one of shakspeares plays harder to characterize the name and the remembrances connected with it prepare us for the representation of attachment no less faithful than fervent on the side of the youth and of sudden and shameless inconstancy on the part of the lady and this is indeed as the gold thread on which the scenes are strung though often kept out of sight and out of mind by gems of greater value than itself but as shakspeare calls forth nothing from the mausoleum of history or the catacombs of tradition without giving or eliciting some permanent and general interest and brings forward no subject which he does not moralize or intellectualizeso here he has drawn in cressida the portrait of a vehement passion that having its true origin and proper cause in warmth of temperament fastens on rather than fixes to some one object by liking and temporary preference     theres language in her eye her cheek her lip   nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out   at every joint and motive of her body   this shakspeare has contrasted with the profound affection represented in troilus and alone worthy the name of loveaffection passionate indeedswoln with the confluence of youthful instincts and youthful fancy and growing in the radiance of hope newly risen in short enlarged by the collective sympathies of naturebut still having a depth of calmer element in a will stronger than desire more entire than choice and which gives permanence to its own act by converting it into faith and duty hence with excellent judgment and with an excellence higher than mere judgment can give at the close of the play when cressida has sunk into infamy below retrieval and beneath hope the same will which had been the substance and the basis of his love while the restless pleasures and passionate longings like seawaves had tossed but on its surfacethis same moral energy is represented as snatching him aloof from all neighbourhood with her dishonour from all lingering fondness and languishing regrets whilst it rushes with him into other and nobler duties and deepens the channel which his heroic brothers death had left empty for its collected flood yet another secondary and subordinate purpose shakspeare has inwoven with his delineation of these two charactersthat of opposing the inferior civilization but purer morals of the trojans to the refinements deep policy but duplicity and sensual corruptions of the greeks  to all this however so little comparative projection is givennay the masterly group of agamemnon nestor and ulysses and still more in advance that of achilles ajax and thersites so manifestly occupy the foreground that the subservience and vassalage of strength and animal courage to intellect and policy seems to be the lesson most often in our poets view and which he has taken little pains to connect with the former more interesting moral impersonated in the titular hero and heroine of the drama but i am half inclined to believe that shakspeares main object or shall i rather say his ruling impulse was to translate the poetic heroes of paganism into the not less rude but more intellectually vigorous and more featurely warriors of christian chivalryand to substantiate the distinct and graceful profiles or outlines of the homeric epic into the flesh and blood of the romantic dramain short to give a grand historypiece in the robust style of albert durer  the character of thersites in particular well deserves a more careful examination as the caliban of demagogic lifethe admirable portrait of intellectual power deserted by all grace all moral principle all not momentary impulsejust wise enough to detect the weak head and fool enough to provoke the armed fist of his bettersone whom malcontent achilles can inveigle from malcontent ajax under the one condition that he shall be called on to do nothing but abuse and slander and that he shall be allowed to abuse as much and as purulently as he likes that is as he canin short a mulequarrelsome by the original discord of his naturea slave by tenure of his own basenessmade to bray and be brayed at to despise and be despicable aye sir but say what you will he is a very clever fellow though the best friends will fall out there was a time when ajax thought he deserved to have a statue of gold erected to him and handsome achilles at the head of the myrmidons gave no little credit to his friend thersites  act iv sc 5 speech of ulysses     o these

interpretation the sense now is that give welcome to a salute ere it comes      coriolanus  this play illustrates the wonderfully philosophic impartiality of shakspeares politics his own countrys history furnished him with no matter but what was too recent to be devoted to patriotism besides he knew that the instruction of ancient history would seem more dispassionate in coriolanus and julius

two so balanced each other that he could decide for the first by equipoise naythe thought growingthat honor had more weight than death that cassius understood it as warburton is the beauty of cassius as contrasted with brutus  ib caesars speech                          he loves no plays   as thou dost antony he hears no music c  this is not a trivial observation nor does our poet mean barely by it that cassius was not a merry sprightly man but that he had not a due temperament of harmony in his disposition theobalds note   o theobald what a commentator wast thou when thou wouldst affect to

how that might change his nature theres the question       and to speak truth of cæsar   i have not known when his affections swayd   more than his reasonso cæsar may   then lest he may prevent   this speech is singularat least i do not at present see into shakspeares motive his rationale or in what point of view he meant brutus character to appear for surelythis i mean is what i say to myself with my present quantum of insight only modified by my experience in how many instances i have ripened into a perception of beauties where i had before descried faults surely nothing can seem more discordant with our historical preconceptions of brutus or more lowering to the intellect of the stoicoplatonic tyrannicide than the tenets here attributed to himto him the stern roman republican namelythat he would have no objection to a king or to cæsar a monarch in rome would cæsar but be as good a monarch as he now seems disposed to be how too could brutus say that he found no personal causenone in cæsars past conduct as a man had he not passed the rubicon had he not entered rome as a conqueror had he not placed his gauls in the senateshakspeare it may be said has not brought these things forwardstrueand this is just the ground of my perplexity what character did shakspeare mean his brutus to be  ib speech of brutus     for if thou path thy native semblance on   surely there need be no scruple in treating this path as a mere misprint or misscript for put in what place does shakspearewhere does any other writer of the same ageuse path as a verb for walk  ib sc 2 caesars speech     she dreamt last night she saw my statue   no doubt it should be statua as in the same age they more often pronounced heroes as a trisyllable than dissyllable a modern tragic poet would have written     last night she dreamt that she my statue saw   but shakspeare never avails himself of the supposed license of transposition merely for the metre there is always some logic either of thought or passion to justify it  act iii sc 1 antonys speech     pardon me juliushere wast thou bayd brave hart   here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand   signd in thy spoil and crimsond in thy death   o world thou wast the forest to this hart   and this indeed o world the heart of thee   i doubt the genuineness of the last two linesnot because they are vile but first on account of the rhythm which is not shakspearian but just the very tune of some old play from which the actor might have interpolated themand secondly because they interrupt not only the sense and connection but likewise the flow both of the passion and what is with me still more decisive of the shakspearian link of association as with many another parenthesis or gloss slipt into the text we have only to read the passage without it to see that it never was in it i venture to say there is no instance in shakspeare fairly like this conceits he has but they not only rise out of some word in the lines before but also lead to the thought in the lines following here the conceit is a mere alien antony forgets an image when he is even touching it and then recollects it when the thought last in his mind must have led him away from it  act iv sc 3 speech of brutus                        what shall one of us   that struck the foremost man of all this world   but for supporting robbers   this seemingly strange assertion of brutus is unhappily verified in the present day what is an immense army in which the lust of plunder has quenched all the duties of the citizen other than a horde of robbers or differenced only as fiends are from ordinarily reprobate men caesar supported and was supported by such as theseand even so buonaparte in our days  i know no part of shakspeare that more impresses on me the belief of his genius being superhuman than this scene between brutus and cassius in the gnostic heresy it might have been credited with less absurdity than most of their dogmas that the supreme had employed him to create previously to his function of representing characters      antony and cleopatra  shakspeare can be complimented only by comparison with himself all other eulogies are either heterogeneous as when they are in reference to spenser or milton or they are flat truisms as when he is gravely preferred to corneille racine or even his own immediate successors beaumont and fletcher massinger and the rest the highest praise or rather form of praise of this play which i can offer in my own mind is the doubt which the perusal always occasions in me whether the antony and cleopatra is not in all exhibitions of a giant power in its strength and vigour of maturity a formidable rival of macbeth lear hamlet and othello feliciter audax is the motto for its style comparatively with that of shakspeares other works even as it is the general motto of all his works compared with those of other poets be it remembered too that this happy valiancy of style is but the representative and result of all the material excellencies so expressed  this play should be perused in mental contrast with romeo and julietas the love of passion and appetite opposed to the love of affection and instinct but the art displayed in the character of cleopatra is profound in this especially that the sense of criminality in her passion is lessened by our insight into its depth and energy at the very moment that we cannot but perceive that the passion itself springs out of the habitual craving of a licentious nature and that it is supported and reinforced by voluntary stimulus and soughtfor associations instead of blossoming out of spontaneous emotion  of all shakspeares historical plays antony and cleopatra is by far the most wonderful there is not one in which he has followed history so minutely and yet there are few in which he impresses the notion of angelic strength so muchperhaps none in which he impresses it more strongly this is greatly owing to the manner in which the fiery force is sustained throughout and to the numerous momentary flashes of nature counteracting the historic abstraction as a wonderful specimen of the way in which shakspeare lives up to the very end of this play read the last part of the concluding scene and if you would feel the judgment as well as the genius of shakspeare in your hearts core compare this astonishing drama with drydens all for love  act i sc 1 philos speech                                 his captains heart   which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst   the buckles on his breast reneges all temper  it should be reneagues

would be a probable reading if the scene opening had discovered antony with cleopatra on his lap but represented as he is walking and jesting with her fool must be the word warburtons objection is

the editors and commentators are all of them ready enough to cry out against shakspeares laxities and licenses of style forgetting that he is not merely a poet but a dramatic poet that when the head and the heart are swelling with fullness a man does not ask himself whether he has grammatically arranged but only whether the context taken in he has conveyed his meaning deny is here clearly equal

have previously had occasion to speak at large on the subject of the three unities of time place and action as applied to the drama in the abstract and to the particular stage for which shakspeare wrote as far as he can be said to have written for any stage but that of the universal mind i hope i have in some measure succeeded in demonstrating that the former two instead of being rules were mere inconveniences attached to the local peculiarities of the athenian drama that the last alone deserved the name of a principle and that in the preservation of this unity shakspeare stood preeminent yet instead of unity of action i should greatly prefer the more appropriate though scholastic and uncouth words homogeneity proportionateness and totality of interestexpressions which involve the distinction or rather the essential difference betwixt the shaping skill of mechanical talent and the creative productive lifepower of inspired genius in the former each part is separately conceived and then by a succeeding act put togethernot as watches are made for wholesalefor there each part supposes a preconception of the whole in some mindbut more like pictures on a motley screen whence arises the harmony that strikes us in the wildest natural landscapesin the relative shapes of rocks the harmony of colours in the heaths ferns and lichens the leaves of the beech and the oak the stems and rich brown branches of the birch and other mountain trees varying from verging autumn to returning springcompared with the visual effect from the greater number of artificial plantationsfrom this that the natural landscape is effected as it were by a single energy modified ab intra in each component part and as this is the particular excellence of the shakspearian drama generally so is it especially characteristic of the romeo and juliet  the groundwork of the tale is altogether in family life and the events of the play have their first origin in family feuds filmy as are the eyes of partyspirit at once dim and truculent still there is commonly some real or supposed object in view or principle to be maintained and though but the twisted wires on the plate of rosin in the preparation for electrical pictures it is still a guide in some degree an assimilation to an outline but in family quarrels which have proved scarcely less injurious to states wilfulness and precipitancy and passion from mere habit and custom can alone be expected with his accustomed judgment shakspeare has begun by placing before us a lively picture of all the impulses of the play and as nature ever presents two sides one for heraclitus and one for democritus he has by way of prelude shown the laughable absurdity of the evil by the contagion of it reaching the servants who have so little to do with it but who are under the necessity of letting the superfluity of sensoreal power fly off through the escapevalve of witcombats and of quarrelling with weapons of sharper edge all in humble imitation of their masters yet there is a sort of unhired fidelity an ourishness about all this that makes it rest pleasant on ones feelings all the first scene down to the conclusion of the princes speech is a motley dance of all ranks and ages to one tune as if the horn of huon had been playing behind the scenes  benvolios speech     madam an hour before the worshippd sun   peerd forth the golden window of the east   and far more strikingly the following speech of old montague     many a morning hath he there been seen   with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew   prove that shakspeare meant the romeo and juliet to approach to a poem which and indeed its early date may be also inferred from the multitude of rhyming couplets throughout and if we are right from the internal evidence in pronouncing this one of shakspeares early dramas it affords a strong instance of the fineness of his insight into the nature of the passions that romeo is introduced already lovebewildered the necessity of loving creates an object for itself in man and woman and yet there is a difference in this respect between the sexes though only to be known by a perception of it it would have displeased us if juliet had been represented as already in love or as fancying herself sobut no one i believe ever experiences any shock at romeos forgetting his rosaline who had been a mere name for the yearning of his youthful imagination and rushing into his passion for juliet rosaline was a mere creation of his fancy and we should remark the boastful positiveness of romeo in a love of his own making which is never shown where love is really near the heart     when the devout religion of mine eye   maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fires      one fairer than my love the allseeing sun   neer saw her match since first the world begun   the character of the nurse is the nearest of any thing in shakspeare to a direct borrowing from mere observation and the reason is that as in infancy and childhood the individual in nature is a representative of a class just as in describing one larch tree you generalize a grove of themso it is nearly as much so in old age the generalization is done to the poets hand here you have the garrulity of age strengthened by the feelings of a longtrusted servant whose sympathy with the mothers affections gives her privileges and rank in the household and observe the mode of connection by accidents of time and place and the childlike fondness of repetition in a second childhood and also that happy humble ducking under yet constant resurgence against the check of her superiors    yes madamyet i cannot choose but laugh c   in the fourth scene we have mercutio introduced to us o how shall i describe that exquisite ebullience and overflow of youthful life wafted on over the laughing waves of pleasure and prosperity as a wanton beauty that distorts the face on which she knows her lover is gazing enraptured and wrinkles her forehead in the triumph of its smoothness wit ever wakeful fancy busy and procreative as an insect courage an easy mind that without cares of its own is at once disposed to laugh away those of others and yet to be interested in themthese and all congenial qualities melting into the common copula of them all the man of rank and the gentleman with all its excellencies and all its weaknesses constitute the character of mercutio   act i sc 5    tyb it fits when such a villain is a guest ill not endure him    cap he shall be endurd          what goodman boyi say he shallgo to

this enchanting scene of the contrast of romeos love with his former fancy and weigh the skill shown in justifying him from his inconstancy by making us feel the difference of his passion yet this too

of the tempest i do not know a more wonderful instance of shakspeares mastery in playing a distinctly rememberable variety on the same remembered air than in the transporting loveconfessions of romeo and juliet and ferdinand and miranda there seems more passion in the one and more dignity in the other yet you feel that the sweet girlish lingering and busy movement of juliet and the calmer and more maidenly fondness of miranda might easily pass into each other  ib sc 3 the friars speech  the reverend character of the friar like all shakspeares representations of the great professions is very

separate characters agitated by one and the same circumstance it is difficult to understand what effect whether that of pity or of laughter shakspeare meant to producethe occasion and the

spring and the winter meetwinter assumes the character of spring and spring the sadness of winter      shakspeares english historical plays  the first form of poetry is the epic the essence of which may be stated as the successive in events and characters this must be distinguished from narration in which there must always be a narrator from whom the objects represented receive a coloring and a mannerwhereas in the epic as in the so called poems of homer the whole is completely objective and the representation is a pure reflection the next form into which poetry passed was the dramaticboth forms having a common basis with a certain difference and that difference not consisting in the dialogue alone both are founded on the relation of providence to the human will and this relation is the universal element expressed under different points of view according to the difference of religions and the moral and intellectual cultivation of different nations in the epic poem fate is represented as overruling the will and making it instrumental to the accomplishment of its designs    greek transliterateddios de teleieto boulae  in the drama the will is exhibited as struggling with fate a great and beautiful instance and illustration of which is the prometheus of Æschylus and the deepest effect is produced when the fate is represented as a higher and intelligent will and the opposition of the individual as springing from a defect  in order that a drama may be properly historical it is necessary that it should be the history of the people to whom it is addressed in the composition care must be taken that there appear no dramatic improbability as the reality is taken for granted it must likewise be poeticalthat only i mean must be taken which is the permanent in our nature which is common and therefore deeply interesting to all ages the events themselves are immaterial otherwise than as the clothing and manifestation of the spirit that is working within in this mode the unity resulting from succession is destroyed but is supplied by a unity of a higher order which connects the events by reference to the workers gives a reason for them in the motives and presents men in their causative character it takes therefore that part of real history which is the least known and infuses a principle of life and organization into the naked facts and makes them all the framework of an animated whole  in my happier days while i had yet hope and onwardlooking thoughts i planned an historical drama of king stephen in the manner of shakspeare indeed it would be desirable that some man of dramatic genius should dramatize all those omitted by shakspeare as far down as henry vii perkin warbeck would make a most interesting drama a few scenes of marlows edward ii might be preserved after henry viii the events are too well and distinctly known to be without plump inverisimilitude crowded together in one nights exhibition whereas the history of our ancient kingsthe events of their reigns i meanare like stars in the skywhatever the real interspaces may be and however great they seem close to each other the starsthe eventsstrike us and remain in our eye little modified by the difference of dates an historic drama is therefore a collection of events borrowed from history but connected together in respect of cause and time poetically and by dramatic fiction it would be a fine national custom to act such a series of dramatic histories in orderly succession in the yearly christmas holidays and could not but tend to counteract that mock cosmopolitism which under a positive term really implies nothing but a negation of or indifference to the particular love of our country by its nationality must every nation retain its independencei mean a nationality quoad the nation better thusnationality in each individual quoad his country is equal to the sense of individuality quoad himself but himself as subsensuous and central patriotism is equal to the sense of individuality reflected from every other individual there may come a higher virtue in bothjust cosmopolitism but this latter is not possible but by antecedence of the former  shakspeare has included the most important part of nine reigns in his historical dramasnamelyking john richard iihenry iv twohenry vhenry vi three including edward v and henry viii in all ten plays there remain therefore to be done with exception of a single scene or two that should be adopted from marloweleven reignsof which the first two appear the only unpromising subjectsand those two dramas must be formed wholly or mainly of invented private stories which however could not have happened except in consequence of the events and measures of these reigns and which should furnish opportunity both of exhibiting the manners and oppressions of the times and of narrating dramatically the great eventsif possiblethe death of the two sovereigns at least of the latter should be made to have some influence on the finale of the story all the rest are glorious subjects especially henry 1st being the struggle between the men of arms and of letters in the persons of henry and becket stephen

prefer the old text the word devil implies fiery you need only read the line laying a full and strong emphasis on devil to perceive the uselessness and tastelessness of warburtons alteration      richard ii  i have stated that the transitional link between the epic poem and the drama is the historic drama that in the epic poem a preannounced fate gradually adjusts and employs the will and the events as its instruments whilst the drama on the other hand places fate and will in opposition to each other and is then most perfect when the victory of fate is obtained in consequence of imperfections in the opposing will so as to leave a final impression that the fate itself is but a higher and a more intelligent will  from the length of the speeches and the circumstance that with one exception the events are all historical and presented in their results not produced by acts seen by or taking place before the audience this tragedy is ill suited to our present large theatres but in itself and for the closet i feel no hesitation in placing it as the first and most admirable of all shakspeares purely historical plays for the two parts of henry iv form a species of themselves which may be named the mixed drama the distinction does not depend on the mere quantity of historical events in the play compared with the fictions for there is as much history in macbeth as in richard but in the relation of the history to the plot  in the purely historical plays the history forms the plot in the mixed it directs it in the rest as macbeth hamlet cymbeline lear it subserves it but however unsuited to the stage this drama may be god forbid that even there it should fall dead on the hearts of jacobinized englishmen then indeed we might saypræteriit gloria mundi for the spirit of patriotic reminiscence is the allpermeating soul of this noble work it is perhaps the most purely historical of shakspeares dramas there are not in it as in the others characters introduced merely for the purpose of giving a greater individuality and realness as in the comic parts of henry iv by presenting as it were our very selves shakspeare avails himself of every opportunity to effect the great object of the historic drama that namely of familiarizing the people to the great names of their country and thereby of exciting a steady patriotism a love of just liberty and a respect for all those fundamental institutions of social life which bind men together     this royal throne of kings this scepterd isle   this earth of majesty this seat of mars   this other eden demiparadise   this fortress built by nature for herself   against infection and the hand of war   this happy breed of men this little world   this precious stone set in the silver sea   which serves it in the office of a wall   or as a moat defensive to a home   against the envy of less happier lands   this blessed plot this earth this realm this england   this nurse this teeming womb of royal kings   feard by their breed and famous by their birth c   add the famous passage in king john     this england never did nor ever shall   lie at the proud foot of a conqueror   but when it first did help to wound itself   now these her princes are come home again   come the three corners of the world in arms   and we shall shock them nought shall make us rue   if england to itself do rest but true   and it certainly seems that shakspeares historic dramas produced a very deep effect on the minds of the english people and in earlier times they were familiar even to the least informed of all ranks according to the relation of bishop corbett marlborough we know was not ashamed to confess that his principal acquaintance with english history was derived from them and i believe that a large part of the information as to our old names and achievements even now abroad is due directly or indirectly to shakspeare  admirable is the judgment with which shakspeare always in the first scenes prepares yet how naturally and with what concealment of art for the catastrophe observe how he here presents the germ of all the after events in richards insincerity partiality arbitrariness and favoritism and in the proud tempestuous temperament of his barons in the very beginning also is displayed that feature in richards character which is never forgotten throughout the playhis attention to decorum and high feeling of the kingly dignity these anticipations show with what judgment shakspeare wrote and illustrate his care to connect the past and future and unify them with the present by forecast and reminiscence  it is interesting to a critical ear to compare the six opening lines of the play     old john of gaunt timehonord lancaster   hast thou according to thy oath and band c   each closing at the tenth syllable with the rhythmless metre of the verse in henry vi and titus andronicus in order that the difference indeed the heterogeneity of the two may be felt etiam in simillimis prima superficie here the weight of the single words supplies all the relief afforded by intercurrent verse while the whole represents the mood and compare the apparently defective metre of bolingbrokes first line     many years of happy days befall   with prosperos     twelve years since miranda twelve years since   the actor should supply the time by emphasis and pause on the first syllable of each of these verses  act i sc 1 bolingbrokes speech     first heaven be the record to my speech   in the devotion of a subjects love c   i remember in the sophoclean drama no more striking example of the greek transliterated to prepon kai semnon than this speech and the rhymes in the last six lines well express the preconcertedness of bolingbrokes scheme so beautifully contrasted with the vehemence and sincere irritation of mowbray  ib bolingbrokes speech     which blood like sacrificing abels cries   even from the tongueless caverns of the earth   to me for justice and rough chastisement   note the greek transliterated deinhon of this to me which is evidently felt by richard     how high a pitch his resolution soars   and the affected depreciation afterwards     as he is but my fathers brothers son   ib mowbrays speech     in haste whereof most heartily i pray   your highness to assign our trial day   the occasional interspersion of rhymes and the more frequent winding up of a speech therewithwhat purpose was this designed to answer in the earnest drama i mean deliberateness an attempt as in mowbray to collect himself and be cool at the closei can see that in the following speeches the rhyme answers the end of the greek chorus and distinguishes the general truths from the passions of the dialogue but this does not exactly justify the practice which is unfrequent in proportion to the excellence of shakspeares plays one thing however is to be observedthat the speakers are historical known and so far formal characters and their reality is already a fact this should be borne in mind the whole of this scene of the quarrel between mowbray and bolingbroke seems introduced for the purpose of showing by anticipation the characters of richard and bolingbroke in the latter there is observable a decorous and courtly checking of his anger in subservience to a predetermined plan especially in his calm speech after receiving sentence of banishment compared with mowbrays unaffected lamentation in the one all is ambitious hope of something yet to come in the other it is desolation and a looking backward of the heart  ib sc 2    gaunt

       an angry arm against his minister   without the hollow extravagance of beaumont and fletchers ultraroyalism how carefully does shakspeare acknowledge and reverence the eternal distinction between the mere individual and the symbolic or representative on which all genial law no less than patriotism depends the whole of this second scene commences and is anticipative of the tone and character of the play at large  ib sc 3 in none of shakspeares fictitious dramas or in those founded on a history as unknown to his auditors generally as fiction is this violent rupture of the

kingly manners of richard yet by well managed anticipations leading us on to the full gratification of pleasure in our own penetration in this scene a new light is thrown on richards character until now he has appeared in all the beauty of royalty but here as soon as he is left to himself the inherent weakness of his character is immediately shown it is a weakness however of a peculiar kind not arising from want of personal courage or any specific defect of faculty but rather an intellectual feminineness which feels a necessity of ever leaning on the breast of others and of reclining on those who are all the while known to be inferiors to this must be attributed as its consequences all richards vices his tendency to concealment and his cunning the whole operation of which is directed to the getting rid of present difficulties richard is not meant to be a debauchee but we see in him that sophistry which is common to man by which we can deceive our own hearts and at one and the same time apologize for and yet commit the error shakspeare has represented this character in a very peculiar manner he has not made him amiable with counterbalancing faults but has openly and broadly drawn those faults without reserve relying on richards disproportionate sufferings and gradually emergent good qualities for our sympathy and this was possible because his faults are not positive vices but spring entirely from defect of character  act ii sc 1     k rich can sick men play so nicely with their names   yes on a deathbed there is a feeling which may make all things appear but as puns and equivocations and a passion there is that carries off its own excess by plays on words as naturally and therefore as appropriately to drama as by gesticulations looks or tones this belongs to human nature as such independently of associations and habits from any particular rank of life or mode of employment and in this consist shakspeares vulgarisms as in macbeths     the devil damn thee black thou creamfacd loon c   this is to equivocate on dantes words in truth the nobile volgare eloquenza indeed it is profoundly true that there is a natural an almost irresistible tendency in the mind when immersed in one strong feeling to connect that feeling with every sight and object around it especially if there be opposition and the words addressed to it are in any way repugnant to the feeling itself as here in the instance of richards unkind language     misery makes sport to mock itself   no doubt something of shakspeares punning must be attributed to his age in which direct and formal combats of wit were a favourite pastime of the courtly and accomplished it was an age more favourable upon the whole to vigour of intellect than the present in which a dread of being thought pedantic dispirits and flattens the energies of original minds but independently of this i have no hesitation in saying that a pun if it be congruous with the feeling of the scene is not only allowable in the dramatic dialogue but oftentimes one of the most effectual intensives of passion  ib     k rich right you say true as herefords love so his              as theirs so mine and all be as it is   the depth of this compared with the first scene     how high a pitch c   there is scarcely anything in shakspeare in its degree more admirably drawn than yorks characterhis religious loyalty struggling with a deep grief and indignation at the kings follies his adherence to his word and faith once given in spite of all even the most natural feelings you see in him the weakness of old age and the overwhelmingness of circumstances for a time surmounting his sense of dutythe junction of both exhibited in his boldness in words and feebleness in immediate act and then again his effort to retrieve himself in abstract loyalty even at the heavy price of the loss of his son this species of accidental and adventitious weakness is brought into parallel with richards continually increasing energy of thought and as constantly diminishing power of actingand thus it is richard that breathes a harmony and a relation into all the characters of the play  ib sc 2     queen to please the king i did to please myself            i cannot do it yet i know no cause            why i should welcome such a guest as grief            save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest            as my sweet richard yet again methinks            some unborn sorrow ripe in sorrows womb            is coming toward me and my inward soul            with nothing trembles at something it grieves            more than with parting from my lord the king   it is clear that shakspeare never meant to represent richard as a vulgar debauchee but a man with a wantonness of spirit in external show a feminine friendism an intensity of womanlike love of those immediately about him and a mistaking of the delight of being loved by him for a love of him and mark in this scene shakspeares gentleness in touching the tender superstitions the terræ incognitæ of presentiments in the human mind and how sharp a line of distinction he commonly draws between these obscure forecastings of general experience in each individual and the vulgar errors of mere tradition indeed it may be taken once for all as the truth that shakspeare in the absolute universality of his genius always reverences whatever arises out of our moral nature he never profanes his muse with a contemptuous reasoning away of the genuine and general however unaccountable feelings of mankind  the amiable part of richards character is brought full upon us by his queens few words          so sweet a guest   as my sweet richard   and shakspeare has carefully shown in him an intense love of his country wellknowing how that feeling would in a pure historic drama redeem him in the hearts of the audience yet even in this love there is something feminine and personal     dear earth i do salute thee with my hand  as a long parted mother with her child   plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting   so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth   and do thee favour with my royal hands   with this is combined a constant overflow of emotions from a total incapability of controlling them and thence a waste of that energy which should have been reserved for actions in the passion and effort of mere resolves and menaces the consequence is moral exhaustion and rapid alternations of unmanly despair and ungrounded hopeevery feeling being abandoned for its direct opposite upon the pressure of external accident and yet when richards inward weakness appears to seek refuge in his despair and his exhaustion counterfeits repose the old habit of kingliness the effect of flatterers from his infancy is ever and anon producing in him a sort of wordy courage which only serves to betray more clearly his internal impotence the second and third scenes of the third act combine and illustrate all this     aumerle he means my lord

bloody here              but when from under this terrestrial ball              he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines              and darts his light through every guilty hole

histories how beautiful an islet of reposea melancholy repose indeedis this scene with the gardener and his servant and how truly affecting and realizing is the incident of the very horse barbary in the scene with the groom in the last act     groom   i was a poor groom of thy stable king              when thou wert king who travelling towards york              with much ado at length have gotten

instance how shakspeare makes one play introductory to another for it is evidently a preparation for henry iv as gloster in the third part of henry vi is for richard iii  i would once more remark upon the exalted idea of the only true loyalty developed in this noble and impressive play we have neither the rants of beaumont and fletcher nor the sneers of massingerthe vast importance of the personal character of the sovereign is distinctly enounced whilst at the same time the genuine sanctity which surrounds him is attributed to and grounded on the position in which he stands as the convergence and exponent of the life and power of the state  the great end of the body politic appears to be to humanize and assist in the progressiveness of the animal manbut the problem is so complicated with contingencies as to render it nearly impossible to lay down rules for the formation of a state and should we be able to form a system of government which should so balance its different powers as to form a check upon each and so continually remedy and correct itself it would nevertheless defeat its own aimfor man is destined to be guided by higher principles by universal views which can never be fulfilled in this state of existenceby a spirit of progressiveness which can never be accomplished for then it would cease to be platos republic is like bunyans town of mansoula description of an individual all of whose faculties are in their proper subordination and interdependence and this it is assumed may be the prototype of the state as one great individual but there is this sophism in it that it is forgotten that the human faculties indeed are parts and not separate things but that you could never get chiefs who were wholly reason ministers who were wholly understanding soldiers all

judice      richard iii  this play should be contrasted with richard ii pride of intellect is the characteristic of richard carried to the extent of even boasting to his own mind of his villany whilst others are present to feed his pride of superiority as in his first speech act ii sc 1 shakspeare here as in all his great parts developes in a tone of sublime morality the dreadful consequences of placing the moral in subordination to the mere intellectual being in richard there is a predominance of irony accompanied with apparently blunt manners to those immediately about him but formalized into a more set hypocrisy towards the people as represented by their magistrates      lear  of all shakspeares plays macbeth is the most rapid hamlet the slowest in movement lear combines length with rapiditylike the hurricane and the whirlpool absorbing while it advances it begins as a stormy day in summer with brightness but that brightness is lurid and anticipates the tempest  it was not without forethought nor is it without its due significance that the division of lears kingdom is in the first six lines of the play stated as a thing already determined in all its particulars previously to the trial of professions as the relative rewards of which the daughters were to be made to consider their several portions the strange yet by no means unnatural mixture of selfishness sensibility and habit of feeling derived from and fostered by the particular rank and usages of the individualthe intense desire of being intensely belovedselfish and yet characteristic of the selfishness of a loving and kindly nature alonethe selfsupportless leaning for all pleasure on anothers breastthe craving after sympathy with a prodigal disinterestedness frustrated by its own ostentation and the mode and nature of its claimsthe anxiety the distrust the jealousy which more or less accompany all selfish affections and are amongst the surest contradistinctions of mere fondness from true love and which originate lears eager wish to enjoy his daughters violent professions whilst the inveterate habits of sovereignty convert the wish into claim and positive right and an incompliance with it into crime and treasonthese facts these passions these moral verities on which the whole tragedy is founded are all prepared for and will to the retrospect be found implied in these first four or five lines of the play they let us know that the trial is but a trick and that the grossness of the old kings rage is in part the natural result of a silly trick suddenly and most unexpectedly baffled and disappointed  it may here be worthy of notice that lear is the only serious performance of shakspeare the interest and situations of which are derived from the assumption of a gross improbability whereas beaumont and fletchers tragedies are almost all of them founded on some out of the way accident or exception to the general experience of mankind but observe the matchless judgment of our shakspeare first improbable as the conduct of lear is in the first scene yet it was an old story rooted in the popular faitha thing taken for granted already and consequently without any of the effects of improbability secondly it is merely the canvass for the characters and passionsa mere occasion forand not in the manner of beaumont and fletcher perpetually recurring as the cause and sine qua non ofthe incidents and emotions let the first scene of this play have been lost and let it only be understood that a fond father had been duped by hypocritical professions of love and duty on the part of two daughters to disinherit the third previously and deservedly more dear to himand all the rest of the tragedy would retain its interest undiminished and be perfectly intelligible the accidental is nowhere the groundwork of the passions but that which is catholic which in all ages has been and ever will be close and native to the heart of manparental anguish from filial ingratitude the genuineness of worth though coffined in bluntness and the execrable vileness of a smooth iniquity perhaps i ought to have added the merchant of venice but here too the same remarks apply it was an old tale and substitute any other danger than that of the pound of flesh the circumstance in which the improbability lies yet all the situations and the emotions appertaining to them remain equally excellent and appropriate whereas take away from the mad lover of beaumont and fletcher the fantastic hypothesis of his engagement to cut out his own heart and have it presented to his mistress and all the main scenes must go with it  kotzebue is the german beaumont and fletcher without their poetic powers and without their vis comica but like them he always deduces his situations and passions from marvellous accidents and the trick of bringing one part of our moral nature to counteract another as our pity for misfortune and admiration of generosity and courage to combat our condemnation of guilt as in adultery robbery and other heinous crimesand like them too he excels in his mode of telling a story clearly and interestingly in a series of dramatic dialogues only the trick of making tragedyheroes and heroines out of shopkeepers and barmaids was too low for the age and too unpoetic for the genius of beaumont and fletcher inferior in every respect as they are to their great predecessor and contemporary how inferior would they have appeared had not shakspeare existed for them to imitatewhich in every play more or less they do and in their tragedies most glaringlyand yeto shame shamethey miss no opportunity of sneering at the divine man and subdetracting from his merits  to return to lear having thus in the fewest words and in a natural reply to as natural a questionwhich yet answers the secondary purpose of attracting our attention to the difference or diversity between the characters of cornwall and albanyprovided the premisses and data as it were for our after insight into the mind and mood of the person whose character passions and sufferings are the main subjectmatter of the playfrom lear the persona patiens of his drama shakspeare passes without delay to the second in importance the chief agent and prime mover and introduces edmund to our acquaintance preparing us with the same felicity of judgment and in the same easy and natural way for his character in the seemingly casual communication of its origin and occasion from the first drawing up of the curtain edmund has stood before us in the united strength and beauty of earliest manhood our eyes have been questioning him gifted as he is with high advantages of person and further endowed by nature with a powerful intellect and a strong energetic will even without any concurrence of circumstances and accident pride will necessarily be the sin that most easily besets him but edmund is also the known and acknowledged son of the princely gloster he therefore has both the germ of pride and the conditions best fitted to evolve and ripen it into a predominant feeling yet hitherto no reason appears why it should be other than the not unusual pride of person talent and birtha pride auxiliary if not akin to many virtues and the natural ally of honorable impulses but alas in his own presence his own father takes shame to himself for the frank avowal that he is his fatherhe has blushed so often to acknowledge him that he is now brazed to it edmund hears the circumstances of his birth spoken of with a most degrading and licentious levityhis mother described as a wanton by her own paramour and the remembrance of the animal sting the low criminal gratifications connected with her wantonness and prostituted beauty assigned as the reason why the whoreson must be acknowledged this and the consciousness of its notoriety the gnawing conviction that every show of respect is an effort of courtesy which recalls while it represses a contrary feelingthis is the ever trickling flow of wormwood and gall into the wounds of pridethe corrosive virus which inoculates pride with a venom not its own with envy hatred and a lust for that power which in its blaze of radiance would hide the dark spots on his discwith pangs of shame personally undeserved and therefore felt as wrongs and with a blind ferment of vindictive working towards the occasions and causes especially towards a brother whose stainless birth and lawful honours were the constant remembrancers of his own debasement and were ever in the way to prevent all chance of its being unknown or overlooked and forgotten add to this that with excellent judgment and provident for the claims of the moral sensefor that which relatively to the drama is called poetic justice and as the fittest means for reconciling the feelings of the spectators to the horrors of glosters after sufferingsat least of rendering them somewhat less unendurable for i will not disguise my conviction that in this one point the tragic in this play has been urged beyond the outermost mark and ne plus ultra of the dramaticshakspeare has precluded all excuse and palliation of the guilt incurred by both the parents of the baseborn edmund by glosters confession that he was at the time a married man and already blest with a lawful heir of his fortunes the mournful alienation of brotherly love occasioned by the law of primogeniture in noble families or rather by the unnecessary distinctions engrafted thereon and this in children of the same stock is still almost proverbial on the continentespecially as i know from my own observation in the south of europeand appears to have been scarcely less common in our own island before the revolution of 1688 if we may judge from the characters and sentiments so frequent in our elder comedies there is the younger brother for instance in beaumont and fletchers play of the scornful lady on the one side and oliver in shakspeares as you like it on the other need it be said how heavy an aggravation in such a case the stain of bastardy must have been were it only that the younger brother was liable to hear his own dishonour and his mothers infamy related by his father with an excusing shrug of the shoulders and in a tone betwixt waggery and shame  by the circumstances here enumerated as so many predisposing causes edmunds character might well be deemed already sufficiently explained and our minds prepared for it but in this tragedy the story or fable constrained shakspeare to introduce wickedness in an outrageous form in the persons of regan and goneril he had read nature too heedfully not to know that courage intellect and strength of character are the most impressive forms of power and that to power in itself without reference to any moral end an inevitable admiration and complacency appertains whether it be displayed in the conquests of a buonaparte or tamerlane or in the foam and the thunder of a cataract but in the exhibition of such a character it was of the highest importance to prevent the guilt from passing into utter monstrositywhich again depends on the presence or absence of causes and temptations sufficient to account for the wickedness without the necessity of recurring to a thorough fiendishness of nature for its origination for such are the appointed relations of intellectual power to truth and of truth to goodness that it becomes both morally and poetically unsafe to present what is admirablewhat our nature compels us to admirein the mind and what is most detestable in the heart as coexisting in the same individual without any apparent connection or any modification of the one by the other that shakspeare has in one instance that of iago approached to this and that he has done it successfully is perhaps the most astonishing proof of his genius and the opulence of its resources but in the present tragedy in which he was compelled to present a goneril and a regan it was most carefully to be avoidedand therefore the only one conceivable addition to the inauspicious influences on the preformation of edmunds character is given in the information that all the kindly counteractions to the mischievous feelings of shame which might have been derived from codomestication with edgar and their common father had been cut off by his absence from home and foreign education from boyhood to the present time and a prospect of its continuance as if to preclude all risk of his interference with the fathers views for the elder and legitimate son   he hath been out nine years and away he shall

love your majesty           according to my bond nor more nor less  there is something of disgust at the ruthless hypocrisy of her sisters and some little faulty admixture of pride and sullenness in cordelias nothing and her tone is well contrived indeed to lessen the glaring absurdity of lears conduct but answers the yet more important purpose of forcing away the attention from the nurserytale the moment it has served its end that of supplying the canvass for the picture this is also materially furthered by kents opposition which displays lears moral incapability of resigning the sovereign power in the very act of disposing of it kent is perhaps the nearest to perfect goodness in all shakspeares characters and yet the most individualized there is an extraordinary charm in his bluntness which is that only of a nobleman arising from a contempt of overstrained courtesy and combined with easy placability where goodness of heart is apparent his passionate affection for and fidelity to lear act on our feelings in lears own favour virtue itself seems to be in company with him  ib sc 2 edmunds speech     who in the lusty stealth of nature take   more composition and fierce quality   than doth c   warburtons note upon a quotation from vanini  poor vaniniany one but warburton would have thought this precious passage more characteristic of mr shandy than of atheism if the fact really were so which it is not but almost the contrary i do not see why the most confirmed theist might not very naturally utter the same wish but it is proverbial that the youngest son in a large family is commonly the man of the greatest talents in it and as good an authority as vanini has saidincalescere in venerem ardentius spei sobolis injuriosum esse  in this speech of edmund you see as soon as a man cannot reconcile himself to reason how his conscience flies off by way of appeal to nature who is sure upon such occasions never to find fault and also how shame sharpens a predisposition in the heart to evil for it is a profound moral that shame will naturally generate guilt the oppressed will be vindictive like shylock and in the anguish of undeserved ignominy the delusion secretly springs up of getting over the moral quality of an action by fixing the mind on the mere physical act alone  ib edmunds speech     this is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in   fortune often the surfeit of our own behaviour we make guilty of   our disasters the sun the moon and the stars c   thus scorn and misanthropy are often the anticipations and mouthpieces of wisdom in the detection of superstitions both individuals and nations may be free from such prejudices by being below them as well as by rising above them  ib sc 3 the steward should be placed in exact antithesis to kent as the only character of utter irredeemable baseness in shakspeare even in this the judgment and invention of the poet are very observablefor what else could the willing tool of a goneril be not a vice but this of baseness was left open to him  ib sc 4 in lear old age is itself a characterits natural imperfections being increased by lifelong habits of receiving a prompt obedience any addition of individuality would have been unnecessary and painful for the relations of others to him of wondrous fidelity and of frightful ingratitude alone sufficiently distinguish him thus lear becomes the open and ample playroom of natures passions  ib     knight since my young ladys going into france sir the fool hath             much pind away   the fool is no comic buffoon to make the groundlings laughno forced condescension of shakspeares genius to the taste of his audience accordingly the poet prepares for his introduction which he never does with any of his common clowns and fools by bringing him into living connection with the pathos of the play he is as wonderful a creation as calibanhis wild babblings and inspired idiocy articulate and gauge the horrors of the scene  the monster goneril prepares what is necessary while the character of albany renders a still more maddening grievance possible namely regan and cornwall in perfect sympathy of monstrosity not a sentiment not an image which can give pleasure on its own account is admitted whenever these creatures are introduced and they are brought forward as little as possible pure horror reigns throughout in this scene and in all the early speeches of lear the one general sentiment of filial ingratitude prevails as the main spring of the feelingsin this early stage the outward object causing the pressure on the mind which is not yet sufficiently familiarized with the anguish for the imagination to work upon it  ib    gon do you mark that my lord    alb i cannot be so partial goneril          to the great love i bear you    gon pray you content c   observe the baffled endeavour of goneril to act on the fears of albany and yet his passiveness his inertia he is not convinced and yet he is afraid of looking into the thing such characters always yield to those who will take the trouble of governing them or for them perhaps the influence of a princess whose choice of him had royalized his state may be some little excuse for albanys weakness ib sc 5    lear o let me not be mad not mad sweet heaven           keep me in temper i would not be mad  the minds

her    all vengeance comes too short c  and yet no reference to the guilt but only to the accident which she uses as an occasion for sneering at her father regan is not in fact a greater monster than goneril but she has the power of casting more venom ib sc 2 cornwalls speech                                   this is some fellow   who having been praised for bluntness doth affect   a saucy roughness c   in thus placing these profound general truths in the mouths of such men as cornwall edmund iago c shakspeare at once gives them utterance and yet shews how indefinite their application is  ib sc 3 edgars assumed madness serves the great purpose of taking off part of the shock which would otherwise be caused by the true madness of lear and further displays the profound difference between the two in every attempt at representing madness throughout the whole range of dramatic literature with the single exception of lear it is mere lightheadedness as especially in otway in edgars ravings shakspeare all the while lets you see a fixed purpose a practical end in view  in lears there is only the brooding of the one anguish an eddy without progression ib sc 4 lears speech    the

the character in the intuition and exposition of which i first made my turn for philosophical criticism and especially for insight into the genius of shakspeare noticed this happened first amongst my acquaintances as sir george beaumont will bear witness and subsequently long before schlegel had delivered at vienna the lectures on shakspeare which he afterwards published i had given on the same subject eighteen lectures substantially the same proceeding from the very same point of view and deducing the same conclusions so far as i either then agreed or now agree with him i gave these lectures at the royal institution before six or seven hundred auditors of rank and eminence in the spring of the same year in which sir humphry davy a fellowlecturer made his great revolutionary discoveries in chemistry even in detail the coincidence of schlegel with my lectures was so extraordinary that all who at a later period heard the same words taken by me from my notes of the lectures at the royal institution concluded a borrowing on my part from schlegel mr hazlitt whose hatred of me is in such an inverse ratio to my zealous kindness towards him as to be defended by his warmest admirer charles lambwho god bless him besides his characteristic obstinacy of adherence to old friends as long at least as they are at all down in the world is linked as by a charm to hazlitts conversationonly as franticmr hazlitt i say himself replied to an assertion of my plagiarism from schlegel in these wordsthat is a lie for i myself heard the very same character of hamlet from coleridge before he went to germany and when he had neither read nor could read a page of german now hazlitt was on a visit to me at my cottage at nether stowey somerset in the summer of the year 1798 in the september of which year i first was out of sight of the shores of great britain recorded by me s t coleridge 7th january 1819  the seeming inconsistencies in the conduct and character of hamlet have long exercised the conjectural ingenuity of critics and as we are always both to suppose that the cause of defective apprehension is in ourselves the mystery has been too commonly explained by the very easy process of setting it down as in fact inexplicable and by resolving the phenomenon into a misgrowth or lusus of the capricious and irregular genius of shakspeare the shallow and stupid arrogance of these vulgar and indolent decisions i would fain do my best to expose i believe the character of hamlet may be traced to shakspeares deep and accurate science in mental philosophy indeed that this character must have some connection with the common fundamental laws of our nature may be assumed from the fact that hamlet has been the darling of every country in which the literature of england has been fostered in order to understand him it is essential that we should reflect on the constitution of our own minds man is distinguished from the brute animals in proportion as thought prevails over sense but in the healthy processes of the mind a balance is constantly maintained between the impressions from outward objects and the inward operations of the intellectfor if there be an overbalance in the contemplative faculty man thereby becomes the creature of mere meditation and loses his natural power of action now one of shakspeares modes of creating characters is to conceive any one intellectual or moral faculty in morbid excess and then to place himself shakspeare thus mutilated or diseased under given circumstances in hamlet he seems to have wished to exemplify the moral necessity of a due balance between our attention to the objects of our senses and our meditation on the workings of our mindsan equilibrium between the real and the imaginary worlds in hamlet this balance is disturbed his thoughts and the images of his fancy are far more vivid than his actual perceptions and his very perceptions instantly passing through the medium of his contemplations acquire as they pass a form and a colour not naturally their own hence we see a great an almost enormous intellectual activity and a proportionate aversion to real action consequent upon it with all its symptoms and accompanying qualities this character shakspeare places in circumstances under which it is obliged to act on the spur of the momenthamlet is brave and careless of death but he vacillates from sensibility and procrastinates from thought and loses the power of action in the energy of resolve thus it is that this tragedy presents a direct contrast to that of macbeth the one proceeds with the utmost slowness the other with a crowded and breathless rapidity  the effect of this overbalance of the imaginative power is beautifully illustrated in the everlasting broodings and superfluous activities of hamlets mind which unseated from its healthy relation is constantly occupied with the world within and abstracted from the world withoutgiving substance to shadows and throwing a mist over all commonplace actualities it is the nature of thought to be indefinitedefiniteness belongs to external imagery alone hence it is that the sense of sublimity arises not from the sight of an outward object but from the beholders reflection upon itnot from the sensuous impression but from the imaginative reflex few have seen a celebrated waterfall without feeling something akin to disappointment it is only subsequently that the image comes back full into the mind and brings with it a train of grand or beautiful associations hamlet feels this his senses are in a state of trance and he looks upon external things as hieroglyphics his soliloquy     o that this too too solid flesh would melt c   springs from that craving after the indefinitefor that which is notwhich most easily besets men of genius and the selfdelusion common to this temper of mind is finely exemplified in the character which hamlet gives of himself                            it cannot be   but i am pigeonlivered and lack gall   to make oppression bitter   he mistakes the seeing his chains for the breaking them delays action till action is of no use and dies the victim of mere circumstance and accident  there is a great significancy in the names of shakspeares plays in the twelfth night midsummer nights dream as you like it and winters tale the total effect is produced by a coordination of the characters as in a wreath of flowers but in coriolanus lear romeo and juliet hamlet othello c the effect arises from the subordination of all to one either as the prominent person or the principal object cymbeline is the only exception and even that has its advantages in preparing the audience for the chaos of time place and costume by throwing the date back into a fabulous kings reign  but as of more importance so more striking is the judgment displayed by our truly dramatic poet as well as poet of the drama in the management of his first scenes with the single exception of cymbeline they either place before us at one glance both the past and the future in some effect which implies the continuance and full agency of its cause as in the feuds and partyspirit of the servants of the two houses in the first scene of romeo and juliet or in the degrading passion for shews and public spectacles and the overwhelming attachment for the newest successful warchief in the roman people already become a populace contrasted with the jealousy of the nobles in julius caesaror they at once commence the action so as to excite a curiosity for the explanation in the following scenes as in the storm of wind and waves and the boatswain in the tempest instead of anticipating our curiosity as in most other first scenes and in too many other first actsor they act by contrast of diction suited to the characters at once to heighten the effect and yet to give a naturalness to the language and rhythm of the principal personages either as that of prospero and miranda by the appropriate lowness of the styleor as in king john by the equally appropriate stateliness of official harangues or narratives so that the after blank verse seems to belong to the rank and quality of the speakers and not to the poetor they strike at once the keynote and give the predominant spirit of the play as in the twelfth night and in macbethor finally the first scene comprises all these advantages at once as in hamlet  compare the easy language of common life in which this drama commences with the direful music and wild wayward rhythm and abrupt lyrics of the opening of macbeth the tone is quite familiarthere is no poetic description of night no elaborate information conveyed by one speaker to another of what both had immediately before their sensessuch as the first distich in addisons cato which is a translation into poetry of past four oclock and a dark morningand yet nothing bordering on the comic on the one hand nor any striving of the intellect on the other it is precisely the language of sensation among men who feared no charge of effeminacy for feeling what they had no want of resolution to bear yet the armour the dead silence the watchfulness that first interrupts it the welcome relief of the guard the cold the broken expressions of compelled attention to bodily feelings still under controlall excellently accord with and prepare for the after gradual rise into tragedybut above all into a tragedy the interest of which is as eminently ad et apud infra as that of macbeth is directly ad extra  in all the best attested stories of ghosts and visions as in that of brutus of archbishop cranmer that of benvenuto cellini recorded by himself and the vision of galileo communicated by him to his favourite pupil torricelli the ghostseers were in a state of cold or chilling damp from without and of anxiety inwardly it has been with all of them as with francisco on his guardalone in the depth and silence of the nighttwas bitter cold and they were sick at heart and not a mouse stirring the attention to minute soundsnaturally associated with the recollection of minute objects and the more familiar and trifling the more impressive from the unusualness of their producing any impression at allgives a philosophic pertinency to this last image but it has likewise its dramatic use and purpose for its commonness in ordinary conversation tends to produce the sense of reality and at once hides the poet and yet approximates the reader or spectator to that state in which the highest poetry will appear and in its component parts though not in the whole composition really is the language of nature if i should not speak it i feel that i should be thinking itthe voice only is the poetsthe words are my own that shakspeare meant to put an effect in the actors power in the very first wordswhos thereis evident from the impatience expressed by the startled francisco in the words that follownay answer me stand and unfold yourself a brave man is never so peremptory as when he fears that he is afraid observe the gradual transition from the silence and the still recent habit of listening in franciscosi think i hear themto the more cheerful call out which a good actor would observe in thestand ho who is there bernardos inquiry after horatio and the repetition of his name and in his own presence indicate a respect or an eagerness that implies him as one of the persons who are in the foreground and the scepticism attributed to him   horatio saystis but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him   prepares us for hamlets after eulogy on him as one whose blood and judgment were happily commingled the actor should also be careful to distinguish the expectation and gladness of bernardos welcome horatio from the mere courtesy of his welcome good marcellus  now observe the admirable indefiniteness of the first opening out of the occasion of all this anxiety the preparation informative of the audience is just as much as was precisely necessary and no moreit begins with the uncertainty appertaining to a question     mar what has this thing appeard again tonight   even the word again has its credibilizing effect then horatio the representative of the ignorance of the audience not himself but by marcellus to bernardo anticipates the common solutiontis but our fantasy upon which marcellus rises into     this dreaded sight twice seen of us   which immediately afterwards becomes this apparition and that too an intelligent spirit that is to be spoken to then comes the confirmation of horatios disbelief     tush tush twill not appear   and the silence with which the scene opened is again restored in the shivering feeling of horatio sitting down at such a time and with the two eyewitnesses to hear a story of a ghost and that too of a ghost which had appeared twice before at the very same hour in the deep feeling which bernardo has of the solemn nature of what he is about to relate he makes an effort to master his own imaginative terrors by an elevation of styleitself a continuation of the effortand by turning off from the apparition as from something which would force him too deeply into himself to the outward objects the realities of nature which had accompanied it     ber last night of all          when yon same star thats westward from the pole          had made his course to illume that part of heaven          where now it burns marcellus and myself          the bell then beating one   this passage seems to contradict the critical law that what is told makes a faint impression compared with what is beholden for it does indeed convey to the mind more than the eye can see whilst the interruption of the narrative at the very moment when we are most intensely listening for the sequel and have our thoughts diverted from the dreaded sight in expectation of the desired yet almost dreaded talethis gives all the suddenness and surprise of the original appearance     mar peace break thee off look where it comes again   note the judgment displayed in having the two persons present who as having seen the ghost before are naturally eager in confirming their former opinionswhilst the sceptic is silent and after having been twice addressed by his friends answers with two hasty syllablesmost likeand a confession of horror    it harrows me with fear and wonder   o heaven words are wasted on those who feel and to those who do not feel the exquisite judgment of shakspeare in this scene what can be saidhume himself could not but have had faith in this ghost dramatically let his antighostism have been as strong as samson against other ghosts less powerfully raised  act i sc i     mar good now sit down and tell me he that knows          why this same strict and most observant watch c   how delightfully natural is the transition to the retrospective narrative and observe upon the ghosts reappearance how much horatios courage is increased by having translated the late individual spectator into general thought and past experienceand the sympathy of marcellus and bernardo with his patriotic surmises in daring to strike at the ghost whilst in a moment upon its vanishing the former solemn awestricken feeling returns upon them     we do it wrong being so majestical   to offer it the show of violence   ib horatios speech                                  i have heard   the cock that is the trumpet to the morn   doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat   awake the god of day c   no addison could be more careful to be poetical in diction than shakspeare in providing the grounds and sources of its propriety but how to elevate a thing almost mean by its familiarity young poets may learn in this treatment of the cockcrow  ib horatios speech                            and by my advice   let us impart what we have seen tonight   unto young hamlet for upon my life   the spirit dumb to us will speak to him   note the inobtrusive and yet fully adequate mode of introducing the main character young hamlet upon whom is transferred all the interest excited for the acts and concerns of the king his father  ib sc 2 the audience are now relieved by a change of scene to the royal court in order that hamlet may not have to take up the leavings of exhaustion in the kings speech observe the set and pedantically antithetic form of the sentences when touching that which galled the heels of consciencethe strain of undignified rhetoricand yet in what follows concerning the public weal a certain appropriate majesty indeed was he not a royal brother  ib kings speech     and now laertes whats the news with you c   thus with great art shakspeare introduces a most important but still subordinate character first laertes who is yet thus graciously treated in consequence of the assistance given to the election of the late kings brother instead of his son by polonius  ib     ham a little more than kin and less than kind    king how is it that the clouds still hang on you    ham not so my lord i am too much i the sun  hamlet opens his mouth with a playing on words the complete absence of which throughout characterizes macbeth this playing on words may be attributed to many causes or motives as either to an exuberant activity of mind as in the higher comedy of shakspeare generallyor to an imitation of it as a mere fashion as if it were saidis not this better than groaningor to a contemptuous exultation in minds vulgarized and overset by their success as in the poetic instance of miltons devils in the battleor it is the language of resentment as is familiar to every one who has witnessed the quarrels of the lower orders where there is invariably a profusion of punning invective whence perhaps nicknames have in a considerable degree sprung upor it is the language of suppressed passion and especially of a hardly smothered personal dislike the first and last of these combine in hamlets case and i have little doubt that farmer is right in supposing the equivocation carried on in the expression too much i the sun or son  ib     ham ay madam it is common   here observe hamlets delicacy to his mother and how the suppression prepares him for the overflow in the next speech in which his character is more developed by bringing forward his aversion to externals and which betrays his habit of brooding over the world within him coupled with a prodigality of beautiful words which are the half embodyings of thought and are more than thought and have an outness a reality sui generis and yet retain their correspondence and shadowy affinity to the images and movements within note also hamlets silence to the long speech of the king which follows and his respectful but general answer to his mother  ib hamlets first soliloquy     o that this too too solid flesh would melt   thaw and resolve itself into a dew c   this tædium vitæ is a common oppression on minds cast in the hamlet mould and is caused by disproportionate mental exertion which necessitates exhaustion of bodily feeling where there is a just coincidence of external and internal action pleasure is always the result but where the former is deficient and the minds appetency of the ideal is unchecked realities will seem cold and unmoving in such cases passion combines itself with the indefinite alone in this mood of his mind the relation of the appearance of his fathers spirit in arms is made all at once to hamletit ishoratios speech in particulara perfect model of the true style of dramatic narrativethe purest poetry and yet in the most natural language equally remote from the inkhorn and the plough  ib sc 3 this scene must be regarded as one of shakspeares lyric movements in the play and the skill with which it is interwoven with the dramatic parts is peculiarly an excellence of our poet you experience the sensation of a pause without the sense of a stop you will observe in ophelias short and general answer to the long speech of laertes the natural carelessness of innocence which cannot think such a code of cautions and prudences necessary to its own preservation  ib speech of poloniusin stockdales edition     or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase   wronging it thus youll tender me a fool   i suspect this wronging is here used much in the same sense as wringing or wrenching and that the parenthesis should be extended to thus 1  ib speech of polonius    how prodigal the soul   lends the tongue vowsthese blazes daughter c   a spondee has i doubt not dropped out of the text either insert go to after vows     lends the tongue vowsgo to these blazes daughter   or read     lends the tongue vowsthese blazes daughter mark you   shakspeare never introduces a catalectic line without intending an equivalent to the foot omitted in the pauses or the dwelling emphasis or the diffused retardation i do not however deny that a good actor might by employing the last mentioned means namely the retardation or solemn knowing drawl supply the missing spondee with good effect but i do not believe that in this or any other of the foregoing speeches of polonius shakspeare meant to bring out the senility or weakness of that personages mind in the great everrecurring dangers and duties of life where to distinguish the fit objects for the application of the maxims collected by the experience of a long life requires no fineness of tact as in the admonitions to his son and daughter polonius is uniformly made respectable but if an actor were even capable of catching these shades in the character the pit and the gallery would be malcontent at their exhibition it is to hamlet that polonius is and is meant to be contemptible because in inwardness and uncontrollable activity of movement hamlets mind is the logical contrary to that of polonius and besides as i have observed before hamlet dislikes the man as false to his true allegiance in the matter of the succession to the crown  ib sc 4 the unimportant conversation with which this scene opens is a proof of shakspeares minute knowledge of human nature it is a well established fact that on the brink of any serious enterprise or event of moment men almost invariably endeavour to elude the pressure of their own thoughts by turning aside to trivial objects and familiar circumstances thus this dialogue on the platform begins with remarks on the coldness of the air and inquiries obliquely connected indeed with the expected hour of the visitation but thrown out in a seeming vacuity of topics as to the striking of the clock and so forth the same desire to escape from the impending thought is carried on in hamlets account of and moralizing on the danish custom of wassailing he runs off from the particular to the universal and in his repugnance to personal and individual concerns escapes as it were from himself in generalizations and smothers the impatience and uneasy feelings of the moment in abstract reasoning besides this another purpose is answeredfor by thus entangling the attention of the audience in the nice distinctions and parenthetical sentences of this speech of hamlets shakspeare takes them completely by surprise on the appearance of the ghost which comes upon them in all the suddenness of its visionary character indeed no modern writer would have dared like shakspeare to have preceded this last visitation by two distinct appearancesor could have contrived that the third should rise upon the former two in impressiveness and solemnity of interest  but in addition to all the other excellencies of hamlets speech concerning the wasselmusicso finely revealing the predominant idealism the ratiocinative meditativeness of his characterit has the advantage of giving nature and probability to the impassioned continuity of the speech instantly directed to the ghost the momentum had been given to his mental activity the full current of the thoughts and words had set in and the very forgetfulness in the fervour of his argumentation of the purpose for which he was there aided in preventing the appearance from benumbing the mind consequently it acted as a new impulsea sudden stroke which increased the velocity of the body already in motion whilst it altered the direction the copresence of horatio marcellus and bernardo is most judiciously contrived for it renders the courage of hamlet and his impetuous eloquence perfectly intelligible the knowledgethe unthought of consciousnessthe sensationof human auditorsof flesh and blood sympathistsacts as a support and a stimulation a tergo while the front of the mind the whole consciousness of the speaker is filled yea absorbed by the apparition add too that the apparition itself has by its previous appearances been brought nearer to a thing of this world this accrescence of objectivity in a ghost that yet retains all its ghostly attributes and fearful subjectivity is truly wonderful  ib sc 5 hamlets speech     o all you host of heaven o earth what else   and shall i couple hell   i remember nothing equal to this burst unless it be the first speech of prometheus in the greek drama after the exit of vulcan and the two afrites but shakspeare alone could have produced the vow of hamlet to make his memory a blank of all maxims and generalized truths that observation had copied therefollowed immediately by the speaker noting down the generalized fact     that one may smile and smile and be a villain   ib     mar hillo ho ho my lord    ham hillo ho ho boy come bird come c   this part of the scene after hamlets interview with the ghost has been charged with an improbable eccentricity but the truth is that after the mind has been stretched beyond its usual pitch and tone it must either sink into exhaustion and inanity or seek relief by change it is thus well known that persons conversant in deeds of cruelty contrive to escape from conscience by connecting something of the ludicrous with them and by inventing grotesque terms and a certain technical phraseology to disguise the horror of their practices indeed paradoxical as it may appear the terrible by a law of the human mind always touches on the verge of the ludicrous both arise from the perception of something out of the common order of thingssomething in fact out of its place and if from this we can abstract danger the uncommonness will alone remain and the sense of the ridiculous be excited the close alliance of these oppositesthey are not contrariesappears from the circumstance that laughter is equally the expression of extreme anguish and horror as of joy as there are tears of sorrow and tears of joy so is there a laugh of terror and a laugh of merriment these complex causes will naturally have produced in hamlet the disposition to escape from his own feelings of the overwhelming and supernatural by a wild transition to the ludicrousa sort of cunning bravado bordering on the flights of delirium for you may perhaps observe that hamlets wildness is but half false he plays that subtle trick of pretending to act only when he is very near really being what he acts  the subterraneous speeches of the ghost are hardly defensiblebut i would call your attention to the characteristic difference between this ghost as a superstition connected with the most mysterious truths of revealed religionand shakspeares consequent reverence in his treatment of itand the foul earthly witcheries and wild language in macbeth  act ii sc 1 polonius and reynaldo  in all things dependent on or rather made up of fine address the manner is no more or otherwise rememberable than the light motions steps and gestures of youth and health but this is almost every thingno wonder therefore if that which can be put down by rule in the memory should appear to us as mere poring maudlin cunningslyness blinking through the watery eye of superannuation so in this admirable scene polonius who is throughout the skeleton of his own former skill and statecraft hunts the trail of policy at a dead scent supplied by the weak feversmell in his own nostrils  ib sc 2 speech of polonius     my liege and madam to expostulate c   warburtons note     then

purposely obscure lines i rather think refer to some thought in hamlets mind contrasting the lovely daughter with such a tedious old fool her father as he hamlet represents polonius to himselfwhy fool as he is he is some degrees in rank above a dead dogs carcase and if the sun being a god that kisses carrion can raise life out of a dead dogwhy may not good fortune that favours fools have raised a lovely girl out of this deadalive old fool warburton is often led astray in his interpretations by his attention to general positions without the due shakspearian reference to what is probably passing

of my view of these lines  ib     ham you cannot sir take from me any thing that i will more   willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life   this repetition strikes me as most admirable  ib     ham then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and   outstretched heroes the beggars shadows   i do not understand this and shakspeare seems to have intended the meaning not to be

dramatic diction of shakspeares own dialogue and authorized too by the actual style of the tragedies before his time porrex and ferrex titus andronicus cis well worthy of notice the fancy that a burlesque was intended sinks below criticism the lines as epic narrative are superb  in the thoughts and even in the separate parts of the diction this description is highly poetical in truth taken by itself this is its fault that it is too poeticalthe language of lyric vehemence and epic pomp and not of the drama but if shakspeare had made the diction truly dramatic where would have been the contrast between hamlet and the play in hamlet  ib   had seen the mobled queen c   a mobcap is still a word in common use for a morning cap which conceals the whole head of hair and passes under the

soliloquy     to be or not to be that is the question c   this speech is of absolutely universal interestand yet to which of all shakspeares characters could it have been appropriately given but to

are you fair   here it is evident that the penetrating hamlet perceives from the strange and forced manner of ophelia that the sweet girl was not acting a part of her own but was a decoy and his after speeches are not so much directed to her as to the listeners and spies such a discovery in a mood so anxious and irritable accounts for a certain harshness in himand yet a wild upworking of love sporting with opposites in a wilful selftormenting strain of irony is perceptible throughout i did love you oncei lovd you notand particularly in his enumeration of the faults of the sex from which ophelia is so free that the mere freedom therefrom constitutes her character note shakspeares charm of composing the female character by the absence of characters that is marks and outjuttings  ib

guildensternwhy look you now cproves  ib hamlets soliloquy     now could i drink hot blood   and do such business as the bitter day   would quake to look on   the utmost at which hamlet arrives is a disposition a mood to do somethingbut what to do is still left undecided while every word he utters tends to betray his disguise yet observe how perfectly equal to any call of the moment is hamlet let it only not be for the future  ib sc 4 speech of polonius poloniuss volunteer obtrusion of himself into this business while it is appropriate to his character still itching after former importance removes all likelihood that hamlet should suspect his presence and prevents us from making his death injure hamlet in our opinion  ib the kings speech     o my offence is rank it smells to heaven c   this speech well marks the difference between crime and guilt of habit the conscience here is still admitted to audience nay even as an audible soliloquy it is far less improbable than is supposed by such as have watched men only in the beaten road of their feelings but the finalall may be well is remarkablethe degree of merit attributed by the selfflattering soul to its own struggle though baffled and to the indefinite halfpromise halfcommand to persevere in religious duties the solution is in the divine medium of the christian doctrine of expiationnot what you have done but what you

the marks of reluctance and procrastination for impetuous horrorstriking fiendishnessof such importance is it to understand the germ of a character but the interval taken by hamlets speech is truly awful and then     my words fly up my thoughts remain below   words without thoughts never to heaven go   o what a lesson concerning the essential difference between wishing and willing and the folly of all motivemongering while the individual self remains  ib sc 4     ham   a bloody deedalmost as bad good mother            as kill a king and marry with his brother    queen as kill a king   i

beforein fact in telling hometruths  act iv sc 5 ophelias singing o note the conjunction here of these two thoughts that had never subsisted in disjunction the love for hamlet and her filial love with the guileless floating on the surface of her pure imagination of the cautions so lately expressed and the fears not too delicately avowed by her father and brother concerning the dangers to which her honour lay exposed thought affliction passion murder itselfshe turns to favour and prettiness this play of association is instanced in the close     my brother shall know of it and i thank you for your good counsel   ib gentlemans speech     and as the world were now but to begin   antiquity forgot custom not known   the ratifiers and props of every ward   they cry c   fearful and selfsuspicious as i always feel when i seem to see an error of judgment in shakspeare yet i cannot reconcile the cool and as warburton calls it rational and consequential reflection in these lines with the anonymousness or the alarm of this gentleman or messenger as he is called in other editions  ib kings speech     theres such divinity doth hedge a king   that treason can but peep to what it would   acts little of his will   proof as indeed all else is that shakspeare never intended us to see the king with hamlets eyes though i suspect the managers have long done so  ib speech of laertes     to hell allegiance vows to the blackest devil    laertes is a good character but c warburton   mercy on warburtons notion of goodness please to refer to the seventh scene of this act     i will do it   and for this purpose ill anoint my sword c   uttered by laertes after the kings description of hamlet     he being remiss   most generous and free from all contriving   will not peruse the foils   yet i acknowledge that shakspeare evidently wishes as much as possible to spare the character of laertesto break the extreme turpitude of his consent to become an agent and accomplice of the kings treacheryand to this end he reintroduces ophelia at the close of this scene to afford a probable stimulus of passion in her brother  ib sc 6 hamlets capture by the pirates this is almost the only play of shakspeare in which mere accidents independent of all will form an essential part of the plotbut here how judiciously in keeping with the character of the overmeditative hamlet ever at last determined by accident or by a fit of passion  ib sc 7 note how the king first awakens laertess vanity by praising the reporter and then gratifies it by the report itself and finally points it by

plethory  i rather think that shakspeare meant pleurisy but involved in it the thought of plethora as supposing pleurisy to arise from too much blood otherwise i cannot explain the following line     and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh   that hurts by easing   in a stitch in the side every one must have heaved a sigh that hurt by easing  since writing the above i feel confirmed that pleurisy is the right word for i find that in the old medical dictionaries the pleurisy is often called the plethory  ib     queen your sisters drownd laertes    laer  drownd o where   that laertes

sprayflowers quietly reflected in the quiet waters but at length is undermined or loosened and becomes a faery isle and after a brief vagrancy sinks almost without an eddy  act v sc 1 o the rich contrast between the clowns and hamlet as two extremes you see in the former the mockery of logic and a traditional wit valued like truth for its antiquity and treasured up like a tune for use  ib sc 1 and 2 shakspeare seems to mean all hamlets character to be brought together before his final disappearance from the scenehis meditative excess in the gravedigging his yielding to passion with laertes his love for ophelia blazing out his tendency to generalize on all occasions in the dialogue with horatio his fine gentlemanly manners with osrick and his and shakspeares own fondness for presentiment     but thou wouldst not think how ill alls here about my heart but it   is no matter   footnote 1 it is so pointed in the modern editionsed      notes on macbeth  macbeth stands in contrast throughout with hamlet in the manner of opening more especially in the latter there is a gradual ascent from the simplest forms of conversation to the language of impassioned intellectyet the intellect still remaining the seat of passion in the former the invocation is at once made to the imagination and the emotions connected therewith hence the movement throughout is the most rapid of all shakspeares plays and hence also with the exception of the disgusting passage of the porter act ii sc 3 which i dare pledge myself to demonstrate to be an interpolation of the actors there is not to the best of my remembrance a single pun or play on words in the whole drama i have previously given an answer to the thousand times repeated charge against shakspeare upon the subject of his punning and i here merely mention the fact of the absence of any puns in macbeth as justifying a candid doubt at least whether even in these figures of speech and fanciful modifications of language shakspeare may not have followed rules and principles that merit and would stand the test of philosophic examination and hence also there is an entire absence of comedy nay even of irony and philosophic contemplation in macbeththe play being wholly and purely tragic for the same cause there are no reasonings of equivocal morality which would have required a more leisurely state and a consequently greater activity of mindno sophistry of selfdelusionexcept only that previously to the dreadful act macbeth mistranslates the recoilings and ominous whispers of conscience into prudential and selfish reasonings and after the deed done the terrors of remorse into fear from external dangerslike delirious men who run away from the phantoms of their own brains or raised by terror to rage stab the real object that is within their reachwhilst lady macbeth merely endeavours to reconcile his and her own sinkings of heart by anticipations of the worst and an affected bravado in confronting them in all the rest macbeths language is the grave utterance of the very heart consciencesick even to the last faintings of moral death it is the same in all the other characters the variety arises from rage caused ever and anon by disruption of anxious thought and the quick transition of fear into it  in hamlet and macbeth the scene opens with superstition but in each it is not merely different but opposite in the first it is connected with the best and holiest feelings in the second with the shadowy turbulent and unsanctified cravings of the individual will nor is the purpose the same in the one the object is to excite whilst in the other it is to mark a mind already excited superstition of one sort or another is natural to victorious generals the instances are too notorious to need mentioning there is so much of chance in warfare and such vast events are connected with the acts of a single individualthe representative in truth of the efforts of myriads and yet to the public and doubtless to his own feelings the aggregate of allthat the proper temperament for generating or receiving superstitious impressions is naturally produced hope the master element of a commanding genius meeting with an active and combining intellect and an imagination of just that degree of vividness which disquiets and impels the soul to try to realize its images greatly increases the creative power of the mind and hence the images become a satisfying world of themselves as is the case in every poet and original philosopherbut hope fully gratified and yet the elementary basis of the passion remaining becomes fear and indeed the general who must often feel even though he may hide it from his own consciousness how large a share chance had in his successes may very naturally be irresolute in a new scene where he knows that all will depend on his own act and election  the wierd sisters are as true a creation of shakspeares as his ariel and calibanfates furies and materializing witches being the elements they are wholly different from any representation of witches in the contemporary writers and yet presented a sufficient external resemblance to the creatures of vulgar prejudice to act immediately on the audience their character consists in the imaginative disconnected from the good they are the shadowy obscure and fearfully anomalous of physical nature the lawless of human natureelemental avengers without sex or kin     fair is foul and foul is fair hover thro the fog and filthy air   how much it were to be wished in playing macbeth that an attempt should be made to introduce the flexile charactermask of the ancient pantomimethat flaxman would contribute his genius to the embodying and making sensuously perceptible that of shakspeare  the style and rhythm of the captains speeches in the second scene should be illustrated by reference to the interlude in hamlet in which the epic is substituted for the tragic in order to make the latter be felt as the reallife diction in macbeth the poets object was to raise the mind at once to the high tragic tone that the audience might be ready for the precipitate consummation of guilt in the early part of the play the true reason for the first appearance of the witches is to strike the keynote of the character of the whole drama as is proved by their reappearance in the third scene after such an order of the kings as establishes their supernatural power of information i say informationfor so it only is as to glamis and cawdor the king hereafter was still contingentstill in macbeths moral will although if he should yield to the temptation and thus forfeit his free agency the link of cause and effect more physico would then commence i need not say that the general idea is all that can be required from the poetnot a scholastic logical consistency in all the parts so as to meet metaphysical objectors but o how truly shakspearian is the opening of macbeths character given in the unpossessedness of banquos mind wholly present to the present objectan unsullied unscarified mirrorand how strictly true to nature it is that banquo and not macbeth himself directs our notice to the effect produced on macbeths mind rendered temptible by previous dalliance of the fancy with ambitious thoughts     good sir why do you start and seem to fear   things that do sound so fair   and then again still unintroitive addresses the witches     i the name of truth   are ye fantastical or that indeed   which outwardly ye show   banquos questions are those of natural curiositysuch as a girl would put after hearing a gipsy tell her schoolfellows fortuneall perfectly general or rather planless but macbeth lost in thought raises himself to speech only by the witches being about to depart     stay you imperfect speakers tell me more   and all that follows is reasoning on a problem already discussed in his mindon a hope which he welcomes and the doubts concerning the attainment of which he wishes to have cleared up compare his eagernessthe keen eye with which he has pursued the witches evanishing     speak i charge you   with the easily satisfied mind of the selfuninterested banquo     the air hath bubbles as the water has   and these are of themwhither are they vanishd   and then macbeths earnest reply     into the air and what seemd corporal melted   as breath into the windwould they had staid   is it too minute to notice the appropriateness of the simile as breath c in a cold climate  still again banquo goes on wondering like any common spectator     were such things here as we do speak about   whilst macbeth persists in recurring to the selfconcerning     your children shall be kings    ban  you shall be king    macb and thane of cawdor too went it not so   so surely is the guilt in its germ anterior to the supposed cause and immediate temptation before he can cool the confirmation of the tempting half of the prophecy arrives and the concatenating tendency of the imagination is fostered by the sudden coincidence     glamis and thane of cawdor the greatest is behind   oppose this to banquos simple surprise     what can the devil speak true   ib banquos speech     that trusted home   might yet enkindle you unto the crown   besides the thane of cawdor   i doubt whether enkindle has not another sense than that of stimulating i mean of kind and kin as when rabbits are said to kindle however macbeth no longer hears any thing ab extra     two truths are told   as happy prologues to the swelling act   of the imperial theme   then in the necessity of recollecting himself     i thank you gentlemen   then he relapses into himself again and every word of his soliloquy shows the early birthdate of his guilt he is allpowerful without strength he wishes the end but is irresolute as to the means conscience distinctly warns him and he lulls it imperfectly     if chance will have me king why chance may crown me   without my stir   lost in the prospective of his guilt he turns round alarmed lest others may suspect what is passing in his own mind and instantly vents the lie of ambition     my dull brain was wrought   with things forgotten   and immediately after pours forth the promising courtesies of a usurper in intention     kind gentlemen your pains   are registerd where every day i turn   the leaf to read them   ib macbeths speech     presents fears are less than horrible imaginings   warburtons note and substitution of feats for fears  mercy on this most wilful ingenuity of blundering which nevertheless was the very warburton of warburtonhis inmost being fears here are present fearstriking objects terribilia adstantia  ib sc 4 o the affecting beauty of the death of cawdor and the presentimental speech of the king     theres no art   to find the minds construction in the face   he was a gentleman on whom i built   an absolute trust   interrupted by     o worthiest cousin   on the entrance of the deeper traitor for whom cawdor had made way and here in contrast with duncans plenteous joys macbeth has nothing but the commonplaces of loyalty in which he hides himself with our duties note the exceeding effort of macbeths addresses to the king his reasoning on his allegiance and then especially when a new difficulty the designation of a successor suggests a new crime this however seems the first distinct notion as to the plan of realizing his wishes and here therefore with great propriety macbeths cowardice of his own conscience discloses itself i always think there is something especially shakspearian in duncans speeches throughout this scene such pourings forth such abandonments compared with the language of vulgar dramatists whose characters seem to have made their speeches as the actors learn them  ib duncans speech     sons kinsmen thanes   and you whose places are the nearest know   we will establish our estate upon   our eldest malcolm whom we name hereafter   the prince of cumberland which honour must   not unaccompanied  invest him only   but signs of nobleness like stars shall shine   on all deservers   it is a fancybut i can never read this and the following speeches of macbeth without involuntarily thinking of the miltonic messiah and satan  ib sc 5 macbeth is described by lady macbeth so as at the same time to reveal her own character could he have everything he wanted he would rather have it innocentlyignorant as alas how many of us are that he who wishes a temporal end for itself does in truth will the means and hence the danger of indulging fancies lady macbeth like all in shakspeare is a class individualizedof high rank left much alone and feeding herself with daydreams of ambition she mistakes the courage of fantasy for the power of bearing the consequences of the realities of guilt hers is the mock fortitude of a mind deluded by ambition she shames her husband with a superhuman audacity of fancy which she cannot support but sinks in the season of remorse and dies in suicidal agony her speech     come all you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here c   is that of one who had habitually familiarized her imagination to dreadful conceptions and was trying to do so still more her invocations and requisitions are all the false efforts of a mind accustomed only hitherto to the shadows of the imagination vivid enough to throw the everyday substances of life into shadow but never as yet brought into direct contact with their own correspondent realities she evinces no womanly life no wifely joy at the return of her husband no pleased terror at the thought of his past dangers whilst macbeth bursts forth naturally     my dearest love   and shrinks from the boldness with which she presents his own thoughts to him with consummate art she at first uses as incentives the very circumstances duncans coming to their house c which macbeths conscience would most probably have adduced to her as motives of abhorrence or repulsion yet macbeth is not prepared     we will speak further   ib sc 6 the lyrical movement with which this scene opens and the free and unengaged mind of banquo loving nature and rewarded in the love itself form a highly dramatic contrast with the laboured rhythm and hypocritical overmuch of lady macbeths welcome in which you cannot detect a ray of personal feeling but all is thrown upon the dignities the general duty  ib sc 7 macbeths speech     we will proceed no further in this business   he hath honord me of late and i have bought   golden opinions from all sorts of people   which would be worn now in their newest gloss   not cast aside so soon   note the inward pangs and warnings of conscience interpreted into prudential reasonings  act ii sc 1 banquos speech     a heavy summons lies like lead upon me   and yet i would not sleep merciful powers   restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature   gives way to in repose   the disturbance of an innocent soul by painful suspicions of anothers guilty intentions and wishes and fear of the cursed thoughts of sensual nature  ib sc 2 now that the deed is done or doingnow that the first reality commences lady macbeth shrinks the most simple sound strikes terror the most natural consequences are horrible whilst previously every thing however awful appeared a mere trifle conscience which before had been hidden to macbeth in selfish and prudential fears now rushes in upon him in her own veritable person     methought i heard a voice cry   sleep no more i could not say amen   when they did say god bless us   and see the novelty given to the most familiar images by a new state of feeling  ib sc 3 this low soliloquy of the porter and his few speeches afterwards i believe to have been written for the mob by some other hand perhaps with shakspeares consent and that finding it take he with the remaining ink of a pen otherwise employed just interpolated the words     ill devilporter it no further i had thought to have let in some of   all professions that go the primrose way to th everlasting bonfire   of the rest not one syllable has the everpresent being of shakspeare  act iii sc 1 compare macbeths mode of working on the murderers in this place with schillers mistaken scene between butler devereux and macdonald in wallenstein part ii act iv sc 2 the comic was wholly out of season shakspeare never introduces it but when it may react on the tragedy by harmonious contrast  ib sc 2 macbeths speech     but let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer   ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep   in the affliction of these terrible dreams   that shake us nightly   ever and ever mistaking the anguish of conscience for fears of selfishness and thus as a punishment of that selfishness plunging still deeper in guilt and ruin  ib macbeths speech     be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck   till thou applaud the deed   this is macbeths sympathy with his own feelings and his mistaking his wifes opposite state  ib sc 4     macb it will have blood they say blood will have blood           stones have been known to move and trees to speak           augurs and understood relations have           by magotpies and choughs and rooks brought forth           the secretst man of blood   the deed is done but macbeth receives no comfortno additional security he has by guilt torn himself liveasunder from nature and is therefore himself in a preternatural state no wonder then that he is inclined to superstition and faith in the unknown of signs and tokens and superhuman agencies  act iv sc 1     len tis two or three my lord that bring you word          macduff is fled to england    macb fled to england   the acme of the avenging conscience  ib sc 2 this scene dreadful as it is is still a relief because a variety because domestic and therefore soothing as associated with the only real pleasures of life the conversation between lady macduff and her child heightens the pathos and is

subjecta genuine proteuswe see all things in him as images in a calm lake most distinct most accurateonly more splendid more glorified this is correctness in the only philosophical sense but he requires your sympathy and your submission you must have that recipiency of moral impression without which the purposes and ends of the drama would be frustrated and the absence of which demonstrates

    nor shall he ever recover an heir if he have a wife before that   recovery   the idea of this delightful drama is a genuine jealousy of disposition and it should be immediately followed by the perusal of othello which is the direct contrast of it in every particular for jealousy is a vice of the mind a culpable tendency of the temper having certain well known and well defined effects and concomitants all of which are visible in leontes and i boldly say not one of which marks its presence in othellosuch as first an excitability by the most inadequate causes and an eagerness to snatch at proofs secondly a grossness of conception and a disposition to degrade the object of the passion by sensual fancies and images thirdly a sense of shame of his own feelings exhibited in a solitary moodiness of humour and yet from the violence of the passion forced to utter itself and therefore catching occasions to ease the mind by ambiguities equivoques by talking to those who cannot and who are known not to be able to understand what is said to themin short by soliloquy in the form of dialogue and hence a confused broken and fragmentary manner fourthly a dread of vulgar ridicule as distinct from a high sense of honour or a mistaken sense of duty and lastly and immediately consequent on this a spirit of selfish vindictiveness  act i sc 12  observe the easy style of chitchat between camillo and archidamus as contrasted with the elevated diction on the introduction of the kings and hermione in the second scene and how admirably polixenes obstinate refusal to leontes to stay     there is no tongue that moves none none i the world   so soon as yours could win me   prepares for the effect produced by his afterwards yielding to hermionewhich is nevertheless perfectly natural from mere courtesy of sex and the exhaustion of the will by former efforts of denial and well calculated to set in nascent action the jealousy of leontes this when once excited is unconsciously increased by hermione     yet good deed leontes i love thee not a jar o the clock behind   what lady she her lord   accompanied as a good actress ought to represent it by an expression

   notes on othello  act i sc 1 admirable is the preparation so truly and peculiarly shakspearian in the introduction of roderigo as the dupe on whom iago shall first exercise his art and in so doing display his own character roderigo without any fixed principle but not without the moral notions and sympathies with honor which his rank and connections had hung upon him is already well fitted and predisposed for the purpose for very want of character and strength of passion like wind loudest in an empty house constitute his character the first three lines happily state the nature and foundation of the friendship between him and iagothe purseas also the contrast of roderigos intemperance of mind with iagos coolnessthe coolness of a preconceiving experimenter the mere language of protestation     if ever i did dream of such a matter abhor me   which falling in with the associative link determines roderigos continuation of complaint     thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate   elicits at length a true feeling of iagos mind the dread of contempt habitual to those who encourage in themselves and have their keenest pleasure in the expression of contempt for others observe iagos high selfopinion and the moral that a wicked man will employ real feelings as well as assume those most alien from his own as instruments of his purposes    and by the faith of man i know my place   i am worth no worse a place   i think tyrwhitts reading of life for wife     a fellow almost damnd in a fair wife   the true one as fitting to iagos contempt for whatever did not display power and that intellectual power in what follows let the reader feel how by and through the glass of two passions disappointed vanity and envy the very vices of which he is complaining are made to act upon him as if they were so many excellences and the more appropriately because cunning is always admired and wished for by minds conscious of inward weaknessbut they act only by half like music on an inattentive auditor swelling the thoughts which prevent him from listening to it  ib     rod what a full fortune does the thicklips owe          if he can carryt thus   roderigo turns off to othello and here comes one if not the only seeming justification of our blackamoor or negro othello even if we supposed this an uninterrupted tradition of the theatre and that shakspeare himself from want of scenes and the experience that nothing could be made too marked for the senses of his audience had practically sanctioned itwould this prove aught concerning his own intention as a poet for all ages can we imagine him so utterly ignorant as to make a barbarous negro plead royal birthat a time too when negros were not known except as slavesas for iagos language to brabantio it implies merely that othello was a moor that is black though i think the rivalry of roderigo sufficient to account for his wilful confusion of moor and negroyet even if compelled to give this up i should think it only adapted for the acting of the day and should complain of an enormity built on a single word in direct contradiction to iagos barbary horse besides if we could in good earnest believe shakspeare ignorant of the distinction still why should we adopt one disagreeable possibility instead of a ten times greater and more pleasing probability it is a common error to mistake the epithets applied by the dramatis personae to each other as truly descriptive of what the audience ought to see or know no doubt desdemona saw othellos visage in his mind yet as we are constituted and most surely as an english audience was disposed in the beginning of the seventeenth century it would be something monstrous to conceive this beautiful venetian girl falling in love with a veritable negro

theobalds note where and bonnetted is suggested goes on the assumption that shakspeare could not use the same word differently in different places whereas i should conclude that as in the passage in

it is yea whilst he is still allowed to bear the divine image it is too fiendish for his own steady viewfor the lonely gaze of a being next to devil and only not quite deviland yet a character which shakspeare has attempted and executed without disgust and without scandal  dr johnson has remarked that little or nothing is wanting to render the othello a regular tragedy but to have opened the play with the arrival of othello in cyprus and to have thrown the preceding act into the form of narration here then is the place to determine whether such a change would or would not be an improvementnay to throw down the glove with a full challenge whether the tragedy would or not by such an arrangement become more regularthat is more consonant with the rules dictated by universal reason on the true commonsense of mankind in its application to the particular case for in all acts of judgment it can never be too often recollected and scarcely too often repeated that rules are means to ends and consequently that the end must be determined and understood before it can be known what the rules are or ought to be now from a certain species of drama proposing to itself the accomplishment of certain endsthese partly arising from the idea of the species itself but in part likewise forced upon the dramatist by accidental circumstances beyond his power to remove or controlthree rules have been abstractedin other words the means most conducive to the attainment of the proposed ends have been generalized and prescribed under the names of the three unitiesthe unity of time the unity of place and the unity of actionwhich last would perhaps have been as appropriately as well as more intelligibly entitled the unity of interest with this last the present question has no immediate concern in fact its conjunction with the former two is a mere delusion of words it is not properly a rule but in itself the great end not only of the drama but of the epic poem the lyric ode of all poetry down to the candleflame cone of an epigramnay of poesy in general as the proper generic term inclusive of all the fine arts as its species but of the unities of time and place which alone are entitled to the name of rules the history of their origin will be their best criterion you might take the greek chorus to a place but you could not bring a place to them without as palpable an equivoque as bringing birnam wood to macbeth at dunsinane it was the same though in a less degree with regard to the unity of timethe positive fact not for a moment removed from the senses the presence i mean of the same identical chorus was a continued measure of timeand although the imagination may supersede perception yet it must be granted to be an imperfectionhowever easily toleratedto place the two in broad contradiction to each other in truth it is a mere accident of terms for the trilogy of the greek theatre was a drama in three acts and notwithstanding this what strange contrivances as to place there are in the aristophanic frogs besides if the law of mere actual perception is once violatedas it repeatedly is even in the greek tragedieswhy is it more difficult to imagine three hours to be three years than to be a whole day and night observe in how many ways othello is made first our acquaintance then our friend then the object of our anxiety before the deeper

sympathy with the most fortunately wived othelloand yet cassio is an enthusiastic admirer almost a worshipper of desdemona o that detestable code that excellence cannot be loved in any form that is female but it must needs be selfish observe othellos honest and cassios bold iago and cassios full guilelesshearted wishes for the safety and loveraptures of othello and the divine desdemona and also note the exquisite circumstance of cassios kissing iagos wife as if it ought to be impossible that the dullest auditor should not feel cassios religious love of desdemonas purity iagos answers are the

greatest of poets to make othello say that he who had killed his wife was like herod who killed mariamneo how many beauties in this one line were impenetrable to the ever thoughtswarming but idealess warburton othello wishes to excuse himself on the score of ignorance and yet not to excuse himselfto excuse himself by accusing this struggle of feeling is finely conveyed in the word base which is applied to the rude indian not in his own character but as the momentary representative of othellos indianfor i retain the old readingmeans american a savage in genere  finally let me repeat that othello does not kill desdemona in jealousy but in a conviction forced upon him by the almost superhuman art of iago such a conviction as any man would and must have entertained who had believed iagos honesty as othello did we the audience know that iago is a villain from the beginning but in considering the essence of the shakspearian othello we must perseveringly place ourselves in his situation and under his circumstances then we shall immediately feel the fundamental difference between the solemn agony of the noble moor and the wretched fishing jealousies of leontes and the morbid suspiciousness of leonatus who is in other respects a fine character  othello had no life but in desdemonathe belief that she his angel had fallen from the heaven of her native innocence wrought a civil war in his heart she is his counterpart and like him is almost sanctified in our eyes by her absolute unsuspiciousness and holy entireness of love as the curtain drops which do we pity the most

on ben jonson  it would be amusing to collect out of our dramatists from elizabeth to charles i proofs of the manners of the times one striking symptom of general coarseness of manners which may coexist with great refinement of morals as alas vice versa is to be seen in the very frequent allusions to the olfactories with their most disgusting stimulants and these too in the conversation of virtuous ladies this would not appear so strange to one who had been on terms of familiarity with sicilian and italian women of rank and bad as they may too many of them actually be yet i doubt not that the extreme grossness of their language has impressed many an englishman of the present era with far darker notions than the same language would have produced in the mind of one of elizabeths or jamess courtiers those who have read shakspeare only complain of occasional grossness in his plays but compare him with his contemporaries and the inevitable conviction is that of the exquisite purity of his imagination  the observation i have prefixed to the volpone is the key to the faint interest which these noble efforts of intellectual power excite with the exception of the fragment of the sad shepherd because in that piece only is there any character with whom you can morally sympathize on the other hand measure for measure is the only play of shakspeares in which there are not some one or more characters generally many whom you follow with affectionate feeling for i confess that isabella of all shakspeares female characters pleases me the least and measure for measure is indeed the only one of his genuine works which is painful to me  let me not conclude this remark however without a thankful acknowledgment to the manes of ben jonson that the more i study his writings i the more admire them and the more my study of him resembles that of an ancient classic in the minutiæ of his rhythm metre choice of words forms of connection and so forth the more numerous have the points of my admiration become i may add too that both the study and the admiration cannot but be disinterested for to expect therefrom any advantage to the present drama would be ignorance the latter is utterly heterogeneous from the drama of the shakspearian age with a diverse object and contrary principle the one was to present a model by imitation of real life taking from real life all that in it which it ought to be and supplying the restthe other is to copy what is and as it isat best a tolerable but most frequently a blundering copy in the former the difference was an essential element in the latter an involuntary defect we should think it strange if a tale in dance were announced and the actors did not dance at alland yet such is modern comedy     whalleys preface   but jonson was soon sensible how inconsistent this medley of names and manners was in reason and nature and with how little propriety it could ever have a place in a legitimate and just picture of real life   but did jonson reflect that the very essence of a play the very language in which it is written is a fiction to which all the parts must conform surely greek manners in english should be a still grosser improbability than a greek name transferred to english manners bens personæ are too often not characters but derangementsthe hopeless patients of a maddoctor ratherexhibitions of folly betraying itself in spite of existing reason and prudence he not poetically but painfully exaggerates every trait that is not by the drollery of the circumstance but by the excess of the originating feeling  but to this we might reply that far from being thought to build his characters upon abstract ideas he was really accused of representing particular persons then existing and that even those characters which appear to be the most exaggerated are said to have had their respective archetypes in nature and life  this degrades jonson into a libeller instead of justifying him as a dramatic poet non quod verum est sed quod verisimile is the dramatists rule at all events the poet who chooses transitory manners ought to content himself with transitory praise if his object be reputation he ought not to expect fame the utmost he can look forwards to is to be quoted by and to enliven the writings of an antiquarian pistol nym and id genus omne do not please us as characters but are endured as fantastic creations foils to the native wit of falstaffi say wit emphatically for this character so often extolled as the masterpiece of humor neither contains nor was meant to contain any humor at all     whalleys life of jonson   it is to the honor of jonsons judgment that the greatest poet of our nation had the same opinion of donnes genius and wit and hath preserved part of him from perishing by putting his thoughts and satire into modern verse  videlicet pope  he said further to drummond shakspeare wanted art and sometimes sense for in one of his plays he brought in a number of men saying they had suffered shipwreck in bohemia where is no sea near by a hundred miles  i have often thought shakspeare justified in this seeming anachronism in pagan times a single name of a german kingdom might well be supposed to comprise a hundred miles more than at present the truth is these notes of drummonds are more disgraceful to himself than to jonson it would be easy to conjecture how grossly jonson must have been misunderstood and what he had said in jest as of hippocrates interpreted in earnest but this is characteristic of a scotchman he has no notion of a jest unless you tell himthis is a jokeand still less of that finer shade of feeling the halfandhalf in which englishmen naturally delight      every man out of his humour  epilogue    the throat of war be stopt within her land

more astonished shall we be at the immense superiority of shakspeare over his contemporariesand yet what contemporariesgiant minds indeed think of jonsons erudition and the force of learned authority in that age and yet in no genuine part of shakspeares works is there to be found such an absurd rant and ventriloquism as this and too too many other passages ferruminated by jonson from senecas tragedies and the writings of the later romans i call it ventriloquism because sejanus is a puppet out of which the poet makes his own voice appear to come  act v scene of the sacrifice to fortune

of volpone himself a most delightful comedy might be produced by making celia the ward or niece of corvino instead of his wife and bonario her lover     epicÆne  this is to my feelings the most entertaining of old bens comedies and more than any other would admit of being brought out anew if under the management of a judicious and stageunderstanding playwright and an actor who had studied

scene of the 1st act is it a large eartrumpetor rather a tube such as passes from parlour to kitchen instead of a bell  whalleys note at the end   some critics of the last age imagined the character of morose to be wholly out of nature but to vindicate our poet mr dryden tells us from tradition and we may venture to take his word that jonson was really acquainted with a person of this whimsical turn of mind and as humor is a personal quality the poet is acquitted from the charge of exhibiting a monster or an extravagant unnatural caricatura   if dryden had not made all additional proof superfluous by his own plays this very vindication would evince that he had formed a false and vulgar conception of the nature and conditions of the drama and dramatic personation ben jonson would himself have rejected such a plea     for he knew poet never credit gaind   by writing truths but things like truths well feignd   by truths he means facts caricatures are not less so because they are found existing in real life comedy demands characters and leaves caricatures to farce the safest and truest defence of old ben would be to call the epicæne the best of farces the defect in morose as in other of jonsons dramatis personæ lies in thisthat the accident is not a prominence growing out of and nourished by the character which still circulates in it but that the character such as it is rises out of or rather consists in the accident shakspeares comic personages have exquisitely characteristic features however awry disproportionate and laughable they may be still like bardolphs nose they are features but jonsons are either a man with a huge wen having a circulation of its own and which we might conceive amputated and the patient thereby losing all his character or they are mere wens themselves instead of menwens personified or with eyes nose and mouth cut out mandrakefashion  nota bene all the above and much more will have been justly said if and whenever the drama of jonson is brought into comparisons of rivalry with the shakspearian but this should not be let its inferiority to the shakspearian be at once fairly ownedbut at the same time as the inferiority of an altogether different genus of the drama on this ground old ben would still maintain his proud height he no less than shakspeare stands on the summit of his hill and looks round him like a masterthough

a somewhat less degree for beaumont and fletcher in respect of these base and silly sneers at shakspeare is that his plays were present to mens minds chiefly as acted they had not a neat edition of them as we have so as by comparing the one with the other to form a just notion of the mighty mind that produced the whole at all events and in every point of view jonson stands far higher in a moral light than beaumont and fletcher he was a fair contemporary and in his way and as far as shakspeare is concerned an original but beaumont and fletcher were always imitators of and often borrowers from him and yet sneer at him with a spite far more malignant than jonson who besides has made noble compensation by his praises  act ii sc 3     just i mean a child of the hornthumb a babe of booty boy a

a poem until some man undertakes the work who has studied the philosophy of metre this has been found the main torch of sound restoration in the greek dramatists by bentley porson and their followershow much more then in writers in our own language it is true that quantity an almost iron law with the greek is in english rather a subject for a peculiarly fine ear than any law or even rule but then instead of it we have first accent secondly emphasis and lastly retardation and acceleration of the times of syllables according to the meaning of the words the passion that accompanies them and even the character of the person that uses them with due attention to theseabove all to that which requires the most attention and the finest taste the character massinger for example might be

indispensable qualification for an editor of b and fand with this qualification a most interesting and instructive edition might be given this edition of colmans stockdale 1811 is below criticism  in metre b and f are inferior to shakspeare on the one hand as expressing the poetic part of the drama and to massinger on the other in the art of reconciling metre with the natural rhythm of

duties and yet remember he was a bishops son and the duty to god was the supposed basis  personals including body house home and religionproperty subordination and intercommunitythese are the fundamentals of society i mean here religion negatively takenso that the person be not compelled to do or utter in relation of the soul to god what would be in that person a liesuch as to force a man to go to church or to swear that he believes what he does not believe religion positively taken may be a great and useful privilege but cannot be a rightwere it for this only that it cannot be predefined the ground of this distinction between negative and positive religion as a social right is plain no one of my fellowcitizens is encroached on by my not declaring to him what i believe respecting the supersensual but should every man be entitled to preach against the preacher who could hear any preacher now it is different in respect of loyalty there we have positive rights but not negative rightsfor every pretended negative would be in effect a positiveas if a soldier had a right to keep to himself whether he would or would not fight now no one of these fundamentals can be rightfully attacked except when the guardian of it has abused it to subvert one or more of the rest the reason is that the guardian as a fluent is less than the permanent which he is to guard he is the temporary and mutable mean and derives his whole value from the end in short as robbery is not high treason so neither is every unjust act of a king the converse all must be attacked and endangered why because the king as a to a is a mean to a or subordination in a far higher sense than a proprietor as b to b is a mean to b or property  act ii sc 2 claudias speech    chimneypieces c  the whole of this speech seems corrupt and if accurately printedthat is if the same in all the prior editions irremediable but by bold conjecture till my tackle should be i think while c  act iii sc 1 b and f always write as if virtue or goodness were a sort of talisman or strange something that might be lost without the least fault on the part of the owner in short their chaste ladies value their chastity as a material thingnot as an act or state of being and this mere thing being imaginary no wonder that all their women are represented with the minds of strumpets except a few irrational humorists far less capable of exciting our sympathy than a hindoo who has had a bason of cowbroth thrown over himfor this though a debasing superstition is still real and we might pity the poor wretch though we cannot help despising him but b and fs lucinas are clumsy fictions it is too plain that the authors had no one idea of chastity as a virtue but only such a conception as a blind man might have of the power of seeing by handling an oxs eye in the queen of corinth indeed they talk differently but it is all talk and nothing is real in it but the dread of losing a reputation hence the frightful contrast between their women even those who are meant for virtuous and shakspeares so for instance the maid in the milla woman must not merely have grown old in brothels but have chuckled over every abomination committed in them with a rampant sympathy of imagination to have had her fancy so drunk with the minutiæ of lechery as this icy chaste virgin evinces hers to have been  it would be worth while to note how many of these plays are founded on rapeshow many on incestuous passions and how many on mere lunacies then their virtuous women are either crazy superstitions of a merely bodily negation of having been acted on or strumpets in their imaginations and wishes or as in this maid in the mill both at the same time in the men the love is merely lust in one directionexclusive preference of one object the tyrants speeches are mostly taken from the mouths of indignant denouncers of the tyrants character with the substitution of i for he and the omission of the prefatory he acts as if he thought so and so the only feelings they can possibly excite are disgust at the aeciuses if regarded as sane loyalists or compassion if considered as bedlamites so much for their tragedies but even their comedies are most of them disturbed by the fantasticalness or gross caricature of the persons or incidents there are few characters that you can really likeeven though you should have had erased from your mind all the filth which bespatters the most likeable of them as piniero in the island princess for instancescarcely one whom you can love how different this from shakspeare who makes one have a sort of sneaking affection even for his barnardineswhose very iagos and richards are awful and by the counteracting power of profound intellects rendered fearful rather than hatefuland even the exceptions as goneril and regan are proofs of superlative judgment and the finest moral tact in being left utter monsters nulla virtute redemptæ and in being kept out of sight as much as possiblethey being indeed only means for the excitement and deepening of noblest emotions towards the lear cordelia c and employed with the severest economy but even shakspeares grossnessthat which is really so independently of the increase in modern times of vicious associations with things indifferentfor there is a state of manners conceivable so pure that the language of hamlet at ophelias feet might be a harmless rallying or playful teazing of a shame that would exist in paradiseat the worst how diverse in kind is it from beaumont and fletchers in shakspeare it is the mere generalities of sex mere words for the most part seldom or never distinct images all headwork and fancydrolleries there is no sensation supposed in the speaker i need not proceed to contrast this with b and f    rollo  this is perhaps the most energetic of fletchers tragedies he evidently aimed at a new richard iii in rollobut as in all his other imitations of shakspeare he was not philosopher enough to bottom his original thus in rollo he has produced a mere personification of outrageous wickedness with no fundamental characteristic impulses to make either the tyrants words or actions philosophically intelligible hence the most pathetic situations border on the horrible and what he meant for the terrible is either hateful greek transliterated to misaeton or ludicrous the scene of baldwins sentence in the third act is probably the grandest working of passion in all b and fs dramasbut the very magnificence of filial affection given to edith in this noble scene renders the after scenein imitation of one of the least shakspearian of all shakspeares works if it be his the scene between richard and lady annein which edith is yielding to a few words and tears not only unnatural but disgusting in shakspeare lady anne is described as a weak vain very woman throughout  act i sc i    gis he is indeed the perfect character          of a good man and so his actions speak

the best and yet as characteristic specimens of beaumont and fletchers dramas i particularly instance the first scene of the bonduca take shakspeares richard ii and having selected some one scene of about the same number of lines and consisting mostly of long speeches compare it with the first scene in bonducanot for the idle purpose of finding out which is the better but in order to see and

will of the writer is an interfusion a continuous agency and not a series of separate acts shakspeare is the height breadth and depth of genius beaumont and fletcher the excellent mechanism in juxtaposition and succession of talent     the noble gentleman   why have the dramatists of the times of elizabeth james i and the first charles become almost obsolete with the exception of shakspeare why do they no longer belong to the english being once so popular and why is shakspeare an exceptionone thing among fifty necessary to the full solution is that they all employed poetry and poetic diction on unpoetic subjects both characters and situations especially in their comedy now shakspeare is all all idealof no time and therefore for all times read for instance marines panegyric in the first scene of this play     know the eminent court to them that can be wise   and fasten on her blessings is a sun c   what can be more unnatural and inappropriatenot only is but must be felt as suchthan such poetry in the mouth of a silly dupe in short the scenes are mock dialogues in which the poet solus plays the ventriloquist but cannot keep down his own way of expressing himself heavy

 on the prometheus of Æschylus   an essay preparatory to a series of disquisitions respecting the egyptian in connection with the sacerdotal theology and in contrast with the mysteries of ancient greece read at the royal society of literature may 18 1825   the french savans who went to egypt in the train of buonaparte denon fourrier and dupuis it has been asserted triumphantly vindicated the chronology of herodotus on the authority of documents that cannot lienamely the inscriptions and sculptures on those enormous masses of architecture that might seem to have been built in the wish of rivalling the mountains and at some unknown future to answer the same purpose that is to stand the gigantic tombstones of an elder world it is decided say the critics whose words i have before cited that the present division of the zodiac had been already arranged by the egyptians fifteen thousand years before the christian era and according to an inscription which cannot lie the temple of esne is of eight thousand years standing  now in the first place among a people who had placed their national pride in their antiquity i do not see the impossibility of an inscription lying and secondly as little can i see the improbability of a modern interpreter misunderstanding it and lastly the incredibility of a french infidels partaking of both defects is still less evident to my understanding the inscriptions may be and in some instances very probably are of later date than the temples themselvesthe offspring of vanity or priestly rivalry or of certain astrological theories or the temples themselves may have been built in the place of former and ruder structures of an earlier and ruder period and not impossibly under a different scheme of hieroglyphic or significant characters and these may have been intentionally or ignorantly miscopied or mistranslated  but more than all the precedingi cannot but persuade myself that for a man of sound judgment and enlightened common sensea man with whom the demonstrable laws of the human mind and the rules generalized from the great mass of facts respecting human nature weigh more than any two or three detached documents or narrations of whatever authority the narrator may be and however difficult it may be to bring positive proofs against the antiquity of the documentsi cannot but persuade myself i say that for such a man the relation preserved in the first book of the pentateuchand which in perfect accordance with all analogous experience with all the facts of history and all that the principles of political economy would lead us to anticipate conveys to us the rapid progress in civilization and splendour from abraham and abimelech to joseph and pharaohwill be worth a whole library of such inferences  i am aware that it is almost universal to speak of the gross idolatry of egypt nay that arguments have been grounded on this assumption in proof of the divine origin of the mosaic monotheism but first if by this we are to understand that the great doctrine of the one supreme being was first revealed to the hebrew legislator his own inspired writings supply abundant and direct confutation of the position of certain astrological superstitionsof certain talismans connected with starmagicplates and images constructed in supposed harmony with the movements and influences of celestial bodiesthere doubtless exist hints if not direct proofs both in the mosaic writings and those next to these in antiquity but of plain idolatry in egypt or the existence of a polytheistic religion represented by various idols each signifying a several deity i can find no decisive proof in the pentateuch and when i collate these with the books of the prophets and the other inspired writings subsequent to the mosaic i cannot but regard the absence of any such proof in the latter compared with the numerous and powerful assertions or evident implications of egyptian idolatry in the former both as an argument of incomparably greater value in support of the age and authenticity of the pentateuch and as a strong presumption in favour of the hypothesis on which i shall in part ground the theory which will pervade this series of disquisitionsnamely that the sacerdotal religion of egypt had during the interval from abimelech to moses degenerated from the patriarchal monotheism into a pantheism cosmotheism or worship of the world as god  the reason or pretext assigned by the hebrew legislator to pharaoh for leading his countrymen into the wilderness to join with their brethren the tribes who still sojourned in the nomadic state namely that their sacrifices would be an abomination to the egyptians may be urged as inconsistent with nay as confuting this hypothesis but to this i reply first that the worship of the ox and cow was not in and of itself and necessarily a contravention of the first commandment though a very gross breach of the secondfor it is most certain that the ten tribes worshipped the jehovah the god of abraham isaac and jacob under the same or similar symbolssecondly that the cow or isis and the io of the greeks truly represented in the first instance the earth or productive nature and afterwards the mundane religion grounded on the worship of nature or the greek transliterated to pan as god in after times the ox or bull was added representing the sun or generative force of nature according to the habit of male and female deities which spread almost over the whole worldthe positive and negative forces in the science of superstitionfor the pantheism of the sage necessarily engenders polytheism as the popular creed but lastly a very sufficient reason may i think be assigned for the choice of the ox or cow as representing the very life of nature by the first legislators of egypt and for the similar sacred character in the brachmanic tribes of hindostan the progress from savagery to civilization is evidently first from the hunting to the pastoral state a process which even now is going on within our own times among the south american indians in the vast tracts between buenos ayres and the andes but the second and the most important step is from the pastoral or wandering to the agricultural or fixed state now if even for men born and reared under european civilization the charms of a wandering life have been found so great a temptation that few who have taken to it have been induced to return see the confession in the preamble to the statute respecting the gipsies 1how much greater must have been the danger of relapse in the first formation of fixed states with a condensed population and what stronger prevention could the ingenuity of the priestly kingsfor the priestly is ever the first form of governmentdevise than to have made the ox or cow the representatives of the divine principle in the world and as such an object of adoration the wilful destruction of which was sacrilegefor this rendered a return to the pastoral state impossible in which the flesh of these animals and the milk formed almost the exclusive food of mankind while in the meantime by once compelling and habituating men to the use of a vegetable diet it enforced the laborious cultivation of the soil and both produced and permitted a vast and condensed population in the process and continued subdivisions of polytheism this great sacred wordfor so the consecrated animals were called greek transliterated ieroi logoibecame multiplied till almost every power and supposed attribute of nature had its symbol in some consecrated animal from the beetle to the hawk wherever the powers of nature had found a cycle for themselves in which the powers still produced the same phenomenon during a given period whether in the motions of the heavenly orbs or in the smallest living organic body there the egyptian sages predicated life and mind time cyclical time was their abstraction of the deity and their holidays were their gods  the diversity between theism and pantheism may be most simply and generally expressed in the following formula in which the material universe is expressed by w and the deity by g    wgo  or the world without god is an impossible conception this position is common to theist and pantheist but the pantheist adds the converse    gwo  for which the theist substitutes    gwg  or that    gg anterior and irrelative to the existence of the world is equal to   gw 2  before the mountains were thou arti am not about to lead the society beyond the bounds of my subject into divinity or theology in the professional sense but without a precise definition of pantheism without a clear insight into the essential distinction between it and the theism of the scriptures it appears to me impossible to understand either the import or the history of the polytheism of the great historical nations i beg leave therefore to repeat and to carry on my former position that the religion of egypt at the time of the exodus of the hebrews was a pantheism on the point of passing into that polytheism of which it afterwards afforded a specimen gross and distasteful even to polytheists themselves of other nations  the objects which on my appointment as royal associate of the royal society of literature i proposed to myself were  1st the elucidation of the purpose of the greek drama and the relations in which it stood to the mysteries on the one hand and to the state or sacerdotal religion on the other  2nd the connection of the greek tragic poets with philosophy as the peculiar offspring of greek genius  3rd the connection of the homeric and cyclical poets with the popular religion of the greeks and  lastly from all thesenamely the mysteries the sacerdotal religion their philosophy before and after socrates the stage the homeric poetry and the legendary belief of the people and from the sources and productive causes in the derivation and confluence of the tribes that finally shaped themselves into a nation of greeksto give a juster and more distinct view of this singular people and of the place which they occupied in the history of the world and the great scheme of divine providence than i have hitherto seenor rather let me say than it appears to me possible to give by any other process  the present essay however i devote to the purpose of removing or at least invalidating one objection that i may reasonably anticipate and which may be conveyed in the following questionwhat proof have you of the fact of any connection between the greek drama and either the mysteries or the philosophy of greece what proof that it was the office of the tragic poet under a disguise of the sacerdotal religion mixed with the legendary or popular belief to reveal as much of the mysteries interpreted by philosophy as would counteract the demoralizing effects of the state religion without compromising the tranquillity of the state itself or weakening that paramount reverence without which a republic such i mean as the republics of ancient greece were could not exist  i know no better way in which i can reply to this objection than by giving as my proof and instance the prometheus of Æschylus accompanied with an exposition of what i believe to be the intention of the poet and the mythic import of the work of which it may be truly said that it is more properly tragedy itself in the plenitude of the idea than a particular tragic poem and as a preface to this exposition and for the twin purpose of rendering it intelligible and of explaining its connexion with the whole scheme of my essays i entreat permission to insert a quotation from a work of my own which has indeed been in print for many years but which few of my auditors will probably have heard of and still fewer if any have read    as the representative of the youth and approaching manhood of the   human intellect we have ancient greece from orpheus linus musaeus   and the other mythological bards or perhaps the brotherhoods   impersonated under those names to the time when the republics lost   their independence and their learned men sank into copyists of and   commentators on the works of their forefathers that we include these   as educated under a distinct providential though not miraculous   dispensation will surprise no one who reflects that in whatever has   a permanent operation on the destinies and intellectual condition of   mankind at largethat in all which has been manifestly employed as a   coagent in the mightiest revolution of the moral world the   propagation of the gospel and in the intellectual progress of mankind   in the restoration of philosophy science and the ingenuous artsit   were irreligion not to acknowledge the hand of divine providence the   periods too join on to each other the earliest greeks took up the   religious and lyrical poetry of the hebrews and the schools of the   prophets were however partially and imperfectly represented by the   mysteries derived through the corrupt channel of the phoenicians with   these secret schools of physiological theology the mythical poets   were doubtless in connexion and it was these schools which prevented   polytheism from producing all its natural barbarizing effects the   mysteries and the mythical hymns and pæans shaped themselves gradually   into epic poetry and history on the one hand and into the ethical   tragedy and philosophy on the other under their protection and that   of a youthful liberty secretly controlled by a species of internal   theocracy the sciences and the sterner kinds of the fine arts that   is architecture and statuary grew up together followed indeed by   painting but a statuesque and austerely idealized painting which   did not degenerate into mere copies of the sense till the process for   which greece existed had been completed3  the greeks alone brought forth philosophy in the proper and contradistinguishable sense of the term which we may compare to the coronation medal with its symbolic characters as contrasted with the coins issued under the same sovereign current in the market in the primary sense philosophy had for its aim and proper subject the greek transliterated ta peri archon de originibus rerum as far as man proposes to discover the same in and by the pure reason alone this i say was the offspring of greece and elsewhere adopted only the predisposition appears in their earliest poetry  the first object or subject matter of greek philosophizing was in some measure philosophy itselfnot indeed as the product but as the producing powerthe productivity great minds turned inward on the fact of the diversity between man and beast a superiority of kind in addition to that of degree the latter that is the difference in degree comprehending the more enlarged sphere and the multifold application of faculties common to man and brute animalseven this being in great measure a transfusion from the former namely from the superiority in kindfor only by its coexistence with reason free will selfconsciousness the contradistinguishing attributes of man does the instinctive intelligence manifested in the ant the dog the elephant c become human understanding it is a truth with which heraclitus the senior but yet contemporary of Æschylus appears from the few genuine fragments of his writings that are yet extant to have been deeply impressedthat the mere understanding in man considered as the power of adapting means to immediate purposes differs indeed from the intelligence displayed by other animals and not in degree only but yet does not differ by any excellence which it derives from itself or by any inherent diversity but solely in consequence of a combination with far higher powers of a diverse kind in one and the same subject  long before the entire separation of metaphysics from poetry that is while yet poesy in all its several species of verse music statuary c continued mythicwhile yet poetry remained the union of the sensuous and the philosophic mindthe efficient presence of the latter in the synthesis of the two had manifested itself in the sublime mythus peri geneseos tou nou en anthropois concerning the genesis or birth of the nous or reason in man this the most venerable and perhaps the most ancient of grecian myth is a philosopheme the very same in subject matter with the earliest record of the hebrews but most characteristically different in tone and conceptionfor the patriarchal religion as the antithesis of pantheism was necessarily personal and the doctrines of a faith the first ground of which and the primary enunciation is the eternal i am must be in part historic and must assume the historic form hence the hebrew record is a narrative and the first instance of the fact is given as the origin of the fact  that a profound trutha truth that is indeed the grand and indispensable condition of all moral responsibilityis involved in this characteristic of the sacred narrative i am not alone persuaded but distinctly aware this hovever does not preclude us from seeing nay as an additional mark of the wisdom that inspired the sacred historian it rather supplies a motive to us impels and authorizes us to see in the form of the vehicle of the truth an accommodation to the then childhood of the human race under this impression we may i trust safely consider the narrationintroduced as it is here introduced for the purpose of explaining a mere work of the unaided mind of man by comparisonas an greek transliterated eros hierogluphikonand as such apparently i mean not actually a synthesis of poesy and philosophy characteristic of the childhood of nations  in the greek we see already the dawn of approaching manhood the substance the stuff is philosophy the form only is poetry the prometheus is a philosophema greek transliterated tautaegorikon the tree of knowledge of good and evilan allegory a greek transliterated propaideuma though the noblest and the most pregnant of its kind  the generation of the greek transliterated nous or pure reason in man  1 it was superadded or infused a supra to mark that it was no mere evolution of the animal basisthat it could not have grown out of the other faculties of man his life sense understanding as the flower grows out of the stem having preexisted potentially in the seed  2 the greek nous or fire was stolento mark its heleroor rather its allogeneity that is its diversity its difference in kind from the faculties which are common to man with the nobler animals  3 and stolen from heavento mark its superiority in kind as well as its essential diversity  4 and it was a sparkto mark that it is not subject to any modifying reaction from that on which it immediately acts that it suffers no change and receives no accession from the inferior but multiplies itself by conversion without being alloyed by or amalgamated with that which it potentiates ennobles and transmutes  5 and lastly in order to imply the homogeneity of the donor and of the gift it was stolen by a god and a god of the race before the dynasty of jovejove the binder of reluctant powers the coercer arid entrancer of free spirits under the fetters of shape and mass and passive mobility but likewise by a god of the same race and essence with jove and linked of yore in closest and friendliest intimacy with him this to mark the preexistence in order of thought of the nous as spiritual both to the objects of sense and to their products formed as it were by the precipitation or if i may dare adopt the bold language of leibnitz by a coagulation of spirit in other words this derivation of the spark from above and from a god anterior to the jovial dynastythat is to the submersion of spirits in material formswas intended to mark the transcendancy of the nous the contradistinctive faculty of man as timeless greek transliterated achronon ti and in this negative sense eternal it signified i say its superiority to and its diversity from all things that subsist in space and time nay even those which though spaceless yet partake of time namely souls or understandings for the soul or understanding if it be defined physiologically as the principle of sensibility irritability and growth together with the functions of the organs which are at once the representatives and the instruments of these must be considered in genere though not in degree or dignity common to man and the inferior animals it was the spirit the nous which man alone possessed and i must be permitted to suggest that this notion deserves some respect were it only that it can shew a semblance at least of sanction from a far higher authority  the greeks agreed with the cosmogonies of the east in deriving all sensible forms from the indistinguishable the latter we find designated as the greek to amorphon the greek hudor prokosmikon the greek chaos as the essentially unintelligible yet necessarily presumed basis or subposition of all positions that it is scientifically considered an indispensable idea for the human mind just as the mathematical point c for the geometricianof this the various systems of our geologists and cosmogonists from burnet to la place afford strong presumption as an idea it must be interpreted as a striving of the mind to distinguish being from existenceor potential being the ground of being containing the possibility of existence from being actualized in the language of the mysteries it was the esurience the greek pothos or desideratum the unfuelled fire the ceres the everseeking maternal goddess the origin and interpretation of whose name is found in the hebrew root signifying hunger and thence capacity it was in short an effort to represent the universal ground of all differences distinct or opposite but in relation to which all antithesis as well as all antitheta existed only potentially this was the container and withholder such is the primitive sense of the hebrew word rendered darkness gen 1 2 out of which light that is the lux lucifica as distinguished from lumen seu lux phænomenalis was producedsay rather that which producing itself into light as the one pole or antagonist power remained in the other pole as darkness that is gravity or the principle of mass or wholeness without distinction of parts  and here the peculiar the philosophic genius of greece began its f¦tal throb here it individualized itself in contradistinction from the hebrew archology on the one side and from the ph¦nician on the other the ph¦nician confounded the indistinguishable with the absolute the alpha and omega the ineffable causa sui it confounded i say the multeity below intellect that is unintelligible from defect of the subject with the absolute identity above all intellect that is transcending comprehension by the plenitude of its excellence with the phoenician sages the cosmogony was their theogony and vice versa hence too flowed their theurgic rites their magic their worship cultus et apotheosis of the plastic forces chemical and vital and these or their notions respecting these formed the hidden meaning the soul as it were of which the popular and civil worship was the body with its drapery  the hebrew wisdom imperatively asserts an unbeginning creative one who neither became the world nor is the world eternally nor made the world out of himself by emanation or evolutionbut who willed it and it was greek ta athea egeneto kai egeneto chaosand this chaos the eternal will by the spirit and the word or express fiatagain acting as the impregnant distinctive and ordonnant powerenabled to become a worldgreek kosmeisthai so must it be when a religion that shall preclude superstition on the one hand and brute indifference on the other is to be true for the meditative sage yet intelligible or at least apprehensible for all but the fools in heart  the greek philosopheme preserved for us in the Æschylean prometheus stands midway betwixt both yet is distinct in kind from either with the hebrew or purer semitic it assumes an x y zi take these letters in their algebraic applicationan indeterminate elohim antecedent to the matter of the world greek hulae akosmosno less than to the greek hulae kekosmaemenae in this point likewise the greek accorded with the semitic and differed from the phoenicianthat it held the antecedent x y z to be supersensuous and divine but on the other hand it coincides with the ph¦nician in considering this antecedent ground of corporeal mattergreek ton somaton kai tou somatikounot so properly the cause of the latter as the occasion and the still continuing substance maleria substat adliuc the corporeal was supposed coessential with the antecedent of its corporeity matter as distinguished from body was a non ens a simple apparition id quod mere videtur but to body the elder physicotheology of the greeks allowed a participation in entity it was spiritus ipse oppressus dormiens et diversis modis somnians in short body was the productive power suspended and as it were quenched in the product this may be rendered plainer by reflecting that in the pure semitic scheme there are four terms introduced in the solution of the problem  1 the beginning selfsufficing and immutable creator  2 the antecedent night as the identity or including germ of the light and darkness that is gravity  3 the chaos and  4 the material world resulting from the powers communicated by the divine fiat in the phoenician scheme there are in fact but twoa selforganizing chaos and the omniforrn nature as the result in the greek scheme we have three terms 1 the hyle greek hulae which holds the place of the chaos or the waters in the true system 2 greek ta somata answering to the mosaic heaven and earth and 3 the saturnian greek chronoi huperchonioiwhich answer to the antecedent darkness of the mosaic scheme but to which the elder physicotheologists attributed a selfpolarizing powera natura gemina quæ fit et facit agit et patitur in other words the elohim of the greeks were still but a natura deorum greek to theion in which a vague plurality adhered or if any unity was imagined it was not personalnot a unity of excellence but simply an expression of the negativethat which was to pass but which had not yet passed into distinct form  all this will seem strange and obscure at first readingperhaps fantastic but it will only seem so dry and prolix indeed it is to me in the writing full as much as it can be to others in the attempt to understand it but i know that once mastered the idea will be the key to the whole cypher of the Æschylean mythology the sum stated in the terms of philosophic logic is this first what moses appropriated to the chaos itself what moses made passive and a materia subjecta et lucis et tenebrarum the containing greek prothemenon of the thesis and antithesisthis the greek placed anterior to the chaosthe chaos itself being the struggle between the hyperchronia the greek ideai pronomoi as the unevolved unproduced prothesis of which greek idea kai nomosidea and laware the thesis and antithesis i use the word produced in the mathematical sense as a point elongating itself to a bipolar line secondly what moses establishes not merely as a transcendant monas but as an individual greek henas likewisethis the greek took as a harmony greek theoi hathanatoi to theion as distinguished from greek o theosor to adopt the more expressive language of the pythagoreans and cabalists numen numerantis and these are to be contemplated as the identity  now according to the greek philosopheme or mythus in these or in this identity there arose a war schism or division that is a polarization into thesis and antithesis in consequence of this schism in the greek to theion the thesis becomes nomos or law and the antithesis becomes idea but so that the nomos is nomos because and only because the idea is idea the nomos is not idea only because the idea has not become nomos and this not must be heedfully borne in mind through the whole interpretation of this most profound and pregnant philosopheme the nomos is essentially idea but existentially it is idea substans that is id quod stat subtus understanding sensu generalissimo the idea which now is no longer idea has substantiated itself become real as opposed to idea and is henceforward therefore substans in substantiato the first product of its energy is the thing itself ipsa se posuit et jam facta est ens positum still however its productive energy is not exhausted in this product but overflows or is effluent as the specific forces properties faculties of the product it reappears in short in the body as the function of the body as a sufficient illustration though it cannot be offered as a perfect instance take the following    in the world we see every where evidences of a unity which the   component parts are so far from explaining that they necessarily   presuppose it as the cause and condition of their existing as those   parts or even of their existing at all this antecedent unity or   cause and principle of each union it has since the time of bacon and   kepler been customary to call a law this crocus for instance or   any flower the reader may have in sight or choose to bring before his   fancythat the root stem leaves petals c cohere as one plant   is owing to an antecedent power or principle in the seed which   existed before a single particle of the matters that constitute the   size and visibility of the crocus had been attracted from the   surrounding soil air and moisture shall we turn to the seed here   too the same necessity meets us an antecedent unity i speak not of   the parent plant but of an agency antecedent in order of operance   yet remaining present as the conservative and reproductive power   must here too be supposed analyze the seed with the finest tools and   let the solar microscope come in aid of your senseswhat do you   findmeans and instruments a wondrous fairytale of nature   magazines of food stores of various sorts pipes spiracles   defencesa house of many chambers and the owner and inhabitant   invisible4  now compare a plant thus contemplated with an animal in the former the productive energy exhausts itself and as it were sleeps in the product or organismusin its root stem foliage blossoms seed its balsams gums resins aromata and all other bases of its sensible qualities are it is well known mere excretions from the vegetable eliminated as lifeless from the actual plant the qualities are not its properties but the properties or far rather the dispersion and volatilization of these extruded and rejected bases but in the animal it is otherwise here the antecedent unitythe productive and selfrealizing ideastrives with partial success to reemancipate itself from its product and seeks once again to become idea vainly indeed for in order to this it must be retrogressive and it hath subjected itself to the fates the evolvers of the endless threadto the stern necessity of progression idea itself it cannot become but it may in long and graduated process become an image an analogon an antitype of idea and this greek eidolon may approximate to a perfect likeness quod est simile nequit esse idem thus in the lower animals we see this process of emancipation commence with the intermediate link or that which forms the transition from properties to faculties namely with sensation then the faculties of sense locomotion construction as for instance webs hives nests c then the functions as of instinct memory fancy instinctive intelligence or understanding as it exists in the most intelligent animals thus the idea henceforward no more idea but irrecoverable by its own fatal act commences the process of its own transmutation as substans in substantiato as the enteleche or the vis formatrix and it finishes the process as substans e substantiato that is as the understanding  if for the purpose of elucidating this process i might be allowed to imitate the symbolic language of the algebraists and thus to regard the successive steps of the process as so many powers and dignities of the nomos or law the scheme would be represented thus n1 represents n superscript 1 ie n to the power of 1 text ed    nomos1  product   n2  property   n3  faculty   n4  function   n5  understanding  which is indeed in one sense itself a nomos inasmuch as it is the index of the nomos as well as its highest function but like the hand of a watch it is likewise a nomizomenon it is a verb but still a verb passive  on the other hand idea is so far coessential with nomos that by its coexistencenot confluencewith the nomos greek hen nomizomenois with the organismus and its faculties and functions in the man it becomes itself a nomos but observe a nomos autonomos or containing its law in itself likewiseeven as the nomos produces for its highest product the understanding so the idea in its opposition and of course its correspondence to the nomos begets in itself an analogon to product and this is selfconsciousness but as the product can never become idea so neither can the idea if it is to remain idea become or generate a distinct product this analogon of product is to be itself but were it indeed and substantially a product it would cease to be self it would be an object for a subject not as it is and must be an object that is its own subject and vice versa a conception which if the uncombining and infusile genius of our language allowed it might be expressed by the term subjectobject now idea taken in indissoluble connection with this analogon of product is mind that which knows itself and the existence of which may be inferred but cannot appear or become a phænomenon  by the benignity of providence the truths of most importance in themselves and which it most concerns us to know are familiar to us even from childhood well for us if we do not abuse this privilege and mistake the familiarity of words which convey these truths for a clear understanding of the truths themselves if the preceding disquisition with all its subtlety and all its obscurity should answer no other purpose it will still have been neither purposeless nor devoid of utility should it only lead us to sympathize with the strivings of the human intellect awakened to the infinite importance of the inward oracle greek gnothi seautonand almost instinctively shaping its course of search in conformity with the platonic intimationgreek psuchaes phusin haxios logou katanoaesai oiei dunaton einai haneu aes tou holou phuseos but be this as it may the ground work of the Æschylean mythus is laid in the definition of idea and law as correlatives that mutually interpret each the otheran idea with the adequate power of realizing itself being a law and a law considered abstractedly from or in the absence of the power of manifesting itself in its appropriate product being an idea whether this be true philosophy is not the question the school of aristotle would of course deny the platonic affirm it for in this consists the difference of the two schools both acknowledge ideas as distinct from the mere generalizations from objects of sense both would define an idea as an ens rationale to which there can be no adequate correspondent in sensible experience but according to aristotle ideas are regulative only and exist only as functions of the mindaccording to plato they are constitutive likewise and one in essence with the power and life of naturegreek hen logo zoae aen kai hae zoae haen to phos ton anthropon and this i assert was the philosophy of the mythic poets who like Æschylus adapted the secret doctrines of the mysteries as the not always safely disguised antidote to the debasing influences of the religion of the state  but to return and conclude this preliminary explanation we have only to substitute the term will and the term constitutive power for nomos or law and the process is the same permit me to represent the identity or prothesis by the letter z and the thesis and antithesis by x and y respectively then i say x by not being y but in consequence of being the correlative opposite of y is will and y by not being x but the correlative and opposite of x is naturenatura naturans greek nomos physikos hence we may see the necessity of contemplating the idea now as identical with the reason and now as one with the will and now as both in one in which last case i shall for convenience sake employ the term nous the rational will the practical reason  we are now out of the holy jungle of transcendental mataphysics if indeed the readers patience shall have had strength and persistency enough to allow me to exclaim    ivimus ambo   per densas umbras at tenet umbra deum   not that i regard the foregoing as articles of faith or as all truei have implied the contrary by contrasting it with at least by shewing its disparateness from the mosaic which bona fide i do regard as the truth but i believe there is much and profound truth in it supra captum greek psilosophon qui non agnoscunt divinum ideoque nec naturam nisi nomine agnoscunt sed res cunctas ex sensuali corporeo cogitant quibus hac ex causa interiora clausa manent et simul cum illis exteriora quæ proxima interioribus sunt and with no less confidence do i believe that the positions above given true or false are contained in the promethean mythus  in this mythus jove is the impersonated representation or symbol of the nomosjupiter est quodcunque vides he is the mens agitans molem but at the same time the molem corpoream ponens et constituens and so far the greek philosopheme does not differ essentially from the cosmotheism or identification of god with the universe in which consisted the first apostacy of mankind after the flood when they combined to raise a temple to the heavens and which is still the favored religion of the chinese prometheus in like manner is the impersonated representative of idea or of the same power as jove but contemplated as independent and not immersed in the productas law minus the productive energy as such it is next to be seen what the several significances of each must or may be according to the philosophic conception and of which significances therefore should we find in the philosopheme a correspondent to each we shall be entitled to assert that such are the meanings of the fable and first of jove  jove represents  1 nomos generally as opposed to idea or nous  2 nomos archinomos now as the father now as the sovereign and now as the includer and representative of

most gratefully ought we to acknowledge that since the completion of our constitution in 1688 we may with unflattering truth elucidate the spirit and character of such a church by the contrast of the institution to which england owes the larger portion of its superiority in that in which alone superiority is an unmixed blessingthe diffused cultivation of its inhabitants but previously to this period i shall offend no enlightened man if i say without distinction of partiesintra muros peccatur et extrathat the history of christendom presents us with too many illustrations of this junonian jealousy this factious harrassing of the sovereign power as soon as the latter betrayed any symptoms of a disposition to its true policy namely to privilege and perpetuate that which is bestto tolerate the tolerableand to restrain none but those who would restrain all and subjugate even the state itself but while truth extorts this confession it at the same time requires that it should be accompanied by an avowal of the fact that the spirit is a relic of paganism and with a bitter smile would an Æschylus or a plato in the shades listen to a gibbon or a hume vaunting the mild and tolerant spirit of the state religions of ancient greece or rome here we have the sense of joves intrigues with europa io c whom the god in his own nature a general lover had successively taken under his protection and here too see the full appropriateness of this part of the mythus in which symbol fades away into allegory but yet in reference to the working cause as grounded in humanity and always existing either actually or potentially and thus never ceases wholly to be a symbol or tautegory  prometheus represents  1 sensu generali idea greek pronomos and in this sense he is a greek theos homophulos a fellowtribesman both of the dii majores with jove at their head and of the titans or dii pacati  2 he represents idea greek philonomos nomodeiktaes and in this sense the former friend and counsellor of jove or nous uranius  3 greek logos philanthropos the divine humanity the humane god who retained unseen kept back or in the catachresis characteristic of the phoeniciogrecian

things should have existed either as pure divinity the sole property and birthright of the dii joviales the uranions or was conceded to inferior beings as a substans in substantiato this spark divine prometheus gave to an elect a favored animal not as a substans or understanding commensurate with and confined by the constitution and conditions of this particular organism but as aliquid superstans liberum non subactum invictum impacatum greek mae nouizomenon this gift by which we are to understand reason theoretical and practical was therefore a greek nomos autonomusunapproachable and unmodifiable by the animal basisthat is by the preexisting substans with its products the animal organismus with its faculties and functions but yet endowed with the power of potentiating ennobling and prescribing to the substance and hence therefore a greek nomos nomopeithaes lex legisuada  4 by a transition ordinary even in allegory and appropriate to mythic symbol but especially significant in the present casethe transition i mean from the giver to the giftthe giver in very truth being the gift whence the soul receives reason and reason is her being says our milton reason is from god and god is reason mens ipsissima  5 prometheus represents greek nous en anthroponous agonistaes thus contemplated the nous is of necessity powerless for all power that is productivity or productive energy is in law that is greek nomos allotrionomos1 still however the idea in the law the numerus numerans become greek nomos is the principle of the law and if with law dwells power so with the knowledge or the idea scientialis of the law dwells prophecy and foresight a perfect astronomical timepiece in relation to the motions of the heavenly bodies or the magnet in the mariners compass in relation to the magnetism of the earth is a sufficient illustration  6 both greek nomos and idea or nous are the verbum but as in the former it is verbum fiat the word of the lordin the latter it must be the verbum fiet or the word of the lord in the mouth of the prophet pari argumento as the knowledge is therefore not power the power is not knowledge the greek nomos the greek zeus pantokrator seeks to learn and as it were to wrest the secret the hateful secret of his own fate namely the transitoriness adherent to all antithesis for the identity or the absolute is alone eternal this secret jove would extort from the nous or prometheus which is the sixth representment of prometheus  7 introduce but the least of real as opposed to ideal the least speck of positive existence even though it were but the mote in a sun beam into the sciential contemplamen or theorem and it ceases to be science ratio desinit esse pura ratio et fit discursus stat subter et fit greek hypothetikonnon superstat the nous is bound to a rock the immovable firmness of which is indissolubly connected with its barrenness its nonproductivity were it productive it would be nomos but it is nous because it is not nomos  8 solitary greek abato en eraemia now i say that the nous notwithstanding its diversity from the nomizomeni is yet relatively to their supposed original essence greek pasi tois nomizomenois tantogenaes of the same race or radix though in another sense namely in relation to the greek pan theionthe pantheistic elohim it is conceived anterior to the schism and to the conquest and enthronization of jove who succeeded hence the prometheus of the great tragedian is greek theos suggenaes the kindred deities come to him some to soothe to condole others to give weak yet friendly counsels of submission others to tempt or insult the most prominent of the latter and the most odious to the imprisoned and insulated nous is hermes the impersonation of interest with the entrancing and serpentine caduceus and as interest or motives intervening between the reason and its immediate selfdeterminations with the antipathies to the greek nomos autonomos the hermes impersonates the eloquence of cupidity the cajolement of power regnant and in a larger sense custom the irrational in language greek rhaemata ta rhaetorika the fluent from greek rheothe rhetorical in opposition to greek logoi ta noaeta but primarily the hermes is the symbol of interest he is the messenger the internuncio in the low but expressive phrase the gobetween to beguile or insult and for the other visitors of prometheus the elementary powers or spirits of the elements titanes pacati greek theoi huponomioi vassal potentates and their solicitations the noblest interpretation will be given if i repeat the lines of our great contemporary poet    earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own   yearnings she hath in her own natural kind   and een with something of a mothers mind   and no unworthy aim the homely nurse doth

nomos politikosby custom hermes by necessity greek bia kai kratosby the mechanic arts and powers greek suggeneis to noo though they are and which are symbolized in hephaistoswe shall see at once the propriety of the title prometheus greek desmotaes  9 nature or zeus as the greek nomos en nomizomenois knows herself only can only come to a knowledge of herself in man and even in man only as man is supernatural above nature noetic but this knowledge man refuses to communicate that is the human understanding alone is at once selfconscious and conscious of nature and this high prerogative it owes exclusively to its being an assessor of the reason yet even the human understanding in its height of place seeks vainly to appropriate the ideas of the pure reason which it can only represent by idola here then the nous stands as prometheus greek antipalos renuensin hostile opposition to jupitor inquisitor  10 yet finally against the obstacles and even under the fostering influences of the nomos greek tou nomimou a son of jove himself but a descendant from io the mundane religion as contradistinguished from the sacerdotal cultus or religion of the state an alcides liberator will arise and the nous or divine principle in man will be prometheus greek heleutheromenos  did my limits or time permit me to trace the persecutions wanderings and migrations of the io the mundane religion through the

agency or it is a selfsubsisting derivative from and dependent on the divine will in either case this authors assertion would amount to a charge of selfcontradiction on the author of all things before

prevalence of infidelity and enthusiasm by walter birch b d   in the description of enthusiasm the author has plainly had in view individual characters and those too in a light in which they appeared to him not clear and discriminate ideas hence a mixture of truth and error of appropriate and inappropriate terms which it is scarcely possible to disentangle part applies to fanaticism part to enthusiasm and no small portion of this latter to enthusiasm not pure but as it exists in particular men modified by their imperfectionsand bad because not wholly enthusiasm i regret this because it is evidently the discourse of a very powerful mindand because i am convinced that the disease of the age is want of enthusiasm and a tending to fanaticism you may very naturally object that the senses in which i use the two terms fanaticism and enthusiasm are private interpretations equally as if not more than mr birchs they are so but the difference between us is that without reference to either term i have attempted to ascertain the existence and diversity of two states of moral being and then having found in our language two words of very fluctuating and indeterminate use indeed but the one word more frequently bordering on the one state the other on the other i try to fix each to that state exclusively and herein i follow the practice of all scientific men whether naturalists or metaphysicians and the dictate of common sense that one word ought to have but one meaning thus by hobbes and others of the materialists compulsion and obligation were used indiscriminately but the distinction of the two senses is the condition of all moral responsibility now the effect of mr birchs use of the words is to continue the confusion remember we could not reason at all if our conceptions and terms were not more single and definite than the things designated enthusiasm is the absorption of the individual in the object contemplated from the vividness or intensity of his conceptions and convictions fanaticism is heat or accumulation and direction of feeling acquired by contagion and relying on the sympathy of sect or confederacy intense sensation with confused or dim conceptions hence the fanatic can exist only in a crowd from inward weakness anxious for outward confirmation and therefore an eager proselyter and intolerant the enthusiast on the contrary is a solitary who lives in a world of his own peopling and for that cause is disinclined to outward action lastly enthusiasm is susceptible of many degrees according to the proportionateness of the objects contemplated from the highest grandeur of moral and intellectual being even to madness but fanaticism is one and the same and appears different only from the manners and original temperament of the individual there is a white and a red heat a sullen glow as well as a crackling flame coldblooded as well as hotblooded fanaticism enthusiasts greek enthousiastai from greek entheos ois ho theos enesi

righteousness of our own faith alone is the restorative the romish scheme is preposterousit puts the rill before the spring faith is the sourcecharity that is the whole christian life is the stream from it it is quite childish to talk of faith being imperfect without charity as wisely might you say that a fire however bright and strong was imperfect without heat or that the sun however cloudless was imperfect without beams the true answer would beit is not faithbut utter reprobate faithlessness which may indeed very possibly coexist with a mere acquiescence of the understanding in certain facts recorded by the evangelists but did john or paul or martin luther ever flatter this barren belief with the name of saving faith no little ones be not deceived wear at your bosoms that precious

life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me  thus we see even our faith is not ours in its origin but is the faith of the son of god graciously communicated to us beware therefore that you do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain if therefore we are saved by charity we are saved by the keeping of the law which doctrine st paul declared to be an apostacy from christ and a bewitching of the soul from the truth but you will perhaps say can a man be saved without charitythe

gradual but sudden instantaneous and incompatible with the life and subsistency of the animals and vegetables in these high latitudes at that period and previously existing  now these data or conditions will be afforded if we assume a total submersion of the surface of this planet even of its highest mountains then and now existing by a sudden contemporaneous mass of waters and that the evaporation of these waters was aided by a steady wind especially adapted to this purpose in a peculiarly dry atmosphere and was as it must of necessity have been most rapid and intense at the equator and within the tropics proportionally foras it has been demonstrated by dr wollastons experiment in which the evaporation occasioned by boiling water at the mid point of a line of water froze the fluid at the two ends that is at a given distance from the greatest intensity of the evaporative processthe effect of an evaporation of the supposed power and rapidity would be to produce at certain distances from the maximum point north and south a vast barrier of icesuch as having once taken place and being of such mass and magnitude as to be only in a small degree diminishable by the ensuing summer must have become permanent and beyond the power of all the known and ordinary dissolving agents of nature that the situation of the magnetic poles of the earth and the almost certain connection of magnetism with cold no less than with metallic cohesion cooperated in determining the distance of the barriers or two poles of evaporation from its centre or the maximum of its activity is highly probable and receives a strong confirmation from the open sea and diminished cold both at the north and south zones on the ulterior of the barrier and towards the true or physical poles of the earth

succession of leaves talk continually the language of deliberate reason in a form of continued preconception of a z already possessed when a was being utteredthis must have appeared godlike i feel

jones of the present day without perhaps being in the ground a better man would have perished rather than submit to be kept by a harridan of fortune therefore this novel is and indeed pretends to be no exemplar of conduct but notwithstanding all this i do loathe the cant which can recommend pamela and clarissa harlowe as strictly moral though they poison the imagination of the young with continued doses of tinct lyttae while tom jones is prohibited as loose i do not speak of young womenbut a young man whose heart or feelings can be injured or even his passions excited by aught in this novel is already thoroughly corrupt there is a cheerful sunshiny breezy spirit that prevails everywhere strongly contrasted with the close hot daydreamy continuity of richardson every indiscretion every immoral act of tom jones and it must be remembered that he is in every one taken by surprisehis inward principles remaining firm is so instantly punished by embarrassment and unanticipated evil consequences of his folly that the readers mind is not left for a moment to dwell or run riot on the criminal indulgence itself in short let the requisite allowance be made for the increased refinement of our mannersand then i dare believe that no young man who consulted his heart and conscience only without adverting to what the world would saycould rise from the perusal of fieldings tom

events relatively to fielding himself and with regard to the state of manners in his time  book xvi ch 5    that refined degree of platonic affection which is absolutely detached   from the flesh and

readiness resign a lover to a rival when such resignation was   proved to be necessary for the temporal interest of such lover  i firmly believe that there are men capable of such a sacrifice and this

an equal superiority in sound shrewd good sense and freedom of intellect had not looked through the two latin folios of paracelsuss works it is not to be doubted that a rich and delightful article would have been the result for who like fuller could have brought out and set forth this singular compound of true philosophic genius with the morals of a quack and the manners of a king of the gypsies nevertheless paracelsus belonged to his agethe dawn of experimental science and a well written critique on his life and writings would present through the magnifying glass of a caricature the

christian court and under the light of protestantism it is marvellous it would be well to ascertain if possible the earliest date of this contrivance whether it existed under the plantagenets or whether first under the tudors or lastly whether it was a precious import from scotland with gentle king jamie  ib c 21 the king    he is a mortal god  compare the fulsome flattery of these and other passages in this volume though modest to the common language of jamess priestly courtiers with the loyal but free and manly tone of fullers later works towards the close of charles the firsts reign

dignitaries tried for a while to renew the old kinggodding mumpsimus but the second charles laughed at them and they quarrelled with his successor and hated the hero who delivered them from him too

complaint with hundreds yea it is an old cuckoo song of grim saints that the reformation came to its close long before it came to its completion but the cause of this imperfection has been fully laid open by no partyscilicet that in divines of both parties of the reformers the protestants and the detestants there was the same relic of the roman luesthe habit of deciding for or against the orthodoxy of a position not according to its truth or falsehood not on grounds of reason or of history but by the imagined consequences of the position the very same principles on which the pontifical polemics vindicate the papal infallibility fuller et centum alii apply to the if possible still more extravagant notion of the absolute truth and divinity of every syllable of the text of the books of the old and new testament as we have it  ib    sure i am that one of as much meekness as some are of moroseness   even upright moses himself in his service of the essential and   increated truth of higher consequence than the historical truth   controverted betwixt us had notwithstanding a respect to the   reward heb xi 26  in religion the faith presupposed in the respect and as its condition

when we see the heavy weight of prejudices the universal code of his age incumbent on his judgment and which nevertheless left sanity of opinion the general character of his writings this remark was suggested by the term monster attached to the worthy cambrian pelagiusthe teacher arminianismi ante arminium  b ii cent 6 s 8    whereas in holy writ when the apostles and the papists commonly call   augustine the english apostle how properly we shall see hereafter   went to a foreign nation god gave them the language thereof c  what a loss that fuller has not made a reference to his authorities for this assertion i am sure he could have found none in the new testament but facts that imply and in the absence of all such proof prove the contrary  ib s 6    thus we see the whole week bescattered with saxon idols whose pagan   gods were the godfathers of the days and gave them their names this   some zealot may behold as the object of a necessary reformation   desiring to have the

knowledge  a curious prediction fulfilled a few years after in the quakers and well worthy of being extracted and addressed to the present friends  memorandumit is the error of the friends but natural and common to almost all sectsthe perversion of the wisdom of the first establishers of their sect into their own folly by not distinguishing between the conditionally right and the permanently and essentially so for example it was right conditionally in the apostles to forbid black puddings even to the gentile christians and it was wisdom in them but to continue the prohibition would be folly and judaism in us the elder church very sensibly distinguished episcopal from apostolic inspiration the episcopal spirit that which dictated what was fit and profitable for a particular community or

between whitgift and bancroft during their rule and bonner and gardiner in the reign of mary i will be thankful to him in my heart and for him in my prayers one difference i see namely that the former professing the new testament to be their rule and guide and making the fallibility of all churches and individuals an article of faith were more inconsistent and therefore less excusable than the popish persecutors 30 aug 1824  nb the crimes murderous as they were were the vice and delusion of the age and it is ignorance to lack charity towards the persons papist or protestant but the tone the spirit characterizes and belongs to the individual for example the bursting spleen of this bancroft not so satisfied with this precious arbitrator for having precondemned his opponents as fierce and surly with him for not hanging them up unheard  at the end next to shakspeare i am not certain whether thomas fuller beyond all other writers does not excite in me the sense and emotion of the marvellousthe degree in which any given faculty or combination of faculties is possessed and manifested so far surpassing what one would have thought possible in a single mind as to give ones admiration the flavour and quality of wonder wit was the stuff and substance of fullers intellect it was the element the earthen base the material which he worked in and this very circumstance has defrauded him of his due praise for the practical wisdom of the thoughts for the beauty and variety of the truths into which he shaped the stuff fuller was incomparably the most sensible the least prejudiced great man of an age that boasted a galaxy of great men he is a very voluminous writer and yet in all his numerous volumes on so many different subjects it is scarcely too much to say that you will hardly find a page in which some one sentence out of every three does not deserve to be quoted for itselfas motto or as maxim god bless thee dear old man may i meet with theewhich is tantamount tomay i go to heaven  july 1829      asgills argument    that according to the covenant of eternal life revealed in the   scriptures man may be translated from hence into that eternal life   without passing through death although the human nature of christ   himself could not be thus translated till he had passed through   death edit 1715  if i needed an illustrative example of the distinction between the reason and the understanding between spiritual sense and logic this treatise of asgills would supply it excuse the defect of all idea or spiritual intuition of god and allow yourself to bring him as plaintiff or defendant into a commonlaw courtand then i cannot conceive a clearer or cleverer piece of special pleading than asgill has here given the language is excellentidiomatic simple perspicuous at once significant and lively that is expressive of the thought and also of a manly proportion of feeling appropriate to it in short it is the ablest attempt to exhibit a scheme of religion without ideas that the inherent contradiction in the thought renders possible  it is of minor importance how a man represents to himself his redemption by the word incarnatewithin what scheme of his understanding he concludes it or by what supposed analogies though actually no better than metaphors he tries to conceive it provided he has a lively faith in christ the son of the living god and his redeemer the faith may and must be the same in all who are thereby saved but every man more or less construes it into an intelligible belief through the shaping and coloring optical glass of his own individual understanding mr asgill has given a very ingenious commonlaw scheme valeat quantum valere potest it would make a figure before the benchers of the middle temple for myself i prefer the belief that man was made to know that a finite free agent could not stand but by the coincidence and independent harmony of a separate will with the will of god for only by the will of god can he obey gods will man fell as a soul to rise a spirit the first adam was a living soul the last a lifemaking spirit  in the word was life and that life is the light of men and as long as the light abides within its own sphere that is appears as reasonso long it is commensurate with the life and is its adequate representative but not so when this light shines downward into the understanding for there it is always more or less refracted and differently in every different individual and it must be reconverted into life to rectify itself and regain its universality or allcommonness allgemeinheit as the german more expressively says hence in faith and charity the church is catholic so likewise in the fundamental articles of belief which constitute the right reason of faith but in the minor dogmata in modes of exposition and the vehicles of faith and reason to the understandings imaginations and affections of men the churches may differ and in this difference supply one object for charity to exercise itself on by mutual forbearance  o there is a deep philosophy in the proverbial phrasehis heart sets his head right in our commerce with heaven we must cast our local coins and tokens into the melting pot of love to pass by weight and bullion and where the balance of trade is so immensely in our favour we have little right to complain though they should not pass for half the nominal value they go for in our own market  p 46    and i am so far from thinking this covenant of eternal life to be an   allusion to the forms of title amongst men that i rather adore it as   the precedent for them all from which our imperfect forms are taken   believing with that great apostle that the things on earth are but   the patterns of things in the heavens where the originals are kept  aye this this is the pinch of the argument which asgill should have proved not merely asserted are these human laws and these forms of law absolutely good and wise or only conditionally sothe limited powers and intellect and the corrupt will of men being considered  p 64    and hence though the dead shall not arise with the same identity of   matter with which they died yet being in the same form they will not   know themselves from themselves being the same to all uses intents   and purposes but then as god in the resurrection is not bound to   use the same matter neither is he obliged to use a different matter  the great objection to this part of asgills scheme which has had and still i am told has many advocates among the chief dignitaries of our church isthat it either takes death as the utter extinction of beingor it supposes a continuance or at least a renewal of consciousness after death the former involves all the irrational and all the immoral consequences of materialism but if the latter be granted the proportionality adhesion and symmetry of the whole scheme are gone and the infinite quantitythat is immortality under the curse of estrangement from godis rendered a mere supplement tacked on to the finite and comparatively insignificant if not doubtful evil namely the dissolution of the organic body see what a poor hand asgill makes of it p 26    and therefore to signify the height of this resentment god raises man   from the dead to demand further satisfaction of him    death is a commitment to the prison of the grave till the judgment of   the great day and then the grand habeas corpus will issue to the   earth and to the sea to give up their dead to remove the bodies   with the cause of their commitment and as these causes shall appear   they shall either be released or else sentenced to the common goal of   hell there to remain until satisfaction  p 66    thou wilt not leave my soul in the grave    and that it is translated soul is an anglicism not understood in   other languages which have no other word for soul but the same   which is for life  how so seele the soul leben life in german greek psychae and greek zoae in greek and so on  p 67    then to this figure god added life by breathing it into him from   himself whereby this inanimate body became a living one  and what was this life something or nothing and had not first the spirit and next the word of god infused life into the earth of which man as an animal and all other animals were madeand then in addition to this breathed into man a living soul which he did not breathe into the other animals  p 757881 ad finem    i have a great deal of business yet in this world without doing of   which heaven itself would be uneasy to me    and therefore do depend that i shall not be taken hence in the midst   of my days before i have done all my hearts desire    but when that is done i know no business i have with the dead and   therefore do as much depend that i shall not go hence by returning to   the dust which is the sentence of that law from which i claim a   discharge but that i shall make my exit by way of translation   which i claim as a dignity belonging to that degree in the science of   eternal life of which i profess myself a graduate according to the   true intent and meaning of the covenant of eternal life revealed in   the scriptures   a man so greek kat exochaen clearheaded so remarkable for the perspicuity of his sentences and the luminous orderliness of his arrangementin short so consummate an artist in the statement of his case and in the inferences from his data as john asgill must be allowed by all competent judges to have beenwas he in earnest or in jest from p 75 to the end of this treatisemy belief is that he himself did not know he was a thorough humorist and so much of will with a spice of the wilful goes to the making up of a humorists creed that it is no easy matter to determine how far such a man might not have a pleasure in humming his own mind and believing in order to enjoy a dry laugh at himself for the belief  but let us look at it in another way that asgills belief professed and maintained in this tract is unwise and odd i can more readily grant than that it is altogether irrational and absurd i am even strongly inclined to conjecture that so early as st pauls apostolate there were persons whether sufficiently numerous to form a sect or party i cannot say who held the same tenet as asgills and in a more intolerant and exclusive sense and that it is to such persons that st paul refers in the justly admired fifteenth chapter of the first epistle to the corinthians and that the inadvertence to this has led a numerous class of divines to a misconception of the apostles reasoning and a misinterpretation of his words in behoof of the socinian notion that the resurrection of christ is the only argument of proof for the belief of a future state and that this was the great end and purpose of this event now this assumption is so destitute of support from the other writers of the new testament and so discordant with the whole spirit and gist of st pauls views and reasoning every where else that it is a priori probable that the apparent exception in this chapter is only apparent and this the hypothesis i have here advanced would enable one to shew and to exhibit the true bearing of the texts asgill contents himself with maintaining that translation without death is one and the best mode of passing to the heavenly state hinc itur ad astra but his earliest predecessors contended that it was the only mode and to this st paul justly repliesif in this life only we have hope we are of all men most miserable  1827     introduction to asgills defence  upon his expulsion from the house op commons  edit 1712  p 28    for as every faith or credit that a man hath attained to is the   result of some knowledge or other so that whoever hath attained that   knowledge hath that faith for whatever a man knows he cannot but   believe    so this all faith being the result of all knowledgetis easy to   conceive that whoever had once attained to all that knowledge nothing   could be difficult to him  this whole discussion on faith is one of the very few instances in which asgill has got out of his depth according to all usage of words science and faith are incompatible in relation to the same object while according to asgill faith is merely the power which science confers on the will asgill sayswhat we know we must believe i retortwhat we only believe we do not know the minor here is excluded by not included in the major minors by difference of quantity are included in their majors but minors by difference of quality are excluded by them or superseded apply this to belief and science or certain knowledge on the confusion of the second that is minors by difference of quality with the first or minors by difference of quantity rests asgills erroneous exposition of faith      notes on sir thomas browns religio medici  made during a second perusal 1808 1  part i s1    for my religion though there be several circumstances that might   perswade the world i have none at all as the generall scandall of my   profession c  the historical origin of this scandal which in nine cases out of ten is the honour of the medical profession may perhaps be found in the fact that Ænesidemus and sextus empiricus the sceptics were both physicians about the close of the second century 2 a fragment from the writings of the former has been preserved by photius and such as would leave a painful regret for the loss of the work had not the invaluable work of sextus empiricus been still extant  s 7    a third there is which i did never positively maintaine or practise   but have often wished it had been consonant to truth and not   offensive to my religion and that is the prayer for the dead c  our church with her characteristic christian prudence does not enjoin prayer for the dead but neither does she prohibit it in its own nature it belongs to a private aspiration and being conditional like all religious acts not expressed in scripture and therefore not combinable with a perfect faith it is something between prayer and wishan act of natural piety sublimed by christian hope that shares in the light and meets the diverging rays of faith though it be not contained in the focus  s 13    he holds no counsell but that mysticall one of the trinity wherein   though there be three persons there is but one mind that decrees   without contradiction c  sir tb is very amusing he confesses his part heresies which are mere opinions while his orthodoxy is full of heretical errors his trinity is a mere trefoil a 31 which is no mystery at all but a common object of the senses the mystery is that one is three that is each being the whole god  s 18    tis not a ridiculous devotion to say a prayer before a game at   tables c  but a great profanation methinks and a no less absurdity would sir t brown before weighing two pigs of lead a and b pray to god that a might weigh the heavier yet if the result of the dice

interpret every phrase in its literal sense as conveying and designed to convey a metaphysical verity or historical factwhat a strange medley of doctrines should we not educe and yet this is the way in which we are constantly in the habit of treating the books of the new testament  s 34    and truely for the first chapters of genesis i must confesse a   great deal of obscurity though divines have to the power of humane   reason endeavored to make all go in a literall meaning yet those   allegoricall interpretations are also probable and perhaps the   mysticall method of moses bred up in the hieroglyphicall schooles of   the egyptians  the second chapter of genesis from v 4 and the third chapter are to my mind as evidently symbolical as the first chapter is literal the first chapter is manifestly by moses himself but the second and third seem to me of far higher antiquity and have the air of being translated into words from graven stones  s 48 this section is a series of ingenious paralogisms  s 49    moses that was bred up in all the learning of the egyptians   committed a grosse absurdity in philosophy when with these eyes of   flesh he desired to see god and petitioned his

no bigger than   it appeareth  it is not improbable that heraclitus meant merely to imply that we perceive only our own sensations and they of course are what they arethat the image of the sun is an appearance or sensation in our eyes and of course an appearance can be neither more nor less than what it appears to bethat the notion of the true size of the sun is not an image or belonging either to the sense or to the sensuous fancy but is an imageless truth of the understanding obtained by intellectual deductions he could not possibly mean what sir t b supposes him to have meant for if he had believed the sun to be no more than a mile distant from us every tree and house must have shown its absurdity    in the following books i have endeavoured wherever the author himself is in a vulgar error as far as my knowledge extends to give in the margin either the demonstrated discoveries or more probable opinions of the present natural philosophyso that independently of the entertainingness of the thoughts and tales and the force and splendor of sir thomas brownes diction and manner you may at once learn from him the history of human fancies and superstitions both when he detects them and when he himself falls into themand from my notes the real truth of things or at least the highest degree of probability at which human research has hitherto arrived    book ii c i production of crystal cold is the attractive or astringent power comparatively uncounteracted by the dilative the diminution of which is the proportional increase of the contractive hence the astringent or power of negative magnetism is the proper agent in cold and the contractive or oxygen an allied and consequential power crystallum non ex aqua sed ex substantia metallorum communi confrigeratum dico as the equator or mid point of the equatorial hemispherical line is to the centre so water is to gold hydrogen is to the electrical azote as azote to the magnetic hydrogen  ib

discoveries from scheele priestley and cavendish to berzelius and davy no improvement has been made in this divisionnot of primary bodies those idols of the modern atomic chemistry but of causes as sir tb rightly expresses themthat is of elementary powers manifested in bodies let mercury stand for the bipolar metallic principle best imaged as a line or axis from north to souththe north or negative pole being the cohesive or coherentific force and the south or positive pole being the dispersive or incoherentific force the first is predominant in and therefore represented by carbonthe second by nitrogen and the series of metals are the primary and hence indecomponible syntheta and proportions of both in like manner sulphur represents the active and passive principle of fire the contractive force or negative electricityoxygenproduces flame and the dilative force or positive electricityhydrogenproduces warmth and lastly salt is the equilibrium or compound of the two former so taken salt sulphur and mercury are equivalent to the combustive the combustible and the combust under one or other of which all known bodies or ponderable substances may be classed and distinguished  the difference between a great minds and a little minds use of history is this the latter would consider for instance what luther did taught or sanctioned the former what luthera lutherwould now do teach and sanction this thought occurred to me at midnight tuesday the 16th of march 1824 as i was stepping into bedmy eye having glanced on luthers table talk  if you would be well with a great mind leave him with a favorable impression of youif with a little mind leave him with a favorable opinion of himself  it is not common to find a book of so early date as this 1658 at least among those of equal neatness of printing that contains so many gross typographical errorswith the exception of our earliest dramatic writers some of which appear to have been never corrected but worked off at once as the types were first arranged by the compositors but the grave and doctrinal works are in general exceedingly correct and form a striking contrast to modern publications of which the late edition of bacons works would be paramount in the infamy of multiplied unnoticed errata were it not for the unrivalled slovenliness of andersons british poets in which the blunders are at least as numerous as the pages and many of them perverting the sense or killing the whole beauty and yet giving or affording a meaning however low instead these are the most execrable of all typographical errors 1808    the volume from which the foregoing notes have been taken is inscribed in mr lambs writing  c lamb 9th march 1804 bought for st coleridge under which in mr coleridges hand is written  nb it was on the 10th on which day i dined and punched at lambs and exulted in the having procured the hydriotaphia and all the rest lucro apposita stc  that same night the volume was devoted as a gift to a dear friend in the following lettered    10th 1804  sat night 12 oclock   my dear  sir thomas brown is among my first favorites rich in various knowledge exuberant in conceptions and conceits contemplative imaginative often truly great and magnificent in his style and diction though doubtless too often big stiff and hyperlatinistic thus i might without admixture of falsehood describe sir t brown and my description would have only this fault that it would be equally or almost equally applicable to half a dozen other writers from the beginning of the reign of elizabeth to the end of charles ii he is indeed all this and what he has more than all this peculiar to himself i seem to convey to my own mind in some measure by sayingthat he is a quiet and sublime enthusiast with a strong tinge of the fantastthe humourist constantly mingling with and flashing across the philosopher as the darting colours in shot silk play upon the main dye in short he has brains in his head which is all the more interesting for a little twist in the brains he sometimes reminds the reader of montaigne but from no other than the general circumstances of an egotism common to both which in montaigne is too often a mere amusing gossip a chitchat story of whims and peculiarities that lead to nothingbut which in sir thomas brown is always the result of a feeling heart conjoined with a mind of active curiositythe natural and becoming egotism of a man who loving other men as himself gains the habit and the privilege of talking about himself as familiarly as about other men fond of the curious and a hunter of oddities and strangenesses while he conceived himself with quaint and humourous gravity a useful inquirer into physical truth and fundamental sciencehe loved to contemplate and discuss his own thoughts and feelings because he found by comparison with other mens that they too were curiosities and so with a perfectly graceful and interesting ease he put them too into his museum and cabinet of varieties in very truth he was not mistakenso completely does he see every thing in a light of his own reading nature neither by sun moon nor candle light but by the light of the faery glory around his own head so that you might say that nature had granted to him in perpetuity a patent and monopoly for all his thoughts read his hydriotaphia above alland in addition to the peculiarity the exclusive sir thomasbrownness of all the fancies and modes of illustration wonder at and admire his entireness in every subject which is before himhe is totus in illo he follows it he never wanders from itand he has no occasion to wanderfor whatever happens to be his subject he metamorphoses all nature into it in that hydriotaphia or treatise on some urns dug up in norfolkhow earthy how redolent of graves and sepulchres is every line you have now dark mould now a thighbone now a scull then a bit of mouldered coffin a fragment of an old tombstone with moss in its hic jaceta ghost or a windingsheetor the echo of a funeral psalm wafted on a november wind and the gayest thing you shall meet with shall be a silver nail or gilt anno domini from a perished coffin top the very same remark applies in the same force to the interesting through the far less interesting treatise on the quincuncial plantations of the ancients there is the same attention to oddities to the remotenesses and minutiæ of vegetable termsthe same entireness of subject you have quincunxes in heaven above quincunxes in earth below and quincunxes in the water beneath the earth quincunxes in deity quincunxes in the mind of man quincunxes in bones in the optic nerves in roots of trees in leaves in petals in every thing in short first turn to the last leaf of this volume and read out aloud to yourself the last seven paragraphs of chap v beginning with the words more considerables c but it is time for me to be in bed in the words of sir thomas which will serve you my dear as a fair specimen of his mannerbut the quincunx of heaventhe hyades or five stars about the horizon at midnight at that timeruns low and tis time we close the five ports of knowledge we are unwilling to spin out our waking thoughts into the phantasmes of sleep which often continueth præcogitationsmaking tables of cobwebbes and wildernesses of handsome groves to keep our eyes open longer were but to act our antipodes the huntsmen are up in america and they are already past their first sleep in persia think you my dear friend that there ever was such a reason given before for going to bed at midnightto wit that if we did not we should be acting the part of our antipodes and then the huntsmen are up in americawhat life what fancydoes the whimsical knight give us thus a dish of strong green tea and call it an opiate i trust that you are quietly asleep  and that all the stars hang bright above your dwelling silent as tho they watched the sleeping earth  s t coleridge   finis
