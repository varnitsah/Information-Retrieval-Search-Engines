80619581	the rape of the lock   and other poems    by  alexander pope       edited  with introduction and notes  by  thomas marc parrott phd  professor of english princeton university    this edition published 1906     preface  it has been the aim of the editor in preparing this little book to get together sufficient material to afford a student in one of our high schools or colleges adequate and typical specimens of the vigorous and versatile genius of alexander pope with this purpose he has included in addition to the rape of the lock the essay on criticism as furnishing the standard by which pope himself expected his work to be judged the first epistle of the essay on man as a characteristic example of his didactic poetry and the epistle to arbuthnot both for its exhibition of popes genius as a satirist and for the picture it gives of the poet himself to these are added the famous close of the dunciad the ode to solitude a specimen of popes infrequent lyric note and the epitaph on gay  the first edition of the rape of the lock has been given as an appendix in order that the student may have the opportunity of comparing the two forms of this poem and of realizing the admirable art with which pope blended old and new in the version that is now the only one known to the average reader the text throughout is that of the globe edition prepared by professor a w ward  the editor can lay no claim to originality in the notes with which he has attempted to explain and illustrate these poems he is indebted at every step to the labors of earlier editors particularly to elwin courthope pattison and hales if he has added anything of his own it has been in the way of defining certain words whose meaning or connotation has changed since the time of pope and in paraphrasing certain passages to bring out a meaning which has been partially obscured by the poets effort after brevity and concision  in the general introduction the editor has aimed not so much to recite the facts of popes life as to draw the portrait of a man whom he believes to have been too often misunderstood and misrepresented the special introductions to the various poems are intended to acquaint the student with the circumstances under which they were composed to trace their literary genesis and relationships and whenever necessary to give an outline of the train of thought which they embody  in conclusion the editor would express the hope that his labors in the preparation of this book may help if only in some slight degree to stimulate the study of the work of a poet who with all his limitations remains one of the abiding glories of english literature and may contribute not less to a proper appreciation of a man who with all his faults was on the evidence of those who knew him best not only a great poet but a very human and lovable personality  t m p  princeton university june 4 1906                                               contents   introduction  the rape of

introduction   perhaps no other great poet in english literature has been so differently judged at different times as alexander pope accepted almost on his first appearance as one of the leading poets of the day he rapidly became recognized as the foremost man of letters of his age he held this position throughout his life and for over half a century after his death his works were considered not only as masterpieces but as the finest models of poetry with the change of poetic temper that occurred at the beginning of the nineteenth century popes fame was overshadowed the romantic poets and critics even raised the question whether pope was a poet at all and as his poetical fame diminished the harsh judgments of his personal character increased it is almost incredible with what exulting bitterness critics and editors of pope have tracked out and exposed his petty intrigues exaggerated his delinquencies misrepresented his actions attempted in short to blast his character as a man  both as a man and as a poet pope is sadly in need of a defender today and a defense is by no means impossible the depreciation of popes poetry springs in the main from an attempt to measure it by other standards than those which he and his age recognized the attacks upon his character are due in large measure to a misunderstanding of the spirit of the times in which he lived and to a forgetfulness of the special circumstances of his own life tried in a fair court by impartial judges pope as a poet would be awarded a place if not among the noblest singers at least high among poets of the second order and the flaws of character which even his warmest apologist must admit would on the one hand be explained if not excused by circumstances and on the other more than counterbalanced by the existence of noble qualities to which his assailants seem to have been quite blind  alexander pope was born in london on may 21 1688 his father was a roman catholic linen draper who had married a second time pope was the only child of this marriage and seems to have been a delicate sweettempered precocious and perhaps a rather spoiled child  popes religion and his chronic illhealth are two facts of the highest importance to be taken into consideration in any study of his life or judgment of his character the high hopes of the catholics for a restoration of their religion had been totally destroyed by the revolution of 1688 during all popes lifetime they were a sect at once feared hated and oppressed by the severest laws they were excluded from the schools and universities they were burdened with double taxes and forbidden to acquire real estate all public careers were closed to them and their property and even their persons were in times of excitement at the mercy of informers in the last year of popes life a proclamation was issued forbidding catholics to come within ten miles of london and pope himself in spite of his influential friends thought it wise to comply with this edict a fierce outburst of persecution often evokes in the persecuted some of the noblest qualities of human nature but a longcontinued and crushing tyranny that extends to all the details of daily life is only too likely to have the most unfortunate results on those who are subjected to it and as a matter of fact we find that the welltodo catholics of popes day lived in an atmosphere of disaffection political intrigue and evasion of the law most unfavorable for the development of that frank courageous and patriotic spirit for the lack of which pope himself has so often been made the object of reproach  in a wellknown passage of the epistle to arbuthnot pope has spoken of his life as one long disease he was in fact a humpbacked dwarf not over four feet six inches in height with long spiderlike legs and arms he was subject to violent headaches and his face was lined and contracted with the marks of suffering in youth he so completely ruined his health by perpetual studies that his life was despaired of and only the most careful treatment saved him from an early death toward the close of his life he became so weak that he could neither dress nor undress without assistance he had to be laced up in stiff stays in order to sit erect and wore a fur doublet and three pairs of stockings to protect himself against the cold with these physical defects he had the extreme sensitiveness of mind that usually accompanies chronic ill health and this sensitiveness was outraged incessantly by the brutal customs of the age popes enemies made as free with his person as with his poetry and there is little doubt that he felt the former attacks the more bitterly of the two dennis his first critic called him a short squab gentleman the very bow of the god of love his outward form is downright monkey a rival poet whom he had offended hung up a rod in a coffee house where men of letters resorted and threatened to whip pope like a naughty child if he showed his face there it is said though perhaps not on the best authority that when pope once forgot himself so far as to make love to lady mary wortley montague the ladys answer was a fit of immoderate laughter in an appendix to the dunciad pope collected some of the epithets with which his enemies had pelted him an ape an ass a frog a coward a fool a little abject thing he affected indeed to despise his assailants but there is only too good evidence that their poisoned arrows rankled in his heart richardson the painter found him one day reading the latest abusive pamphlet these things are my diversion said the poet striving to put the best face on it but as he read his friends saw his features writhen with anguish and prayed to be delivered from all such diversions as these popes enemies and their savage abuse are mostly forgotten today popes furious retorts have been secured to immortality by his genius it would have been nobler no doubt to have answered by silence only but before one condemns pope it is only fair to realize the causes of his bitterness  popes education was short and irregular he was taught the rudiments of latin and greek by his family priest attended for a brief period a school in the country and another in london and at the early age of twelve left school altogether and settling down at his fathers house in the country began to read to his hearts delight he roamed through the classic poets translating passages that pleased him went up for a time to london to get lessons in french and italian and above all read with eagerness and attention the works of older english poetsspenser waller and dryden he had already it would seem determined to become a poet and his father delighted with the clever boys talent used to set him topics force him to correct his verses over and over and finally when satisfied dismiss him with the praise these are good rhymes he wrote a comedy a tragedy an epic poem all of which he afterward destroyed and as he laughingly confessed in later years he thought himself the greatest genius that ever was  pope was not alone however in holding a high opinion of his talents while still a boy in his teens he was taken up and patronized by a number of gentlemen trumbull walsh and cromwell all dabblers in poetry and criticism he was introduced to the dramatist wycherly nearly fifty years his senior and helped to polish some of the old mans verses his own works were passed about in manuscript from hand to hand till one of them came to the eyes of drydens old publisher tonson tonson wrote pope a respectful letter asking for the honor of being allowed to publish them one may fancy the delight with which the sixteenyearold boy received this offer it is a proof of popes patience as well as his precocity that he delayed three years before accepting it it was not till 1709 that his first published verses the pastorals a fragment translated from homer and a modernized version of one of the canterbury tales appeared in tonsons miscellany  with the publication of the pastorals pope embarked upon his life as a man of letters they seem to have brought him a certain recognition but hardly fame that he obtained by his next poem the essay on criticism which appeared in 1711 it was applauded in the spectator and pope seems about this time to have made the acquaintance of addison and the little senate which met in buttons coffee house his poem the messiah appeared in the spectator in may 1712 the first draft of the rape of the lock in a poetical miscellany in the same year and addisons request in 1713 that he compose a prologue for the tragedy of cato set the final stamp upon his rank as a poet  popes friendly relations with addison and his circle were not however long continued in the year 1713 he gradually drew away from them and came under the influence of swift then at the height of his power in political and social life swift introduced him to the brilliant tories politicians and lovers of letters harley bolingbroke and atterbury who were then at the head of affairs popes new friends seem to have treated him with a deference which he had never experienced before and which bound him to them in unbroken affection harley used to regret that popes religion rendered him legally incapable of holding a sinecure office in the government such as was frequently bestowed in those days upon men of letters and swift jestingly offered the young poet twenty guineas to become a protestant but now as later pope was firmly resolved not to abandon the faith of his parents for the sake of worldly advantage and in order to secure the independence he valued so highly he resolved to embark upon the great work of his life the translation of homer  what led me into that he told a friend long after was purely the want of money i had then none not even to buy books it seems that about this time 1713 popes father had experienced some heavy financial losses and the poet whose receipts in money had so far been by no means in proportion to the reputation his works had brought him now resolved to use that reputation as a means of securing from the public a sum which would at least keep him for life from poverty or the necessity of begging for patronage it is worth noting that pope was the first englishman of letters who threw himself thus boldly upon the public and earned his living by his pen  the arrangements for the publication and sale of popes translation of homer were made with care and pushed on with enthusiasm he issued in 1713 his proposals for an edition to be published by subscription and his friends at once became enthusiastic canvassers we have a characteristic picture of swift at this time bustling about a crowded antechamber and informing the company that the best poet in england was mr pope a papist who had begun a translation of homer for which they must all subscribe for says he the author shall not begin to print till i have a thousand guineas for him the work was to be in six volumes each costing a guinea pope obtained 575 subscribers many of whom took more than one set lintot the publisher gave pope £1200 for the work and agreed to supply the subscription copies free of charge as a result pope made something between £5000 and £6000 a sum absolutely unprecedented in the history of english literature and amply sufficient to make him independent for life  but the sum was honestly earned by hard and wearisome work pope was no greek scholar it is said indeed that he was just able to make out the sense of the original with a translation and in addition to the fifteen thousand lines of the iliad he had engaged to furnish an introduction and notes at first the magnitude of the undertaking frightened him what terrible moments he said to spence does one feel after one has engaged for a large work in the beginning of my translating the iliad i wished anybody would hang me a hundred times it sat so heavily on my mind at first that i often used to dream of it and do sometimes still in spite of his discouragement however and of the ill health which so constantly beset him pope fell gallantly upon his task and as time went on came almost to enjoy it he used to translate thirty or forty verses in the morning before rising and in his own characteristic phrase piddled over them for the rest of the day he used every assistance possible drew freely upon the scholarship of friends corrected and recorrected with a view to obtaining clearness and point and finally succeeded in producing a version which not only satisfied his own critical judgment but was at once accepted by the englishspeaking world as the standard translation of homer  the first volume came out in june 1715 and to popes dismay and wrath a rival translation appeared almost simultaneously tickell one of addisons little senate had also begun a translation of the iliad and although he announced in the preface that he intended to withdraw in favor of pope and take up a translation of the odyssey the poets suspicions were at once aroused and they were quickly fanned into a flame by the gossip of the town which reported that addison the recognized authority in literary criticism pronounced tickells version the best that ever was in any language rumor went so far in fact as to hint pretty broadly that addison himself was the author in part at least of tickells book and pope who had been encouraged by addison to begin his long task felt at once that he had been betrayed his resentment was all the more bitter since he fancied that addison now at the height of his power and prosperity in the world of letters and of politics had attempted to ruin an enterprise on which the younger man had set all his hopes of success and independence for no better reason than literary jealousy and political estrangement we know now that pope was mistaken but there was beyond question some reason at the time for his thinking as he did and it is to the bitterness which this incident caused in his mind that we owe the famous satiric portrait of addison as atticus  the last volume of the iliad appeared in the spring of 1720 and in it pope gave a renewed proof of his independence by dedicating the whole work not to some lord who would have rewarded him with a handsome present but to his old acquaintance congreve the last survivor of the brilliant comic dramatists of drydens day and now resting for a time from his long labors pope turned to the adornment and cultivation of the little house and garden that he had leased at twickenham  popes father had died in 1717 and the poet rejecting politely but firmly the suggestion of his friend atterbury that he might now turn protestant devoted himself with double tenderness to the care of his aged and infirm mother he brought her with him to twickenham where she lived till 1733 dying in that year at the great age of ninetyone it may have been partly on her account that pope pitched upon twickenham as his abiding place beautifully situated on the banks of the thames it was at once a quiet country place and yet of easy access to london to hampton court or to kew the five acres of land that lay about the house furnished pope with inexhaustible entertainment for the rest of his life he twisted and twirled and harmonized his bit of ground till it appeared two or three sweet little lawns opening and opening beyond one another the whole surrounded by impenetrable woods following the taste of his times in landscape gardening he adorned his lawns with artificial mounds a shell temple an obelisk and a colonnade but the crowning glory was the grotto a tunnel decorated fantastically with shells and bits of lookingglass which pope dug under a road that ran through his grounds here pope received in state and his house and garden was for years the center of the most brilliant society in england here swift came on his rare visits from ireland and bolingbroke on his return from exile arbuthnot popes beloved physician was a frequent visitor and peterborough one of the most distinguished of english soldiers condescended to help lay out the garden congreve came too at times and gay the laziest and most goodnatured of poets nor was the society of women lacking at these gatherings lady mary wortley montague the wittiest woman in england was often there until her bitter quarrel with the poet the grim old duchess of marlborough appeared once or twice in popes last years and the princess of wales came with her husband to inspire the leaders of the opposition to the hated walpole and the miserly king and from first to last the good angel of the place was the blueeyed sweettempered patty blount popes best and dearest friend  not long after the completion of the iliad pope undertook to edit shakespeare and completed the work in 1724 the edition is of course quite superseded now but it has its place in the history of shakespearean studies as the first that made an effort though irregular and incomplete to restore the true text by collation and conjecture it has its place too in the story of popes life since the bitter criticism which it received all the more unpleasant to the poet since it was in the main true was one of the principal causes of his writing the dunciad between the publication of his edition of shakespeare however and the appearance of the dunciad pope resolved to complete his translation of homer and with the assistance of a pair of friends got out a version of the odyssey in 1725 like the iliad this was published by subscription and as in the former case the greatest men in england were eager to show their appreciation of the poet by filling up his lists sir robert walpole the great whig statesman took ten copies and harley the fallen tory leader put himself his wife and his daughter down for sixteen pope made it is said about £3700 by this work  in 1726 swift visited pope and encouraged him to complete a satire which he seems already to have begun on the dull critics and hack writers of the day for one cause or another its publication was deferred until 1728 when it appeared under the title of the dunciad here pope declared open war upon his enemies all those who had attacked his works abused his character or scoffed at his personal deformities were caricatured as ridiculous and sometimes disgusting figures in a mock epic poem celebrating the accession of a new monarch to the throne of dullness the dunciad is little read today except by professed students of english letters but it made naturally enough a great stir at the time and vastly provoked the wrath of all the dunces whose names it dragged to light pope has often been blamed for stooping to such ignoble combat and in particular for the coarseness of his abuse and for his bitter jests upon the poverty of his opponents but it must be remembered that no living writer had been so scandalously abused as pope and no writer that ever lived was by nature so quick to feel and to resent insult the undoubted coarseness of the work is in part due to the gross license of the times in speech and writing and more particularly to the influence of swift at this time predominant over pope and in regard to popes trick of taunting his enemies with poverty it must frankly be confessed that he seized upon this charge as a ready and telling weapon pope was at heart one of the most charitable of men in the days of his prosperity he is said to have given away one eighth of his income and he was always quick to succor merit in distress he pensioned the poet savage and he tried to secure patronage for johnson but for the wretched hack writers of the common press who had barked against him he had no mercy and he struck them with the first rod that lay ready to his hands  during his work on the dunciad pope came into intimate relations with bolingbroke who in 1725 had returned from his long exile in france and had settled at dawley within easy reach of popes villa at twickenham bolingbroke was beyond doubt one of the most brilliant and stimulating minds of his age without depth of intellect or solidity of character he was at once a philosopher a statesman a scholar and a fascinating talker pope who had already made his acquaintance was delighted to renew and improve their intimacy and soon came wholly under the influence of his splendid friend it is hardly too much to say that all the rest of popes work is directly traceable to bolingbroke the essay on man was built up on the precepts of bolingbrokes philosophy the imitations of horace were undertaken at bolingbrokes suggestion and the whole tone of popes political and social satire during the years from 1731 to 1738 reflects the spirit of that opposition to the administration of walpole and to the growing influence of the commercial class which was at once inspired and directed by bolingbroke and yet it is exactly in the work of this period that we find the best and with perhaps one exception the essay on man the most original work of pope he has obtained an absolute command over his instrument of expression in his hands the heroic couplet sings and laughs and chats and thunders he has turned from the ignoble warfare with the dunces to satirize courtly frivolity and wickedness in high places and most important of all to the student of pope it is in these last works that his personality is most clearly revealed it has been well said that the best introduction to the study of pope the man is to get the epistle to arbuthnot by heart  pope gradually persuaded himself that all the works of these years the essay on man the satires epistles and moral essays were but parts of one stupendous whole he told spence in the last years of his life i had once thought of completing my ethic work in four booksthe first you know is on the nature of man the essay on man the second would have been on knowledge and its limitshere would have come in an essay on education part of which i have inserted in the dunciad ie in the fourth book published in 1742 the third was to have treated of government both ecclesiastical and civiland this was what chiefly stopped my going on i could not have said what i would have said without provoking every church on the face of the earth and i did not care for living always in boiling waterthis part would have come into my brutus an epic poem which pope never completed which is planned already the fourth would have been on morality in eight or nine of the most concerning branches of it  it is difficult if not impossible to believe that pope with his irregular methods of work and illogical habit of thought had planned so vast and elaborate a system before he began its execution it is far more likely that he followed his old method of composing on the inspiration of the moment and produced the works in question with little thought of their relation or interdependence but in the last years of his life when he had made the acquaintance of warburton and was engaged in reviewing and perfecting the works of this period he noticed their general similarity in form and spirit and possibly under warburtons influence conceived the notion of combining and supplementing them to form that greater essay on man of which he spoke to spence and of which warburton himself has given us a detailed account  warburton a wideread pompous and polemical clergyman had introduced himself to the notice of pope by a defense of the philosophical and religious principles of the essay on man in spite of the influence of the freethinking bolingbroke pope still remained a member of the catholic church and sincerely believed himself to be an orthodox though liberal christian and he had in consequence been greatly disconcerted by a criticism of his poem published in switzerland and lately translated into english its author pierre de crousaz maintained and with a considerable degree of truth that the principles of popes poem if pushed to their logical conclusion were destructive to religion and would rank their author rather among atheists than defenders of the faith the very word atheist was at that day sufficient to put the man to whom it was applied beyond the pale of polite society and pope who quite lacked the ability to refute in logical argument the attack of de crousaz was proportionately delighted when warburton came forward in his defense and in a series of letters asserted that popes whole intention was to vindicate the ways of god to man and that de crousaz had mistaken his purpose and misunderstood his language popes gratitude to his defender knew no bounds he declared that warburton understood the essay better than he did himself he pronounced him the greatest critic he ever knew secured an introduction to him introduced him to his own rich and influential friends in short made the mans fortune for him outright when the university of oxford hesitated to give warburton who had never attended a university the degree of dd pope declined to accept the degree of dcl which had been offered him at the same time and wrote the fourth book of the dunciad to satirize the stupidity of the university authorities in conjunction with warburton he proceeded further to revise the whole poem for which his new friend wrote notes and a ponderous introduction and made the capital mistake of substituting the frivolous but clever colley gibber with whom he had recently become embroiled for his old enemy theobald as the hero and the last year of his life was spent in getting out new editions of his poems accompanied by elaborate commentaries from the pen of warburton  in the spring of 1744 it was evident that pope was failing fast in addition to his other ailments he was now attacked by an asthmatical dropsy which no efforts of his physicians could remove yet he continued to work almost to the last and distributed copies of his ethic epistles to his friends about three weeks before his death with the smiling remark that like the dying socrates he was dispensing his morality among his friends his mind began to wander he complained that he saw all things as through a curtain and told spence once with a smile of great pleasure and with the greatest softness that he had seen a vision his friends were devoted in their attendance bolingbroke sat weeping by his chair and on spences remarking how pope with every rally was always saying something kindly of his friends replied i never in my life knew a man that had so tender a heart for his particular friends or a more general friendship for mankind i have known him these thirty years and value myself more for that mans love thanhere his head dropped and his voice broke in tears it was noticed that whenever patty blount came into the room the dying flame of life flashed up in a momentary glow at the very end a friend reminded pope that as a professed catholic he ought to send for a priest the dying man replied that he did not believe it essential but thanked him for the suggestion when the priest appeared pope attempted to rise from his bed that he might receive the sacrament kneeling and the priest came out from the sick room penetrated to the last degree with the state of mind in which he found his penitent resigned and wrapt up in the love of god and man the hope that sustained pope to the end was that of immortality i am so certain of the souls being immortal he whispered almost with his last breath that i seem to feel it within me as it were by intuition he died on the evening of may 30 so quietly that his friends hardly knew that the end had come he was buried in twickenham church near the monument he had erected to his parents and his coffin was carried to the grave by six of the poorest men of the parish  it is plain even from so slight a sketch as this that the common conception of pope as the wicked wasp of twickenham a bitter jealous and malignant spirit is utterly out of accord with the facts of his life popes faults of character lie on the surface and the most perceptible is that which has done him most harm in the eyes of englishspeaking men he was by nature perhaps by training also untruthful if he seldom stooped to an outright lie he never hesitated to equivocate and students of his life have found that it is seldom possible to take his word on any point where his own works or interests were concerned i have already p x attempted to point out the probable cause of this defect and it is moreover worth while to remark that popes manifold intrigues and evasions were mainly of the defensive order he plotted and quibbled not so much to injure others as to protect himself to charge pope with treachery to his friends as has sometimes been done is wholly to misunderstand his character  another flaw one can hardly call it a vice in popes character was his constant practice of considering everything that came in his way as copy it was this which led him to reclaim his early letters from his friends to alter rewrite and redate them utterly unconscious of the trouble which he was preparing for his future biographers the letters he thought were good reading but not so good as he could make them and he set to work to improve them with all an artists zeal and without a trace of a historians care for facts it was this which led him to embody in his description of a rich fools splendid house and park certain unmistakable traces of a living noblemans estate and to start in genuine amazement and regret when the world insisted on identifying the nobleman and the fool and when pope had once done a good piece of work he had all an artists reluctance to destroy it he kept bits of verse by him for years and inserted them into appropriate places in his poems this habit it was that brought about perhaps the gravest charge that has ever been made against pope that of accepting £1000 to suppress a satiric portrait of the old duchess of marlborough and yet of publishing it in a revision of a poem that he was engaged on just before his death the truth seems to be that pope had drawn this portrait in days when he was at bitter enmity with the duchess and after the reconcilement that took place unwilling to suppress it entirely had worked it over and added passages out of keeping with the first design but pointing to another lady with whom he was now at odds popes behavior we must admit was not altogether creditable but it was that of an artist reluctant to throw away good work not that of a ruffian who stabs a woman he has taken money to spare  finally pope was throughout his life and notably in his later years the victim of an irritable temper and a quick abusive tongue his irritability sprang in part we may believe from his physical sufferings even more however from the exquisitely sensitive heart which made him feel a coarse insult as others would a blow and of the coarseness of the insults that were heaped upon pope no one except the careful student of his life can have any conception his genius his morals his person his parents and his religion were overwhelmed in one indiscriminate flood of abuse too high spirited to submit tamely to these attacks too irritable to laugh at them he struck back and his weapon was personal satire which cut like a whip and left a brand like a hot iron and if at times as in the case of addison pope was mistaken in his object and assaulted one who was in no sense his enemy the fault lies not so much in his alleged malice as in the unhappy state of warfare in which he lived  over against the faults of pope we may set more than one noble characteristic the sensitive heart and impulsive temper that led him so often into bitter warfare made him also most susceptible to kindness and quick to pity suffering he was essentially of a tender and loving nature a devoted son and a loyal friend unwearied in acts of kindness and generosity his ruling passion to use his own phrase was a devotion to letters and he determined as early and worked as diligently to make himself a poet as ever milton did his wretched body was dominated by a high and eager mind and he combined in an unparalleled degree the fiery energy of the born poet with the tireless patience of the trained artist  but perhaps the most remarkable characteristic of pope is his manly independence in an age when almost without exception his fellowwriters stooped to accept a great mans patronage or sold their talents into the slavery of politics pope stood aloof from patron and from party he repeatedly declined offers of money that were made him even when no condition was attached he refused to change his religion though he was far from being a devout catholic in order to secure a comfortable place he relied upon his genius alone for his support and his genius gave him all that he asked a modest competency his relations with his rich and powerful friends were marked by the same independent spirit he never cringed or flattered but met them on even terms and raised himself by merit alone from his position as the unknown son of an humble shopkeeper to be the friend and associate of the greatest fortunes and most powerful minds in england it is not too much to say that the career of a man of letters as we know it today a career at once honorable and independent takes its rise from the life and work of alexander pope  the long controversies that have raged about popes rank as a poet seem at last to be drawing to a close and it has become possible to strike a balance between the exaggerated praise of his contemporaries and the reckless depreciation of romantic critics that he is not a poet of the first order is plain if for no other reason than that he never produced a work in any of the greatest forms of poetry the drama the epic the lyric were all outside his range on the other hand unless a definition of poetry be framedand dr johnson has well remarked that to circumscribe poetry by a definition will only show the narrowness of the definerwhich shall exclude all gnomic and satiric verse and so debar the claims of hesiod juvenal and boileau it is impossible to deny that pope is a true poet certain qualities of the highest poet pope no doubt lacked lofty imagination intense passion wide human sympathy but within the narrow field which he marked out for his own he approaches perfection as nearly as any english poet and popes merit consists not merely in the smoothness of his verse or the polish of separate epigrams as is so often stated but quite as much in the vigor of his conceptions and the unity and careful proportion of each poem as a whole it is not too much to say that the rape of the lock is one of the bestplanned poems in any language it is as symmetrical and exquisitely finished as a grecian temple  historically pope represents the fullest embodiment of that spirit which began to appear in english literature about the middle of the seventeenth century and which we are accustomed to call the classical spirit in essence this movement was a protest against the irregularity and individual license of earlier poets instead of farfetched wit and fanciful diction the classical school erected the standards of common sense in conception and directness in expression and in so doing they restored poetry which had become the diversion of the few to the possession of the many pope for example is preeminently the poet of his time he dealt with topics that were of general interest to the society in which he lived he pictured life as he saw it about him and this accounts for his prompt and general acceptance by the world of his day  for the student of english literature popes work

madam  it will be in vain to deny that i have some regard for this piece since i dedicate it to you yet you may bear me witness it was intended only to divert a few young ladies who have good sense and good humour enough to laugh not only at their sexs little unguarded follies but at their own but as it was communicated with the air of a secret it soon found its way into the world an imperfect copy having been offerd to a bookseller you had the goodnature for my sake to consent to the publication of one more correct this i was forcd to before i had executed half my design for the machinery was entirely wanting to compleat it  the machinery madam is a term invented by the critics to signify that part which the deities angels or dæmons are made to act in a poem for the ancient poets are in one respect like many modern ladies let an action be never so trivial in itself they always make it appear of the utmost importance these machines i determined to raise on a very new and odd foundation the rosicrucian doctrine of spirits  i know how disagreeable it is to make use of hard words before a lady butt is so much the concern of a poet to have his works understood and particularly by your sex that you must give me leave to explain two or three difficult terms  the rosicrucians are a people i must bring you acquainted with the best account i know of them is in a french book calld le comte de gabalis which both in its title and size is so like a novel that many of the fair sex have read it for one by mistake according to these gentlemen the four elements are inhabited by spirits which they call sylphs gnomes nymphs and salamanders the gnomes or dæmons of earth delight in mischief but the sylphs whose habitation is in the air are the bestconditiond creatures imaginable for they say any mortals may enjoy the most intimate familiarities with these gentle spirits upon a condition very easy to all true adepts an inviolate preservation of chastity  as to the following cantos all the passages of them are as fabulous as the vision at the beginning or the transformation at the end except the loss of your hair which i always mention with reverence the human persons are as fictitious as the airy ones and the character of belinda as it is now managd resembles you in nothing but in beauty  if this poem had as many graces as there are in your person or in your mind yet i could never hope it should pass thro the world half so uncensurd as you have done but let its fortune be what it will mine is happy enough to have given me this occasion of assuring you that i am with the truest esteem madam  your most obedient humble servant  a pope      canto i     what dire offence from amrous causes springs   what mighty contests rise from trivial

criticism     tis hard to say if greater want of skill   appear in writing or in judging ill   but of the two less dangrous is th offence   to tire our patience than mislead our sense   some few in that but numbers err in this                         5   ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss   a fool might once himself alone expose   now one in verse makes many more in prose    tis with our judgments as our watches none   go just alike yet each believes his own                         10   in poets as true genius is but rare   true taste as seldom is the critics share   both must alike from heavn derive their light   these born to judge as well as those to write   let such teach others who themselves excel                       15   and censure freely who have written well   authors are partial to their wit tis true   but are not critics to their judgment too    yet if we look more closely we shall find   most have the seeds of judgment in their mind                    20   nature affords at least a glimmring light   the lines tho touchd but faintly are drawn right   but as the slightest sketch if justly tracd     is by illcolouring but the more disgracd        so by false learning is good sense defacd                      25   some are bewilderd in the maze of schools   and some made coxcombs nature meant but fools    in search of wit these lose their common sense   and then turn critics in their own defence   each burns alike who can or cannot write                       30   or with a rivals or an eunuchs spite   all fools have still an itching to deride   and fain would be upon the laughing side   if mævius scribble in apollos spite   there are who judge still worse than he can write                35    some have at first for wits then poets past   turnd critics next and provd plain fools at last   some neither can for wits nor critics pass   as heavy mules are neither horse nor ass   those halflearnd witlings numrous in our isle                40   as halfformd insects on the banks of nile   unfinishd things one knows not what to call   their generations so equivocal   to tell em would a hundred tongues require   or one vain wits that might a hundred tire                     45    but you who seek to give and merit fame   and justly bear a critics noble name   be sure yourself and your own reach to know   how far your genius taste and learning go   launch not beyond your depth but be discreet                    50   and mark that point where sense and dulness meet    nature to all things fixd the limits fit   and wisely curbd

a praise   most critics fond of some subservient art   still make the whole depend upon a part   they talk of principles but notions prize                     265   and all to one lovd folly sacrifice

          295   and hide with ornaments their want of art   true wit is nature to advantage dressd   what oft was thought but neer so well expressd   something whose truth convincd at sight we find   that gives us back the image of our mind                       300   as shades more sweetly recommend the light   so modest plainness sets off sprightly wit   for works may have more wit than does em

prismatic glass   its gaudy colours spreads on evry place   the face of nature we no more survey   all glares alike without distinction gay   but true expression like th unchanging sun                   315   clears and improves whateer it shines upon   it gilds all objects but it alters none   expression is the dress of thought and still   appears more decent as more suitable   a vile conceit in pompous words expressd                      320   is like a clown in regal purple dressd   for diffrent styles with diffrent subjects sort   as several garbs with country town and court    some by old words to fame have made pretence   ancients in phrase mere moderns in their sense                325   such labourd nothings in so strange a style   amaze th unlearnd and make the learned smile   unlucky as fungoso in the play             these sparks with awkward vanity display     what the fine gentleman wore yesterday                        330   and but so mimic ancient wits at best   as

yet the last to lay the old aside    but most by numbers judge a poets song   and smooth or rough with them is right or wrong   in the bright muse though thousand charms conspire   her voice is all these tuneful fools admire                    340   who haunt parnassus but to please their ear        not mend their minds as some to church repair     not for the doctrine but the music there          these equal syllables alone require   tho oft the ear the open vowes tire                          345   while expletives their feeble aid do join   and ten low words oft creep in one dull line   while they ring round the same unvaryd chimes   with sure returns of still expected rhymes   whereeer you find the cooling western breeze               350   in the next line it whispers through the trees   if crystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep   the readers threatend not in vain with sleep   then at the last and only couplet fraught   with some unmeaning thing they call a thought                  355   a needless alexandrine ends the song   that like a wounded snake drags its slow length along   leave such to tune their own dull rhymes and know   whats roundly smooth or languishingly slow   and praise the easy vigour of a line                           360   where denhams strength and wallers sweetness join   true ease in writing comes from art not chance   as those move easiest who have learnd to dance   tis not enough no harshness gives offence   the sound must seem an echo to the sense                       365   soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows   and the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows   but when loud surges lash the sounding shore   the hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar   when ajax strives some rocks vast weight to throw             370   the line too labours and the words move slow   not so when swift camilla scours the plain   flies oer th unbending corn and skims along the main   hear how timotheus varied lays surprize   and bid alternate passions fall and rise                       375   while at each change the son of libyan jove   now burns with glory and then melts with love   now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow   now sighs steal out and tears begin to flow   persians and greeks like turns of nature found                 380   and the worlds victor stood subdud by sound   the powr of music all our hearts allow   and what timotheus was is dryden now    avoid extremes and shun the fault of such   who still are pleasd too little or too much                   385   at evry trifle scorn to take offence   that always shows great pride or little sense   those heads as stomachs are not sure the best   which nauseate all and nothing can digest   yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move                     390   for fools admire but men of sense approve   as things seem large which we thro mists descry   dulness is ever apt to magnify    some foreign writers some our own despise   the ancients only or the moderns prize                        395   thus wit like faith by each man is applyd   to one small sect and all are damnd beside   meanly they seek the blessing to confine   and force that sun but on a part to shine   which not alone the southern wit sublimes                      400   but ripens spirits in cold northern climes   which from the first has shone on ages past   enlights the present and shall warm the last   tho each may feel increases and decays   and see now clearer and now darker days                        405   regard not then if wit be old or new   but blame the false and value still the true    some neer advance a judgment of their own   but catch the spreading notion of the town   they reason and conclude by precedent                          410   and own stale nonsense which they neer invent   some judge of authors names not works and then   nor praise nor blame the writings but the men   of all this servile herd the worst is he   that in proud dulness joins with quality                       415   a constant critic at the great mans board   to fetch and carry nonsense for my lord   what woful stuff this madrigal would be   in some starvd hackney sonneteer or me   but let a lord once own the happy lines                        420   how the wit brightens how the style refines   before his sacred name flies evry fault   and each exalted stanza teems with thought    the vulgar thus through imitation err   as oft the learnd by being singular                           425   so much they scorn the crowd that if the throng   by chance go right they purposely go wrong   so schismatics the plain believers quit   and are but damnd for having too much wit   some praise at morning what they blame at night                430   but always think the last opinion right   a muse by these is like a mistress usd   this hour shes idolizd the next abusd   while their weak heads like towns unfortifyd   twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side              435   ask them the cause theyre wiser still they say   and still tomorrows wiser than today   we think our fathers fools so wise we grow   our wiser sons no doubt will think us

laugh   some valuing those of their own side or mind   still make themselves the measure of mankind   fondly we think we honour merit then   when we but praise ourselves in other men

bolingbroke    the design   having proposed to write some pieces on human life and manners such as to use my lord bacons expression come home to mens business and bosoms i thought it more satisfactory to begin with considering man in the abstract his nature and his state since to prove any moral duty to enforce any moral precept or to examine the perfection or imperfection of any creature whatsoever it is necessary first to know what condition and relation it is placed in and what is the proper end and purpose of its being  the science of human nature is like all other sciences reduced to a few clear points there are not many certain truths in this world it is therefore in the anatomy of the mind as in that of the body more good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large open and perceptible parts than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels the conformations and uses of which will for ever escape our observation the disputes are all upon these last and i will venture to say they have less sharpened the wits than the hearts of men against each other and have diminished the practice more than advanced the theory of morality if i could flatter myself that this essay has any merit it is in steering betwixt the extremes of doctrines seemingly opposite in passing over terms utterly unintelligible and in forming a temperate yet not inconsistent and a short yet not imperfect system of ethics  this i might have done in prose but i chose verse and even rhyme for two reasons the one will appear obvious that principles maxims or precepts so written both strike the reader more strongly at first and are more easily retained by him afterwards the other may seem odd but is true i found i could express them more shortly this way than in prose itself and nothing is more certain than that much of the force as well as grace of arguments or instructions depends on their conciseness i was unable to treat this part of my subject more in detail without becoming dry and tedious or more poetically without sacrificing perspicuity to ornament without wandring from the precision or breaking the chain of reasoning if any man can unite all these without diminution of any of them i freely confess he will compass a thing above my capacity  what is now published is only to be considered as a general map of man marking out no more than the greater parts their extent their limits and their connection and leaving the particular to be more fully delineated in the charts which are to follow consequently these epistles in their progress if i have health and leisure to make any progress will be less dry and more susceptible of poetical ornament i am here only opening the fountains and clearing the passage to deduce the rivers to follow them in their course and to observe their effects may be a task more agreeable  p      argument of epistle i   of the nature and state of man with respect to the universe   of man in the abstract   i   v 17 c    that we can judge only with regard to our own                   system being ignorant of the relations of                   systems and things  ii  v 35 c   that man is not to be deemed imperfect but a being                   suited to his place and rank in the creation                   agreeable to the general order of things and                   conformable to ends and relations to him unknown  iii v 77 c   that it is partly upon his ignorance of future                   events and partly upon the hope of a future                   state that all his happiness in the present                   depends  iv  v 109 c the pride of aiming at more knowledge and                  pretending to more perfections the cause of mans                  error and misery the impiety of putting himself in                  the place of god and judging of the fitness or                  unfitness perfection or imperfection justice or                  injustice of his dispensations  v   v 131 c the absurdity of conceiting himself the final cause                  of the creation or expecting that perfection in the                  moral world which is not in the natural  vi  v 173 c the unreasonableness of his complaints against                  providence while on the one hand he demands the                  perfections of the angels and on the other the bodily                  qualifications of the brutes though to possess any of                  the sensitive faculties in a higher degree would                  render him miserable  vii v 207     that throughout the whole visible world an universal                  order and gradation in the sensual and mental                  faculties is observed which causes a subordination                  of creature to creature

several occasions offered i had no thoughts of publishing it till it pleased some persons of rank and fortune the authors of verses to the imitator of horace and of an epistle to a doctor of divinity from a nobleman at hampton court to attack in a very extraordinary manner not only my writings of which being public the public is judge but my person morals and family whereof to those who know me not a truer information may be requisite being divided between the necessity to say something of myself and my own laziness to undertake so awkward a task i thought it the shortest way to put the last hand to this epistle if it have any thing pleasing it will be that by which i am most desirous to please the truth and the sentiment and if any thing offensive it will be only to those i am least sorry to offend the vicious or the ungenerous  many will know their own pictures in it there being not a circumstance but what is true but i have for the most part spared their names and they may escape being laughed at if they please  i would have some of them know it was owing to the request of the learned and candid friend to whom it is inscribed that i make not as free use of theirs as they have done of mine however i shall have this advantage and honour on my side that whereas by their proceeding any abuse may be directed at any man no injury can possibly be done by mine since a

introduction   in 1711 pope who had just published his essay on criticism was looking about for new worlds to conquer a fortunate chance threw in his way a subject exactly suited to his tastes and powers he seized upon it dashed off his first sketch in less than a fortnight and published it anonymously in a miscellany issued by lintot in 1712 but the theme had taken firm root in his mind dissatisfied with his first treatment of it he determined against the advice of the best critic of the day to recast the work and lift it from a mere society jeu desprit into an elaborate mockheroic poem he did so and won a complete success even yet however he was not completely satisfied and from time to time he added a touch to his work until he finally produced the finished picture which we know as the rape of the lock as it stands it is an almost flawless masterpiece a brilliant picture and lighthearted mockery of the gay society of queen annes day on the whole the most satisfactory creation of popes genius and perhaps the best example of the mockheroic in any literature  the occasion which gave rise to the rape of the lock has been so often related that it requires only a brief restatement among the catholic families of queen annes day who formed a little society of their own miss arabella fermor was a reigning belle in a youthful frolic which overstepped the bounds of propriety lord petre a young nobleman of her acquaintance cut off a lock of her hair the lady was offended the two families took up the quarrel a lasting estrangement possibly even a duel was threatened at this juncture a common friend of the two families a mr caryll nephew of a wellknown jacobite exile for whom he is sometimes mistaken suggested to pope to write a poem to make a jest of it and so kill the quarrel with laughter pope consented wrote his first draft of the rape of the lock and passed it about in manuscript pope says himself that it had its effect in the two families certainly nothing more is heard of the feud how miss fermor received the poem is a little uncertain pope complains in a letter written some months after the poem had appeared in print that the celebrated lady is offended according to johnson she liked the verses well enough to show them to her friends and a niece of hers said years afterward that mr popes praise had made her aunt very troublesome and conceited it is not improbable that belinda was both flattered and offended delighted with the praise of her beauty she may none the less have felt called upon to play the part of the offended lady when the poem got about and the ribald wits of the day began to read into it double meanings which reflected upon her reputation to soothe her ruffled feelings pope dedicated the second edition of the poem to her in a delightful letter in which he thanked her for having permitted the publication of the first edition to forestall an imperfect copy offered to a bookseller declared that the character of belinda resembled her in nothing but in beauty and affirmed that he could never hope that his poem should pass through the world half so uncensured as she had done it would seem that the modern critics who have undertaken to champion miss fermor against what they are pleased to term the revolting behavior of the poet are fighting a needless battle a pretty girl who would long since have been forgotten sat as an unconscious model to a great poet he made her the central figure in a brilliant picture and rendered her name immortal that is the whole story and when carping critics begin to search the poem for the improprieties of conduct to which they say pope alluded one has but to answer in popes own words    if to her share some female errors fall   look on her face and youll forget em all  popes statement in the dedication that he had been forced into publishing the first draft of the poem before his design of enlarging it was half executed is probably to be taken like many of his statements with a sufficient grain of salt pope had a curious habit of protesting that he was forced into publishing his letters poems and other trifles merely to forestall the appearance of unauthorized editions it is more likely that it was the undoubted success of the rape of the lock in its first form which gave him the idea of working up the sketch into a complete mockheroic poem  examples of such a poem were familiar enough to pope not to go back to the pseudohomeric mock epic which relates the battle of the frogs and mice vida in italy and boileau in france with both of whom pope as the essay on criticism shows was well acquainted had done work of this kind vidas description of the game of chess in his scacchia ludus certainly gave him the model for the game of ombre in the third canto of the rape of the lock boileaus lutrin probably suggested to him the idea of using the mockheroic for the purposes of satire  now it was a dogma of the critical creed of the day which pope devoutly accepted that every epic must have a wellrecognized machinery machinery as he kindly explained to miss fermor was a term invented by the critics to signify that part which the deities angels or demons are made to act in a poem in short for the whole supernatural element such machinery was quite wanting in the first draft of the rape it must be supplied if the poem was to be a true epic even of the comic kind and the machinery must be of a nature which would lend itself to the light satiric tone of the poem what was it to be the employment of what we may call christian machinery the angels and devils of tasso and milton was of course out of the question the employment of the classic machinery was almost as impossible it would have been hard for such an admirer of the classics as pope to have taken the deities of olympus otherwise than seriously and even if he had been able to treat them humorously the humor would have been a form of burlesque quite at variance with what he had set out to accomplish for popes purpose springing naturally from the occasion which set him to writing the rape was not to burlesque what was naturally lofty by exhibiting it in a degraded light but to show the true littleness of the trivial by treating it in a grandiose and mockheroic fashion to make the quarrel over the stolen lock ridiculous by raising it to the plane of the epic contest before the walls of troy  in his perplexity a happy thought little less in fact than an inspiration of genius came to pope he had been reading a book by a clever french abbé treating in a satiric fashion of the doctrines of the socalled rosicrucians in particular of their ideas of elemental spirits and the influence of these spirits upon human affairs here was the machinery he was looking for made to his hand there would be no burlesque in introducing the rosicrucian sylphs and gnomes into a mockheroic poem for few people certainly not the author of the comte de gabalis took them seriously yet the widespread popularity of this book to say nothing of the existence of certain rosicrucian societies had rendered their names familiar to the society for which pope wrote he had but to weave them into the action of his poem and the brilliant little sketch of society was transformed into a true mockepic  the manner in which this interweaving was accomplished is one of the most satisfactory evidences of popes artistic genius he was proud of it himself the making the machinery and what was published before hit so well together is he told spencer i think one of the greatest proofs of judgment of anything i ever did and he might well be proud macaulay in a wellknown passage has pointed out how seldom in the history of literature such a recasting of a poem has been successfully accomplished but popes revision of the rape of the lock was so successful that the original form was practically done away with no one reads it now but professed students of the literature of queen annes time and so artfully has the new matter been woven into the old that if the recasting of the rape of the lock were not a commonplace even in school histories of english literature not one reader in a hundred would suspect that the original sketch had been revised and enlarged to more than twice its length it would be an interesting task for the student to compare the two forms printed in this edition to note exactly what has been added and the reasons for its addition and to mark how pope has smoothed the junctures and blended the old and the new nothing that he could do would admit him more intimately to the secrets of popes mastery of his art  a word must be said in closing as to the merits of the rape of the lock and its position in english literature in the first place it is an inimitable picture of one phase at least of the life of the time of the gay witty heartless society of queen annes day slowly recovering from the licentious excesses of the restoration society at this time was perhaps unmoral rather than immoral it was quite without ideals unless indeed the conventions of good form may be dignified by that name it lacked the brilliant enthusiasm of elizabethan times as well as the religious earnestness of the puritans and the devotion to patriotic and social ideals which marked a later age nothing perhaps is more characteristic of the age than its attitude toward women it affected indeed a tone of highflown adoration which thinly veiled a cynical contempt it styled woman a goddess and really regarded her as little better than a doll the passion of love had fallen from the high estate it once possessed and become the mere relaxation of the idle moments of a man of fashion  in the comedies of congreve for example a lover even if honestly in love thinks it as incumbent upon him to make light of his passion before his friends as to exaggerate it in all the forms of affected compliment before his mistress  in the rape of the lock pope has caught and fixed forever the atmosphere of this age it is not the mere outward form and circumstance the manners and customs the patching powdering ogling gambling of the day that he has reproduced though his account of these would alone suffice to secure the poem immortality as a contribution to the history of society the essential spirit of the age breathes from every line no great english poem is at once so brilliant and so empty so artistic and yet so devoid of the ideals on which all high art rests it is incorrect i think to consider pope in the rape of the lock as the satirist of his age he was indeed clever enough to perceive its follies and witty enough to make sport of them but it is much to be doubted whether he was wise enough at this time to raise his eyes to anything better in the social satires of popes great admirer byron we are at no loss to perceive the ideal of personal liberty which the poet opposes to the conventions he tears to shreds is it possible to discover in the rape of the lock any substitute for belindas fancies and the barons freaks the speech of clarissa which pope inserted as an afterthought to point the moral of the poem recommends belinda to trust to merit rather than to charms but merit is explicitly identified with good humor a very amiable quality but hardly of the highest rank among the moral virtues and the avowed end and purpose of merit is merely to preserve what beauty gains the flattering attentions of the other sexsurely the lowest ideal ever set before womankind the truth is i think that the rape of the lock represents popes attitude toward the social life of his time in the period of his brilliant youth he was at once dazzled amused and delighted by the gay world in which he found himself the apples of pleasure had not yet turned to ashes on his lips and it is the poets sympathy with the world he paints which gives to the poem the air most characteristic of the age itself of easy idle unthinking gayety we would not have it otherwise there are sermons and satires in abundance in english literature but there is only one rape of the lock  the form of the poem is in perfect correspondence with its spirit there is an immense advance over the essay on criticism in ease polish and balance of matter and manner and it is not merely in matters of detail that the supremacy of the latter poem is apparent the rape of the lock is remarkable among all popes longer poems as the one complete and perfect whole it is no mosaic of brilliant epigrams but an organic creation it is impossible to detach any one of its witty paragraphs and read it with the same pleasure it arouses when read in its proper connection thalestris call to arms and clarissas moral reproof are integral parts of the poem and as a result perhaps of its essential unity the rape of the lock bears witness to the presence of a power in pope that we should hardly have suspected from his other works the power of dramatic characterization elsewhere he has shown himself a master of brilliant portraiture but belinda the baron and thalestris are something more than portraits they are living people acting and speaking with admirable consistency even the little sketch of sir plume is instinct with life  finally the rape of the lock in its limitations and defects no less than in its excellencies represents a whole period of english poetry the period which reaches with but few exceptions from dryden to wordsworth the creed which dominated poetic composition during this period is discussed in the introduction to the essay on criticism see p 103 and is admirably illustrated in that poem itself its repression of individuality its insistence upon the necessity of following in the footsteps of the classic poets and of checking the outbursts of imagination by the rules of common sense simply incapacitated the poets of the period from producing works of the highest order and its insistence upon man as he appeared in the conventional urban society of the day as the one true theme of poetry its belief that the end of poetry was to instruct and improve either by positive teaching or by negative satire still further limited its field one must remember in attempting an estimate of the rape of the lock that it was composed with an undoubting acceptance of this creed and within all these narrowing limitations and when this is borne in mind it is hardly too much to say that the poem attains the highest point possible in its treatment of the supernatural it is as original as a poem could be at that day the brilliancy of its picture of contemporary society could not be heightened by a single stroke its satire is swift and keen but never ill natured and the personality of pope himself shines through every line johnson advised authors who wished to attain a perfect style to give their days and nights to a study of addison with equal justice one might advise students who wish to catch the spirit of our socalled augustan age and to realize at once the limitations and possibilities of its poetry to devote themselves to the study of the rape of the lock     dedication  mrs arabella  the title of mrs was still given in popes time to unmarried ladies as soon as they were old enough to enter society   the rosicrucian doctrine  the first mention of the rosicrucians is in a book published in germany in 1614 inviting all scholars to join the ranks of a secret society said to have been founded two centuries before by a certain christian rosenkreuz who had mastered the hidden wisdom of the east it seems probable that this book was an elaborate hoax but it was taken seriously at the time and the seventeenth century saw the formation of numerous groups of brothers of the rosy cross they dabbled in alchemy spiritualism and magic and mingled modern science with superstitions handed down from ancient times pope probably knew nothing more of them than what he had read in le comte de gabalis  this was the work of a french abbé de montfaucon villars 16351673 who was well known in his day both as a preacher and a man of letters it is really a satire upon the fashionable mystical studies but treats in a tone of pretended seriousness of secret sciences of elemental spirits and of their intercourse with men it was translated into english in 1680 and again in

tons of snuff found on board some spanish ships which he had captured in vigo bay  in the spectator for august 8 1711 a mock advertisement is inserted professing to teach the exercise of the snuffbox

labours of the toilet   26 two  knights  one of these was the baron see l 66   27 ombre  a game of cards invented in spain it takes its name from the spanish phrase originally used by the player who declared trumps yo soy lhombre ie i am the man it could be played by three five or nine players but the usual number was three as here each of these received nine cards and one of them named the trump and thus became the ombre who played against the two others if either of the ombres opponents took more tricks than the ombre it was codille l 92 this meant that the opponent took the stake and the ombre had to replace it for the next hand  a peculiar feature of ombre is the rank or value of the cards the three best cards were called matadores a spanish word meaning killers the first of these matadores was spadillio the ace of spades the third was basto the ace of clubs the second manillio varied according to the suit if a black suit were declared maniilio was the two of trumps if a red suit manillio was the seven of trumps it is worth noting also that the red aces were inferior to the face cards of their suits except when a red suit was trump  a brief analysis of the game played on this occasion will clear up the passage and leave the reader free to admire the ingenuity with which pope has described the contest in terms of epic poetry  belinda declares spades trumps and so becomes the ombre she leads one after the other the three matadores and takes three tricks she then leads the next highest card the king of spades and wins a fourth trick being out of trumps she now leads the king of clubs but the baron who has actually held more spades than belinda trumps it with the queen of spades all the trumps are now exhausted and the barons long suit of diamonds is established he takes the sixth seventh and eighth tricks with the king queen and knave of diamonds respectively everything now depends on the last trick since belinda and the baron each have taken four the baron leads the ace of hearts and belinda takes it with the king thus escaping codille and winning the stake   30 the sacred nine  the nine muses   41 succint  tucked up   54 one plebeian

belindas filling the sky with exulting shouts and some modern critics have been foolish enough to echo his objection the whole scene is a masterpiece of the mockheroic the game is a battle the cards are warriors and belindas exclamations of pleasure at winning are in the same fashion magnified into the cheers of a victorious army   100 long canals  the canals which run through the splendid

in which she stood and drank her health    there was in the place says steele a gay fellow halffuddled who   offered to jump in and swore though he liked not the liquor he would   have the toast he was opposed in his resolution yet this whim gave   foundation to the present honor which is done to the lady we mention   in our liquors who has ever since been called a toast  to understand the point of the story one must know that it was an old custom to put a bit of toast in hot drinks  in this line in the poem thalestris insinuates that if belinda submits tamely to the rape of the lock her position as a toast will be forfeited   113116  thalestris supposes that the baron will have the lock set in a ring under a bit of crystal oldfashioned hairrings of this kind are still to be seen

          an essay on criticism   introduction  the essay on criticism was the first really important work that pope gave to the world he had been composing verses from early boyhood and had actually published a set of pastorals which had attracted some attention he was already known to the literary set of london coffeehouses as a young man of keen wit and high promise but to the reading public at large he was as yet an unknown quantity with the appearance of the essay pope not only sprang at once into the full light of publicity but seized almost undisputed that position as the first of living english poets which he was to retain unchallenged till his death even after his death down to the romantic revival in fact popes supremacy was an article of critical faith and this supremacy was in no small measure founded upon the acknowledged merits of the essay on criticism johnson the last great representative of popes own school of thought in matters literary held that the poet had never excelled this early work and gave it as his deliberate opinion that if pope had written nothing else the essay would have placed him among the first poets and the first critics the essay on criticism is hardly an epochmaking poem but it certainly made alexander pope  the poem was published anonymously in the spring of 1711 when pope was twentythree years old there has been considerable dispute as to the date of its composition but the facts seem to be that it was begun in 1707 and finished in 1709 when pope had it printed not for publication but for purposes of further correction as it stands therefore it represents a work planned at the close of popes precocious youth and executed and polished in the first flush of his manhood and it is quite fair to say that considering the age of its author the essay on criticism is one of the most remarkable works in english  not that there is anything particularly original about the essay on the contrary it is one of the most conventional of all popes works it has nothing of the lively fancy of the rape of the lock little or nothing of the personal note which stamps the later satires and epistles as so peculiarly popes own apart from its brilliant epigrammatic expression the essay on criticism might have been written by almost any man of letters in queen annes day who took the trouble to think a little about the laws of literature and who thought about those laws strictly in accordance with the accepted conventions of his time pope is not in the least to be blamed for this lack of originality profound original criticism is perhaps the very last thing to be expected of a brilliant boy and pope was little more when he planned this work but boy as he was he had already accomplished an immense amount of desultory reading not only in literature proper but in literary criticism as well he told spence in later years that in his youth he had gone through all the best critics naming especially quintilian rapin and bossu a mere cursory reading of the essay shows that he had also studied horace vida and boileau before he began to write he had so he told spence digested all the matter of the poem into prose in other words then the essay on criticism is at once the result of popes early studies the embodiment of the received literary doctrines of his age and as a consecutive study of his poems shows the programme in accordance with which making due allowance for certain exceptions and inconsistencies he evolved the main body of his work  it would however be a mistake to treat as did popes first editor the essay on criticism as a methodical elaborate and systematic treatise pope indeed was flattered to have a scholar of such recognized authority as warburton to interpret his works and permitted him to print a commentary upon the essay which is quite as long and infinitely duller than the original but the true nature of the poem is indicated by its title it is not an art of poetry such as boileau composed but an essay and by the word essay pope meant exactly what bacon dida tentative sketch a series of detached thoughts upon a subject not a complete study or a methodical treatise all that we know of popes method of study habit of thought and practice of composition goes to support this opinion he read widely but desultorily thought swiftly and brilliantly but illogically and inconsistently and composed in minute sections on the backs of letters and scraps of waste paper fragments which he afterward united rather than blended to make a complete poem a mosaic rather than a picture  yet the essay is by no means the collection of independent maxims tied together by the printer but having no natural order which de quincey pronounced it to be it falls naturally into three parts the first deals with the rules derived by classic critics from the practice of great poets and ever since of binding force both in the composition and in the criticism of poetry the second analyzes with admirable sagacity the causes of faulty criticism as pride imperfect learning prejudice and so on the third part discusses the qualities which a true critic should possess good taste learning modesty frankness and tact and concludes with a brief sketch of the history of criticism from aristotle to walsh this is the general outline of the poem sufficient i think to show that it is not a mere bundle of poetic formulae but within these broad limits the thought of the poem wanders freely and is quite rambling inconsistent and illogical enough to show that pope is not formulating an exact and definitely determined system of thought  such indeed was i fancy hardly his purpose it was rather to give clear vivid and convincing expression to certain ideas which were at that time generally accepted as orthodox in the realm of literary criticism no better expression of these ideas can be found anywhere than in the essay itself but a brief statement in simple prose of some of the most important may serve as a guide to the young student of the essay  in the first place the ultimate source alike of poetry and criticism is a certain intuitive faculty common to all men though more highly developed in some than others called reason or sometimes good sense the first rule for the budding poet or critic is follow nature this by the way sounds rather modern and might be accepted by any romantic poet but by nature was meant not at all the natural impulses of the individual but those rules founded upon the natural and common reason of mankind which the ancient critics had extracted and codified from the practice of the ancient poets pope says explicitly to follow nature is to follow them and he praises virgil for turning aside from his own original conceptions to imitate homer for    nature and homer were he found the same  certain exceptions to these rules were indeed allowableseverer critics than pope by the way absolutely denied thisbut only to the ancient poets the moderns must not dare to make use of them or at the very best moderns must only venture upon such exceptions to the rules as classic precedents would justify inasmuch as all these rules were discovered and illustrated in ancient times it followed logically that the great breach with antiquity which is called the middle ages was a period of hopeless and unredeemed barbarism incapable of bringing forth any good thing the light of literature began to dawn again with the revival of learning at the renaissance but the great poets of the renaissance spenser and shakespeare for example were irregular that is they trusted too much to their individual powers and did not accept with sufficient humility the orthodox rules of poetry this dogma by the way is hardly touched upon in the essay but is elaborated with great emphasis in popes later utterance on the principles of literature the wellknown epistle to augustus finally with the establishment of the reign of reason in france under louis xiv and in england a little later the full day had come and literary sins of omission and commission that might be winked at in such an untutored genius as shakespeare were now unpardonable this last dogma explains the fact that in the brief sketch of the history of criticism which concludes the essay pope does not condescend to name an english poet or critic prior to the reign of charles ii  it would be beside the purpose to discuss these ideas today or to attempt an elaborate refutation of their claims to acceptance time has done its work upon them and the literary creed of the wits of queen annes day is as antiquated as their periwigs and kneebreeches except for purposes of historical investigation it is quite absurd to take the essay on criticism seriously  and yet it has even for us of today a real value our age absolutely lacks a standard of literary criticism and of all standards the one least likely to be accepted is that of pope and his fellowbelievers individual taste reigns supreme in this democratic age and one mans judgment is as good as perhaps a little better than anothers but even this democratic and individual age may profit by turning back for a time to consider some of the general truths as valid today as ever to which pope gave such inimitable expression or to study the outlines of that noble picture of the true critic which st beuve declared every professed critic should frame and hang up in his study an age which seems at times upon the point of throwing classical studies overboard as useless lumber might do far worse than listen to the eloquent tribute which the poet pays to the great writers of antiquity and finally nothing could be more salutary for an age in which literature itself has caught something of the taint of the prevailing commercialism than to bathe itself again in that spirit of sincere and disinterested love of letters which breathes throughout the essay and which in spite of all his errors and jealousies and petty vices was the masterpassion of alexander pope    6 censure  the word has here its original meaning of judge not its modern judge severely or blame   8  because each foolish poem provokes a host of foolish commentators and critics   1516  this assertion that only a good writer can be a fair critic is not to be accepted without reservation   17  the word wit has a number of different meanings in this poem and the student should be careful to discriminate between them it means  1 mind intellect l 61 2 learning culture l 727 3 imagination genius l 82 4 the power to discover amusing analogies or the apt expression of such an analogy ll 449 297 5 a man possessed of wit in its various significations l 45 this last form usually occurs in the plural ll 104 539   26 the maze of schools  the labyrinth of conflicting systems of thought especially of criticism   21 coxcombs  fools  what is the difference in meaning between these words in this passage   3031  in this couplet pope hits off the spiteful envy of conceited critics toward successful writers if the critic can write himself he hates the author as a rival if he cannot he entertains against him the deep grudge an incapable man so often cherishes toward an effective worker   34 mævius  a poetaster whose name has been handed down by virgil and horace his name like that of his associate bavius has become a byword for a wretched scribbler  apollo  here thought of as the god of poetry the true poet was inspired by apollo but a poetaster like mævius wrote without inspiration as it were in spite of the god   4043  pope here compares halflearned critics to the animals which old writers reported were bred from the nile mud in antony and cleopatra for example lepidus says your serpent of egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun so is your crocodile pope thinks of these animals as in the unformed stage part kindled into life part a lump of mud so these critics are unfinished things for which no proper name can be found equivocal generation is the old term used to denote spontaneous generation of this sort pope applies it here to critics without proper training who spring spontaneously from the mire of ignorance   44 tell  count   45  the idea is that a vain wits tongue could outtalk a hundred ordinary mens   53 pretending wit  presuming or ambitious mind   5658 memory  understanding imagination  this is the old threefold division of the human mind pope means that where one of these faculties is above the average in any individual another of them is sure to fall below is this always the case   63 peculiar arts  special branches of knowledge   73  in what sense can nature be called the source the end and the test of art   76 th informing soul  the soul which not only dwells in but animates and molds the body   8081  what two meanings are attached to wit in this couplet   84 tis more  it is more important  the muses steed  pegasus the winged horse of greek

commentary on homer in what sense is this to be understood   130 maro  virgil whose full name was publius vergilius maro pope here praises virgils wellknown imitation of homer since nature and homer were the same a young poet like virgil could do nothing better than copy homer   138 the stagirite  aristotle a native of stagyra was the first and one of the greatest of literary critics his rules were drawn from the practice of great poets and so according to pope to imitate homer was to obey the ancient rules   141  there are some beauties in poetry which cannot be explained by criticism   142 happiness  used here to express the peculiar charm of spontaneous poetic expression as contrasted with care ie the art of revising and improving which can be taught   152 vulgar bounds  the

exceptions to the rules of poetry when these are justified by the poets genius true critics do not presume to correct them in many editions this couplet comes after l 151 this was popes first arrangement but he later shifted it to its present position   162 as kings  the stuart kings claimed the right to dispense with laws that is to set them aside in special instances in 1686 eleven out of twelve english judges decided in a test case that it is a privilege inseparably connected with the sovereignty of the king to dispense with penal laws and that according to his own judgment the english people very naturally felt that such a privilege opened the door to absolute monarchy and after the fall of james ii parliament declared in 1689 that the pretended power of suspending of laws  without the consent of parliament is illegal   164 its end  the purpose of every law of poetry namely to please the reader this purpose must not be transgressed ie forgotten by those who wish to make exceptions to these laws   166 their precedent  the example of classic poets   179 stratagems  error  things in the classic poets which to carping critics seem faults are often clever devices to make a deeper impression on the reader   180 homer nods  horace in his art of poetry used this figure to imply that even the greatest poet sometimes made mistakes pope very neatly suggests that it may be

great spaces of learning that lie behind the first objects of our study   225232  this fine simile is one of the best expressions in english verse of the modesty of the true scholar due to his realization of the boundless extent of knowledge it was such a feeling that led sir isaac newton to say after all his wonderful discoveries    i do not know what i may appear to the world but to myself i seem to   have been only like a boy playing on the seashore and diverting myself   in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than   ordinary whilst the great ocean of

inclined than a stranger to wonder at the perfect proportions of any of them but there are two at least the pantheon and st peters which might justly evoke the admiration even of a roman it was probably of one of these that pope was thinking   265  what is the difference between principles and notions in this line   265 la manchas knight  don quixote the anecdote that follows is not taken from cervantes novel but from a continuation of it by an author calling himself avellanada the story is that don quixote once fell in with a scholar who had written a play about a persecuted queen of bohemia her innocence in the original story was established by a combat in the lists but this the poet proposed to omit as contrary to the rules of aristotle the don although professing great respect for aristotle insisted that the combat was the best part of the story and must be acted even if a special theater had to be built for the purpose or the play given in the open fields pope quotes this anecdote to show how some critics in spite of their professed acceptance of general rules are so prejudiced in favor of a minor point as to judge a whole work of art from one standpoint only   270 dennis  john dennis a playwright and critic of popes time pope and he were engaged in frequent quarrels but this first reference to him in popes works is distinctly complimentary the line probably refers to some remarks by dennis on the grecian stage in his impartial critic a pamphlet published in 1693   273 nice  discriminating in l 286 the meaning is overscrupulous finicky   276 unities  according to the laws of dramatic composition generally accepted in popes day a play must observe the unities of subject place and time that is it must have one main theme not a number of diverse stories for its plot all the scenes must be laid in one place or as nearly so as possible and the action must be begun and finished within the space of twentyfour hours   286 curious  fastidious

syllables in a line no matter what sort of sound or sense results for instance they do not object to a series of open vowels ie hiatuses caused by the juxtaposition of such words as tho and oft the and ear line 345 is composed especially to show how feeble a rhythm results from such a succession of open vowels they do not object to bolstering up a line with expletives such as do in l 346 nor to using ten low words ie short monosyllabic words to make up a line   347  with this line pope passes unconsciously from speaking of bad critics to denouncing some of the errors of bad poets who keep on using hackneyed phrases and wornout metrical devices   356 alexandrine  a line of six iambic feet such as l 357 written especially to illustrate this form why does pope use the adjective needless here   361 denhams strength  wallers sweetness  waller and denham were poets of the century before pope they are almost forgotten today but were extravagantly admired in his time waller began and denham continued the fashion of writing in closed heroic couplets ie in verses where the sense is for the most part contained within one couplet and does not run over into the next as had been the fashion in earlier verse dryden said that the excellence and dignity of rhyme were never fully known till mr waller taught it and the same critic spoke of denhams poetry as majestic and correct   370 ajax  one

so swift of foot that she might have run over a field of wheat without breaking the stalks or across the sea without wetting her feet pope attempts in l 373 to reproduce in the sound and movement of his verse the sense of swift flight   374 timotheus  a greek poet and singer who was said to have played and sung before alexander the great the reference in this passage is to drydens famous poem

of the old disputants lie covered with cobwebs in ducklane a street in london where secondhand books were sold in popes day he calls the cobwebs kindred because the arguments of thomists and scotists were as fine spun as a spiders web   449  the latest fashionable folly is the test or the proof of a quick uptodate wit in other words to be generally accepted an author must accept the current

much of his early work including the first draft of this very poem pope was sincerely attached to him and this tribute to his dead friend is marked by deep and genuine feeling   738 short excursions  such as this essay on criticism instead of longer and more ambitious poems which pope planned and in part executed in his boyhood there is no reason to believe with mr elwin that this passage proves that pope formed the design of the poem after the death of walsh                                               an essay on man   introduction  the essay on man is the longest and in some ways the most important work of the third period of popes career it corresponds closely to his early work the essay on criticism like the earlier work the essay on man is a didactic poem written primarily to diffuse and popularize certain ideas of the poet as in the earlier work these ideas are by no means original with pope but were the common property of a school of thinkers in his day as in the essay on criticism pope here attempts to show that these ideas have their origin in nature and are consistent with the common sense of man and finally the merit of the later work even more than of the earlier is due to the force and brilliancy of detached passages rather than to any coherent consistent and wellbalanced system which it presents  the close of the seventeenth century and beginning of the eighteenth was marked by a change of ground in the sphere of religious controversy the old debates between the catholic and protestant churches gradually died out as these two branches of western christianity settled down in quiet possession of the territory they still occupy in their place arose a vigorous controversy on the first principles of religion in general on the nature of god the origin of evil the place of man in the universe and the respective merits of optimism and pessimism as philosophic theories the controversialists as a rule either rejected or neglected the dogmas of revealed religion and based their arguments upon real or supposed facts of history physical nature and the mental processes and moral characteristics of man in this controversy the two parties at times were curiously mingled orthodox clergymen used arguments which justified a strong suspicion of their orthodoxy and avowed freethinkers bitterly disclaimed the imputation of atheism and wrote in terms that might be easily adopted by a devout believer  into this controversy pope was led by his deepening intimacy with bolingbroke who had returned from france in 1725 and settled at his country place within a few miles of twickenham during his long exile bolingbroke had amused himself with the study of moral philosophy and natural religion and in his frequent intercourse with pope he poured out his newfound opinions with all the fluency vigor and polish which made him so famous among the orators and talkers of the day bolingbrokes views were for that time distinctly heterodox and if logically developed led to complete agnosticism but he seems to have avoided a complete statement of his ideas to pope possibly for fear of shocking or frightening the sensitive little poet who still remained a professed catholic pope however was very far from being a strict catholic and indeed prided himself on the breadth and liberality of his opinions he was therefore at once fascinated and stimulated by the eloquent conversation of bolingbroke and resolved to write a philosophical poem in which to embody the ideas they held in common bolingbroke approved of the idea and went so far as to furnish the poet with seven or eight sheets of notes to direct the plan in general and to supply matter for particular epistles lord bathurst who knew both pope and bolingbroke went so far as to say in later years that the essay was originally composed by bolingbroke in prose and that pope only put it into verse but this is undoubtedly an exaggeration of what pope himself frankly acknowledged that the poem was composed under the influence of bolingbroke that in the main it reflected his opinions and that bolingbroke had assisted him in the general plan and in numerous details very properly therefore the poem is addressed to bolingbroke and begins and closes with a direct address to the poets guide philosopher and friend  in substance the essay on man is a discussion of the moral order of the world its purpose is to vindicate the ways of god to man and it may therefore be regarded as an attempt to confute the skeptics who argued from the existence of evil in the world and the wretchedness of mans existence to the impossibility of belief in an allgood and allwise god it attempts to do this not by an appeal to revelation or the doctrines of christianity but simply on the basis of a commonsense interpretation of the facts of existence  a brief outline of the poem will show the general tenor of popes argument  the first epistle deals with the nature and state of man with respect to the universe it insists on the limitations of mans knowledge and the consequent absurdity of his presuming to murmur against god it teaches that the universe was not made for man but that man with all his apparent imperfections is exactly fitted to the place which he occupies in the universe in the physical universe all things work together for good although certain aspects of nature seem evil to man and likewise in the moral universe all things even mans passions and crimes conduce to the general good of the whole finally it urges calm submission and acquiescence in what is hard to understand since one truth is clearwhatever is is right  the second epistle deals with the nature of man as an individual it begins by urging men to abandon vain questionings of gods providence and to take up the consideration of their own natures for the proper study of mankind is man pope points out that the two cardinal principles of mans nature are selflove and reason the first an impelling the second a regulating power the aim of both these principles is pleasure by which pope means happiness which he takes for the highest good each man is dominated by a master passion and it is the proper function of reason to control this passion for good and to make it bear fruit in virtue no man is wholly virtuous or vicious and heaven uses the mingled qualities of men to bind them together in mutual interdependence and makes the various passions and imperfections of mankind serve the general good and the final conclusion is that though mans a fool yet god is wise  the third epistle treats of the nature of man with respect to society all creatures pope asserts are bound together and live not for themselves alone but man is preeminently a social being the first state of man was the state of nature when he lived in innocent ignorance with his fellowcreatures obeying the voice of nature man learned to copy and improve upon the instincts of the animals to build to plow to spin to unite in societies like those of ants and bees the first form of government was patriarchal then monarchies arose in which virtue in arms or arts made one man ruler over many in either case the origin of true government as of true religion was love gradually force crept in and uniting with superstition gave rise to tyranny and false religions poets and patriots however restored the ancient faith and taught powers due use by showing the necessity of harmony in the state pope concludes by asserting the folly of contention for forms of government or modes of faith the common end of government as of religion is the general good it may be noticed in passing that popes account of the evolution of society bears even less relation to historical facts than does his account of the development of literature in the essay on criticism  the last epistle discusses the nature of happiness our beings end and aim happiness is attainable by all men who think right and mean well it consists not in individual but in mutual pleasure it does not consist in external things mere gifts of fortune but in health peace and competence virtuous men are indeed subject to calamities of nature but god cannot be expected to suspend the operation of general laws to spare the virtuous objectors who would construct a system in which all virtuous men are blest are challenged to define the virtuous and to specify what is meant by blessings honors nobility fame superior talents often merely serve to make their possessors unhappy virtue alone is happiness and virtue consists in a recognition of the laws of providence and in love for ones fellowman  even this brief outline will show i think some of the inconsistencies and omissions of popes train of thought a careful examination of his arguments in detail would be wholly out of place here the reader who wishes to pursue the subject further may consult warburtons elaborate vindication of popes argument and elwins equally prosy refutation or better still the admirable summary by leslie stephen in the chapter on this poem in his life of pope english men of letters no one is now likely to turn to the writer of the early eighteenth century for a system of the universe least of all to a writer so incapable of exact or systematic thinking as alexander pope if the essay on man has any claim to be read today it must be as a piece of literature pure and simple for philosophy and poetry combined browning and tennyson lie nearer to our age and mode of thought than pope  even regarded as a piece of literature the essay on man cannot i think claim the highest place among popes works it obtained indeed a success at home and abroad such as was achieved by no other english poem until the appearance of childe harold it was translated into french german italian portuguese polish and latin it was imitated by wieland praised by voltaire and quoted by kant but this success was due in part to the accuracy with which it reflected ideas which were the common property of its age in part to the extraordinary vigor and finish of its epigrams which made it one of the most quotable of english poems but as a whole the essay is not a great poem the poet is evidently struggling with a subject that is too weighty for him and at times he staggers and sinks beneath his burden the second and third books in particular are it must be confessed with the exception of one or two fine outbursts little better than dull and dullness is not a quality one is accustomed to associate with pope the essay on man lacks the bright humor and imaginative artistry of the rape of the lock and the lively portraiture vigorous satire and strong personal note of the moral epistles and imitations of horace pope is at his best when he is dealing with a concrete world of men and women as they lived and moved in the london of his day he is at his worst when he is attempting to seize and render abstract ideas  yet the essay on man is a very remarkable work in the first place it shows popes wonderful power of expression no one can read the poem for the first time without meeting on page after page phrases and epigrams which have become part of the common currency of our language popes precision and firmness of touch to quote the apt statement of leslie stephen enables him to get the greatest possible meaning into a narrow compass he uses only one epithet but it is the right one even when the thought is commonplace enough the felicity of the expression gives it a new and effective force and there are whole passages where pope rises high above the mere coining of epigrams as i have tried to show in my notes he composed by separate paragraphs and when he chances upon a topic that appeals to his imagination or touches his heart we get an outburst of poetry that shines in splendid contrast to the prosaic plainness of its surroundings such for example are the noble verses that tell of the immanence of god in his creation at the close of the first epistle or the magnificent invective against tyranny and superstition in the third ll 241268  finally the essay on man is of interest in what it tells us of pope himself mr elwins idea that in the essay on man pope partly the dupe partly the accomplice of bolingbroke was attempting craftily to undermine the foundations of religion is a notion curiously compounded of critical blindness and theological rancor in spite of all its incoherencies and futilities the essay is an honest attempt to express popes opinions borrowed in part of course from his admired friend but in part the current notions of his age on some of the greatest questions that have perplexed the mind of man and popes attitude toward the questions is that of the best minds of his day at once religious independent and sincere he acknowledges the omnipotence and benevolence of god confesses the limitations and imperfections of human knowledge teaches humility in the presence of unanswerable problems urges submission to divine providence extols virtue as the true source of happiness and love of man as an essential of virtue if we study the essay on man as the reasoned argument of a philosopher we shall turn from it with something like contempt if we read it as the expression of a poets sentiments we shall i think leave it with an admiration warmer than before for a character that has been so much abused and so little understood as that of pope    the design  2 bacons expression  in the dedication of his essays 1625 to buckingham bacon speaks of them

accent on the antepenult   4350  pope here takes it for granted that our universe inasmuch as it is the work of gods infinite wisdom must be the best system possible if this be granted he says it is plain that man must have a place somewhere in this system and the only question is whether god has placed him wrong   45  every grade in creation must be complete so as to join with that which is beneath and with that which is above it or there would be a lack of coherency a break somewhere in the system   47 reasning life  conscious mental life   5160  pope argues here that since man is a part of the best possible system whatever seems wrong in him must be right when considered in relation to the whole order of the universe it is only our ignorance of this order which keeps us from realizing this fact   55 one single  the word movement is understood after single   6168  pope here illustrates his preceding argument by analogy we can know no more of gods purpose in the ordering of our lives than the animals can know of our ordering of theirs   64 Ægypts god  one of the gods of the egyptians was the sacred bull apis   68 a deity  worshiped as a god like the egyptian kings and roman emperors   6976  pope now goes on to argue that on the basis of what has been proved we ought not to regard man as an imperfect being but rather as one who is perfectly adapted to his place in the universe his knowledge for example is measured by the brief time he has to live and the brief space he can survey   69 fault  pronounced in popes day as rhyming with ought   7376  these lines are really out of place they first appeared after l 98 then pope struck them out altogether just before his death he put them into their present place on the advice of warburton who probably approved of them because of their reference to a future state of bliss it is plain that they interfere with the regular argument of the poem   79  this line is grammatically dependent upon hides l 77   81 riot

from its true home the life to come this line represents one of the alterations which warburton induced pope to make the poet first wrote confined at home thus representing this life as the home of the soul his friend led him to make the change in order to express more clearly his belief in the souls immortality   89  show how rests and expatiates in this line contrast with uneasy and confined in l 97   99112  in this famous passage pope shows how the belief in immortality is found even among the most ignorant tribes this is to pope an argument that the soul must be immortal since only nature or god working through nature could have implanted this conception in the indians mind   102 the solar walk  the suns path in the heavens  the milky way  some old philosophers held that the souls of good men went thither after death   pope means that the ignorant indian had no conception of a heaven reserved for the just such as greek sages and christian believers have all he believes in

general laws due perhaps to some change in nature since the world began ll 145148 pope replies by asking why there should not be exceptions in the moral as well as in the physical world may not great villains be compared to terrible catastrophes in nature ll 148156 he goes on to say that no one but god can answer this question that our human reasoning springs from pride and that the true course of

animal world there is an exact gradation of the faculties of sense and of the powers of instinct man alone is endowed with reason which is more than equivalent to all these powers and makes him lord

that there is no reason why hair and heart should be contrasted but pope may have had in mind the saying of christ the very hairs of your head are all numbered the hairs are spoken of here as the least important part of the body the heart on the other hand has always been thought of as the most important organ there is therefore a real antithesis between the two   278 seraph  burns  the

has been preaching throughout this epistle possibly it means that all things high and low are filled alike with the divine spirit and in this sense all things are equal but one must not expect to find exact and consistent philosophy in the essay on man   281294  here pope sums up the argument of this epistle urging man to recognize his ignorance to be content with his seeming imperfections and to

think the epistle to arbuthnot is the most interesting and the most important of popes poemsthe most important since it shows the master poet of the age employing his ripened powers in the field most suitable for their display that of personal satire the most interesting because unlike his former satiric poem the dunciad it is not mere invective but gives us as no other poem of popes can be said to do a portrait of the poet himself  like most of popes poems the epistle to arbuthnot owes its existence to an objective cause this was the poets wish to justify himself against a series of savage attacks which had recently been directed against him if pope had expected by the publication of the dunciad to crush the herd of scribblers who had been for years abusing him he must have been woefully disappointed on the contrary the roar of insult and calumny rose louder than ever and new voices were added to the chorus in the year 1733 two enemies entered the field against pope such as he had never yet had to encounterenemies of high social position of acknowledged wit and of a certain though as the sequel proved quite inadequate talent for satire these were lady mary wortley montague and lord john hervey  lady mary had been for years acknowledged as one of the wittiest most learned and most beautiful women of her day pope seems to have met her in 1715 and at once joined the train of her admirers when she accompanied her husband on his embassy to constantinople in the following year the poet entered into a long correspondence with her protesting in the most elaborate fashion his undying devotion on her return he induced her to settle with her husband at twickenham here he continued his attentions half real half in the affected gallantry of the day until to quote the ladys own words to her daughter many years after at some illchosen time when she least expected what romancers call a declaration he made such passionate love to her as in spite of her utmost endeavours to be angry and look grave provoked an immoderate fit of laughter and she added from that moment pope became her implacable enemy certainly by the time pope began to write the dunciad he was so far estranged from his old friend that he permitted himself in that poem a scoffing allusion to a scandal in which she had recently become involved the lady answered or the poet thought that she did with an anonymous pamphlet a pop upon pope describing a castigation wholly imaginary said to have been inflicted upon the poet as a proper reward for his satire after this of course all hope of a reconciliation was at an end and in his satires and epistles pope repeatedly introduced lady mary under various titles in the most offensive fashion in his first imitation of horace published in february 1733 he referred in the most unpardonable manner to a certain sappho and the dangers attendant upon any acquaintance with her lady mary was foolish enough to apply the lines to herself and to send a common friend to remonstrate with pope he coolly replied that he was surprised that lady mary should feel hurt since the lines could only apply to certain women naming four notorious scribblers whose lives were as immoral as their works such an answer was by no means calculated to turn away the ladys wrath and for an ally in the campaign of anonymous abuse that she now planned she sought out her friend lord hervey john hervey called by courtesy lord hervey the second son of the earl of bristol was one of the most prominent figures at the court of george ii he had been made vicechamberlain of the royal household in 1730 and was the intimate friend and confidential adviser of queen caroline clever affable unprincipled and cynical he was a perfect type of the georgian courtier to whom loyalty patriotism honesty and honor were so many synonyms for folly he was effeminate in habits and appearance but notoriously licentious he affected to scoff at learning but made some pretense to literature and had written four epistles after the manner of ovid and numerous political pamphlets pope who had some slight personal acquaintance with him disliked his political connections and probably despised his verses and in the imitation already mentioned had alluded to him under the title of lord fanny as capable of turning out a thousand lines of verse a day this was sufficient cause if cause were needed to induce hervey to join lady mary in her warfare against pope  the first blow was struck in an anonymous poem probably the combined work of the two allies called verses addressed to the imitator of horace which appeared in march 1733 and it was followed up in august by an epistle from a nobleman to a doctor of divinity which also appeared anonymously but was well known to be the work of lord hervey in these poems pope was abused in the most unmeasured terms his work was styled a mere collection of libels he had no invention except in defamation he was a mere pretender to genius his morals were not left unimpeached he was charged with selling other mens work printed in his namea gross distortion of his employing assistants in the translation of the odysseyhe was ungrateful unjust a foe to human kind an enemy like the devil to all that have being the noble authors probably well aware how they could give the most pain proceeded to attack his family and his distorted person his parents were obscure and vulgar people and he himself a wretched outcast    with the emblem of his crooked mind   marked on his back like cain by gods own hand  and to cap the climax as soon as these shameful libels were in print lord hervey bustled off to show them to the queen and to laugh with her over the fine way in which he had put down the bitter little poet  in order to understand and appreciate popes reception of these attacks we must recall to ourselves the position in which he lived he was a catholic and i have already introduction p x called attention to the precarious tenure by which the catholics of his time held their goods their persons their very lives in security he was the intimate of bolingbroke of all men living the most detested by the court and his noble friends were almost without exception the avowed enemies of the court party pope had good reason to fear that the malice of his enemies might not be content to stop with abusive doggerel but he was not in the least intimidated on the contrary he broke out in a fine flame of wrath against lord hervey whom he evidently considered the chief offender challenged his enemy to disavow the epistle and on his declining to do so proceeded to make what he called a proper reply in a prose letter to a noble lord this masterly piece of satire was passed about from hand to hand but never printed we are told that sir robert walpole who found hervey a convenient tool in court intrigues bribed pope not to print it by securing a good position in france for one of the priests who had watched over the poets youth if this story be true and we have horace walpoles authority for it we may well imagine that the entry of the bribe like that of uncle tobys oath was blotted out by a tear from the books of the recording angel  but pope was by no means disposed to let the attacks go without an answer of some kind and the particular form which his answer took seems to have been suggested by a letter from arbuthnot i make it my last request wrote his beloved physician now sinking fast under the diseases that brought him to the grave that you continue that noble disdain and abhorrence of vice which you seem so naturally endued with but still with a due regard to your own safety and study more to reform than to chastise though the one often cannot be effected without the other i took very kindly your advice pope replied  and it has worked so much upon me considering the time and state you gave it in that i determined to address to you one of my epistles written by piecemeal many years and which i have now made haste to put together wherein the question is stated what were and are my motives of writing the objections to them and my answers in other words the epistle to arbuthnot which we see that pope was working over at the date of this letter august 25 1734 was in the oldfashioned phrase his apologia his defense of his life and work  as usual popes account of his work cannot be taken literally a comparison of dates shows that the epistle instead of having been written by piecemeal many years is essentially the work of one impulse the desire to vindicate his character his parents and his work from the aspersions cast upon them by lord hervey and lady mary the exceptions to this statement are two or possibly three passages which we know to have been written earlier and worked into the poem with infinite art  the first of these is the famous portrait of addison as atticus i have already spoken of the reasons that led to popes breach with addison introduction p xv and there is good reason to believe that this portrait sprang directly from popes bitter feeling toward the elder writer for his preference of tickells translation the lines were certainly written in addisons lifetime though we may be permitted to doubt whether pope really did send them to him as he once asserted they did not appear in print however till four years after addisons death when they were printed apparently without popes consent in a volume of miscellanies it is interesting to note that in this form the full name addison appeared in the last line some time later pope acknowledged the verses and printed them with a few changes in his miscellany of 1727 substituting the more decorous an for the addison of the first text finally he worked over the passage again and inserted it for a purpose that will be shown later in the epistle to arbuthnot  it is not worth while to discuss here the justice or injustice of this famous portrait in fact the question hardly deserves to be raised the passage is admittedly a satire and a satire makes no claim to be a just and final sentence admitting as we must that pope was in the wrong in his quarrel with addison we may well admit that he has not done him full justice but we must equally admit that the picture is drawn with wonderful skill that praise and blame are deftly mingled and that the satire is all the more severe because of its frank admission of the great mans merits and it must also be said that pope has hit off some of the faults of addisons characterhis coldness his selfcomplacency his quiet sneer his indulgence of flattering foolsin a way that none of his biographers have done that pope was not blind to addisons chief merit as an author is fully shown by a passage in a later poem less well known than the portrait of atticus but well worth quotation after speaking of the licentiousness of literature in restoration days he goes on to say    in our own excuse some courtly stains   no whiter page than addisons remains   he from the taste obscene reclaims our youth   and sets the passions on the side of truth   forms the soft bosom with the gentlest art   and pours each human virtue in the heart    epistle to augustus ii 215220  if pope was unjust to addison the man he at least made amends to addison the moralist  the second passage that may have had an independent existence before the epistle was conceived is the portrait of bufo ll 229247 there is reason to believe that this attack was first aimed at bubb doddington a courtier of herveys class though hardly of so finished a type to whom pope alludes as bubo in l 278 when pope was working on the epistle however he saw an opportunity to vindicate his own independence of patronage by a satiric portrait of the great maecenas of his younger days lord halifax who had ventured some foolish criticisms on popes translation of the iliad and seems to have expected that the poet should dedicate the great work to him in return for an offer of a pension which he made and pope declined there is no reason to believe that pope cherished any very bitter resentment toward halifax on the contrary in a poem published some years after the epistle he boasted of his friendship with halifax naming him outright and adding in a note that the noble lord was no less distinguished by his love of letters than his abilities in parliament  the third passage a tender reference to his mothers age and weakness was written at least as early as 1731mrs pope died in 1733and was incorporated in the epistle to round it off with a picture of the poet absorbed in his filial duties at the very time that hervey and lady mary were heaping abuse upon him as a monster devoid of all good qualities and now having discussed the various insertions in the epistle let us look for a moment at the poem as a whole and see what is the nature of popes defense of himself and of his reply to his enemies  it is cast in the form of a dialogue between the poet himself and arbuthnot pope begins by complaining of the misfortunes which his reputation as a successful man of letters has brought upon him he is a mark for all the starving scribblers of the town who besiege him for advice recommendations and hard cash is it not enough to make a man write dunciads arbuthnot warns him against the danger of making foes ll 101 104 but pope replies that his flatterers are even more intolerable than his open enemies and with a little outburst of impatience such as we may well imagine him to have indulged in during his later years he cries    why did i write what sin to me unknown   dipt me in ink my parents or my own  and begins with l 125 his poetical autobiography he tells of his first childish efforts of poetry taken up to help me thro this long disease my life and then goes on to speak of the noble and famous friends who had praised his early work and urged him to try his fortune in the open field of letters he speaks of his first poems the pastorals and windsor forest harmless as herveys own verses and tells how even then critics like dennis fell foul of him rival authors hated him too especially such pilfering bards as philips this he could endure but the coldness and even jealousy of such a man as addisonand here appears the famous portrait of atticuswas another matter serious enough to draw tears from all lovers of mankind  passing on l 213 to the days of his great success when his homer was the talk of the town he asserts his ignorance of all the arts of puffery and his independence of mutual admiration societies he left those who wished a patron to the tender mercies of halifax who fed fat on flattery and repaid his flatterers merely with a good word or a seat at his table after all the poet could afford to lose the society of bufos toadies while such a friend as gay was left him l 254  after an eloquent expression of his wish for independence ll 261270 he goes on to speak of the babbling friends who insist that he is always meditating some new satire and persist in recognizing some wretched poetasters lampoon as his and so by a natural transition pope comes to speak of his own satiric poems and their aims he says and rightly that he has never attacked virtue or innocence he reserves his lash for those who trample on their neighbors and insult fallen worth for cold or treacherous friends liars and babbling blockheads let sporus hervey tremble l 303 arbuthnot interposes herewith an ejaculation of contemptuous pity is it really worth the poets while to castigate such a slight thing as hervey that mere white curd but pope has suffered too much from herveys insolence to stay his hand and he now proceeds to lay on the lash with equal fury and precision drawing blood at every stroke until we seem to see the wretched fop writhing and shrieking beneath the whip and then with a magnificent transition he goes on ll 332337 to draw a portrait of himself here he says in effect is the real man that sporus has so maligned the portrait is idealized of course one could hardly expect a poet speaking in his own defense in reply to venomous attacks to dissect his own character with the stern impartiality of the critics of the succeeding century but it is in all essentials a portrait at once impressive and true  arbuthnot again interrupts l 358 to ask why he spares neither the poor nor the great in his satire and pope replies that he hates knaves in every rank of life yet by nature he insists he is of an easy temper more readily deceived than angered and in a long catalogue of instances he illustrates his own patience and good nature ll 366385 it must be frankly confessed that these lines do not ring true pope might in the heat of argument convince himself that he was humble and slow to wrath but he has never succeeded in convincing his readers  with l 382 pope turns to the defense of his family which as we have seen his enemies had abused as base and obscure he draws a noble picture of his dead father by nature honest by experience wise simple modest and temperate and passes to the description of himself watching over the last years of his old mother his sole care to    explore the thought explain the asking eye   and keep a while one parent from the sky  if the length of days which heaven has promised those who honor father and mother fall to his lot may heaven preserve him such a friend as arbuthnot to bless those days and arbuthnot closes the dialogue with a word which is meant i think to sum up the whole discussion and to pronounce the verdict that popes life had been good and honorable    whether that blessing 1 be denyd or givn   thus far was right the rest belongs to heavn  it seems hardly necessary to point out the merits of so patent a masterpiece as the epistle to arbuthnot in order to enjoy it to the full indeed one must know something of the life of the author of the circumstances under which it was written and in general of the social and political life of the time but even without this special knowledge no reader can fail to appreciate the marvelous ease fluency and poignancy of this admirable satire there is nothing like it in our language except popes other satires and of all his satires it is by common consent easily the first it surpasses the satiric poetry of dryden in pungency and depth of feeling as easily as it does that of byron in polish and artistic restraint its range of tone is remarkable at times it reads like glorified conversation as in the opening lines at times it flames and quivers with emotion as in the assault on hervey or in the defense of his parents even in the limited field of satiric portraiture there is a wide difference between the manner in which pope has drawn the portrait of atticus and that of sporus the latter is a masterpiece of pure invective no allowances are made no lights relieve the darkness of the shadows the portrait is frankly inhuman it is the product of an unrestrained outburst of bitter passion the portrait of atticus on the other hand was as we know the work of years it is the product not of an outburst of fury but of a slowly growing and intense dislike which while recognizing the merits of its object fastened with peculiar power upon his faults and weaknesses the studious restraint which controls the satirists hand makes it only the more effective we know well enough that the portrait is not a fair one but we are forced to remind ourselves of this at every step to avoid the spell which popes apparent impartiality casts over our judgments the whole passage reads not so much like the heated plea of an advocate as the measured summingup of a judge and the last couplet falls on our ears with the inevitability of a final sentence but the peculiar merit of the epistle to arbuthnot consists neither in the ease and polish of its style nor in the vigor and effectiveness of its satire but in the insight it gives us into the heart and mind of the poet himself it presents an ideal picture of pope the man and the author of his life his friendships his love of his parents his literary relationships and aims and it is quite futile to object as some critics have done that this picture is not exactly in accordance with the known facts of popes life no great man can be tried and judged on the mere record of his acts we must know the circumstances that shaped these and the motives that inspired them a mans ideals if genuinely held and honestly followed are perhaps even more valuable contributions to our final estimate of the man himself than all he did or left undone    all i could never be   all men ignored in me   this i was worth to god whose wheel the pitcher shaped  and in the epistle to arbuthnot we recognize in pope ideals of independence of devotion to his art of simple living of loyal friendship and of filial piety which shine in splendid contrast with the gross servile and cynically immoral tone of the age and society in which he lived    footnote 1 i e the blessing of arbuthnots future companionship for which pope l 413 had just prayed      advertisement  dr john arbuthnot one of popes most

giving his clients good words and good dinners pope tells an amusing story of montagues comments on his translation of the iliad spence anecdotes p 134 but halifax subscribed for ten copies of the

hundred pounds for a monument and pope not unreasonably suggests that some of this bounty might have been bestowed on dryden in his lifetime   249  when a politician wants a writer to put in a days work in defending him walpole for example who cared nothing for poetry spent large sums in retaining writers to defend him in the journals and pamphlets of the day   254  john gay the author of some

at once identified by a scandalloving public with the timon of the poem in the description pope speaks of the silver bell which calls worshipers to timons chapel and of the soft dean preaching there

celebrated in popes elegy to the memory of an unfortunate lady   374375  there is an allusion here that has never been fully explained possibly the passage refers to teresa blount whom pope suspected of having circulated slanderous reports concerning his relations with her sister   376377  suffered budgell to attribute to his popes pen the slanderous gossip of the grub street journala paper to

draft of these appeared in a letter to aaron hill september 3 1731 where pope speaks of having sent them the other day to a particular friend perhaps the poet thomson mrs pope who was very old and feeble was of course alive when they were first written but died more than a year before the passage appeared in its revised form in this epistle   412  an allusion to the promise contained in the fifth commandment   415 served a queen  arbuthnot had been queen annes doctor but was driven out of his rooms in the palace after her death   416 that blessing  long life for arbuthnot it was in fact

the early age of twelve it first appeared in a letter to his friend henry cromwell dated july 17 1709 there are several variations between this first form and that in which it was finally published and it is probable that pope thought enough of his boyish production to subject it to repeated revision its spirit is characteristic of a side of popes nature that is often forgotten he was indeed the poet of the society of his day urban cultured and pleasureloving but to the end of his days he retained a love for the quiet charm of country life which he had come to feel in his boyhood at binfield and for which he early withdrew from the whirl and dissipations of london to the groves and the grotto of his villa at twickenham                                            notes on   the descent of dullness  in the fourth book of the dunciad pope abandons the satire on the pretenders to literary fame which had run through the earlier books and flies at higher game he represents the goddess dullness as coming in her majesty to destroy order and science and to substitute the kingdom of the dull upon earth he attacks the pedantry and formalism of university education in his day the dissipation and false taste of the traveled gentry the foolish pretensions to learning of collectors and virtuosi and the daringly irreverent speculations of freethinkers and infidels at the close of the book he represents the goddess as dismissing her worshipers with a speech which she concludes with a yawn of extraordinary virtue under its influence all nature nods and pulpits colleges and parliament succumb the poem closes with the magnificent description of the descent of dullness and her final conquest of art philosophy and religion it is said that pope himself admired these lines so much that he could not repeat them without his voice faltering with emotion and well it might sir said dr johnson when this anecdote was repeated to him for they are noble lines and thackeray in his lecture on pope in the english humorists says    in these astonishing lines pope reaches i think to the very   greatest height which his sublime art has attained and shows himself   the equal of all poets of all times it is the brightest ardor the   loftiest assertion of truth the most generous wisdom illustrated by   the noblest poetic figure and spoken in words the aptest grandest   and most harmonious                                               epitaph on gay  john gay the idlest bestnatured and bestloved man of letters of his day was the special friend of pope his early work the shepherds week was planned as a parody on the pastorals of popes rival ambrose philips and pope assisted him in the composition of his luckless farce three hours after marriage when gays opera polly was forbidden by the licenser and gays patrons the duke and duchess of queensberry were driven from court for soliciting subscriptions for him pope warmly espoused his cause gay died in 1732 and was buried in westminster abbey popes epitaph for his tomb was first published in the quarto edition of popes works in 1735johnson in his discussion of popes epitaphs lives of the poets devotes a couple of pages of somewhat captious criticism to these lines but they have at least the virtue of simplicity and sincerity and are at once an admirable portrait of the man and a lasting tribute to the poet

lofty mind   all that i dread is leaving you behind                       145   rather than so ah let me still survive   and still burn on in cupids flames alive    restore the lock she cries and all around   restore the lock the vaulted roofs rebound   not fierce othello in so loud a strain                        150   roared for the handkerchief that caused his pain   but see how oft ambitious aims are crossed   and chiefs contend till all the prize is lost   the lock obtained with guilt and kept with pain   in evry place is sought but sought in vain                 155   with such a prize no mortal must be blessed   so heavn decrees with heavn who can contest   some thought it mounted to the lunar sphere   since all that man eer lost is treasured there   there heroes wits are kept in pondrous vases               160   and beaux in snuffboxes and tweezercases   there broken vows and deathbed alms are found   and lovers hearts with ends of ribbon bound   the courtiers promises and sick mans prayrs   the smiles of harlots and the tears of heirs                165   cages for gnats and chains to yoke a flea   dried butterflies and tomes of casuistry    but trust the museshe saw
