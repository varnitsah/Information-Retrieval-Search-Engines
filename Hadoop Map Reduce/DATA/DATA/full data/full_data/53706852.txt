garden gay the roman came he bore the sway he bullied bought and sold your fountain sweeps his works away beside your manor old  but still his crumbling urns are found within the windowbay where once he listened to the sound that lulls you day by day  the sound of summer winds at play the noise of waters cold to yarty wandering on their way beside your manor old  the roman fell  his firmset bound became the saxons stay the bells made music all around for monks in cloisters grey till fled the monks in disarray from their warm chantrys fold old abbots slumber as they may beside your manor old  envoy  creeds empires peoples all decay down into darkness rolled may life thats fleet be sweet i pray beside your manor old    a dream in june    in twilight of the longest day i lingered over lucian till ere the dawn a dreamy way my spirit found untrod of man between the green sky and the grey  amid the soft dusk suddenly more light than air i seemed to sail afloat upon the ocean sky while through the faint blue clear and pale i saw the mountain clouds go by my barque had thought for helm and sail and one mist wreath for canopy  like torches on a marble floor reflected so the wild stars shone within the abysmal hyaline till the day widened more and more and sank to sunset and was gone and then as burning beacons shine on summits of a mountain isle a light to folk on sea that fare so the skys beacons for a while burned in these islands of the air  then from a starry island set where one swift tide of wind there flows came scent of lily and violet narcissus hyacinth and rose laurel and myrtle buds and vine so delicate is the air and fine and forests of all fragrant trees sloped seaward from the central hill and ever clamorous were these  with singing of glad birds and still such music came as in the woods most lonely consecrate to pan the wind makes in his many moods upon the pipes some shepherd man hangs up in thanks for victory on these shall mortals play no more but the wind doth touch them over and oer and the winds breath in the reeds will sigh  between the daylight and the dark that island lies in silver air and suddenly my magic barque wheeled and ran in and grounded there and by me stood the sentinel of them who in the island dwell all smiling did he bind my hands with rushes green and rosy bands they have no harsher bonds than these the people of the pleasant lands within the wash of the airy seas  then was i to their city led now all of ivory and gold the great walls were that garlanded the temples in their shining fold each fane of beryl built and each girt with its grove of shadowy beech and all about the town and through there flowed a river fed with dew as sweet as roses and as clear as mountain crystals pure and cold and with his waves that water kissed the gleaming altars of amethyst that smoke with victims all the year and sacred are to the gods of old  there sat three judges by the gate and i was led before the three and they but looked on me and straight the rosy bonds fell down from me who being innocent was free and i might wander at my will about that city on the hill among the happy people clad in purple weeds of woven air hued like the webs that twilight weaves at shut of languid summer eves so light their raiment seemed and glad was every face i looked on there  there was no heavy heat no cold the dwellers there wax never old nor wither with the waning time but each man keeps that age he had when first he won the fairy clime the night falls never from on high nor ever burns the heat of noon but such soft light eternally shines as in silver dawns of june before the sun hath climbed the sky  within these pleasant streets and wide the souls of heroes go and come even they that fell on either side beneath the walls of ilium and sunlike in that shadowy isle the face of helen and her smile makes glad the souls of them that knew grief for her sake a little while and all true greeks and wise are there and with his hand upon the hair of phaedo saw i socrates about him many youths and fair hylas narcissus and with these him whom the quoit of phoebus slew by fleet eurotas unaware  all these their mirth and pleasure made within the plain elysian the fairest meadow that may be with all green fragrant trees for shade and every scented wind to fan and sweetest flowers to strew the lea the soft winds are their servants fleet to fetch them every fruit at will and water from the river chill and every bird that singeth sweet throstle and merle and nightingale brings blossoms from the dewy vale  lily and rose and asphodel  with these doth each guest twine his crown and wreathe his cup and lay him down beside some friend he loveth well  there with the shining souls i lay when lo a voice that seemed to say in faroff haunts of memory whoso death taste the dead mens bread shall dwell for ever with these dead nor ever shall his body lie beside his friends on the grey hill where rains weep and the curlews shrill and the brown water wanders by  then did a new soul in me wake the dead mens bread i feared to break their fruit i would not taste indeed were it but a pomegranate seed nay not with these i made my choice to dwell for ever and rejoice for otherwhere the river rolls that girds the home of christian souls and these my whole heart seeks are found on otherwise enchanted ground  even so i put the cup away the vision wavered dimmed and broke and nowise sorrowing i woke while grey among the ruins grey chill through the dwellings of the dead the dawn crept oer the northern sea then in a moment flushed to red flushed all the broken minster old and turned the shattered stones to gold and wakened half the world with me    lenvoito e w g    who also had rhymed on the fortune islands of lucian  each in the selfsame field we glean the field of the samosatene each something takes and something leaves and this must choose and that forego in lucians visionary sheaves to twine a modern

syrian pantagruelist the sage who laughed the world away who mocked at gods and men and care more sweet of voice than rabelais and lighterhearted than voltaire    a vision in the strand    the jaded light of late july shone yellow down the dusty strand the anxious people bustled by policeman pressman you and i and thieves and judges of the land  so swift they strode they had not time to mark the humours of the town but i that mused an idle rhyme looked here and there and up and down and many a rapid cart i spied that drew as fast as ponies can the newspapers of either side these joys of every englishman  the standard here the echo there and cultured evning papers fair with din and fuss and shout and blare through all the eager land they bare the rumours of our little span  midst these but ah more slow of speed a biggish box of sanguine hue was tugged on a velocipede and in and out the crowd and through an earnest stripling urged it well perched on a cranky tricycle  a seedy tricycle he rode perchance some three miles in the hour but on the big red box that glowed behind him was a name of power justice i read it eer i wist the organ of the socialist  the paper carts fled fleetly by and vanished up the roaring strand and eager purchasers drew nigh each with his penny in his hand but justice scarce more fleet than i began to permeate the land and dark methinks the twilight fell or

beef and beer and all things matched to his desire while all the middle classes should with every vile capitalist be clean reformed away for good and vanish like a morning mist  ah splendid vision golden time an end of hunger cold and crime an end of rent an end of rank an end of balance at the bank an end of everything thats meant to bring investors five per cent  how fair doth justice seem i cried yet oh how strong the embattled powers that war against on every side justice and this great dream of ours and what have we to plead our cause gainst masters capital and laws what but a big red box indeed with copies of a weekly screed thats slowly jolted up and down behind an old velocipede to clamour justice through the town how touchingly inadequate these arms wherewith wed vanquish fate  nay the old order shall endure and little change the years shall know and still the many shall be poor and still the poor shall dwell in woe firm in the iron law of things the strong shall be the wealthy still and called capitalists or kings shall seize and hoard the fruits of skill leaving the weaker for their gain leaving the gentler for their prize such dens and husks as beasts disdain  till slowly from the wrinkled skies the fireless frozen sun shall wane nor summer come with golden grain till men be glad mid frost and snow to live such equal lives of pain as now the hutted eskimo

dying gods we have held carouse and our lips are wan from their wild caresses our hands are filled with their holy boughs  as we crossed the lawn in the dying day no fairy led us to meet the may but the very goddess loved by lovers in mourning raiment of green and grey  she was not decked as for glee and game she was not veiled with the veil of flame the saffron veil of the bride that covers the face that is flushed with her joy and shame  on the laden branches the scent and dew mingled and met and as snow to strew the woodland rides and the fragrant grasses white flowers fell as the night

older by far than your ancestors are and made love and made war ere the making of man for when all things were dark not a glimmer nor spark and the world like a barque without rudder or sail floated on through the night twas a bird struck a light twas a flash from the bright featherd tonatius 3 tail then the hawk 4 with some dry wood flew up in the sky and afar safe and high the hawk lit sun and moon and the birds of the air they rejoiced everywhere and they recked not of care that should come on them soon for the hawk so they tell was then known as pundjel 5 and a musing he fell at the close of the day then he went on the quest as we thought of a nest with some bark of the best and a clawful of clay 6 and with these did he frame two birds lacking a name without feathers his game was a puzzle to all next around them he fluttered adancing and muttered and lastly he uttered a magical call then the figures of clay as they featherless lay they leaped up who but they and embracing they fell and this was the baking of man and his making but now hes forsaking his father pundjel now these creatures of mire they kept whining for fire and to crown their desire who was found but the wren to the high heaven he came from the sun stole he flame and for this has a name in the memory of men 7 and in india who for the soma juice flew and to men brought it through without falter or fail why
