14408900	just so stories  by rudyard kipling     table of contents       how the whale got his throat      how the camel got his hump      how the rhinoceros got his skin      how the leopard got his spots      the elephants child      the singsong of old man kangaroo      the beginning of the armadillos      how the first letter was written      how the alphabet was made      the crab that played with the sea      the cat that walked by himself      the butterfly that stamped     how the whale got his throat  in the sea once upon a time o my best beloved there was a whale and he ate fishes he ate the starfish and the garfish and the crab and the dab and the plaice and the dace and the skate and his mate and the mackereel and the pickereel and the really truly twirlywhirly eel all the fishes he could find in all the sea he ate with his mouthso till at last there was only one small fish left in all the sea and he was a small stute fish and he swam a little behind the whales right ear so as to be out of harms way then the whale stood up on his tail and said im hungry and the small stute fish said in a small stute voice noble and generous cetacean have you ever tasted man  no said the whale what is it like  nice said the small stute fish nice but nubbly  then fetch me some said the whale and he made the sea froth up with his tail  one at a time is enough said the stute fish if you swim to latitude fifty north longitude forty west that is magic you will find sitting on a raft in the middle of the sea with nothing on but a pair of blue canvas breeches a pair of suspenders you must not forget the suspenders best beloved and a jackknife one shipwrecked mariner who it is only fair to tell you is a man of infiniteresourceandsagacity  so the whale swam and swam to latitude fifty north longitude forty west as fast as he could swim and on a raft in the middle of the sea with nothing to wear except a pair of blue canvas breeches a pair of suspenders you must particularly remember the suspenders best beloved and a jackknife he found one single solitary shipwrecked mariner trailing his toes in the water he had his mummys leave to paddle or else he would never have done it because he was a man of infiniteresourceandsagacity  then the whale opened his mouth back and back and back till it nearly touched his tail and he swallowed the shipwrecked mariner and the raft he was sitting on and his blue canvas breeches and the suspenders which you must not forget and the jackknifehe swallowed them all down into his warm dark inside cupboards and then he smacked his lipsso and turned round three times on his tail  but as soon as the mariner who was a man of infiniteresourceandsagacity found himself truly inside the whales warm dark inside cupboards he stumped and he jumped and he thumped and he bumped and he pranced and he danced and he banged and he clanged and he hit and he bit and he leaped and he creeped and he prowled and he howled and he hopped and he dropped and he cried and he sighed and he crawled and he bawled and he stepped and he lepped and he danced hornpipes where he shouldnt and the whale felt most unhappy indeed have you forgotten the suspenders  so he said to the stute fish this man is very nubbly and besides he is making me hiccough what shall i do  tell him to come out said the stute fish  so the whale called down his own throat to the shipwrecked mariner come out and behave yourself ive got the hiccoughs  nay nay said the mariner not so but far otherwise take me to my natalshore and the whitecliffsofalbion and ill think about it and he began to dance more than ever   you had better take him home said the stute fish to the whale  i ought to have warned you that he is a man of infiniteresourceandsagacity  so the whale swam and swam and swam with both flippers and his tail as hard as he could for the hiccoughs and at last he saw the mariners natalshore and the whitecliffsofalbion and he rushed halfway up the beach and opened his mouth wide and wide and wide and said change here for winchester ashuelot nashua keene and stations on the fitchburg road and just as he said fitch the mariner walked out of his mouth but while the whale had been swimming the mariner who was indeed a person of infiniteresourceandsagacity had taken his jackknife and cut up the raft into a little square grating all running crisscross and he had tied it firm with his suspenders now you know why you were not to forget the suspenders and he dragged that grating good and tight into the whales throat and there it stuck then he recited the following sloka which as you have not heard it i will now proceed to relate    by means of a grating   i have stopped your ating  for the mariner he was also an hibernian and he stepped out on the shingle and went home to his mother who had given him leave to trail his toes in the water and he married and lived happily ever afterward so did the whale but from that day on the grating in his throat which he could neither cough up nor swallow down prevented him eating anything except very very small fish and that is the reason why whales nowadays never eat men or boys or little girls  the small stute fish went and hid himself in the mud under the doorsills of the equator he was afraid that the whale might be angry with him  the sailor took the jackknife home he was wearing the blue canvas breeches when he walked out on the shingle the suspenders were left behind you see to tie the grating with and that is the end of that tale        when the cabin portholes are dark and green        because of the seas outside      when the ship goes wop with a wiggle between      and the steward falls into the souptureen        and the trunks begin to slide      when nursey lies on the floor in a heap      and mummy tells you to let her sleep      and you arent waked or washed or dressed      why then you will know if you havent guessed      youre fifty north and forty west     how the camel got his hump  now this is the next tale and it tells how the camel got his big hump  in the beginning of years when the world was so new and all and the animals were just beginning to work for man there was a camel and he lived in the middle of a howling desert because he did not want to work and besides he was a howler himself so he ate sticks and thorns and tamarisks and milkweed and prickles most scruciating idle and when anybody spoke to him he said humph just humph and no more  presently the horse came to him on monday morning with a saddle on his back and a bit in his mouth and said camel o camel come out and trot like the rest of us  humph said the camel and the horse went away and told the man  presently the dog came to him with a stick in his mouth and said camel o camel come and fetch and carry like the rest of us  humph said the camel and the dog went away and told the man  presently the ox came to him with the yoke on his neck and said camel o camel come and plough like the rest of us  humph said the camel and the ox went away and told the man  at the end of the day the man called the horse and the dog and the ox together and said three o three im very sorry for you with the world so newandall but that humphthing in the desert cant work or he would have been here by now so i am going to leave him alone and you must work doubletime to make up for it  that made the three very angry with the world so newandall and they held a palaver and an indaba and a punchayet and a powwow on the edge of the desert and the camel came chewing on milkweed most scruciating idle and laughed at them then he said humph and went away again  presently there came along the djinn in charge of all deserts rolling in a cloud of dust djinns always travel that way because it is magic and he stopped to palaver and powpow with the three  djinn of all deserts said the horse is it right for any one to be idle with the world so newandall  certainly not said the djinn  well said the horse theres a thing in the middle of your howling desert and hes a howler himself with a long neck and long legs and he hasnt done a stroke of work since monday morning he wont trot  whew said the djinn whistling thats my camel for all the gold in arabia what does he say about it  he says humph said the dog and he wont fetch and carry  does he say anything else  only humph and he wont plough said the ox  very good said the djinn ill humph him if you will kindly wait a minute  the djinn rolled himself up in his dustcloak and took a bearing across the desert and found the camel most scruciatingly idle looking at his own reflection in a pool of water  my long and bubbling friend said the djinn whats this i hear of your doing no work with the world so newandall  humph said the camel  the djinn sat down with his chin in his hand and began to think a great magic while the camel looked at his own reflection in the pool of water  youve given the three extra work ever since monday morning all on account of your scruciating idleness said the djinn and he went on thinking magics with his chin in his hand  humph said the camel  i shouldnt say that again if i were you said the djinn you might say it once too often bubbles i want you to work  and the camel said humph again but no sooner had he said it than he saw his back that he was so proud of puffing up and puffing up into a great big lolloping humph  do you see that said the djinn thats your very own humph that youve brought upon your very own self by not working today is thursday and youve done no work since monday when the work began now you are going to work  how can i said the camel with this humph on my back  thats made apurpose said the djinn all because you missed those three days you will be able to work now for three days without eating because you can live on your humph and dont you ever say i never did anything for you come out of the desert and go to the three and behave humph yourself  and the camel humphed himself humph and all and went away to join the three and from that day to this the camel always wears a humph we call it hump now not to hurt his feelings but he has never yet caught up with the three days that he missed at the beginning of the world and he has never yet learned how to behave        the camels hump is an ugly lump        which well you may see at the zoo      but uglier yet is the hump we get        from having too little to do       kiddies and grownups toooooo      if we havent enough to dooooo          we get the hump          cameelious hump      the hump that is black and blue       we climb out of bed with a frouzly head        and a snarlyyarly voice      we shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl        at our bath and our boots and our toys       and there ought to be a corner for me      and i know there is one for you          when we get the hump          cameelious hump      the hump that is black and blue       the cure for this ill is not to sit still        or frowst with a book by the fire      but to take a large hoe and a shovel also        and dig till you gently perspire       and then you will find that the sun and the wind      and the djinn of the garden too          have lifted the hump          the horrible hump      the hump that is black and blue       i get it as well as youoooo      if i havent enough to dooooo          we all get hump          cameelious hump      kiddies and grownups too     how the rhinoceros got his skin  once upon a time on an uninhabited island on the shores of the red sea there lived a parsee from whose hat the rays of the sun were reflected in morethanoriental splendour and the parsee lived by the red sea with nothing but his hat and his knife and a cookingstove of the kind that you must particularly never touch and one day he took flour and water and currants and plums and sugar and things and made himself one cake which was two feet across and three feet thick it was indeed a superior comestible thats magic and he put it on stove because he was allowed to cook on the stove and he baked it and he baked it till it was all done brown and smelt most sentimental but just as he was going to eat it there came down to the beach from the altogether uninhabited interior one rhinoceros with a horn on his nose two piggy eyes and few manners in those days the rhinoceross skin fitted him quite tight there were no wrinkles in it anywhere he looked exactly like a noahs ark rhinoceros but of course much bigger all the same he had no manners then and he has no manners now and he never will have any manners he said how and the parsee left that cake and climbed to the top of a palm tree with nothing on but his hat from which the rays of the sun were always reflected in morethanoriental splendour and the rhinoceros upset the oilstove with his nose and the cake rolled on the sand and he spiked that cake on the horn of his nose and he ate it and he went away waving his tail to the desolate and exclusively uninhabited interior which abuts on the islands of mazanderan socotra and promontories of the larger equinox then the parsee came down from his palmtree and put the stove on its legs and recited the following sloka which as you have not heard i will now proceed to relate    them that takes cakes   which the parseeman bakes   makes dreadful mistakes  and there was a great deal more in that than you would think  because five weeks later there was a heat wave in the red sea and everybody took off all the clothes they had the parsee took off his hat but the rhinoceros took off his skin and carried it over his shoulder as he came down to the beach to bathe in those days it buttoned underneath with three buttons and looked like a waterproof he said nothing whatever about the parsees cake because he had eaten it all and he never had any manners then since or henceforward he waddled straight into the water and blew bubbles through his nose leaving his skin on the beach  presently the parsee came by and found the skin and he smiled one smile that ran all round his face two times then he danced three times round the skin and rubbed his hands then he went to his camp and filled his hat with cakecrumbs for the parsee never ate anything but cake and never swept out his camp he took that skin and he shook that skin and he scrubbed that skin and he rubbed that skin just as full of old dry stale tickly cakecrumbs and some burned currants as ever it could possibly hold then he climbed to the top of his palmtree and waited for the rhinoceros to come out of the water and put it on  and the rhinoceros did he buttoned it up with the three buttons and it tickled like cake crumbs in bed then he wanted to scratch but that made it worse and then he lay down on the sands and rolled and rolled and rolled and every time he rolled the cake crumbs tickled him worse and worse and worse then he ran to the palmtree and rubbed and rubbed and rubbed himself against it he rubbed so much and so hard that he rubbed his skin into a great fold over his shoulders and another fold underneath where the buttons used to be but he rubbed the buttons off and he rubbed some more folds over his legs and it spoiled his temper but it didnt make the least difference to the cakecrumbs they were inside his skin and they tickled so he went home very angry indeed and horribly scratchy and from that day to this every rhinoceros has great folds in his skin and a very bad temper all on account of the cakecrumbs inside  but the parsee came down from his palmtree wearing his hat from which the rays of the sun were reflected in morethanoriental splendour packed up his cookingstove and went away in the direction of orotavo amygdala the upland meadows of anantarivo and the marshes of sonaput        this uninhabited island        is off cape gardafui      by the beaches of socotra        and the pink arabian sea      but its hottoo hot from suez        for the likes of you and me          ever to go          in a p and o      and call on the cakeparsee     how the leopard got his spots  in the days when everybody started fair best beloved the leopard lived in a place called the high veldt member it wasnt the low veldt or the bush veldt or the sour veldt but the sclusively bare hot shiny high veldt where there was sand and sandycoloured rock and sclusively tufts of sandyyellowish grass the giraffe and the zebra and the eland and the koodoo and the hartebeest lived there and they were sclusively sandyyellowbrownish all over but the leopard he was the sclusivest sandiestyellowishbrownest of them alla greyishyellowish cattyshaped kind of beast and he matched the sclusively yellowishgreyishbrownish colour of the high veldt to one hair this was very bad for the giraffe and the zebra and the rest of them for he would lie down by a sclusively yellowishgreyishbrownish stone or clump of grass and when the giraffe or the zebra or the eland or the koodoo or the bushbuck or the bontebuck came by he would surprise them out of their jumpsome lives he would indeed and also there was an ethiopian with bows and arrows a sclusively greyishbrownishyellowish man he was then who lived on the high veldt with the leopard and the two used to hunt togetherthe ethiopian with his bows and arrows and the leopard sclusively with his teeth and clawstill the giraffe and the eland and the koodoo and the quagga and all the rest of them didnt know which way to jump best beloved they didnt indeed  after a long timethings lived for ever so long in those daysthey learned to avoid anything that looked like a leopard or an ethiopian and bit by bitthe giraffe began it because his legs were the longestthey went away from the high veldt they scuttled for days and days and days till they came to a great forest sclusively full of trees and bushes and stripy speckly patchyblatchy shadows and there they hid and after another long time what with standing half in the shade and half out of it and what with the slipperyslidy shadows of the trees falling on them the giraffe grew blotchy and the zebra grew stripy and the eland and the koodoo grew darker with little wavy grey lines on their backs like bark on a tree trunk and so though you could hear them and smell them you could very seldom see them and then only when you knew precisely where to look they had a beautiful time in the sclusively specklyspickly shadows of the forest while the leopard and the ethiopian ran about over the sclusively greyishyellowishreddish high veldt outside wondering where all their breakfasts and their dinners and their teas had gone at last they were so hungry that they ate rats and beetles and rockrabbits the leopard and the ethiopian and then they had the big tummyache both together and then they met baviaanthe dogheaded barking baboon who is quite the wisest animal in all south africa  said leopard to baviaan and it was a very hot day where has all the game gone  and baviaan winked he knew  said the ethiopian to baviaan can you tell me the present habitat of the aboriginal fauna that meant just the same thing but the ethiopian always used long words he was a grownup  and baviaan winked he knew  then said baviaan the game has gone into other spots and my advice to you leopard is to go into other spots as soon as you can  and the ethiopian said that is all very fine but i wish to know whither the aboriginal fauna has migrated  then said baviaan the aboriginal fauna has joined the aboriginal flora because it was high time for a change and my advice to you ethiopian is to change as soon as you can  that puzzled the leopard and the ethiopian but they set off to look for the aboriginal flora and presently after ever so many days they saw a great high tall forest full of tree trunks all sclusively speckled and sprottled and spottled dotted and splashed and slashed and hatched and crosshatched with shadows say that quickly aloud and you will see how very shadowy the forest must have been  what is this said the leopard that is so sclusively dark and yet so full of little pieces of light  i dont know said the ethiopian but it ought to be the aboriginal flora i can smell giraffe and i can hear giraffe but i cant see giraffe  thats curious said the leopard i suppose it is because we have just come in out of the sunshine i can smell zebra and i can hear zebra but i cant see zebra  wait a bit said the ethiopian its a long time since weve hunted em perhaps weve forgotten what they were like  fiddle said the leopard i remember them perfectly on the high veldt especially their marrowbones giraffe is about seventeen feet high of a sclusively fulvous goldenyellow from head to heel and zebra is about four and a half feet high of asclusively greyfawn colour from head to heel  umm said the ethiopian looking into the specklyspickly shadows of the aboriginal floraforest then they ought to show up in this dark place like ripe bananas in a smokehouse  but they didnt the leopard and the ethiopian hunted all day and though they could smell them and hear them they never saw one of them  for goodness sake said the leopard at teatime let us wait till it gets dark this daylight hunting is a perfect scandal  so they waited till dark and then the leopard heard something breathing sniffily in the starlight that fell all stripy through the branches and he jumped at the noise and it smelt like zebra and it felt like zebra and when he knocked it down it kicked like zebra but he couldnt see it so he said be quiet o you person without any form i am going to sit on your head till morning because there is something about you that i dont understand  presently he heard a grunt and a crash and a scramble and the ethiopian called out ive caught a thing that i cant see it smells like giraffe and it kicks like giraffe but it hasnt any form  dont you trust it said the leopard sit on its head till the morningsame as me they havent any formany of em  so they sat down on them hard till bright morningtime and then leopard said what have you at your end of the table brother  the ethiopian scratched his head and said it ought to be sclusively a rich fulvous orangetawny from head to heel and it ought to be giraffe but it is covered all over with chestnut blotches what have you at your end of the table brother  and the leopard scratched his head and said it ought to be sclusively a delicate greyishfawn and it ought to be zebra but it is covered all over with black and purple stripes what in the world have you been doing to yourself zebra dont you know that if you were on the high veldt i could see you ten miles off you havent any form  yes said the zebra but this isnt the high veldt cant you see  i can now said the leopard but i couldnt all yesterday how is it done  let us up said the zebra and we will show you  they let the zebra and the giraffe get up and zebra moved away to some little thornbushes where the sunlight fell all stripy and giraffe moved off to some tallish trees where the shadows fell all blotchy  now watch said the zebra and the giraffe this is the way its done onetwothree and wheres your breakfast  leopard stared and ethiopian stared but all they could see were stripy shadows and blotched shadows in the forest but never a sign of zebra and giraffe they had just walked off and hidden themselves in the shadowy forest  hi hi said the ethiopian thats a trick worth learning take a lesson by it leopard you show up in this dark place like a bar of soap in a coalscuttle  ho ho said the leopard would it surprise you very much to know that you show up in this dark place like a mustardplaster on a sack of coals  well calling names wont catch dinner said the ethiopian the long and the little of it is that we dont match our backgrounds im going to take baviaans advice he told me i ought to change and as ive nothing to change except my skin im going to change that  what to said the leopard tremendously excited  to a nice working blackishbrownish colour with a little purple in it and touches of slatyblue it will be the very thing for hiding in hollows and behind trees  so he changed his skin then and there and the leopard was more excited than ever he had never seen a man change his skin before  but what about me he said when the ethiopian had worked his last little finger into his fine new black skin  you take baviaans advice too he told you to go into spots  so i did said the leopard i went into other spots as fast as i could i went into this spot with you and a lot of good it has done me  oh said the ethiopian baviaan didnt mean spots in south africa he meant spots on your skin  whats the use of that said the leopard  think of giraffe said the ethiopian or if you prefer stripes think of zebra they find their spots and stripes give them perfeet satisfaction  umm said the leopard i wouldnt look like zebranot for ever so  well make up your mind said the ethiopian because id hate to go hunting without you but i must if you insist on looking like a sunflower against a tarred fence  ill take spots then said the leopard but dont make em too vulgarbig i wouldnt look like giraffenot for ever so  ill make em with the tips of my fingers said the ethiopian theres plenty of black left on my skin still stand over  then the ethiopian put his five fingers close together there was plenty of black left on his new skin still and pressed them all over the leopard and wherever the five fingers touched they left five little black marks all close together you can see them on any leopards skin you like best beloved sometimes the fingers slipped and the marks got a little blurred but if you look closely at any leopard now you will see that there are always five spotsoff five fat black fingertips  now you are a beauty said the ethiopian you can lie out on the bare ground and look like a heap of pebbles you can lie out on the naked rocks and look like a piece of puddingstone you can lie out on a leafy branch and look like sunshine sifting through the leaves and you can lie right across the centre of a path and look like nothing in particular think of that and purr  but if im all this said the leopard why didnt you go spotty too  oh plain blacks best for a nigger said the ethiopian now come along and well see if we cant get even with mr onetwothree wheres your breakfast  so they went away and lived happily ever afterward best beloved that is all  oh now and then you will hear grownups say can the ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots i dont think even grownups would keep on saying such a silly thing if the leopard and the ethiopian hadnt done it oncedo you but they will never do it again best beloved they are quite contented as they are      i am the most wise baviaan saying in most wise tones    let us melt into the landscapejust us two by our lones    people have comein a carriagecalling but mummy is there    yes i can go if you take menurse says she dont care    lets go up to the pigsties and sit on the farmyard rails    lets say things to the bunnies and watch em skitter their tails    letsoh anything daddy so long as its you and me    and going truly exploring and not being in till tea    heres your boots ive brought em and heres your cap and stick    and heres your pipe and tobacco oh come along out of itquick     the elephants child  in the high and faroff times the elephant o best beloved had no trunk he had only a blackish bulgy nose as big as a boot that he could wriggle about from side to side but he couldnt pick up things with it but there was one elephanta new elephantan elephants childwho was full of satiable curtiosity and that means he asked ever so many questions and he lived in africa and he filled all africa with his satiable curtiosities he asked his tall aunt the ostrich why her tailfeathers grew just so and his tall aunt the ostrich spanked him with her hard hard claw he asked his tall uncle the giraffe what made his skin spotty and his tall uncle the giraffe spanked him with his hard hard hoof and still he was full of satiable curtiosity he asked his broad aunt the hippopotamus why her eyes were red and his broad aunt the hippopotamus spanked him with her broad broad hoof and he asked his hairy uncle the baboon why melons tasted just so and his hairy uncle the baboon spanked him with his hairy hairy paw and still he was full of satiable curtiosity he asked questions about everything that he saw or heard or felt or smelt or touched and all his uncles and his aunts spanked him and still he was full of satiable curtiosity  one fine morning in the middle of the precession of the equinoxes this satiable elephants child asked a new fine question that he had never asked before he asked what does the crocodile have for dinner then everybody said hush in a loud and dretful tone and they spanked him immediately and directly without stopping for a long time  by and by when that was finished he came upon kolokolo bird sitting in the middle of a waitabit thornbush and he said my father has spanked me and my mother has spanked me all my aunts and uncles have spanked me for my satiable curtiosity and still i want to know what the crocodile has for dinner  then kolokolo bird said with a mournful cry go to the banks of the great greygreen greasy limpopo river all set about with fevertrees and find out  that very next morning when there was nothing left of the equinoxes because the precession had preceded according to precedent this satiable elephants child took a hundred pounds of bananas the little short red kind and a hundred pounds of sugarcane the long purple kind and seventeen melons the greenycrackly kind and said to all his dear families goodbye i am going to the great greygreen greasy limpopo river all set about with fevertrees to find out what the crocodile has for dinner and they all spanked him once more for luck though he asked them most politely to stop  then he went away a little warm but not at all astonished eating melons and throwing the rind about because he could not pick it up  he went from grahams town to kimberley and from kimberley to khamas country and from khamas country he went east by north eating melons all the time till at last he came to the banks of the great greygreen greasy limpopo river all set about with fevertrees precisely as kolokolo bird had said  now you must know and understand o best beloved that till that very week and day and hour and minute this satiable elephants child had never seen a crocodile and did not know what one was like it was all his satiable curtiosity  the first thing that he found was a bicolouredpythonrocksnake curled round a rock  scuse me said the elephants child most politely but have you seen such a thing as a crocodile in these promiscuous parts  have i seen a crocodile said the bicolouredpythonrocksnake in a voice of dretful scorn what will you ask me next  scuse me said the elephants child but could you kindly tell me what he has for dinner  then the bicolouredpythonrocksnake uncoiled himself very quickly from the rock and spanked the elephants child with his scalesome flailsome tail  that is odd said the elephants child because my father and my mother and my uncle and my aunt not to mention my other aunt the hippopotamus and my other uncle the baboon have all spanked me for my satiable curtiosityand i suppose this is the same thing  so he said goodbye very politely to the bicolouredpythonrocksnake and helped to coil him up on the rock again and went on a little warm but not at all astonished eating melons and throwing the rind about because he could not pick it up till he trod on what he thought was a log of wood at the very edge of the great greygreen greasy limpopo river all set about with fevertrees  but it was really the crocodile o best beloved and the crocodile winked one eyelike this  scuse me said the elephants child most politely but do you happen to have seen a crocodile in these promiscuous parts  then the crocodile winked the other eye and lifted half his tail out of the mud and the elephants child stepped back most politely because he did not wish to be spanked again  come hither little one said the crocodile why do you ask such things  scuse me said the elephants child most politely but my father has spanked me my mother has spanked me not to mention my tall aunt the ostrich and my tall uncle the giraffe who can kick ever so hard as well as my broad aunt the hippopotamus and my hairy uncle the baboon and including the bicolouredpythonrocksnake with the scalesome flailsome tail just up the bank who spanks harder than any of them and so if its quite all the same to you i dont want to be spanked any more  come hither little one said the crocodile for i am the crocodile and he wept crocodiletears to show it was quite true  then the elephants child grew all breathless and panted and kneeled down on the bank and said you are the very person i have been looking for all these long days will you please tell me what you have for dinner  come hither little one said the crocodile and ill whisper  then the elephants child put his head down close to the crocodiles musky tusky mouth and the crocodile caught him by his little nose which up to that very week day hour and minute had been no bigger than a boot though much more useful  i think said the crocodileand he said it between his teeth like thisi think today i will begin with elephants child  at this o best beloved the elephants child was much annoyed and he said speaking through his nose like this led go you are hurtig be  then the bicolouredpythonrocksnake scuffled down from the bank and said my young friend if you do not now immediately and instantly pull as hard as ever you can it is my opinion that your acquaintance in the largepattern leather ulster and by this he meant the crocodile will jerk you into yonder limpid stream before you can say jack robinson  this is the way bicolouredpythonrocksnakes always talk  then the elephants child sat back on his little haunches and pulled and pulled and pulled and his nose began to stretch and the crocodile floundered into the water making it all creamy with great sweeps of his tail and he pulled and pulled and pulled  and the elephants childs nose kept on stretching and the elephants child spread all his little four legs and pulled and pulled and pulled and his nose kept on stretching and the crocodile threshed his tail like an oar and he pulled and pulled and pulled and at each pull the elephants childs nose grew longer and longerand it hurt him hijjus  then the elephants child felt his legs slipping and he said through his nose which was now nearly five feet long this is too butch for be  then the bicolouredpythonrocksnake came down from the bank and knotted himself in a doubleclovehitch round the elephants childs hind legs and said rash and inexperienced traveller we will now seriously devote ourselves to a little high tension because if we do not it is my impression that yonder selfpropelling manofwar with the armourplated upper deck and by this o best beloved he meant the crocodile will permanently vitiate your future career  that is the way all bicolouredpythonrocksnakes always talk  so he pulled and the elephants child pulled and the crocodile pulled but the elephants child and the bicolouredpythonrocksnake pulled hardest and at last the crocodile let go of the elephants childs nose with a plop that you could hear all up and down the limpopo  then the elephants child sat down most hard and sudden but first he was careful to say thank you to the bicolouredpythonrocksnake and next he was kind to his poor pulled nose and wrapped it all up in cool banana leaves and hung it in the great greygreen greasy limpopo to cool  what are you doing that for said the bicolouredpythonrocksnake  scuse me said the elephants child but my nose is badly out of shape and i am waiting for it to shrink  then you will have to wait a long time said the bicolouredpythonrocksnake some people do not know what is good for them  the elephants child sat there for three days waiting for his nose to shrink but it never grew any shorter and besides it made him squint for o best beloved you will see and understand that the crocodile had pulled it out into a really truly trunk same as all elephants have today  at the end of the third day a fly came and stung him on the shoulder and before he knew what he was doing he lifted up his trunk and hit that fly dead with the end of it  vantage number one said the bicolouredpythonrocksnake you couldnt have done that with a meresmear nose try and eat a little now  before he thought what he was doing the elephants child put out his trunk and plucked a large bundle of grass dusted it clean against his forelegs and stuffed it into his own mouth  vantage number two said the bicolouredpythonrocksnake you couldnt have done that with a mearsmear nose dont you think the sun is very hot here  it is said the elephants child and before he thought what he was doing he schlooped up a schloop of mud from the banks of the great greygreen greasy limpopo and slapped it on his head where it made a cool schloopysloshy mudcap all trickly behind his ears  vantage number three said the bicolouredpythonrocksnake you couldnt have done that with a meresmear nose now how do you feel about being spanked again  scuse me said the elephants child but i should not like it at all  how would you like to spank somebody said the bicolouredpythonrocksnake  i should like it very much indeed said the elephants child  well said the bicolouredpythonrocksnake you will find that new nose of yours very useful to spank people with  thank you said the elephants child ill remember that and now i think ill go home to all my dear families and try  so the elephants child went home across africa frisking and whisking his trunk when he wanted fruit to eat he pulled fruit down from a tree instead of waiting for it to fall as he used to do when he wanted grass he plucked grass up from the ground instead of going on his knees as he used to do when the flies bit him he broke off the branch of a tree and used it as flywhisk and he made himself a new cool slushysqushy mudcap whenever the sun was hot when he felt lonely walking through africa he sang to himself down his trunk and the noise was louder than several brass bands  he went especially out of his way to find a broad hippopotamus she was no relation of his and he spanked her very hard to make sure that the bicolouredpythonrocksnake had spoken the truth about his new trunk the rest of the time he picked up the melon rinds that he had dropped on his way to the limpopofor he was a tidy pachyderm  one dark evening he came back to all his dear families and he coiled up his trunk and said how do you do they were very glad to see him and immediately said come here and be spanked for your satiable curtiosity  pooh said the elephants child i dont think you peoples know anything about spanking but i do and ill show you then he uncurled his trunk and knocked two of his dear brothers head over heels  o bananas said they where did you learn that trick and what have you done to your nose  i got a new one from the crocodile on the banks of the great greygreen greasy limpopo river said the elephants child i asked him what he had for dinner and he gave me this to keep  it looks very ugly said his hairy uncle the baboon  it does said the elephants child but its very useful and he picked up his hairy uncle the baboon by one hairy leg and hove him into a hornets nest  then that bad elephants child spanked all his dear families for a long time till they were very warm and greatly astonished he pulled out his tall ostrich aunts tailfeathers and he caught his tall uncle the giraffe by the hindleg and dragged him through a thornbush and he shouted at his broad aunt the hippopotamus and blew bubbles into her ear when she was sleeping in the water after meals but he never let any one touch kolokolo bird  at last things grew so exciting that his dear families went off one by one in a hurry to the banks of the great greygreen greasy limpopo river all set about with fevertrees to borrow new noses from the crocodile when they came back nobody spanked anybody any more and ever since that day o best beloved all the elephants you will ever see besides all those that you wont have trunks precisely like the trunk of the satiable elephants child        i keep six honest servingmen        they taught me all i knew      their names are what and where and when        and how and why and who      i send them over land and sea        i send them east and west      but after they have worked for me        i give them all a rest       i let them rest from nine till five        for i am busy then      as well as breakfast lunch and tea        for they are hungry men      but different folk have different views        i know a person small      she keeps ten million servingmen        who get no rest at all      she sends em abroad on her own affairs        from the second she opens her eyes      one million hows two million wheres        and seven million whys     the singsong of old man kangaroo  not always was the kangaroo as now we do behold him but a

kangaroo nqong said dingo wake up dingo do you see that gentleman dancing on an ashpit he wants to be popular and very truly run after dingo make him so  up jumped dingoyellowdog dingoand said what that catrabbit  off ran dingoyellowdog dingoalways hungry grinning like a coalscuttleran after kangaroo  off went the proud kangaroo on his four little legs like a bunny  this o beloved of mine ends the first part of the tale  he ran through the desert he ran through the mountains he ran through the saltpans he ran through the reedbeds he ran through the blue gums he ran through the spinifex he

his hind legs ached  he had to  still ran dingoyellowdog dingohungrier and hungrier grinning like a horsecollar never getting nearer never getting farther and they came to the wollgong river  now there wasnt any bridge and there wasnt any ferryboat and kangaroo didnt know how to get over so he stood on his legs and hopped  he had to  he hopped through the flinders he hopped through the cinders he hopped through the deserts in the middle of australia he hopped like a kangaroo  first he hopped one yard then he hopped three yards then he hopped five yards his legs growing stronger his legs growing longer he hadnt any time for rest or refreshment and he wanted them very much  still ran dingoyellowdog dingovery much bewildered very much hungry and wondering what in the world or out of it made old man kangaroo hop  for he hopped like a cricket like a pea in a saucepan or a new rubber ball on a nursery floor  he had to  he tucked up his front legs he hopped on his hind legs he stuck out his tail for a balanceweight behind him and he hopped through the darling downs  he had to  still ran dingotireddog dingohungrier and hungrier very much bewildered and wondering when in the world or

i only meant to explain to your lordliness that ive had nothing to eat since morning and im very empty indeed  yes said dingoyellowdog dingoi am just in the same situation ive made him different from all other animals but what may i have for my tea  then said nqong from his bath in the saltpan come and ask me about it tomorrow because im going to wash  so they were left in the middle of australia old man kangaroo and yellowdog dingo and each said thats your fault        this is the mouthfilling song      of the race that was run by a boomer      run in a single burstonly event of its kind      started by big god nqong from warrigaborrigarooma      old man kangaroo first yellowdog dingo behind       kangaroo bounded away      his backlegs working like pistons      bounded from morning till dark      twentyfive feet to a bound      yellowdog dingo lay      like a yellow cloud in the distance      much too busy to bark      my but they covered the ground       nobody knows where they went      or followed the track that they flew in      for that continent      hadnt been given a name      they ran thirty degrees      from torres straits to the leeuwin      look at the atlas please      and they ran back as they came       sposing you could trot      from adelaide to the pacific      for an afternoons run      half what these gentlemen did      you would feel rather hot      but your legs would develop terrific      yes my importunate son      youd be a marvellous kid     the beginning of the armadillos  this o best beloved is another story of the high and faroff times in the very middle of those times was a sticklyprickly hedgehog and he lived on the banks of the turbid amazon eating shelly snails and things and he had a friend a slowsolid tortoise who lived on the banks of the turbid amazon eating green lettuces and things and so that was all right best beloved do you see  but also and at the same time in those high and faroff times there was a painted jaguar and he lived on the banks of the turbid amazon too and he ate everything that he could catch when he could not catch deer or monkeys he would eat frogs and beetles and when he could not catch frogs and beetles he went to his mother jaguar and she told him how to eat hedgehogs and tortoises  she said to him ever so many times graciously waving her tail my son when you find a hedgehog you must drop him into the water and then he will uncoil and when you catch a tortoise you must scoop him out of his shell with your paw and so that was all right best beloved  one beautiful night on the banks of the turbid amazon painted jaguar found sticklyprickly hedgehog and slowsolid tortoise sitting under the trunk of a fallen tree they could not run away and so sticklyprickly curled himself up into a ball because he was a hedgehog and slowsolid tortoise drew in his head and feet into his shell as far as they would go because he was a tortoise and so that was all right best beloved do you see  now attend to me said painted jaguar because this is very important my mother said that when i meet a hedgehog i am to drop him into the water and then he will uncoil and when i meet a tortoise i am to scoop him out of his shell with my paw now which of you is hedgehog and which is tortoise because to save my spots i cant tell  are you sure of what your mummy told you said sticklyprickly hedgehog are you quite sure perhaps she said that when you uncoil a tortoise you must shell him out the water with a scoop and when you paw a hedgehog you must drop him on the shell  are you sure of what your mummy told you said slowandsolid tortoise are you quite sure perhaps she said that when you water a hedgehog you must drop him into your paw and when you meet a tortoise you must shell him till he uncoils  i dont think it was at all like that said painted jaguar but he felt a little puzzled but please say it again more distinctly  when you scoop water with your paw you uncoil it with a hedgehog said sticklyprickly remember that because its important  but said the tortoise when you paw your meat you drop it into a tortoise with a scoop why cant you understand  you are making my spots ache said painted jaguar and besides i didnt want your advice at all i only wanted to know which of you is hedgehog and which is tortoise  i shant tell you said sticklyprickly but you can scoop me out of my shell if you like  aha said painted jaguar now i know youre tortoise you thought i wouldnt now i will painted jaguar darted out his paddypaw just as sticklyprickly curled himself up and of course jaguars paddypaw was just filled with prickles worse than that he knocked sticklyprickly away and away into the woods and the bushes where it was too dark to find him then he put his paddypaw into his mouth and of course the prickles hurt him worse than ever as soon as he could speak he said now i know he isnt tortoise at all butand then he scratched his head with his unprickly pawhow do i know that this other is tortoise  but i am tortoise said slowandsolid your mother was quite right she said that you were to scoop me out of my shell with your paw begin  you didnt say she said that a minute ago said painted jaguar sucking the prickles out of his paddypaw you said she said something quite different  well suppose you say that i said that she said something quite different i dont see that it makes any difference because if she said what you said i said she said its just the same as if i said what she said she said on the other hand if you think she said that you were to uncoil me with a scoop instead of pawing me into drops with a shell i cant help that can i  but you said you wanted to be scooped out of your shell with my paw said painted jaguar  if youll think again youll find that i didnt say anything of the kind i said that your mother said that you were to scoop me out of my shell said slowandsolid  what will happen if i do said the jaguar most sniffily and most cautious  i dont know because ive never been scooped out of my shell before but i tell you truly if you want to see me swim away youve only got to drop me into the water  i dont believe it said painted jaguar youve mixed up all the things my mother told me to do with the things that you asked me whether i was sure that she didnt say till i dont know whether im on my head or my painted tail and now you come and tell me something i can understand and it makes me more mixy than before my mother told me that i was to drop one of you two into the water and as you seem so anxious to be dropped i think you dont want to be dropped so jump into the turbid amazon and be quick about it  i warn you that your mummy wont be pleased dont tell her i didnt tell you said slowsolid  if you say another word about what my mother said the jaguar answered but he had not finished the sentence before slowandsolid quietly dived into the turbid amazon swam under water for a long way and came out on the bank where sticklyprickly was waiting for him  that was a very narrow escape said sticklyprickly i dont rib painted jaguar what did you tell him that you were  i told him truthfully that i was a truthful tortoise but he wouldnt believe it and he made me jump into the river to see if i was and i was and he is surprised now hes gone to tell his mummy listen to him  they could hear painted jaguar roaring up and down among the trees and the bushes by the side of the turbid amazon till his mummy came  son son said his mother ever so many times graciously waving her tail what have you been doing that you shouldnt have done  i tried to scoop something that said it wanted to be scooped out of its shell with my paw and my paw is full of perickles said painted jaguar  son son said his mother ever so many times graciously waving her tail by the prickles in your paddypaw i see that that must have been a hedgehog you should have dropped him into the water  i did that to the other thing and he said he was a tortoise and i didnt believe him and it was quite true and he has dived under the turbid amazon and he wont come up again and i havent anything at all to eat and i think we had better find lodgings somewhere else they are too clever on the turbid amazon for poor me  son son said his mother ever so many times graciously waving her tail now attend to me and remember what i say a hedgehog curls himself up into a ball and his prickles stick out every which way at once by this you may know the hedgehog  i dont like this old lady one little bit said sticklyprickly under the shadow of a large leaf i wonder what else she knows  a tortoise cant curl himself up mother jaguar went on ever so many times graciously waving her tail he only draws his head and legs into his shell by this you may know the tortoise  i dont like this old lady at allat all said slowandsolid tortoise even painted jaguar cant forget those directions its a great pity that you cant swim sticklyprickly  dont talk to me said sticklyprickly just think how much better it would be if you could curl up this is a mess listen to painted jaguar  painted jaguar was sitting on the banks of the turbid amazon sucking prickles out of his paws and saying to himself    cant curl but can swim   slowsolid thats him   curls up but cant swim   sticklyprickly thats him  hell never forget that this month of sundays said sticklyprickly hold up my chin slowandsolid im going to try to learn to swim it may be useful  excellent said slowandsolid and he held up sticklypricklys chin while sticklyprickly kicked in the waters of the turbid amazon  youll make a fine swimmer yet said slowandsolid now if you can unlace my backplates a little ill see what i can do towards curling up it may be useful  sticklyprickly helped to unlace tortoises backplates so that by twisting and straining slowandsolid actually managed to curl up a tiddy wee bit  excellent said sticklyprickly but i shouldnt do any more just now its making you black in the face kindly lead me into the water once again and ill practice that sidestroke which you say is so easy and so sticklyprickly practiced and slowsolid swam alongside  excellent said slowandsolid a little more practice will make you a regular whale now if i may trouble you to unlace my back and front plates two holes more ill try that fascinating bend that you say is so easy wont painted jaguar be surprised  excellent said sticklyprickly all wet from the turbid amazon i declare i shouldnt know you from one of my own family two holes i think you said a little more expression please and dont grunt quite so much or painted jaguar may hear us when youve finished i want to try that long dive which you say is so easy wont painted jaguar be surprised  and so sticklyprickly dived and slowandsolid dived alongside  excellent said slowandsolid a leetle more attention to holding your breath and you will be able to keep house at the bottom of the turbid amazon now ill try that exercise of putting my hind legs round my ears which you say is so peculiarly comfortable wont painted jaguar be surprised  excellent said sticklyprickly but its straining your backplates a little they are all overlapping now instead of lying side by side  oh thats the result of exercise said slowandsolid ive noticed that your prickles seem to be melting into one another and that youre growing to look rather more like a pinecone and less like a chestnutburr than you used to  am i said sticklyprickly that comes from my soaking in the water oh wont painted jaguar be surprised  they went on with their exercises each helping the other till morning came and when the sun was high they rested and dried themselves then they saw that they were both of them quite different from what they had been  sticklyprickly said tortoise after breakfast i am not what i was yesterday but i think that i may yet amuse painted jaguar  that was the very thing i was thinking just now said sticklyprickly i think scales are a tremendous improvement on pricklesto say nothing of being able to swim oh wont painted jaguar be surprised lets go and find him  by and by they found painted jaguar still nursing his paddypaw that had been hurt the night before he was so astonished that he fell three times backward over his own painted tail without stopping  good morning said sticklyprickly and how is your dear gracious mummy this morning  she is quite well thank you said painted jaguar but you must forgive me if i do not at this precise moment recall your name  thats unkind of you said sticklyprickly seeing that this time yesterday you tried to scoop me out of my shell with your paw  but you hadnt any shell it was all prickles said painted jaguar i know it was just look at my paw  you told me to drop into the turbid amazon and be drowned said slowsolid why are you so rude and forgetful today  dont you remember what your mother told you said sticklyprickly    cant curl but can swim   sticklyprickly thats him   curls up but cant swim   slowsolid thats him  then they both curled themselves up and rolled round and round painted jaguar till his eyes turned truly cartwheels in his head  then he went to fetch his mother  mother he said there are two new animals in the woods today and the one that you said couldnt swim swims and the one that you said couldnt curl up curls and theyve gone shares in their prickles i think because both of them are scaly all over instead of one being smooth and the other very prickly and besides that they are rolling round and round in circles and i dont feel comfy  son son said mother jaguar ever so many times graciously waving her tail a hedgehog is a hedgehog and cant be anything but a hedgehog and a tortoise is a tortoise and can never be anything else  but it isnt a hedgehog and it isnt a tortoise its a little bit of both and i dont know its proper name  nonsense said mother jaguar everything has its proper name i should call it armadillo till i found out the real one and i should leave it alone  so painted jaguar did as he was told especially about leaving them alone but the curious thing is that from that day to this o best beloved no one on the banks of the turbid amazon has ever called sticklyprickly and slowsolid anything except armadillo there are hedgehogs and tortoises in other places of course there are some in my garden but the real old and clever kind with their scales lying lippetylappety one over the other like pinecone scales that lived on the banks of the turbid amazon in the high and faroff days are always called armadillos because they were so clever  so that all right best beloved do you see       ive never sailed the amazon        ive never reached brazil      but the don and magdelana        they can go there when they will               yes weekly from southampton              great steamers white and gold              go rolling down to rio              roll downroll down to rio              and id like to roll to rio              some day before im old       ive never seen a jaguar        nor yet an armadill      o dilloing in his armour        and i spose i never will               unless i go to rio              these wonders to behold              roll downroll down to rio              roll really down to rio              oh id love to roll to rio              some day before im old     how the first letter was written  once upon a most early time was a neolithic man he was not a jute or an angle or even a dravidian which he might well have been best beloved but never mind why he was a primitive and he lived cavily in a cave and he wore very few clothes and he couldnt read and he couldnt write and he didnt want to and except when he was hungry he was quite happy his name was tegumai bopsulai and that means manwhodoesnotputhisfootforwardinahurry but we o best beloved will call him tegumai for short and his wifes name was teshumai tewindrow and that means ladywhoasksaverymanyquestions but we o best beloved will call her teshumai for short and his little girldaughters name was taffimai metallumai and that means smallpersonwithoutanymannerswhooughttobespanked but im going to call her taffy and she was tegumai bopsulais best beloved and her own mummys best beloved and she was not spanked half as much as was good for her and they were all three very happy as soon as taffy could run about she went everywhere with her daddy tegumai and sometimes they would not come home to the cave till they were hungry and then teshumai tewindrow would say where in the world have you two been to to get so shocking dirty really my tegumai youre no better than my taffy  now attend and listen  one day tegumai bopsulai went down through the beaverswamp to the wagai river to spear carpfish for dinner and taffy went too tegumais spear was made of wood with sharks teeth at the end and before he had caught any fish at all he accidentally broke it clean across by jabbing it down too hard on the bottom of the river they were miles and miles from home of course they had their lunch with them in a little bag and tegumai had forgotten to bring any extra spears  heres a pretty kettle of fish said tegumai it will take me half the day to mend this  theres your big black spear at home said taffy let me run back to the cave and ask mummy to give it me  its too far for your little fat legs said tegumai besides you might fall into the beaverswamp and be drowned we must make the best of a bad job he sat down and took out a little leather mendybag full of reindeersinews and strips of leather and lumps of beeswax and resin and began to mend the spear  taffy sat down too with her toes in the water and her chin in her hand and thought very hard then she saidi say daddy its an awful nuisance that you and i dont know how to write isnt it if we did we could send a message for the new spear  taffy said tegumai how often have i told you not to use slang awful isnt a pretty word but it could be a convenience now you mention it if we could write home  just then a strangerman came along the river but he belonged to a far tribe the tewaras and he did not understand one word of tegumais language he stood on the bank and smiled at taffy because he had a little girldaughter of his own at home tegumai drew a hank of deersinews from his mendybag and began to mend his spear  come here said taffy do you know where my mummy lives and the strangerman said um being as you know a tewara  silly said taffy and she stamped her foot because she saw a shoal of very big carp going up the river just when her daddy couldnt use his spear  dont bother grownups said tegumai so busy with his spearmending that he did not turn round  i arent said taffy i only want him to do what i want him to do and he wont understand  then dont bother me said tegumai and he went on pulling and straining at the deersinews with his mouth full of loose ends the strangermana genuine tewara he wassat down on the grass and taffy showed him what her daddy was doing the strangerman thought this is a very wonderful child she stamps her foot at me and she makes faces she must be the daughter of that noble chief who is so great that he wont take any notice of me so he smiled more politely than ever  now said taffy i want you to go to my mummy because your legs are longer than mine and you wont fall into the beaverswamp and ask for daddys other spearthe one with the black handle that hangs over our fireplace  the strangerman and he was a tewara thought this is a very very wonderful child she waves her arms and she shouts at me but i dont understand a word of what she says but if i dont do what she wants i greatly fear that that haughty chief manwhoturnshisbackoncallers will be angry he got up and twisted a big flat piece of bark off a birchtree and gave it to taffy he did this best beloved to show that his heart was as white as the birchbark and that he meant no harm but taffy didnt quite understand  oh said she now i see you want my mummys livingaddress of course i cant write but i can draw pictures if ive anything sharp to scratch with please lend me the sharks tooth off your necklace  the strangerman and he was a tewara didnt say anything so taffy put up her little hand and pulled at the beautiful bead and seed and sharktooth necklace round his neck  the strangerman and he was a tewara thought this is a very very very wonderful child the sharks tooth on my necklace is a magic sharks tooth and i was always told that if anybody touched it without my leave they would immediately swell up or burst but this child doesnt swell up or burst and that important chief manwhoattendsstrictlytohisbusiness who has not yet taken any notice of me at all doesnt seem to be afraid that she will swell up or burst i had better be more polite  so he gave taffy the sharks tooth and she lay down flat on her tummy with her legs in the air like some people on the drawingroom floor when they want to draw pictures and she said now ill draw you some beautiful pictures you can look over my shoulder but you mustnt joggle first ill draw daddy fishing it isnt very like him but mummy will know because ive drawn his spear all broken well now ill draw the other spear that he wants the blackhandled spear it looks as if it was sticking in daddys back but thats because the sharks tooth slipped and this piece of bark isnt big enough thats the spear i want you to fetch so ill draw a picture of me myself splaining to you my hair doesnt stand up like ive drawn but its easier to draw that way now ill draw you i think youre very nice really but i cant make you pretty in the picture so you mustnt be fended are you fended  the strangerman and he was a tewara smiled he thought there must be a big battle going to be fought somewhere and this extraordinary child who takes my magic sharks tooth but who does not swell up or burst is telling me to call all the great chiefs tribe to help him he is a great chief or he would have noticed me  look said taffy drawing very hard and rather scratchily now ive drawn you and ive put the spear that daddy wants into your hand just to remind you that youre to bring it now ill show you how to find my mummys livingaddress you go along till you come to two trees those are trees and then you go over a hill thats a hill and then you come into a beaverswamp all full of beavers i havent put in all the beavers because i cant draw beavers but ive drawn their heads and thats all youll see of them when you cross the swamp mind you dont fall in then our cave is just beyond the beaverswamp it isnt as high as the hills really but i cant draw things very small thats my mummy outside she is beautiful she is the most beautifullest mummy there ever was but she wont be fended when she sees ive drawn her so plain shell be pleased of me because i can draw now in case you forget ive drawn the spear that daddy wants outside our cave its inside really but you show the picture to my mummy and shell give it you ive made her holding up her hands because i know shell be so pleased to see you isnt it a beautiful picture and do you quite understand or shall i splain again  the strangerman and he was a tewara looked at the picture and nodded very hard he said to himself if i do not fetch this great chiefs tribe to help him he will be slain by his enemies who are coming up on all sides with spears now i see why the great chief pretended not to notice me he feared that his enemies were hiding in the bushes and would see him therefore he turned to me his back and let the wise and wonderful child draw the terrible picture showing me his difficulties i will away and get help for him from his tribe he did not even ask taffy the road but raced off into the bushes like the wind with the birchbark in his hand and taffy sat down most pleased  now this is the picture that taffy had drawn for him  what have you been doing taffy said tegumai he had mended his spear and was carefully waving it to and fro  its a little berangement of my own daddy dear said taffy if you wont ask me questions youll know all about it in a little time and youll be surprised you dont know how surprised youll be daddy promise youll be surprised  very well said tegumai and went on fishing  the strangermandid you know he was a tewarahurried away with the picture and ran for some miles till quite by accident he found teshumai tewindrow at the door of her cave talking to some other neolithic ladies who had come in to a primitive lunch taffy was very like teshumai especially about the upper part of the face and the eyes so the strangermanalways a pure tewarasmiled politely and handed teshumai the birchbark he had run hard so that he panted and his legs were scratched with brambles but he still tried to be polite  as soon as teshumai saw the picture she screamed like anything and flew at the strangerman the other neolithic ladies at once knocked him down and sat on him in a long line of six while teshumai pulled his hair  its as plain as the nose on this strangermans face she said he has stuck my tegumai all full of spears and frightened poor taffy so that her hair stands all on end and not content with that he brings me a horrid picture of how it was done look she showed the picture to all the neolithic ladies sitting patiently on the strangerman here is my tegumai with his arm broken here is a spear sticking into his back here is a man with a spear ready to throw here is another man throwing a spear from a cave and here are a whole pack of people they were taffys beavers really but they did look rather like people coming up behind tegumai isnt it shocking  most shocking said the neolithic ladies and they filled the strangermans hair with mud at which he was surprised and they beat upon the reverberating tribal drums and called together all the chiefs of the tribe of tegumai with their hetmans and dolmans all neguses woons and akhoonds of the organisation in addition to the warlocks angekoks jujumen bonzes and the rest who decided that before they chopped the strangermans head off he should instantly lead them down to the river and show them where he had hidden poor taffy  by this time the strangerman in spite of being a tewara was really annoyed they had filled his hair quite solid with mud they had rolled him up and down on knobby pebbles they had sat upon him in a long line of six they had thumped him and bumped him till he could hardly breathe and though he did not understand their language he was almost sure that the names the neolithic ladies called him were not ladylike however he said nothing till all the tribe of tegumai were assembled and then he led them back to the bank of the wagai river and there they found taffy making daisychains and tegumai carefully spearing small carp with his mended spear  well you have been quick said taffy but why did you bring so many people daddy dear this is my surprise are you surprised daddy  very said tegumai but it has ruined all my fishing for the day why the whole dear kind nice clean quiet tribe is here taffy  and so they were first of all walked teshumai tewindrow and the neolithic ladies tightly holding on to the strangerman whose hair was full of mud although he was a tewara behind them came the head chief the vicechief the deputy and assistant chiefs all armed to the upper teeth the hetmans and heads of hundreds platoffs with their platoons and dolmans with their detachments woons neguses and akhoonds ranking in the rear still armed to the teeth behind them was the tribe in hierarchical order from owners of four caves one for each season a private reindeerrun and two salmonleaps to feudal and prognathous villeins semientitled to half a bearskin of winter nights seven yards from the fire and adscript serfs holding the reversion of a scraped marrowbone under heriot arent those beautiful words best beloved they were all there prancing and shouting and they frightened every fish for twenty miles and tegumai thanked them in a fluid neolithic oration  then teshumai tewindrow ran down and kissed and hugged taffy very much indeed but the head chief of the tribe of tegumai took tegumai by the topknot feathers and shook him severely  explain explain explain cried all the tribe of tegumai  goodness sakes alive said tegumai let go of my topknot cant a man break his carpspear without the whole countryside descending on him youre a very interfering people  i dont believe youve brought my daddys blackhandled spear after all said taffy and what are you doing to my nice strangerman  they were thumping him by twos and threes and tens till his eyes turned round and round he could only gasp and point at taffy  where are the bad people who speared you my darling said teshumai tewindrow  there werent any said tegumai my only visitor this morning was the poor fellow that you are trying to choke arent you well or are you ill o tribe of tegumai  he came with a horrible picture said the head chiefa picture that showed you were full of spears  erumpraps id better splain that i gave him that picture said taffy but she did not feel quite comfy  you said the tribe of tegumai all together smallpersonwithnomannerswhooughttobespanked you  taffy dear im afraid were in for a little trouble said her daddy and put his arm round her so she didnt care  explain explain explain said the head chief of the tribe of tegumai and he hopped on one foot  i wanted the strangerman to fetch daddys spear so i drawded it said taffy there wasnt lots of spears there was only one spear i drawded it three times to make sure i couldnt help it looking as if it stuck into daddys headthere wasnt room on the birchbark and those things that mummy called bad people are my beavers i drawded them to show him the way through the swamp and i drawded mummy at the mouth of the cave looking pleased because he is a nice strangerman and i think you are just the stupidest people in the world said taffy he is a very nice man why have you filled his hair with mud wash him  nobody said anything at all for a longtime till the head chief laughed then the strangerman who was at least a tewara laughed then tegumai laughed till he fell down flat on the bank then all the tribe laughed more and worse and louder the only people who did not laugh were teshumai tewindrow and all the neolithic ladies they were very polite to all their husbands and said idiot ever so often  then the head chief of the tribe of tegumai cried and said and sang o smallpersonwithoutanymannerswhooughttobespanked youve hit upon a great invention  i didnt intend to i only wanted daddys blackhandled spear said taffy  never mind it is a great invention and some day men will call it writing at present it is only pictures and as we have seen today pictures are not always properly understood but a time will come o babe of tegumai when we shall make lettersall twentysix of emand when we shall be able to read as well as to write and then we shall always say exactly what we mean without any mistakes let the neolithic ladies wash the mud out of the strangers hair  i shall be glad of that said taffy because after all though youve brought every single other spear in the tribe of tegumai youve forgotten my daddys blackhandled spear  then the head chief cried and said and sang taffy dear the next time you write a pictureletter youd better send a man who can talk our language with it to explain what it means i dont mind it myself because i am a head chief but its very bad for the rest of the tribe of tegumai and as you can see it surprises the stranger  then they adopted the strangerman a genuine tewara of tewar into the tribe of tegumai because he was a gentleman and did not make a fuss about the mud that the neolithic ladies had put into his hair but from that day to this and i suppose it is all taffys fault very few little girls have ever liked learning to read or write most of them prefer to draw pictures and play about with their daddiesjust like taffy        there runs a road by merrow down        a grassy track today it is      an hour out of guildford town        above the river wey it is       here when they heard the horsebells ring        the ancient britons dressed and rode      to watch the dark phoenicians bring        their goods along the western road       and here or hereabouts they met        to hold their racial talks and such      to barter beads for whitby jet        and tin for gay shell torques and such       but long and long before that time        when bison used to roam on it      did taffy and her daddy climb        that down and had their home on it       then beavers built in broadstone brook        and made a swamp where bramley stands      and hears from shere would come and look        for taffimai where shamley stands       the wey that taffy called wagai        was more than six times bigger then      and all the tribe of tegumai        they cut a noble figure then     how the alphabet was made  the week after taffimai metallumai we will still call her taffy best beloved made that little mistake about her daddys spear and the strangerman and the pictureletter and all she went carpfishing again with her daddy her mummy wanted her to stay at home and help hang up hides to dry on the big dryingpoles outside their neolithic cave but taffy slipped away down to her daddy quite early and they fished presently she began to giggle and her daddy said dont be silly child  but wasnt it inciting said taffy dont you remember how the head chief puffed out his cheeks and how funny the nice strangerman looked with the mud in his hair  well do i said tegumai i had to pay two deerskinssoft ones with fringesto the strangerman for the things we did to him  we didnt do anything said taffy it was mummy and the other neolithic ladiesand the mud  we wont talk about that said her daddy lets have lunch  taffy took a marrowbone and sat mousyquiet for ten whole minutes while her daddy scratched on pieces of birchbark with a sharks tooth then she said daddy ive thinked of a secret surprise you make a noiseany sort of noise  ah said tegumai will that do to begin with  yes said taffy you look just like a carpfish with its mouth open say it again please  ah ah ah said her daddy dont be rude my daughter  im not meaning rude really and truly said taffy its part of my secretsurprisethink do say ah daddy and keep your mouth open at the end and lend me that tooth im going to draw a carpfishs mouth wideopen  what for said her daddy  dont you see said taffy scratching away on the bark that will be our little secret sprise when i draw a carpfish with his mouth open in the smoke at the back of our caveif mummy doesnt mindit will remind you of that ahnoise then we can play that it was me jumped out of the dark and sprised you with that noisesame as i did in the beaverswamp last winter  really said her daddy in the voice that grownups use when they are truly attending go on taffy  oh bother she said i cant draw all of a carpfish but i can draw something that means a carpfishs mouth dont you know how they stand on their heads rooting in the mud well heres a pretence carpfish we can play that the rest of him is drawn heres just his mouth and that means ah and she drew this 1  thats not bad said tegumai and scratched on his own piece of bark for himself but youve forgotten the feeler that hangs across his mouth  but i cant draw daddy  you neednt draw anything of him except just the opening of his mouth and the feeler across then well know hes a carpfish cause the perches and trouts havent got feelers look here taffy and he drew this 2  now ill copy it said taffy will you understand this when you see it  perfectly said her daddy  and she drew this 3 and ill be quite as sprised when i see it anywhere as if you had jumped out from behind a tree and said ah  now make another noise said taffy very proud  yah said her daddy very loud  hm said taffy thats a mixy noise the end part is ahcarpfishmouth but what can we do about the front part yeryeryer and ah ya  its very like the carpfishmouth noise lets draw another bit of the carpfish and join em said her daddy he was quite incited too  no if theyre joined ill forget draw it separate draw his tail if hes standing on his head the tail will come first sides i think i can draw tails easiest said taffy  a good notion said tegumai heres a carpfish tail for the yernoise and he drew this 4  ill try now said taffy member i cant draw like you daddy will it do if i just draw the split part of the tail and the stickydown line for where it joins and she drew this 5  her daddy nodded and his eyes were shiny bright with citement  thats beautiful she said now make another noise daddy  oh said her daddy very loud  thats quite easy said taffy you make your mouth all around like an egg or a stone so an egg or a stone will do for that  you cant always find eggs or stones well have to scratch a round something like one and he drew this 6  my gracious said taffy what a lot of noisepictures weve madecarpmouth carptail and egg now make another noise daddy  ssh said her daddy and frowned to himself but taffy was too incited to notice  thats quite easy she said scratching on the bark  eh what said her daddy i meant i was thinking and didnt want to be disturbed  its a noise just the same its the noise a snake makes daddy when it is thinking and doesnt want to be disturbed lets make the sshnoise a snake will this do and she drew this 7  there she said thats another sprisesecret when you draw a hissysnake by the door of your little backcave where you mend the spears ill know youre thinking hard and ill come in most mousyquiet and if you draw it on a tree by the river when you are fishing ill know you want me to walk most most mousyquiet so as not to shake the banks  perfectly true said tegumai and theres more in this game than you think taffy dear ive a notion that your daddys daughter has hit upon the finest thing that there ever was since the tribe of tegumai took to using sharks teeth instead of flints for their spearheads i believe weve found out the big secret of the world  why said taffy and her eyes shone too with incitement  ill show said her daddy whats water in the tegumai language  ya of course and it means river toolike wagaiyathe wagai river  what is bad water that gives you fever if you drink itblack waterswampwater  yo of course  now look said her daddy spose you saw this scratched by the side of a pool in the beaverswamp and he drew this 8  carptail and round egg two noises mixed yo bad water said taffy course i wouldnt drink that water because id know you said it was bad  but i neednt be near the water at all i might be miles away hunting and still  and still it would be just the same as if you stood there and said gway taffy or youll get fever all that in a carpfishtail and a round egg o daddy we must tell mummy quick and taffy danced all round him  not yet said tegumai not till weve gone a little further lets see yo is bad water but so is food cooked on the fire isnt it and he drew this 9  yes snake and egg said taffy so that means dinners ready if you saw that scratched on a tree youd know it was time to come to the cave sod i  my winkie said tegumai thats true too but wait a minute i see a difficulty so means come and have dinner but sho means the dryingpoles where we hang our hides  horrid old dryingpoles said taffy i hate helping to hang heavy hot hairy hides on them if you drew the snake and egg and i thought it meant dinner and i came in from the wood and found that it meant i was to help mummy hang the two hides on the dryingpoles what would i do  youd be cross sod mummy we must make a new picture for sho we must draw a spotty snake that hisses shsh and well play that the plain snake only hisses ssss  i couldnt be sure how to put in the spots said taffy and praps if you were in a hurry you might leave them out and id think it was so when it was sho and then mummy would catch me just the same no i think wed better draw a picture of the horrid high dryingpoles their very selves and make quite sure ill put them in just after the hissysnake look and she drew this 10  praps thats safest its very like our dryingpoles anyhow said her daddy laughing now ill make a new noise with a snake and dryingpole sound in it ill say shi thats tegumai for spear taffy and he laughed  dont make fun of me said taffy as she thought of her pictureletter and the mud in the strangermans hair you draw it daddy  we wont have beavers or hills this time eh said her daddy ill just draw a straight line for my spear and he drew this 11  even mummy couldnt mistake that for me being killed  please dont daddy it makes me uncomfy do some more noises were getting on beautifully  erhm said tegumai looking up well say shu that means sky  taffy drew the snake and the dryingpole then she stopped we must make a new picture for that end sound mustnt we  shushuuuu said her daddy why its just like the roundeggsound made thin  then spose we draw a thin round egg and pretend its a frog that hasnt eaten anything for years  nno said her daddy if we drew that in a hurry we might mistake it for the round egg itself shushushu i tell you what well do well open a little hole at the end of the round egg to show how the onoise runs out all thin ooooooo like this and he drew this 12  oh thats lovely much better than a thin frog go on said taffy using her sharks tooth her daddy went on drawing and his hand shook with incitement he went on till he had drawn this 13  dont look up taffy he said try if you can make out what that means in the tegumai language if you can weve found the secret  snakepolebrokeneggcarptail and carpmouth said taffy shuya skywater rain just then a drop fell on her hand for the day had clouded over why daddy its raining was that what you meant to tell me  of course said her daddy and i told it you without saying a word didnt i  well i think i would have known it in a minute but that raindrop made me quite sure ill always remember now shuya means rain or it is going to rain why daddy she got up and danced round him spose you went out before i was awake and drawed shuya in the smoke on the wall id know it was going to rain and id take my beaverskin hood wouldnt mummy be surprised  tegumai got up and danced daddies didnt mind doing those things in those days more than that more than that he said spose i wanted to tell you it wasnt going to rain much and you must come down to the river what would we draw say the words in tegumaitalk first  shuyalas ya maru skywater ending river come to what a lot of new sounds i dont see how we can draw them  but i dobut i do said tegumai just attend a minute taffy and we wont do any more today weve got shuya all right havent we but this las is a teaser lalala and he waved his sharktooth  theres the hissysnake at the end and the carpmouth before the snakeasasas we only want lala said taffy  i know it but we have to make lala and were the first people in all the world whove ever tried to do it taffimai  well said taffy yawning for she was rather tired las means breaking or finishing as well as ending doesnt it  so it does said tegumai tolas means that theres no water in the tank for mummy to cook withjust when im going hunting too  and shilas means that your spear is broken if id only thought of that instead of drawing silly beaver pictures for the stranger  la la la said tegumai waiving his stick and frowning oh bother  i could have drawn shi quite easily taffy went on then id have drawn your spear all brokenthis way and she drew 14  the very thing said tegumai thats la all over it isnt like any of the other marks either and he drew this 15  now for ya oh weve done that before now for maru mummummum mum shuts ones mouth up doesnt it well draw a shut mouth like this and he drew 16  then the carpmouth open that makes mamama but what about this rrrrrthing taffy  it sounds all rough and edgy like your sharktooth saw when youre cutting out a plank for the canoe said taffy  you mean all sharp at the edges like this said tegumai and he drew 17  xactly said taffy but we dont want all those teeth only put two  ill only put in one said tegumai if this game of ours is going to be what i think it will the easier we make our soundpictures the better for everybody and he drew 18  now weve got it said tegumai standing on one leg ill draw em all in a string like fish  hadnt we better put a little bit of stick or something between each word sos they wont rub up against each other and jostle same as if they were carps  oh ill leave a space for that said her daddy and very incitedly he drew them all without stopping on a big new bit of birchbark 19  shuyalas yamaru said taffy reading it out sound by sound   thats enough for today said tegumai besides youre getting tired taffy never mind dear well finish it all tomorrow and then well be remembered for years and years after the biggest trees you can see are all chopped up for firewood  so they went home and all that evening tegumai sat on one side of the fire and taffy on the other drawing yas and yos and shus and shis in the smoke on the wall and giggling together till her mummy said really tegumai youre worse than my taffy  please dont mind said taffy its only our secretsprise mummy dear and well tell you all about it the very minute its done but please dont ask me what it is now or else ill have to tell  so her mummy most carefully didnt and bright and early next morning tegumai went down to the river to think about new sound pictures and when taffy got up she saw yalas water is ending or running out chalked on the side of the big stone watertank outside the cave  um said taffy these picturesounds are rather a bother daddys just as good as come here himself and told me to get more water for mummy to cook with she went to the spring at the back of the house and filled the tank from a bark bucket and then she ran down to the river and pulled her daddys left earthe one that belonged to her to pull when she was good  now come along and well draw all the leftover soundpictures said her daddy and they had a most inciting day of it and a beautiful lunch in the middle and two games of romps when they came to t taffy said that as her name and her daddys and her mummys all began with that sound they should draw a sort of family group of themselves holding hands that was all very well to draw once or twice but when it came to drawing it six or seven times taffy and tegumai drew it scratchier and scratchier till at last the tsound was only a thin long tegumai with his arms out to hold taffy and teshumai you can see from these three pictures partly how it happened 20 21 22  many of the other pictures were much too beautiful to begin with especially before lunch but as they were drawn over and over again on birchbark they became plainer and easier till at last even tegumai said he could find no fault with them they turned the hissysnake the other way round for the zsound to show it was hissing backwards in a soft and gentle way 23 and they just made a twiddle for e because it came into the pictures so often 24 and they drew pictures of the sacred beaver of the tegumais for the bsound 25 26 27 28 and because it was a nasty nosy noise they just drew noses for the nsound till they were tired 29 and they drew a picture of the big lakepikes mouth for the greedy gasound 30 and they drew the pikes mouth again with a spear behind it for the scratchy hurty kasound 31 and they drew pictures of a little bit of the winding wagai river for the nice windywindy wasound 32 33 and so on and so forth and so following till they had done and drawn all the soundpictures that they wanted and there was the alphabet all complete  and after thousands and thousands and thousands of years and after hieroglyphics and demotics and nilotics and cryptics and cufics and runics and dorics and ionics and all sorts of other ricks and tricks because the woons and the neguses and the akhoonds and the repositories of tradition would never leave a good thing alone when they saw it the fine old easy understandable alphabeta b c d e and the rest of emgot back into its proper shape again for all best beloveds to learn when they are old enough  but i remember tegumai bopsulai and taffimai metallumai and teshumai tewindrow her dear mummy and all the days gone by and it was sojust soa little time agoon the banks of the big wagai       of all the tribe of tegumai        who cut that figure none remain      on merrow down the cuckoos cry        the silence and the sun remain       but as the faithful years return        and hearts unwounded sing again      comes taffy dancing through the fern        to lead the surrey spring again       her brows are bound with brackenfronds        and golden elflocks fly above      her eyes are bright as diamonds        and bluer than the skies above       in mocassins and deerskin cloak        unfearing free and fair she flits      and lights her little dampwood smoke        to show her daddy where she flits       for faroh very far behind        so far she cannot call to him      comes tegumai alone to find        the daughter that was all to him     the crab that played with the sea  before the high and faroff times o my best beloved came the time of the very beginnings and that was in the days when the eldest magician was getting things ready first he got the earth ready then he got the sea ready and then he told all the animals that they could come out and play and the animals said o eldest magician what shall we play at and he said i will show you he took the elephantalltheelephanttherewasand said play at being an elephant and alltheelephanttherewas played he took the beaverallthebeavertherewas and said play at being a beaver and allthe beavertherewas played he took the cowallthe cowtherewasand said play at being a cow and allthecowtherewas played he took the turtlealltheturtle therewas and said play at being a turtle and alltheturtletherewas played one by one he took all the beasts and birds and fishes and told them what to play at  but towards evening when people and things grow restless and tired there came up the man with his own little girldaughteryes with his own best beloved little girldaughter sitting upon his shoulder and he said what is this play eldest magician and the eldest magician said ho son of adam this is the play of the very beginning but you are too wise for this play and the man saluted and said yes i am too wise for this play but see that you make all the animals obedient to me  now while the two were talking together pau amma the crab who was next in the game scuttled off sideways and stepped into the sea saying to himself i will play my play alone in the deep waters and i will never be obedient to this son of adam nobody saw him go away except the little girldaughter where she leaned on the mans shoulder and the play went on till there were no more animals left without orders and the eldest magician wiped the fine dust off his hands and walked about the world to see how the animals were playing  he went north best beloved and he found alltheelephanttherewas digging with his tusks and stamping with his feet in the nice new clean earth that had been made ready for him  kun said alltheelephanttherewas meaning is this right  payah kun said the eldest magician meaning that is quite right and he breathed upon the great rocks and lumps of earth that alltheelephanttherewas had thrown up and they became the great himalayan mountains and you can look them out on the map  he went east and he found allthecow therewas feeding in the field that had been made ready for her and she licked her tongue round a whole forest at a time and swallowed it and sat down to chew her cud  kun said allthecowtherewas  payah kun said the eldest magician and he breathed upon the bare patch where she had eaten and upon the place where she had sat down and one became the great indian desert and the other became the desert of sahara and you can look them out on the map  he went west and he found allthebeavertherewas making a beaverdam across the mouths of broad rivers that had been got ready for him  kun said allthebeavertherewas  payah kun said the eldest magician and he breathed upon the fallen trees and the still water and they became the everglades in florida and you may look them out on the map  then he went south and found alltheturtletherewas scratching with his flippers in the sand that had been got ready for him and the sand and the rocks whirled through the air and fell far off into the sea  kun said alltheturtletherewas  payah kun said the eldest magician and he breathed upon the sand and the rocks where they had fallen in the sea and they became the most beautiful islands of borneo celebes sumatra java and the rest of the malay archipelago and you can look them out on the map  by and by the eldest magician met the man on the banks of the perak river and said ho son of adam are all the animals obedient to you  yes said the man  is all the earth obedient to you  yes said the man  is all the sea obedient to you  no said the man once a day and once a night the sea runs up the perak river and drives the sweetwater back into the forest so that my house is made wet once a day and once a night it runs down the river and draws all the water after it so that there is nothing left but mud and my canoe is upset is that the play you told it to play  no said the eldest magician that is a new and a bad play  look said the man and as he spoke the great sea came up the mouth of the perak river driving the river backwards till it overflowed all the dark forests for miles and miles and flooded the mans house  this is wrong launch your canoe and we will find out who is playing with the sea said the eldest magician they stepped into the canoe the little girldaughter came with them and the man took his krisa curving wavy dagger with a blade like a flameand they pushed out on the perak river then the sea began to run back and back and the canoe was sucked out of the mouth of the perak river past selangor past malacca past singapore out and out to the island of bingtang as though it had been pulled by a string  then the eldest magician stood up and shouted ho beasts birds and fishes that i took between my hands at the very beginning and taught the play that you should play which one of you is playing with the sea  then all the beasts birds and fishes said together eldest magician we play the plays that you taught us to playwe and our childrens children but not one of us plays with the sea  then the moon rose big and full over the water and the eldest magician said to the hunchbacked old man who sits in the moon spinning a fishingline with which he hopes one day to catch the world ho fisher of the moon are you playing with the sea  no said the fisherman i am spinning a line with which i shall some day catch the world but i do not play with the sea and he went on spinning his line  now there is also a rat up in the moon who always bites the old fishermans line as fast as it is made and the eldest magician said to him ho rat of the moon are you playing with the sea  and the rat said i am too busy biting through the line that this old fisherman is spinning i do not play with the sea and he went on biting the line  then the little girldaughter put up her little soft brown arms with the beautiful white shell bracelets and said o eldest magician when my father here talked to you at the very beginning and i leaned upon his shoulder while the beasts were being taught their plays one beast went away naughtily into the sea before you had taught him his play  and the eldest magician said how wise are little children who see and are silent what was the beast like  and the little girldaughter said he was round and he was flat and his eyes grew upon stalks and he walked sideways like this and he was covered with strong armour upon his back  and the eldest magician said how wise are little children who speak truth now i know where pau amma went give me the paddle  so he took the paddle but there was no need to paddle for the water flowed steadily past all the islands till they came to the place called pusat tasekthe heart of the seawhere the great hollow is that leads down to the heart of the world and in that hollow grows the wonderful tree pauh janggi that bears the magic twin nuts then the eldest magician slid his arm up to the shoulder through the deep warm water and under the roots of the wonderful tree he touched the broad back of pau amma the crab and pau amma settled down at the touch and all the sea rose up as water rises in a basin when you put your hand into it  ah said the eldest magician now i know who has been playing with the sea and he called out what are you doing pau amma  and pau amma deep down below answered once a day and once a night i go out to look for my food once a day and once a night i return leave me alone  then the eldest magician said listen pau amma when you go out from your cave the waters of the sea pour down into pusat tasek and all the beaches of all the islands are left bare and the little fish die and raja moyang kaban the king of the elephants his legs are made muddy when you come back and sit in pusat tasek the waters of the sea rise and half the little islands are drowned and the mans house is flooded and raja abdullah the king of the crocodiles his mouth is filled with the salt water  then pau amma deep down below laughed and said i did not know i was so important henceforward i will go out seven times a day and the waters shall never be still  and the eldest magician said i cannot make you play the play you were meant to play pau amma because you escaped me at the very beginning but if you are not afraid come up and we will talk about it  i am not afraid said pau amma and he rose to the top of the sea in the moonlight there was nobody in the world so big as pau ammafor he was the king crab of all crabs not a common crab but a king crab one side of his great shell touched the beach at sarawak the other touched the beach at pahang and he was taller than the smoke of three volcanoes as he rose up through the branches of the wonderful tree he tore off one of the great twin fruitsthe magic double kernelled nuts that make people youngand the little girldaughter saw it bobbing alongside the canoe and pulled it in and began to pick out the soft eyes of it with her little golden scissors  now said the magician make a magic pau amma to show that you are really important  pau amma rolled his eyes and waved his legs but he could only stir up the sea because though he was a king crab he was nothing more than a crab and the eldest magician laughed  you are not so important after all pau amma he said now let me try and he made a magic with his left handwith just the little finger of his left handandlo and behold best beloved pau ammas hard bluegreenblack shell fell off him as a husk falls off a cocoanut and pau amma was left all softsoft as the little crabs that you sometimes find on the beach best beloved  indeed you are very important said the eldest magician shall i ask the man here to cut you with kris shall i send for raja moyang kaban the king of the elephants to pierce you with his tusks or shall i call raja abdullah the king of the crocodiles to bite you  and pau amma said i am ashamed give me back my hard shell and let me go back to pusat tasek and i will only stir out once a day and once a night to get my food  and the eldest magician said no pau amma i will not give you back your shell for you will grow bigger and prouder and stronger and perhaps you will forget your promise and you will play with the sea once more  then pau amma said what shall i do i am so big that i can only hide in pusat tasek and if i go anywhere else all soft as i am now the sharks and the dogfish will eat me and if i go to pusat tasek all soft as i am now though i may be safe i can never stir out to get my food and so i shall die then he waved his legs and lamented  listen pau amma said the eldest magician i cannot make you play the play you were meant to play because you escaped me at the very beginning but if you choose i can make every stone and every hole and every bunch of weed in all the seas a safe pusat tasek for you and your children for always  then pau amma said that is good but i do not choose yet look there is that man who talked to you at the very beginning if he had not taken up your attention i should not have grown tired of waiting and run away and all this would never have happened what will he do for me  and the man said if you choose i will make a magic so that both the deep water and the dry ground will be a home for you and your childrenso that you shall be able to hide both on the land and in the sea  and pau amma said i do not choose yet look there is that girl who saw me running away at the very beginning if she had spoken then the eldest magician would have called me back and all this would never have happened what will she do for me  and the little girldaughter said this is a good nut that i am eating if you choose i will make a magic and i will give you this pair of scissors very sharp and strong so that you and your children can eat cocoanuts like this all day long when you come up from the sea to the land or you can dig a pusat tasek for yourself with the scissors that belong to you when there is no stone or hole near by and when the earth is too hard by the help of these same scissors you can run up a tree  and pau amma said i do not choose yet for all soft as i am these gifts would not help me give me back my shell o eldest magician and then i will play your play  and the eldest magician said i will give it back pau amma for eleven months of the year but on the twelfth month of every year it shall grow soft again to remind you and all your children that i can make magics and to keep you humble pau amma for i see that if you can run both under the water and on land you will grow too bold and if you can climb trees and crack nuts and dig holes with your scissors you will grow too greedy pau amma  then pau amma thought a little and said i have made my choice i will take all the gifts  then the eldest magician made a magic with the right hand with all five fingers of his right hand and lo and behold best beloved pau amma grew smaller and smaller and smaller till at last there was only a little green crab swimming in the water alongside the canoe crying in a very small voice give me the scissors  and the girldaughter picked him up on the palm of her little brown hand and sat him in the bottom of the canoe and gave him her scissors and he waved them in his little arms and opened them and shut them and snapped them and said i can eat nuts i can crack shells i can dig holes i can climb trees i can breathe in the dry air and i can find a safe pusat tasek under every stone i did not know i was so important kun is this right  payahkun said the eldest magician and he laughed and gave him his blessing and little pau amma scuttled over the side of the canoe into the water and he was so tiny that he could have hidden under the shadow of a dry leaf on land or of a dead shell at the bottom of the sea  was that well done said the eldest magician  yes said the man but now we must go back to perak and that is a weary way to paddle if we had waited till pau amma had gone out of pusat tasek and come home the water would have carried us there by itself  you are lazy said the eldest magician so your children shall be lazy they shall be the laziest people in the world they shall be called the malazythe lazy people and he held up his finger to the moon and said o fisherman here is the man too lazy to row home pull his canoe home with your line fisherman  no said the man if i am to be lazy all my days let the sea work for me twice a day for ever that will save paddling  and the eldest magician laughed and said payah kun that is right  and the rat of the moon stopped biting the line and the fisherman let his line down till it touched the sea and he pulled the whole deep sea along past the island of bintang past singapore past malacca past selangor till the canoe whirled into the mouth of the perak river again kun said the fisherman of the moon  payah kun said the eldest magician see now that you pull the sea twice a day and twice a night for ever so that the malazy fishermen may be saved paddling but be careful not to do it too hard or i shall make a magic on you as i did to pau amma  then they all went up the perak river and went to bed best beloved  now listen and attend  from that day to this the moon has always pulled the sea up and down and made what we call the tides sometimes the fisher of the sea pulls a little too hard and then we get spring tides and sometimes he pulls a little too softly and then we get what are called neaptides but nearly always he is careful because of the eldest magician  and pau amma you can see when you go to the beach how all pau ammas babies make little pusat taseks for themselves under every stone and bunch of weed on the sands you can see them waving their little scissors and in some parts of the world they truly live on the dry land and run up the palm trees and eat cocoanuts exactly as the girldaughter promised but once a year all pau ammas must shake off their hard armour and be softto remind them of what the eldest magician could do and so it isnt fair to kill or hunt pau ammas babies just because old pau amma was stupidly rude a very long time ago  oh yes and pau ammas babies hate being taken out of their little pusat taseks and brought home in picklebottles that is why they nip you with their scissors and it serves you right        chinagoing ps and os      pass pau ammas playground close      and his pusat tasek lies      near the track of most bis      uyk and ndl      know pau ammas home as well      as the fisher of the sea knows      bens mms and rubattinos      but and this is rather queer      atls can not come here      o and o and doa      must go round another way      orient anchor bibby hall      never go that way at all      ucs would have a fit      if it found itself on it      and if beavers took their cargoes      to penang instead of lagos      or a fat shawsavill bore      passengers to singapore      or a white star were to try a      little trip to sourabaya      or a bsa went on      past natal to cheribon      then great mr lloyds would come      with a wire and drag them home       youll know what my riddle means      when youve eaten mangosteens  or if you cant wait till then ask them to let you have the outside page of the times turn over to page 2 where it is marked shipping on the top left hand then take the atlas and that is the finest picturebook in the world and see how the names of the places that the steamers go to fit into the names of the places on the map any steamerkiddy ought to be able to do that but if you cant read ask some one to show it you     the cat that walked by himself  hear and attend and listen for this befell and behappened and became and was o my best beloved when the tame animals were wild the dog was wild and the horse was wild and the cow was wild and the sheep was wild and the pig was wildas wild as wild could beand they walked in the wet wild woods by their wild lones but the wildest of all the wild animals was the cat he walked by himself and all places were alike to him  of course the man was wild too he was dreadfully wild he didnt even begin to be tame till he met the woman and she told him that she did not like living in his wild ways she picked out a nice dry cave instead of a heap of wet leaves to lie down in and she strewed clean sand on the floor and she lit a nice fire of wood at the back of the cave and she hung a dried wildhorse skin taildown across the opening of the cave and she said wipe you feet dear when you come in and now well keep house  that night best beloved they ate wild sheep roasted on the hot stones and flavoured with wild garlic and wild pepper and wild duck stuffed with wild rice and wild fenugreek and wild coriander and marrowbones of wild oxen and wild cherries and wild grenadillas then the man went to sleep in front of the fire ever so happy but the woman sat up combing her hair she took the bone of the shoulder of muttonthe big fat bladeboneand she looked at the wonderful marks on it and she threw more wood on the fire and she made a magic she made the first singing magic in the world  out in the wet wild woods all the wild animals gathered together where they could see the light of the fire a long way off and they wondered what it meant  then wild horse stamped with his wild foot and said o my friends and o my enemies why have the man and the woman made that great light in that great cave and what harm will it do us  wild dog lifted up his wild nose and smelled the smell of roast mutton and said i will go up and see and look and say for i think it is good cat come with me  nenni said the cat i am the cat who walks by himself and all places are alike to me i will not come  then we can never be friends again said wild dog and he trotted off to the cave but when he had gone a little way the cat said to himself all places are alike to me why should i not go too and see and look and come away at my own liking so he slipped after wild dog softly very softly and hid himself where he could hear everything  when wild dog reached the mouth of the cave he lifted up the dried horseskin with his nose and sniffed the beautiful smell of the roast mutton and the woman looking at the bladebone heard him and laughed and said here comes the first wild thing out of the wild woods what do you want  wild dog said o my enemy and wife of my enemy what is this that smells so good in the wild woods  then the woman picked up a roasted muttonbone and threw it to wild dog and said wild thing out of the wild woods taste and try wild dog gnawed the bone and it was more delicious than anything he had ever tasted and he said o my enemy and wife of my enemy give me another  the woman said wild thing out of the wild woods help my man to hunt through the day and guard this cave at night and i will give you as many roast bones as you need  ah said the cat listening this is a very wise woman but she is not so wise as i am  wild dog crawled into the cave and laid his head on the womans lap and said o my friend and wife of my friend i will help your man to hunt through the day and at night i will guard your cave  ah said the cat listening that is a very foolish dog and he went back through the wet wild woods waving his wild tail and walking by his wild lone but he never told anybody  when the man waked up he said what is wild dog doing here and the woman said his name is not wild dog any more but the first friend because he will be our friend for always and always and always take him with you when you go hunting  next night the woman cut great green armfuls of fresh grass from the watermeadows and dried it before the fire so that it smelt like newmown hay and she sat at the mouth of the cave and plaited a halter out of horsehide and she looked at the shoulder of muttonboneat the big broad bladeboneand she made a magic she made the second singing magic in the world  out in the wild woods all the wild animals wondered what had happened to wild dog and at last wild horse stamped with his foot and said i will go and see and say why wild dog has not returned cat come with me  nenni said the cat i am the cat who walks by himself and all places are alike to me i will not come but all the same he followed wild horse softly very softly and hid himself where he could hear everything  when the woman heard wild horse tripping and stumbling on his long mane she laughed and said here comes the second wild thing out of the wild woods what do you want  wild horse said o my enemy and wife of my enemy where is wild dog  the woman laughed and picked up the bladebone and looked at it and said wild thing out of the wild woods you did not come here for wild dog but for the sake of this good grass  and wild horse tripping and stumbling on his long mane said that is true give it me to eat  the woman said wild thing out of the wild woods bend your wild head and wear what i give you and you shall eat the wonderful grass three times a day  ah said the cat listening this is a clever woman but she is not so clever as i am wild horse bent his wild head and the woman slipped the plaited hide halter over it and wild horse breathed on the womans feet and said o my mistress and wife of my master i will be your servant for the sake of the wonderful grass  ah said the cat listening that is a very foolish horse and he went back through the wet wild woods waving his wild tail and walking by his wild lone but he never told anybody  when the man and the dog came back from hunting the man said what is wild horse doing here and the woman said his name is not wild horse any more but the first servant because he will carry us from place to place for always and always and always ride on his back when you go hunting  next day holding her wild head high that her wild horns should not catch in the wild trees wild cow came up to the cave and the cat followed and hid himself just the same as before and everything happened just the same as before and the cat said the same things as before and when wild cow had promised to give her milk to the woman every day in exchange for the wonderful grass the cat went back through the wet wild woods waving his wild tail and walking by his wild lone just the same as before but he never told anybody and when the man and the horse and the dog came home from hunting and asked the same questions same as before the woman said her name is not wild cow any more but the giver of good food she will give us the warm white milk for always and always and always and i will take care of her while you and the first friend and the first servant go hunting  next day the cat waited to see if any other wild thing would go up to the cave but no one moved in the wet wild woods so the cat walked there by himself and he saw the woman milking the cow and he saw the light of the fire in the cave and he smelt the smell of the warm white milk  cat said o my enemy and wife of my enemy where did wild cow go  the woman laughed and said wild thing out of the wild woods go back to the woods again for i have braided up my hair and i have put away the magic bladebone and we have no more need of either friends or servants in our cave  cat said i am not a friend and i am not a servant i am the cat who walks by himself and i wish to come into your cave  woman said then why did you not come with first friend on the first night  cat grew very angry and said has wild dog told tales of me  then the woman laughed and said you are the cat who walks by himself and all places are alike to you your are neither a friend nor a servant you have said it yourself go away and walk by yourself in all places alike  then cat pretended to be sorry and said must i never come into the cave must i never sit by the warm fire must i never drink the warm white milk you are very wise and very beautiful you should not be cruel even to a cat  woman said i knew i was wise but i did not know i was beautiful so i will make a bargain with you if ever i say one word in your praise you may come into the cave  and if you say two words in my praise said the cat  i never shall said the woman but if i say two words in your praise you may sit by the fire in the cave  and if you say three words said the cat  i never shall said the woman but if i say three words in your praise you may drink the warm white milk three times a day for always and always and always  then the cat arched his back and said now let the curtain at the mouth of the cave and the fire at the back of the cave and the milkpots that stand beside the fire remember what my enemy and the wife of my enemy has said and he went away through the wet wild woods waving his wild tail and walking by his wild lone  that night when the man and the horse and the dog came home from hunting the woman did not tell them of the bargain that she had made with the cat because she was afraid that they might not like it  cat went far and far away and hid himself in the wet wild woods by his wild lone for a long time till the woman forgot all about him only the batthe little upsidedown batthat hung inside the cave knew where cat hid and every evening bat would fly to cat with news of what was happening  one evening bat said there is a baby in the cave he is new and pink and fat and small and the woman is very fond of him  ah said the cat listening but what is the baby fond of  he is fond of things that are soft and tickle said the bat he is fond of warm things to hold in his arms when he goes to sleep he is fond of being played with he is fond of all those things  ah said the cat listening then my time has come  next night cat walked through the wet wild woods and hid very near the cave till morningtime and man and dog and horse went hunting the woman was busy cooking that morning and the baby cried and interrupted so she carried him outside the cave and gave him a handful of pebbles to play with but still the baby cried  then the cat put out his paddy paw and patted the baby on the cheek and it cooed and the cat rubbed against its fat knees and tickled it under its fat chin with his tail and the baby laughed and the woman heard him and smiled  then the batthe little upsidedown batthat hung in the mouth of the cave said o my hostess and wife of my host and mother of my hosts son a wild thing from the wild woods is most beautifully playing with your baby  a blessing on that wild thing whoever he may be said the woman straightening her back for i was a busy woman this morning and he has done me a service  that very minute and second best beloved the dried horseskin curtain that was stretched taildown at the mouth of the cave fell downwhooshbecause it remembered the bargain she had made with the cat and when the woman went to pick it uplo and beholdthe cat was sitting quite comfy inside the cave  o my enemy and wife of my enemy and mother of my enemy said the cat it is i for you have spoken a word in my praise and now i can sit within the cave for always and always and always but still i am the cat who walks by himself and all places are alike to me  the woman was very angry and shut her lips tight and took up her spinningwheel and began to spin but the baby cried because the cat had gone away and the woman could not hush it for it struggled and kicked and grew black in the face  o my enemy and wife of my enemy and mother of my enemy said the cat take a strand of the wire that you are spinning and tie it to your spinningwhorl and drag it along the floor and i will show you a magic that shall make your baby laugh as loudly as he is now crying  i will do so said the woman because i am at my wits end but i will not thank you for it  she tied the thread to the little clay spindle whorl and drew it across the floor and the cat ran after it and patted it with his paws and rolled head over heels and tossed it backward over his shoulder and chased it between his hindlegs and pretended to lose it and pounced down upon it again till the baby laughed as loudly as it had been crying and scrambled after the cat and frolicked all over the cave till it grew tired and settled down to sleep with the cat in its arms  now said the cat i will sing the baby a song that shall keep him asleep for an hour and he began to purr loud and low low and loud till the baby fell fast asleep the woman smiled as she looked down upon the two of them and said that was wonderfully done no question but you are very clever o cat  that very minute and second best beloved the smoke of the fire at the back of the cave came down in clouds from the roofpuffbecause it remembered the bargain she had made with the cat and when it had cleared awaylo and beholdthe cat was sitting quite comfy close to the fire  o my enemy and wife of my enemy and mother of my enemy said the cat it is i for you have spoken a second word in my praise and now i can sit by the warm fire at the back of the cave for always and always and always but still i am the cat who walks by himself and all places are alike to me  then the woman was very very angry and let down her hair and put more wood on the fire and brought out the broad bladebone of the shoulder of mutton and began to make a magic that should prevent her from saying a third word in praise of the cat it was not a singing magic best beloved it was a still magic and by and by the cave grew so still that a little weewee mouse crept out of a corner and ran across the floor  o my enemy and wife of my enemy and mother of my enemy said the cat is that little mouse part of your magic  ouh chee no indeed said the woman and she dropped the bladebone and jumped upon the footstool in front of the fire and braided up her hair very quick for fear that the mouse should run up it  ah said the cat watching then the mouse will do me no harm if i eat it  no said the woman braiding up her hair eat it quickly and i will ever be grateful to you  cat made one jump and caught the little mouse and the woman said a hundred thanks even the first friend is not quick enough to catch little mice as you have done you must be very wise  that very moment and second o best beloved the milkpot that stood by the fire cracked in two piecesffftbecause it remembered the bargain she had made with the cat and when the woman jumped down from the footstoollo and beholdthe cat was lapping up the warm white milk that lay in one of the broken pieces  o my enemy and wife of my enemy and mother of my enemy said the cat it is i for you have spoken three words in my praise and now i can drink the warm white milk three times a day for always and always and always but still i am the cat who walks by himself and all places are alike to me  then the woman laughed and set the cat a bowl of the warm white milk and said o cat you are as clever as a man but remember that your bargain was not made with the man or the dog and i do not know what they will do when they come home  what is that to me said the cat if i have my place in the cave by the fire and my warm white milk three times a day i do not care what the man or the dog can do  that evening when the man and the dog came into the cave the woman told them all the story of the bargain while the cat sat by the fire and smiled then the man said yes but he has not made a bargain with me or with all proper men after me then he took off his two leather boots and he took up his little stone axe that makes three and he fetched a piece of wood and a hatchet that is five altogether and he set them out in a row and he said now we will make our bargain if you do not catch mice when you are in the cave for always and always and always i will throw these five things at you whenever i see you and so shall all proper men do after me  ah said the woman listening this is a very clever cat but he is not so clever as my man  the cat counted the five things and they looked very knobby and he said i will catch mice when i am in the cave for always and always and always but still i am the cat who walks by himself and all places are alike to me  not when i am near said the man if you had not said that last i would have put all these things away for always and always and always but i am now going to throw my two boots and my little stone axe that makes three at you whenever i meet you and so shall all proper men do after me  then the dog said wait a minute he has not made a bargain with me or with all proper dogs after me and he showed his teeth and said if you are not kind to the baby while i am in the cave for always and always and always i will hunt you till i catch you and when i catch you i will bite you and so shall all proper dogs do after me  ah said the woman listening this is a very clever cat but he is not so clever as the dog  cat counted the dogs teeth and they looked very pointed and he said i will be kind to the baby while i am in the cave as long as he does not pull my tail too hard for always and always and always but still i am the cat that walks by himself and all places are alike to me  not when i am near said the dog if you had not said that last i would have shut my mouth for always and always and always but now i am going to hunt you up a tree whenever i meet you and so shall all proper dogs do after me  then the man threw his two boots and his little stone axe that makes three at the cat and the cat ran out of the cave and the dog chased him up a tree and from that day to this best beloved three proper men out of five will always throw things at a cat whenever they meet him and all proper dogs will chase him up a tree but the cat keeps his side of the bargain too he will kill mice and he will be kind to babies when he is in the house just as long as they do not pull his tail too hard but when he has done that and between times and when the moon gets up and night comes he is the cat that walks by himself and all places are alike to him then he goes out to the wet wild woods or up the wet wild trees or on the wet wild roofs waving his wild tail and walking by his wild lone        pussy can sit by the fire and sing        pussy can climb a tree      or play with a silly old cork and string        tomuse herself not me      but i like binkie my dog because        he lnows how to behave      so binkies the same as the first friend was        and i am the man in the cave       pussy will play manfriday till        its time to wet her paw      and make her walk on the windowsill        for the footprint crusoe saw      then she fluffles her tail and mews        and scratches and wont attend      but binkie will play whatever i choose        and he is my true first friend       pussy will rub my knees with her head        pretending she loves me hard      but the very minute i go to my bed        pussy runs out in the yard      and there she stays till the morninglight        so i know it is only pretend      but binkie he snores at my feet all night        and he is my firstest friend     the butterfly that stamped  this o my best beloved is a storya new and a wonderful storya story quite different from the other storiesa story about the most wise sovereign suleimanbindaoudsolomon the son of david  there are three hundred and fiftyfive stories about suleimanbindaoud but this is not one of them it is not the story of the lapwing who found the water or the hoopoe who shaded suleimanbindaoud from the heat it is not the story of the glass pavement or the ruby with the crooked hole or the gold bars of balkis it is the story of the butterfly that stamped  now attend all over again and listen  suleimanbindaoud was wise he understood what the beasts said what the birds said what the fishes said and what the insects said he understood what the rocks said deep under the earth when they bowed in towards each other and groaned and he understood what the trees said when they rustled in the middle of the morning he understood everything from the bishop on the bench to the hyssop on the wall and balkis his head queen the most beautiful queen balkis was nearly as wise as he was  suleimanbindaoud was strong upon the third finger of the right hand he wore a ring when he turned it once afrits and djinns came out of the earth to do whatever he told them when he turned it twice fairies came down from the sky to do whatever he told them and when he turned it three times the very great angel azrael of the sword came dressed as a watercarrier and told him the news of the three worlds abovebelowand here  and yet suleimanbindaoud was not proud he very seldom showed off and when he did he was sorry for it once he tried to feed all the animals in all the world in one day but when the food was ready an animal came out of the deep sea and ate it up in three mouthfuls suleimanbindaoud was very surprised and said o animal who are you and the animal said o king live for ever i am the smallest of thirty thousand brothers and our home is at the bottom of the sea we heard that you were going to feed all the animals in all the world and my brothers sent me to ask when dinner would be ready suleimanbindaoud was more surprised than ever and said o animal you have eaten all the dinner that i made ready for all the animals in the world and the animal said o king live for ever but do you really call that a dinner where i come from we each eat twice as much as that between meals then suleimanbindaoud fell flat on his face and said o animal i gave that dinner to show what a great and rich king i was and not because i really wanted to be kind to the animals now i am ashamed and it serves me right suleimanbindaoud was a really truly wise man best beloved after that he never forgot that it was silly to show off and now the real story part of my story begins  he married ever so many wifes he married nine hundred and ninetynine wives besides the most beautiful balkis and they all lived in a great golden palace in the middle of a lovely garden with fountains he didnt really want ninehundred and ninetynine wives but in those days everybody married ever so many wives and of course the king had to marry ever so many more just to show that he was the king  some of the wives were nice but some were simply horrid and the horrid ones quarrelled with the nice ones and made them horrid too and then they would all quarrel with suleimanbindaoud and that was horrid for him but balkis the most beautiful never quarrelled with suleimanbindaoud she loved him too much she sat in her rooms in the golden palace or walked in the palace garden and was truly sorry for him  of course if he had chosen to turn his ring on his finger and call up the djinns and the afrits they would have magicked all those nine hundred and ninetynine quarrelsome wives into white mules of the desert or greyhounds or pomegranate seeds but suleimanbindaoud thought that that would be showing off so when they quarrelled too much he only walked by himself in one part of the beautiful palace gardens and wished he had never been born  one day when they had quarrelled for three weeksall nine hundred and ninetynine wives togethersuleimanbindaoud went out for peace and quiet as usual and among the orange trees he met balkis the most beautiful very sorrowful because suleimanbindaoud was so worried and she said to him o my lord and light of my eyes turn the ring upon your finger and show these queens of egypt and mesopotamia and persia and china that you are the great and terrible king but suleimanbindaoud shook his head and said o my lady and delight of my life remember the animal that came out of the sea and made me ashamed before all the animals in all the world because i showed off now if i showed off before these queens of persia and egypt and abyssinia and china merely because they worry me i might be made even more ashamed than i have been  and balkis the most beautiful said o my lord and treasure of my soul what will you do  and suleimanbindaoud said o my lady and content of my heart i shall continue to endure my fate at the hands of these nine hundred and ninetynine queens who vex me with their continual quarrelling  so he went on between the lilies and the loquats and the roses and the cannas and the heavyscented gingerplants that grew in the garden till he came to the great camphortree that was called the camphor tree of suleimanbindaoud but balkis hid among the tall irises and the spotted bamboos and the red lillies behind the camphortree so as to be near her own true love suleimanbindaoud  presently two butterflies flew under the tree quarrelling  suleimanbindaoud heard one say to the other i wonder at your presumption in talking like this to me dont you know that if i stamped with my foot all suleimanbindaouds palace and this garden here would immediately vanish in a clap of thunder  then suleimanbindaoud forgot his nine hundred and ninetynine bothersome wives and laughed till the camphortree shook at the butterflys boast and he held out his finger and said little man come here  the butterfly was dreadfully frightened but he managed to fly up to the hand of suleimanbindaoud and clung there fanning himself suleimanbindaoud bent his head and whispered very softly little man you know that all your stamping wouldnt bend one blade of grass what made you tell that awful fib to your wifefor doubtless she is your wife  the butterfly looked at suleimanbindaoud and saw the most wise kings eye twinkle like stars on a frosty night and he picked up his courage with both wings and he put his head on one side and said o king live for ever she is my wife and you know what wives are like  suleimanbindaoud smiled in his beard and said yes i know little brother  one must keep them in order somehow said the butterfly and she has been quarrelling with me all the morning i said that to quiet her  and suleimanbindaoud said may it quiet her go back to your wife little brother and let me hear what you say  back flew the butterfly to his wife who was all of a twitter behind a leaf and she said he heard you suleimanbindaoud himself heard you  heard me said the butterfly of course he did i meant him to hear me  and what did he say oh what did he say  well said the butterfly fanning himself most importantly between you and me my dearof course i dont blame him because his palace must have cost a great deal and the oranges are just ripeninghe asked me not to stamp and i promised i wouldnt  gracious said his wife and sat quite quiet but suleimanbindaoud laughed till the tears ran down his face at the impudence of the bad little butterfly  balkis the most beautiful stood up behind the tree among the red lilies and smiled to herself for she had heard all this talk she thought if i am wise i can yet save my lord from the persecutions of these quarrelsome queens and she held out her finger and whispered softly to the butterflys wife little woman come here up flew the butterflys wife very frightened and clung to balkiss white hand  balkis bent her beautiful head down and whispered little woman do you believe what your husband has just said  the butterflys wife looked at balkis and saw the most beautiful queens eyes shining like deep pools with starlight on them and she picked up her courage with both wings and said o queen be lovely for ever you know what menfolk are like  and the queen balkis the wise balkis of sheba put her hand to her lips to hide a smile and said little sister i know  they get angry said the butterflys wife fanning herself quickly over nothing at all but we must humour them o queen they never mean half they say if it pleases my husband to believe that i believe he can make suleimanbindaouds palace disappear by stamping his foot im sure i dont care hell forget all about it tomorrow  little sister said balkis you are quite right but next time he begins to boast take him at his word ask him to stamp and see what will happen we know what menfolk are like dont we hell be very much ashamed  away flew the butterflys wife to her husband and in five minutes they were quarrelling worse than ever  remember said the butterfly remember what i can do if i stamp my foot  i dont believe you one little bit said the butterflys wife i should very much like to see it done suppose you stamp now  i promised suleimanbindaoud that i wouldnt said the butterfly and i dont want to break my promise  it wouldnt matter if you did said his wife you couldnt bend a blade of grass with your stamping i dare you to do it she said stamp stamp stamp  suleimanbindaoud sitting under the camphortree heard every word of this and he laughed as he had never laughed in his life before he forgot all about his queens he forgot all about the animal that came out of the sea he forgot about showing off he just laughed with joy and balkis on the other side of the tree smiled because her own true love was so joyful  presently the butterfly very hot and puffy came whirling back under the shadow of the camphortree and said to suleiman she wants me to stamp she wants to see what will happen o suleimanbindaoud you know i cant do it and now shell never believe a word i say shell laugh at me to the end of my days  no little brother said suleimanbindaoud she will never laugh at you again and he turned the ring on his fingerjust for the little butterflys sake not for the sake of showing offand lo and behold four huge djinns came out of the earth  slaves said suleimanbindaoud when this gentleman on my finger that was where the impudent butterfly was sitting stamps his left front forefoot you will make my palace and these gardens disappear in a clap of thunder when he stamps again you will bring them back carefully  now little brother he said go back to your wife and stamp all youve a mind to  away flew the butterfly to his wife who was crying i dare you to do it i dare you to do it stamp stamp now stamp balkis saw the four vast djinns stoop down to the four corners of the gardens with the palace in the middle and she clapped her hands softly and said at last suleimanbindaoud will do for the sake of a butterfly what he ought to have done long ago for his own sake and the quarrelsome queens will be frightened  the the butterfly stamped the djinns jerked the palace and the gardens a thousand miles into the air there was a most awful thunderclap and everything grew inkyblack the butterflys wife fluttered about in the dark crying oh ill be good im so sorry i spoke only bring the gardens back my dear darling husband and ill never contradict again  the butterfly was nearly as frightened as his wife and suleimanbindaoud laughed so much that it was several minutes before he found breath enough to whisper to the butterfly stamp again little brother give me back my palace most great magician  yes give him back his palace said the butterflys wife still flying about in the dark like a moth give him back his palace and dont lets have any more horridmagic  well my dear said the butterfly as bravely as he could you see what your nagging has led to of course it doesnt make any difference to meim used to this kind of thingbut as a favour to you and to suleimanbindaoud i dont mind putting things right  so he stamped once more and that instant the djinns let down the palace and the gardens without even a bump the sun shone on the darkgreen orange leaves the fountains played among the pink egyptian lilies the birds went on singing and the butterflys wife lay on her side under the camphortree waggling her wings and panting oh ill be good ill be good  suleimanbindaolld could hardly speak for laughing he leaned back all weak and hiccoughy and shook his finger at the butterfly and said o great wizard what is the sense of returning to me my palace if at the same time you slay me with mirth  then came a terrible noise for all the nine hundred and ninetynine queens ran out of the palace shrieking and shouting and calling for their babies they hurried down the great marble steps below the fountain one hundred abreast and the most wise balkis went statelily forward to meet them and said what is your trouble o queens  they stood on the marble steps one hundred abreast and shouted what is our trouble we were living peacefully in our golden palace as is our custom when upon a sudden the palace disappeared and we were left sitting in a thick and noisome darkness and it thundered and djinns and afrits moved about in the darkness that is our trouble o head queen and we are most extremely troubled on account of that trouble for it was a troublesome trouble unlike any trouble we have known  then balkis the most beautiful queensuleimanbindaouds very best belovedqueen that was of sheba and sable and the rivers of the gold of the southfrom the desert of zinn to the towers of zimbabwebalkis almost as wise as the most wise suleimanbindaoud himself said it is nothing o queens a butterfly has made complaint against his wife because she quarrelled with him and it has pleased our lord suleimanbindaoud to teach her a lesson in lowspeaking and humbleness for that is counted a virtue among the wives of the butterflies  then up and spoke an egyptian queenthe daughter of a pharoahand she said our palace cannot be plucked up by the roots like a leek for the sake of a little insect no suleimanbindaoud must be dead and what we heard and saw was the earth thundering and darkening at the news  then balkis beckoned that bold queen without looking at her and said to her and to the others come and see  they came down the marble steps one hundred abreast and beneath his camphortree still weak with laughing they saw the most wise king suleimanbindaoud rocking back and forth with a butterfly on either hand and they heard him say o wife of my brother in the air remember after this to please your husband in all things lest he be provoked to stamp his foot yet again for he has said that he is used to this magic and he is most eminently a great magicianone who steals away the very palace of suleirnanbindaoud himself go in peace little folk and he kissed them on the wings and they flew away  then all the queens except balkisthe most beautiful and splendid balkis who stood apart smilingfell flat on their faces for they said if these things are done when a butterfly is displeased with his wife what shall be done to us who have vexed our king with our loudspeaking and open quarrelling through many days  then they put their veils over their heads and they put their hands over their mouths and they tiptoed back to the palace most mousyquiet  then balkisthe most beautiful and excellent balkiswent forward through the red lilies into the shade of the camphortree and laid her hand upon suleimanbindaouds shoulder and said o my lord and treasure of my soul rejoice for we have taught the queens of egypt and ethiopia and abyssinia and persia and india and china with a great and a memorable teaching  and suleimanbindaoud still looking after the butterflies where they played in the sunlight said o my lady and jewel of my felicity when did this happen for i have been jesting with a butterfly ever since i came into the garden and he told balkis what he had done  balkisthe tender and most lovely balkissaid o my lord and regent of my existence i hid behind the camphortree and saw it all it was i who told the butterflys wife to ask the butterfly to stamp because i hoped that for the sake of the jest my lord would make some great magic and that the queens would see it and be frightened and she told him what the queens had said and seen and thought  then suleimanbindaoud rose up from his seat under the camphortree and stretched his arms and rejoiced and said o my lady and sweetener of my days know that if i had made a magic against my queens for the sake of pride or anger as i made that feast for all the animals i should certainly have been put to shame but by means of your wisdom i made the magic for the sake of a jest and for the sake of a little butterfly andbeholdit has also delivered me from the vexations of my vexatious wives tell me therefore o my lady and heart of my heart how did you come to be so wise and balkis the queen beautiful and tall looked up into suleimanbindaouds eyes and put her head a little on one side just like the butterfly and said first o my lord because i loved you and secondly o my lord because i know what womenfolk are  then they went up to the palace and lived happily ever afterwards  but wasnt it clever of balkis        there was never a queen like balkis        from here to the wide worlds end      but balkis tailed to a butterfly        as you would talk to a friend       there was never a king like solomon        not since the world began      but solomon talked to a butterfly        as a man would talk to a man       she was queen of sabaea        and he was asias lord      but they both of em talked to butterflies        when they took their walks abroad
