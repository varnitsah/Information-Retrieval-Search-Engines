book one    chapter i introducing mr peter ruff   there was nothing about the supper party on that particular sunday evening in november at daisy villa green street streatham which seemed to indicate in any way that one of the most interesting careers connected with the world history of crime was to owe its very existence to the disaster which befell that little gathering the villa was the residence and alsoto his creditthe unmortgaged property of mr david barnes a struggling but fairly prosperous coal merchant of excellent character some means and methodist proclivities his habit of sitting without his coat when carving although deprecated by his wife and daughter on account of the genteel aspirations of the latter was a not unusual one in the neighbourhood and coupled with the proximity of a cold joint of beef his seat at the head of the table and a carving knife and fork grasped in his hands established clearly the fact of his position in the household which a somewhat weak physiognomy might otherwise have led the casual observer to doubt opposite him at the other end of the table sat his wife mrs barnes a somewhat voluminous lady with a high colour a black satin frock and many ornaments on her left the son of the house eighteen years old of moderate stature somewhat pimply with the fashion of the moment reflected in his pink tie with white spots drawn through a gold ring and curving outwards to seek obscurity underneath a dazzling waistcoat a white tuberose in his buttonhole might have been intended as a sort of compliment to the occasion or an indication of his intention to take a walk after supper in the fashionable purlieus of the neighbourhood facing him sat his sistera fluffyhaired blueeyed young lady pretty in her way but chiefly noticeable for a peculiar sort of selfconsciousness blended with selfsatisfaction and possessed only at a certain period in their lives by young ladies of her age it was almost the air of the cat in whose interior reposes the missing canary except that in this instance the canary obviously existed in the person of the young man who sat at her side introduced formally to the household for the first time that young mans name wasat the momentmr spencer fitzgerald  it seems idle to attempt any description of a person who in the past had secured a certain amount of fame under a varying personality and who in the future was to become more than ever notorious under a far less aristocratic pseudonym than that by which he was at present known to the inhabitants of daisy villa there are photographs of him in new york and paris st petersburg and chicago vienna and cape town but there are no two pictures which present to the casual observer the slightest likeness to one another to allude to him by the name under which he had won some part at least of the affections of miss maud barnes mr spencer fitzgerald as he sat there a suitor on probation for her hand was a young man of modest and genteel appearance he wore a blue serge suita little underdressed for the occasion perhaps but his tie and collar were neat his goldrimmed spectaclesif a little disapproved of by maud on account of the air of steadiness which they impartedsuggested excellent soninlawlike qualities to mr and mrs barnes he had the promise of a fair moustache but his complexion generally was colourless his features except for a certain regularity were undistinguished his speech was modest and correct his manner varied with his company tonight it had been pronounced by excellent judgesgenteel  the conversation consistednaturally enough under the circumstancesof a course of subtle and judicious pumping tactfully prompted for the most part by mrs barnes such for instance as the following  talking about marie corellis new book reminds me mr fitzgeraldyour occupation is connected with books is it not his prospective motherinlaw enquired artlessly  mr fitzgerald bowed assent  i am cashier at howell  wilsons in cheapside he said we sell a great many books thereas many i should think as any retail establishment in london  indeed mrs barnes purred very interesting work i am sure so nice and intellectual too for of course you must be looking inside them sometimes  i know the place well mr adolphus barnes junior announced condescendinglypass it every day on my way to lunch  so much nicer mrs barnes continued than any of the ordinary businessesgrocery or drapery or anything of that sort  miss maud elevated her eyebrows slightly was it likely that she would have looked with eyes of favour upon a young man engaged in any of these inferior occupations  theres money in books too mr barnes declared with sudden inspiration his prospective soninlaw turned towards him deferentially  you are right sir he admitted there is money in them theres money for those who write and theres money for those who sell my occupation he continued with a modest little cough brings me often into touch with publishers travellers and clerks so i am as it were behind the scenes to some extent i can assure you he continued looking from mr barnes to his wife and finally transfixing mr adolphusi can assure you that the money paid by some firms of publishers to a few wellknown authorsi will mention no namesas advances against royalties is something stupendous  ah mr barnes murmured solemnly shaking his head  marie corelli i expect and that hall caine remarked young adolphus  seems easy enough to write a book too mrs barnes said why i declare that some of those we get from the librarywe subscribe to a library mr fitzgeraldare just as simple and straightforward that a child might have written them no plot whatsoever no murders or mysteries or anything of that sortjust stories about people like ourselves i dont see how they can pay people for writing stories about people just like those one meets every day  i always say maud intervened that spencer means to write a book some day he has quite the literary air hasnt he mother  indeed he has mrs barnes declared with an appreciative glance at the goldrimmed spectacles  mr fitzgerald modestly disclaimed any literary aspirations  the thing is a gift after all he declared generously i can keep accounts and earn a fair salary at it but if i attempted fiction i should soon be up a tree  mr barnes nodded his approval of such sentiments  every one to his trade i say he remarked what sort of salaries do they pay now in the book trade he asked guilelessly  very fair mr fitzgerald admitted candidlyvery fair indeed  when i was your age mr barnes said reflectively i was gettinglet me seefortytwo shillings a week pretty good pay too for those days  mr fitzgerald admitted the fact  of course he said apologetically salaries are a little higher now all round mr howell has been very kind to mein fact i have had two raises this year i am getting four pounds ten now  four pounds ten per week mrs barnes exclaimed laying down her knife and fork  certainly mr fitzgerald answered after christmas i have some reason to believe that it may be five pounds  mr barnes whistled softly and looked at the young man with a new respect  i told you thatmrthat spencer was doing pretty well mother maud simpered looking down at her plate  any one to support her father asked transferring a pickle from the fork to his mouth  no one mr fitzgerald answered in fact i may say that i have some small expectations i havent done badly either out of the few investments i have made from time to time  saved a bit of money eh mr barnes enquired genially  i have a matter of four hundred pounds put by mr fitzgerald admitted modestly besides a few sticks of furniture i never cared much about lodginghouse things so i furnished a couple of rooms myself some time ago  mrs barnes rose slowly to her feet  you are quite sure you wont have a small piece more of beef she enquired anxiously  just a morsel mr barnes asked tapping the joint insinuatingly with his carving knife  no i thank you mr fitzgerald declared firmly i have done excellently  then if you will put the joint on the sideboard adolphus mrs barnes directed maud and i will change the plates we always let the girl go out on sundays mr fitzgerald she explained turning to their guest its very awkward of course but they seem to expect it  quite natural im sure mr fitzgerald murmured watching mauds light movements with admiring eyes i like to see ladies interested in domestic work  theres one thing i will say for maud her proud mother declared plumping down a dish of jelly upon the table she does know whats what in keeping house and even if she hasnt to scrape and save as i did when david and i were first married economy is a great thing when youre young i have always said so and i stick to it  quite right mother mr barnes declared  if instead of sitting there mrs barnes continued in high good humour you were to get a bottle of that port wine out of the cellarette we might drink mr fitzgeralds health being as its his first visit  mr barnes rose to his feet with alacrity for a woman with sound ideas he declared commend me to your mother  maud having finished her duties resumed her place by the side of the guest of the evening their hands met under the tablecloth for a moment to the girl the pleasure of such a proceeding was natural enough but fitzgerald asked himself for the fiftieth time why on earth he who notwithstanding his present modest exterior was a young man of some experience should from such primitive lovemaking derive a rapture which nothing else in life afforded him he was at that moment content with his futurea future which he had absolutely and finally decided upon he was content with his fatherinlaw and his motherinlaw with daisy villa and the prospect of a daisy villa for himselfcontent even with adolphus but for mr spencer fitzgerald these things were not to be the awakening was even then at hand  the dining room of daisy villa fronted the street and was removed from it only a few feet consequently the footsteps of passersby upon the flagged pavement were clearly distinguishable it was just at the moment when mrs barnes was inserting a few fresh almonds into a somewhat precarious tipsy cake and mr barnes was engaged with the decanting of the port that two pairs of footsteps considerably heavier than those of the ordinary promenader paused outside and finally stopped the gate creaked mr barnes looked up  hullo he exclaimed whats that visitors  they all listened the frontdoor bell rang adolphus in response to a gesture from his mother rose sulkily to his feet  job i hate he muttered as he left the room  the rest of the family full of the small curiosity of people of their class were intent upon listening for voices outside the demeanour of mr spencer fitzgerald therefore escaped their notice it is doubtful in any case whether their perceptions would have been sufficiently keen to have enabled them to trace the workings of emotion in the countenance of a person so magnificently endowed by providence with the art of subterfuge mr spencer fitzgerald seemed simply to have stiffened in acute and earnest attention it was only for a moment that he hesitated his unfailing inspiration told him the truth  his course of action was simplehe rose to his feet and strolled to the window  some people who have lost their way in the fog perhaps he remarked what a night  he laid his hand upon the sashsimultaneously there was a rush of cold air into the room a halfangry halffrightened exclamation from adolphus in the passage a scream from miss maudand no mr spencer fitzgerald no one had time to be more than blankly astonished the door was opened and a police inspector in very nice dark braided uniform and a peaked cap stood in the doorway  mr barnes dropped the port and mrs barnes emulating her daughters example screamed the inspector as though conscious of the draught moved rapidly toward the window  you had a visitor here mr barnes he said quicklya mr spencer fitzgerald where is he  there was no one who could answer mr barnes was speechless between the shock of the spilt port and the appearance of a couple of uniformed policemen in his dining room john dory the detective he knew well enough in his private capacity but in his uniform and attended by policemen he presented a new and startling appearance mrs barnes was in hysterics and maud was gazing like a creature turned to stone at the open window through which little puffs of fog were already drifting into the room adolphus with an air of bewilderment was standing with his mouth and eyes wider open than they had ever been in his life and as for the honoured guest of these admirable inhabitants of daisy villa there was not the slightest doubt but that mr spencer fitzgerald had disappeared through the window   fitzgeralds expedition was nearly at an end soon he paused crossed the road to a block of flats ascended to the eighth floor by an automatic lift and rang the bell at a door which bore simply the number ii a trim parlourmaid opened it after a few minutes delay  is miss emerson at home he asked  miss emerson is in the maid admitted with some hesitation but i am not sure that she will see any one tonight  i have a message for her fitzgerald said  will you give me your name sir please the maid asked  an inner door was suddenly opened a slim girl looking taller than she really was by reason of the rug upon which she stood looked out into the halla girl with masses of brown hair loosely coiled on her head with pale face and strange eyes she opened her lips as though to call to her visitor by name and as suddenly closed them again there was not much expression in her face but there was enough to show that his visit was not unwelcome  you she exclaimed come in please come in at once  fitzgerald obeyed the invitation of the girl whom he had come to visit she had retreated a little into the room but the door was no sooner closed than she held out her hands  peter she exclaimed peter you have come to me at last  her lips were a little parted her eyes were bright with pleasure her whole expression was one of absolute delight fitzgerald frowned as though he found her welcome a little too enthusiastic for his taste  violet he said please dont look at me as though i were a prodigal sheep if you do i shall be sorry that i came  her hands fell to her side the pleasure died out of her faceonly her eyes still questioned him fitzgerald carefully laid his hat on a vacant chair  something has happened she said tell me that all that madness is overthat you are yourself again  so far as regards my engagement with messrs howell  wilson he said despondently you are right as regardsmiss barnes there has been no direct misunderstanding between us but i am afraid for the present that i must consider thatwell in abeyance  that is something she exclaimed drawing a little breath of relief sit down peter will you have something to eat i finished dinner an hour ago but  thank you fitzgerald interrupted i suppedextremely well in streatham  in streatham she repeated why how did you get there the fog is awful  fogs do not trouble me fitzgerald answered i walked i could have done it as well blindfold i will take a whisky and soda if i may  she led him to an easychair  i will mix it myself she said  without being remarkably goodlooking she was certainly a pleasant and attractivelooking young woman her cheeks were a little pale her hairperfectly naturalwas a wonderful deep shade of soft brown her eyes were long and narrowalmost oriental in shapeand they seemed in some queer way to match the room he could have sworn that in the firelight they flashed green her body and limbs notwithstanding her extreme slightness were graceful perhaps but with the grace of the tigress she wore a green silk dressing jacket pulled together with a belt of lizard skin and her neck was bare her skirt was of some thin black material she was obviously in deshabille and yet there was something neat and trim about the smaller details of her toilette  go on please peter she begged you are keeping me in suspense  there isnt much to tell he answered its overthats all  she drew a sharp breath through her teeth  you are not going to marry that girlthat bourgeois doll in streatham  fitzgerald sat up in his chair  look here he said seriously dont you call her names if im not going to marry her it isnt my fault she is the only girl i have ever wanted and probablymost probablyshe will be the only one i ever shall want thats honest isnt it  the girl winced  yes she said it is honest  i should have married her the young man continued and i should have been happy i had my eye on a villanot too near her parentsand i saw my way to a little increase of salary i should have taken to gardening to walks in the park with an occasional theatre and i should have thoroughly enjoyed a fortnight every summer at skegness or suttononsea we should have saved a little money i should have gone to church regularly and if possible i should have filled some minor public offices you may call this bourgeoisit was my idea of happiness  was she murmured  is still he declared sharply but i shall never attain to it tonight i had to leave maudto leave the supper table of daisy villathrough the window  she looked at him in amazement  the police he explained that brute dory was at the bottom of it  but surely she murmured you told me that you had a bonafide situation  so i had he declared and i was a fool not to be content with it it was my habit of taking long country walks and their rotten auditing which undid me you understand that this was all before i met maud since the day i spoke to her i turned over a new leaf i have left the night work alone and i repaid every penny of the firms money which they could ever have possibly found out about there was only that one little affair of mine down at sudbury  tell me what you are going to do she whispered  i have no alternative he answered the law has kicked me out from the respectable places the law shall pay  she looked at him with glowing eyes  have you any plans she asked softly  i have he answered i have considered the subject from a good many points of view and i have decided to start in business for myself as a private detective  she raised her eyebrows  my dear peter she murmured couldnt you be a little more original  that is only what i am going to call myself he answered i may tell you that i am going to strike out on somewhat new lines  please explain she begged  he recrossed his knees and made himself a little more comfortable  the weak part of every great robbery however successful he began is the great wastage in value which invariably results for jewels which costsay five thousand pounds and to procure which the artist has to risk his life as well as his liberty he has to consider himself lucky if he clears eight hundred for the hermitage rubies for instance where i nearly had to shoot a man dead i realized rather less than four hundred pounds it doesnt pay  go on she begged  i am not clear he continued how far this class of business will attract me at all but i do not propose in any case to enter into any transactions on my own account i shall work for other people and for cash down your experience of life violet has been fairly large have you not sometimes come into contact with people driven into a situation from which they would willingly commit any crime to escape if they dared it is not with them a question of money at allit is simply a matter of ignorance they do not know how to commit a crime they have had no experience and if they attempt it they know perfectly well that they are likely to blunder a person thoroughly experienced in the ways of criminalsa person of genius like myselfwould have without a doubt an immense clientele if only he dared put up his signboard literally i cannot do that actually i mean to do so i shall be willing to accept contracts either to help nervous people out of an undesirable crisis or on the other hand to measure my wits against the wits of scotland yard and to discover the criminals whom they have failed to secure i shall make my own bargains and i shall be paid in cash i shall take on nothing that i am not certain about  but your clients she asked curiously how will you come into contact with them  he smiled  i am not afraid of business being slack he said the world is full of fools  you cannot live outside the law peter she objected you are clever i know but they are not all fools at scotland yard  you forget he reminded her that there will be a perfectly legitimate side to my profession the other sort of case i shall only accept if i can see my way clear to make a success of it needless to say i shall have to refuse the majority that are offered to me  she came a little nearer to him  in any case she said with a little sigh you have given up that foolish bourgeois life of yours  he looked down into her face and his eyes were cold  violet he said this is no time for misunderstandings i should like you to know that apart from one young lady who possesses my whole affection  all of it she pleaded  all he declared emphatically she will doubtless be faithless to meunder the circumstances i cannot blame herbut so far as i am concerned i have no affection whatever for any one else  she crept back to her place  i could be so useful to you she murmured  you could and you shall if you will be sensible he answered  tell me how she begged  he was silent for a moment  are you acting now he asked  i am understudying molly she answered and i have a very small part at the globe  he nodded  there is no reason to interfere with that he said in fact i wish you to continue your connection with the profession it brings you into touch with the class of people among whom i am likely to find clients  go on please she begged  on two conditionsor rather one he said you can if you like become my secretary and partnerand find the money we shall require to make a start  conditions she asked  you must understand once and for all he said that i will not be made love to and that i can treat you only as a working companion my name will be peter ruff and yours miss brown you will have to dress like a secretary and behave like one sometimes there will be plenty of work for you and sometimes there will be none at all sometimes you will be bored to death and sometimes there will be excitement i do not wish to make you vain but i may add especially as you are aware of my personal feelings toward you that you are the only person in the world to whom i would make this offer  she sighed gently  tell me peter she asked when do you mean to start this new enterprise  not for six monthsperhaps a year he answered i must go to parisperhaps vienna i might even have to go to new york there are certain associations with which i must come into touchcertain information i must become possessed of  peter she said i like your scheme but there is just one thing such men as you should be the brains of great enterprises dont you understand what i mean it shouldnt be you who does the actual thing which brings you within the power of the law i am not overscrupulous you know i hate wrongdoing but i have never been able to treat as equal criminals the poor man who steals for a living and the rich financier who robs right and left out of sheer greed i agree with you that crime is not an absolute thing the circumstances connected with every action in life determine its morality or immorality but peter it isnt worth while to go outside the law  he nodded  you are a sensible girl he said i have always thought that well talk over my cases together if they seem to run a little too close to the line  very well peter she said i accept    chapter ii a new career   about twelve months after the interrupted festivities at daisy villa that particular neighbourhood was again the scene of some rejoicing standing before the residence of mr barnes were three carriages drawn in each case by a pair of grey horses the coachmen and their steeds were similarly adorned with white rosettes it would have been an insult to the intelligence of the most youthful of the loungersby to have informed them that a wedding was projected  at the neighbouring church all was ready the clerk stood at the door the red drugget was down the usual little crowd were standing all agog upon the pavement there was one unusual feature of the proceedings instead of a solitary policeman there were at least a dozen who kept clear the entrance to the church their presence greatly puzzled a little old gentleman who had joined the throng of sightseers he pushed himself to the front and touched one of them upon the shoulder  mr policeman he said will you tell me why there are so many of you to keep such a small crowd in order  bridegrooms a member of the force sir for one reason the man answered goodhumouredly  and the other the old gentleman persisted  the policeman behaved as though he had not hearda proceeding which his natural stolidity rendered easy the little old gentleman however was not so easily put off he tapped the man once more upon the shoulder  and the other reason mr policeman he asked insinuatingly  not allowed to talk about that sir was the somewhat gruff reply  the little old gentleman moved away a trifle hurt he was a very nicely dressed old gentleman indeed and everything about him seemed to savour of prosperity but he was certainly garrulous an obviously invited guest was standing upon the edge of the pavement stroking a pair of lavender kid gloves the little old gentleman sidled up to him  i beg your pardon sir he said raising his hat i am just back from australiahavent seen a wedding in england for fifty years do you think that they would let me into the church  the invited guest looked down at his questioner and approved of him furthermore he seemed exceedingly glad to be interrupted in his somewhat nervous task of waiting for the wedding party  certainly sir he replied cheerfully come along in with me and ill find you a seat  down the scarlet drugget they wentthe big best man with the red hands and the lavender kid gloves and the opulentlooking old gentleman with the goldrimmed spectacles and the handsome walking stick  dear me this is very interesting the latter remarked is it the custom sir always may i ask in this country to have so many policemen at a wedding  the big man looked downward and shook his head  special reason he said mysteriously fact is young lady was engaged once to a very bad charactera burglar whom the police have been wanting for years he had to leave the country but he has written her once or twice since in a mysterious sort of waywanted her to be true to him and all that sort of thing dorythats the bridegroomhas got a sort of an idea that he may turn up today  this is very excitingvery the little old gentleman remarked reminds me of our younger days out in australia  you sit down here the best man directed ushering his companion into an empty pew i must get back again outside or i shall have the bridegroom arriving  goodday to you sir and many thanks the little old gentleman said politely  soon the bridegroom arriveda smart young officer well thought of at scotland yard well set up wearing a long tail coat a lilac and white tie and shaking in every limb he walked up the aisle accompanied by the best man and the little old gentleman from australia watched him genially from behind those goldrimmed glasses and then scarcely was he at the altar rails when through the open church door one heard the sounds of horses feet one heard a rustle the murmur of voices caught a glimpse of a waiting group arranging themselves finally in the porch of the church maud on the arm of her father came slowly up the aisle the little old gentleman turned his head as though this was something upon which he feared to look he saw nothing of mr barnes in a new coat with tuberose and spray of maidenhair in his coat and exceedingly tight patent leather boots on his feet he saw nothing of mrs barnes clad in a gown of the lightest magenta with a bonnet smothered with violets  it was in the vestry that the only untoward incident of that highly successful wedding took place the ceremony was over bride bridegroom and parents trooped in and when the register was opened one witness had already signed in the clear precise writing his name stood out upon the virgin page  spencer fitzgerald   the bridegroom swore the bride nearly collapsed the clerk pressed into the hands of the latter an envelope  from the little old gentleman he announced who was fussing round the church this morning  mrs dory tore it open and gave a cry of delight a diamond cross worth all the rest of her presents put together flashed soft lights from a background of dull velvet her husband had looked over her shoulder and with a scowl seized the morocco case and threw it far from him  it was the only disturbing incident of a highly successful function  at precisely the same moment when the wedding guests were seated around the hospitable board of daisy villa a celebration of a somewhat different nature was taking place in the more aristocratic neighbourhood of curzon street here however the little party was a much smaller one and the innocent gaiety of the gathering at daisy villa was entirely lacking the luncheon table around which the four men were seated presented all the unlovely signs of a meal where selfrestraint had been abandonedwhere conviviality has passed the bounds of licence edibles were represented only by a single dish of fruit the tablecloth stained with wine and cigar ash seemed crowded with every sort of bottle and every sort of glass a magnum of champagne empty another half full stood in the middle of the table whisky brandy liqueurs of various sorts were all represented glassessome full some empty some filled with cigar ash and cigarette stumpsan ugly sight  the guest in chief arose short thickset redfaced with bulbous eyes and veins about his temples which just now were unpleasantly prominent he seemed indeed a very fitting person to have been the recipient of such hospitality he stood clutching a little at the tablecloth and swaying upon his feet he spoke as a drunken man but such words as he pronounced clearly showed him to be possessed of a voice naturally thick and raspy it was obvious that he was a person of entirely different class from his three companions  ggentlemen he said i must be off i thank you very much for thishospitality honoured im sure to have sat down in suchsuch company good afternoon all  he lurched a little toward the door but his neighbour at the tablewho was also his hostcaught hold of his coat tail and pulled him back into his chair  no hurry masters he said one more liqueur eh its a raw afternoon  nnot another drop sir richard the man declared not another drop to drink i am very much obliged to you all but i must be off must be off he repeated making another effort to rise  his host held him by the arm the man resented ithe showed signs of anger  dn it all iim not a prisoner am i he exclaimed angrily tell you ive gotappointmentclub cant you see its past five oclock  thats all right masters the man whom he had addressed as sir richard declared soothingly we want just a word with you on business first before you gocolonel dickinson lord merries and myself  masters shook his head  see you tomorrow he declared no time to talk business now let me go  he made another attempt to rise which his host also prevented  masters dont be a fool the latter said firmly youve got to hear what we want to say to you sit down and listen  masters relapsed sullenly into his chair his little eyes seemed to creep closer to one another so they wanted to talk business perhaps it was for that reason that they had bidden him sit at their tablehad entertained him so well the very thought cleared his brain  go on he said shortly  sir richard lit a cigarette and leaned further back in his chair he was a man apparently about fifty years of agetall well dressed with good features save for his mouth which resembled more than anything a rat trap he was perfectly bald and he had the air of a man who was a careful liver his eyes were bright almost beadlike his fingers long and a trifle overmanicured one would have judged him to be what he wasa man of fashion and a patron of the turf  masters he said we are all old friends here we want to speak to you plainly we three have had a try as you knowmerries dickinson and myselfto make the coup of our lives we failed and were up against it hard  very hard indeed lord merries murmured softly  deuced hard colonel dickinson echoed  masters was sitting tight breathing a little hard looking fixedly at his host  take my own case first the latter continued i am sir richard dyson ninth baronet with estates in wiltshire and scotland and a town house in cleveland place i belong to the proper clubs for a man in my position and somehow or otherwe wont say howi have managed to pay my way there isnt an acre of my property that isnt mortgaged for more than its value my town housewell it doesnt belong to me at all i have twentysix thousand pounds to pay you on monday to save my life i could not raise twentysix thousand farthings so much for me  the man masters ground his teeth  so much for you he muttered  take the case next sir richard continued of my friend merries here merries is an earl it is true but he never had a penny to bless himself with hes tried acting reporting marryinganything to make an honest living so far i am afraid we must consider lord merries as something of a failure eh  a rotten failure i should say that young nobleman declared gloomily  lord merries is to put it briefly financially unsound sir richard declared  what is the amount of your debt to mr masters jim  eleven thousand two hundred pounds lord merries answered  and we may take it i presume for granted that you have not that sum nor anything like it at your disposal sir richard asked  not a fiver lord merries declared with emphasis  we come now mr masters to our friend colonel dickinson sir richard continued colonel dickinson is perhaps in a more favourable situation than any of us he has a small but regular income and he has expectations which it is not possible to mortgage fully at the same time it will be many years before they canerfructify he is therefore with us in this somewhat unpleasant predicament in which we find ourselves  cut it short masters growled im sick of so much talk whats it all mean  it means simply this mr masters sir richard said we want you to take six months bills for our indebtedness to you  masters rose to his feet his thick lips were drawn a little apart he had the appearance of a savage and discontented animal  so thats why ive been asked here and fed up with wine and stuff eh he exclaimed thickly well my answer to you is soon given no ill take bills from no man my terms are cash on settling daycash to pay or cash to receive ill have no other  sir richard rose also to his feet  mr masters i beg of you to be reasonable he said you will do yourself no good by adopting this attitude facts are facts we havent got a thousand pounds between us  ive heard that sort of a tale before masters answered with a sneer job masters is too old a bird to be caught by such chaff ill take my risks gentlemen ill take my risks  he moved toward the door no one spoke a word the silence as he crossed the room seemed a little ominous he looked over his shoulder they were all three standing in their places looking at him a vague sense of uneasiness disturbed his equanimity  no offence gents he said and good afternoon  still no reply he reached the door and turned the handle the door was fast he shook itgently at first and then violently suddenly he realized that it was locked he turned sharply around  what games this he exclaimed fiercely let me out  they stood in their places without movement there was something a little ominous in their silence masters was fast becoming a sober man  let me out of here he exclaimed or ill break the door down  sir richard dyson came slowly towards him there was something in his appearance which terrified masters he raised his fist to strike the door he was a fighting man but he felt a sudden sense of impotence  mr masters sir richard said suavely the truth is that we cannot afford to let you gounless you agree to do what we have asked you see we really have not the money or any way of raising itand the inconvenience of being posted you have yourself very ably pointed out change your mind mr masters take those bills well do our best to meet them  ill do nothing of the sort masters answered striking the door fiercely with his clenched fist ill have cashnothing but the cash  there was a dull sickening thud and the bookmaker went over like a shot rabbit his legs twitched for a momenta little moan that was scarcely audible broke from his lips then he lay quite still sir richard bent over him with the life preserver still in his hand  ive done it he muttered hoarsely one blow thank heaven he didnt want another his skull was as soft as pudding ugh  he turned away the man who lay stretched upon the floor was an ugly sight his two companions cowering over the table were not much better dysons trembling fingers went out for the brandy decanter half of what he poured out was spilled upon the tablecloth the rest he drank from a tumbler neat  its nervous work this you fellows he said hoarsely  its hellish dickinson answered lets have some air in the room by god its close  he sank back into his chair white to the lips dyson looked at him sharply  look here he exclaimed i hold you both to our bargain i was to be the one he attacked and who struck the blowin selfdefence remember thatit was in selfdefence ive done it ive done my share i hope to god ill forget it some day andrew you know your task be a man and get to work  dickinson rose to his feet unsteadily yes he said what was it i have forgotten for the moment but i am ready  you must get his betting book from his pocket sir richard directed then you must help merries downstairs with him and into the car merries isto get rid of him  merries shivered his hand too went out for the brandy  to get rid of him he muttered it sounds easy  it is easy sir richard declared you have only to keep your nerve and the thing is done no one will see him inside the car in that motoring coat and glasses you can drive somewhere out into the country and leave him  leave him merries repeated trembling leave himyes  neither of the two men moved  i must do more than my share i suppose sir richard declared contemptuously come  they dragged the mans body on to a chair wrapped a huge coat around him tied a motoring cap under his chin fixed goggles over his eyes sir richard strolled into the hall and opened the front door he stood there for a moment looking up and down the street when he gave the signal they dragged him out supported between them across the pavement into the car ugh his attitude was so natural as to be absolutely ghastly merries started the car and sprang into the drivers seat there were people in the square now but the figure reclining in the dark cushioned interior looked perfectly natural  so long jimmy sir richard called out see you this evening  right o merries replied with a brave effort   peter ruff summoned by telephone from his sitting room slipped down the stairs like a catnoiseless swift the voice which had summoned him had been the voice of his secretarya voice almost unrecognisablea voice shaken with fear fear no it had been terror  on the landing below exactly underneath the room from which he had descended there was a door upon which his name was written upon a small brass platemr peter ruff he opened and closed it behind him with a swift movement which he had practised in his idle moments he found himself looking in upon a curious scene  miss brown with the radiance of her hair effectually concealed in plain black skirt and simple blousethe ideal secretaryhad risen from the seat in front of her typewriter and was standing facing the door through which he had entered with a small revolverwhich he had given her for a birthday present only the day beforeclasped in her outstretched hand the object of her solicitude was it seemed to peter ruff the most pitifullooking object upon which he had ever looked the hours had dwelt with merries as the years with some people and worse he had lost his cap his hair hung over his forehead in wild confusion his eyes were red bloodshot and absolutely aflame with the terrors through which he had livedunderneath them the black marks might have been traced with a charcoal pencil his cheeks were livid save for one burning spot his clothes too were in disorderthe starch had gone from his collar his tie hung loosely outside his waistcoat he was cowering back against the wall and between him and the girl stretched upon the floor was the body of a man in a huge motor coat a limp inert mass which neither moved nor seemed to have any sign of life no wonder that peter ruff looked around his office whose serenity had been so tragically disturbed with an air of mild surprise  dear me he exclaimed something seems to have happened my dear violet you can put that revolver away i have secured the door  her hand fell to her side she gave a little shiver of relief peter ruff nodded  that is more comfortable he declared now perhaps you will explain  that young man she interrupted or lunaticwhatever he calls himselfburst in here a few minutes ago draggingthat she pointed to the motionless figure upon the floor if i had not stopped him he would have bolted off without a word of explanation  peter ruff with his back against the door shook his head gravely  my dear lord merries he said my office is not a mortuary  merries gasped  you know me then he muttered hoarsely  of course ruff answered it is my profession to know everybody go and sit down upon that easychair and drink the brandy and soda which miss brown is about to mix for you thats right  merries staggered across the room and half fell into an easychair he leaned over the side with his face buried in his hands unable still to face the horror which lay upon the floor a few seconds later the tumbler of brandy and soda was in his hands he drank it like a man who drains fresh life into his veins  perhaps now peter ruff suggested pointing to the motionless figure you can give me some explanation as to this  merries looked away from him all the time he was speaking his voice was thick and nervous  there were three of us lunching together he beganfour in all there was a dispute and this man threatened us afterwards there was a fight it fell to my lot to take him away and i cant get rid of him i cant get rid of him he repeated with something that sounded like a sob  i still do not see peter ruff argued why you should have brought him here and deposited him upon my perfectly new carpet  you are peter ruff merries declared crime investigator and private detective you call yourself you are used to this sort of thing you will know what to do with it it is part of your business  i can assure you peter ruff answered that you are under a delusion as to the details of my profession i am peter ruff he admitted and i call myself a crime investigatorin fact i am the only one worth speaking of in the world but i certainly deny that i am used to having dead bodies deposited upon my carpet and that i make a habit of disposing of themespecially gratis  merries tore open his coat  listen he said his voice shaking hysterically i must get rid of it or go mad for two hours i have been driving about in a motor car withit for a passenger i drove to a quiet spot and i tried to lift it outa policeman rode up i tried again a man rushed by on a motor cycle and turned to look at me i tried a few minutes laterthe policeman came back it was always the same the night seemed to have eyes i was watched everywhere thethe face began to mock me ill swear that i heard it chuckle once  peter ruff moved a little further away  i dont think ill have anything to do with it he declared i dont like your description at all  itll be all right with you merries declared eagerly its my nerves thats all you see i was therewhen the accident happened see here he added tearing a pocketbook from his coat i have three hundred and seventy pounds saved up in case i had to bolt ill keep seventythree hundred for youto dispose of it  ruff leaned over the motionless body looked into its face and nodded  masters the bookmaker he remarked hm i did hear that he had a lot of money coming to him over the cambridgeshire  merries shuddered  may i go he pleaded theres the three hundred on the table for gods sake let me go  peter ruff nodded  i wish youd saved a little more he said however  he turned the lock and merries rushed out of the room ruff looked across the room towards his secretary  ring up 1535 central he ordered sharply    peter ruff had descended from his apartments on the top floor of the building in a new brown suit with which he was violently displeased to meet a caller  i am sorry to intrudemr ruff i believe it is sir richard dyson said a little irritablybut i have not a great deal of time to spare  most natural peter ruff declared pray take a chair sir richard you want to know of course about lord merries and poor masters  sir richard stared at his questioner for a moment without speech once more the fear which he had succeeded in banishing for a while shone in his eyesrevealed itself in his white face  try the easychair sir richard ruff continued pleasantly leave your hat and cane on the table there and make yourself comfortable i should like to understand exactly what you have come to me for  sir richard moved his head toward miss brown  my business with you he said is more than ordinarily private i have the honour of knowing miss  miss brown peter interrupted quickly in these offices this young ladys name is miss violet brown  sir richard shrugged his shoulders  it is of no importance he said only as you may understand my business with you scarcely requires the presence of a third party even one with the discretion which i am sure missbrown possesses  in these matters ruff answered my secretary does not exist apart from myself her presence is necessary she takes down in shorthand notes of our conversation i have a shocking memory and there are always points which i forget at the conclusion of our business whatever it may be these notes are destroyed i could not work without them however  sir richard glanced a little doubtfully at the long slim back of the girl who sat with her face turned away from him of course he began if you make yourself personally responsible for her discretion  i am willing to do so ruff interrupted brusquely i guarantee it go on please  i do not know of course where you got your information from sir richard began but it is perfectly true that i have come here to consult you upon a matter in which the two people whose names you have mentioned are concerned the disappearance of job masters is of course common talk but i cannot tell what has led you to associate with it the temporary absence of lord merries from this country  let me ask you this question ruff said how are you affected by the disappearance of masters  indirectly it has caused me a great deal of inconvenience sir richard declared  facts please murmured peter  it has been rumoured sir richard admitted that i owed masters a large sum of money which i could not pay  anything else  it has also been rumoured sir richard continued that he was seen to enter my house that day and that he remained there until late in the afternoon  did he asked ruff  certainly not sir richard answered  peter ruff yawned for a moment but covered the indiscretion with his hand  respecting this inconvenience he said which you admit that the disappearance of job masters has caused you what is its tangible side  sir richard drew his chair a little nearer to the table where ruff was sitting his voice dropped almost to a whisper  it seems absurd he said and yet what i tell you is the truth i have been followed aboutshadowed in factfor several days men even in my own social circle seem to hold aloof from me it is as though he continued slowly people were beginning to suspect me of being connected in some way with the mans disappearance  ruff who had been making figures with a pencil on the edge of his blotting paper suddenly turned round his eyes flashed with a new light as they became fixed upon his companions  and are you not he asked calmly sir richard bore himself well for a moment he had shrunk back then he half rose to his feet  mr ruff he said i must protest  stop  peter ruff used no violent gesture only his forefinger tapped the desk in front of him his voice was as smooth as velvet  tell me as much or as little as you please sir richard he said but let that little or that much be the truth on those terms only i may be able to help you you do not go to your physician and expect him to prescribe to you while you conceal your symptoms or to your lawyer for advice and tell him half the truth i am not asking for your confidence i simply tell you that you are wasting your time and mine if you choose to withhold it  sir richard was silent he recognized a new quality in the manbut the truth was an awful thing to tell he consideredthen told  ruff briskly asked two questions in alluding to your heavy settlement with masters you said just now that you could not have paid himthen  quite so sir richard admitted that is the rotten part of the whole affair four days later a wonderful double came offone in which we were all interested and one which not one of us expected weve drawn a considerable amount already from one or two bookies and i believe even masters owes us a bit now  thank you ruff said i think that i know everything now my fee is five hundred guineas  sir richard looked at him  what he exclaimed  five hundred guineas ruff repeated  for a consultation sir richard asked  peter ruff shook his head  more than that he said you are a brave man in your way sir richard dyson but you are going about now shivering under a load of fear it sits like a devil incarnate upon your shoulders it poisons the air wherever you go write your cheque sir richard and you can leave that little black devil in my wastebasket you are under my protection nothing will happen to you  sir richard sat like a man mesmerised the little man with the amiable expression and the badly fitting suit was leaning back in his chair his finger tips pressed together waiting  nothing will happen sir richard repeated incredulously  certainly not i guarantee you against any inconvenience which might arise to you from this recent unfortunate affair isnt that all you want  its all i want certainly sir richard declared but i must understand a little how you propose to secure my immunity  ruff shook his head  i have my own methods he said i can help only those who trust me  sir richard drew a cheque book from his pocket i dont know why i should believe in you he said as he wrote the cheque  but you do peter ruff said smiling fortunately for you you do    it was not so easy to impart a similar confidence into the breast of colonel dickinson with whom sir richard dined that night teteatete dickinson was inclined to think that sir richard ad been had  youve paid a ridiculous fee he argued and all that you have in return is the fellows promise to see you through it isnt like you to part with money so easily richard did he hypnotise you  i dont think so sir richard answered i wasnt conscious of it  what sort of a fellow is he dickinson asked  sir richard looked reflectively into his glass  hes a vulgar sort of little johnny he said looks as though he were always dressed in new clothes and couldnt get used to them  three men entered the room two remained in the background john dory came forward towards the table  sir richard dyson he said gravely i have come upon an unpleasant errand  go on sir richard said fingering something hard inside pocket of his coat  i have a warrant for your arrest dory continued in connection with the disappearance of job masters on saturday the 10th of november last i will read the terms of the warrant if you choose it is my duty to warn you that anything you may now say can be used in evidence against you this gentleman i believe is colonel dickinson  that is my name sir dickinson answered with unexpected fortitude  i regret to say the detective continued that i have also a warrant for your arrest in connection with the same matter  sir richard had hold of the butt end of his revolver then like grisly phantoms the thoughts chased one another through his brain should he shoot and end itpass into black nothingnessescape disgrace but die like a rat in a corner his finger was upon the trigger then suddenly his heart gave a great leap he raised his head as though listening something flashed in his eyessomething that was almost like hope there was no mistaking that voice which he had heard in the hall he made a great rally  i can only conclude he said turning to the detective that you have made some absurd blunder if you really possess the warrants you speak of however colonel dickinson and i will accompany you wherever you choose  then the door opened and peter ruff walked in followed by job masters whose head was still bandaged and who seemed to have lost a little flesh and a lot of colour peter ruff looked round apologetically he seemed surprised not to find sir richard dyson and colonel dickinson alone he seemed more than ever surprised to recognize dory  i trust he said smoothly that our visit is not inopportune sir richard dyson i believe he continued bowingmy friend mr masters here has consulted me as to the loss of a betting book and we ventured to call to ask you sir if by any chance on his recent visit to your house  god in heaven its masters dyson exclaimed its job masters  thats me sir masters admitted mr ruff thought you might be able to help me find that book  sir richard swayed upon his feet then the blood rushed once more through his veins  your books here in my cabinet safe enough he said you left it here after our luncheon that day where on earth have you been to man he continued we want some money from you over myopia  ill pay all right sir masters answered fact is after our luncheon party im afraid i got a bit fuddled i dont seem to remember much  he sat down a little heavily peter ruff hastened to the table and took up a glass  you will excuse me if i give him a little brandy wont you sir he said hes really not quite fit for getting about yet but he was worrying about his book  give him all the brandy he can drink sir richard answered  the detectives face had been a study he knew masters well enough by sightthere was no doubt about his identity his teeth came together with an angry little click he had made a mistake it was a thing which would be remembered against him forever it was as bad as his failure to arrest that young man at daisy villa  your visit masters sir richard said with a curious smile at the corners of his lips is in some respects a little opportune about that little matter we were speaking of he continued turning towards the detective  we have only to offer you our apologies sir richard dory answered  then he crossed the room and confronted peter ruff  do i understand sir that your name is ruffpeter ruff he asked  that is my name sir peter ruff admitted pleasantly yours i believe is dory we are likely to come across one another now and then i suppose glad to know you  the detective stood quite still and there was no geniality in his face  i wonderhave we ever met before he asked without removing his eyes from the others face peter ruff smiled  not professionally at any rate he answered i know that scotland yard you dont think much of us small fry but we find out things sometimes  why didnt you contradict all those rumours as to his disappearance the detective asked pointing to where job masters was contentedly sipping his brandy and water  i was acting for my client and in my own interests replied peter it was surely no part of my duty to save you gentlemen at scotland yard from hunting up mares nests  john dory went out followed by his men sir richard took peter ruff by the arm and leading him to the sideboard mixed him a drink  peter ruff he said youre a clever scoundrel but youve earned your five hundred guineas hang it youre welcome to them is there anything else i can do for you  peter ruff raised his glass and set it down again once more he eyed with admiration his clients wellturned out figure  you might give me a letter to your tailors sir richard he begged  sir richard laughed outrightit was some time since he had laughed  you shall have it peter ruff he declared raising his glassand heres to you    chapter iii vincent cawdor commission agent   for the second time since their new association peter ruff had surprised that look upon his secretarys face this time he wheeled around in his chair and addressed her  my dear violet he said be frank with me what is wrong  miss brown turned to face her employer save for a greater demureness of expression and the extreme simplicity of her attire she had changed very little since she had given up her life of comparative luxury to become peter ruffs secretary there was a sort of personal elegance which clung to her notwithstanding her strenuous attempts to dress for her part except for which she looked precisely as a private secretary and typist should look she even wore a black bow at the back of her hair  i have not complained have i she asked  do not waste time peter ruff said coldly proceed  i have not enough to do she said i do not understand why you refuse so many cases  peter ruff nodded  i did not bring my talents into this business he said to watch flirting wives to ascertain the haunts of gay husbands or to detect the pilferings of servants  anything is better than sitting still she protested  i do not agree with you peter ruff said i like sitting still very much indeedone has time to think is there anything else  shall i really go on she asked  by all means he answered  i have idea she continued that you are subordinating your general interests to your secret enmityto one man you are waiting until you can find another case in which you are pitted against him  sometimes peter ruff said your intelligence surprises me  i came to you she continued looking at him earnestly for two reasons the personal one i will not touch upon the other was my love of excitement i have tried many things in life as you know peter but i have seemed to carry always with me the heritage of weariness i thought that my position here would help me to fight against it  you have seen me bring a corpse to life peter ruff reminded her a little aggrieved  she smiled  it was a month ago she reminded him  i cant do that sort of thing every day he declared  naturally she answered but you have refused four cases within the last five days  peter ruff whistled softly to himself for several moments  seen anything of our new neighbour in the flat above he asked with apparent irrelevance  miss brown looked across at him with upraised eyebrows  i have been in the lift with him twice she answered  fancy his appearance ruff asked casually  not in the least violet answered i thought him a vulgar offensive person  peter ruff chuckled he seemed immensely delighted  mr vincent cawdor he calls himself i believe he remarked  i have no idea miss brown declared the subject did not appeal to her  his name is on a small copper plate just over the letterbox ruff said rather neat idea by the bye he calls himself a commission agent i believe  violet was suddenly interested she realized after all that mr vincent cawdor might be a person of some importance  what is a commission agent she asked  peter ruff shook his head  it might mean anything he declared never trust any one who is not a little more explicit as to his profession i am afraid that this mr vincent cawdor for instance is a bad lot  i am sure he is miss brown declared  looks after a pretty girl coughs in the liftall that sort of thing eh peter ruff asked  she nodded  disgusting she exclaimed with emphasis  peter ruff sighed and glanced at the clock the existence of mr vincent cawdor seemed to pass out of his mind  it is nearly one oclock he said where do you usually lunch violet  it depends upon my appetite she answered carelessly most often at an a b c  today peter ruff said you will be extravagantat my expense  i had a poor breakfast miss brown remarked complacently  you will leave at once peter ruff said and you will go to the french cafe at the milan get a table facing the courtyard and towards the hotel side of the room keep your eyes open and tell me exactly what you see  she looked at him with parted lips her eyes were full of eager questioning  mere skirmishing peter ruff continued but i thinkyes i think that it may lead to something  whom am i to watch she asked  any one who looks interesting peter ruff answered for instance if this person vincent cawdor should be about  he would recognize me she declared  peter ruff shrugged his shoulders  one must hold the candle he remarked  i decline to flirt with him she declared nothing would induce me to be pleasant to such an odious creature  he will be too busy to attempt anything of the sort of course he may not be there it may be the merest fancy on my part at any rate you may rely upon it that he will not make any overtures in a public place like the milan mr vincent cawdor may be a curious sort of person but i do not fancy that he is a fool  very well miss brown said i will go  be back soon after three peter ruff said i am going up to my room to do my exercises  and afterwards she asked  i shall have my lunch sent in he answered dont hurry back though i shall not expect you till a quarter past three  it was a few minutes past that time when miss brown returned peter ruff was sitting at his desk looking as though he had never moved he was absorbed by a book of patterns sent in by his new tailor and he only glanced up when she entered the room  violet he said earnestly come in and sit down i want to consult you there is a new material herea sort of mousecoloured cheviot i wonder whether it would suit me  violet was looking very handsome and a little flushed she raised her veil and came over to his side  put that stupid book away peter she said i want to tell you about the milan  he leaned back in his chair  ah he said i had forgotten was mr vincent cawdor there  yes she answered still a little breathless there was some one else there too in whom you are still more interested  he nodded  go on he said  mr vincent cawdor she continued came in alone he looked just as objectionable as ever and he stared at me till i nearly threw my wine glass at him  he did not speak to you peter ruff asked  i was afraid that he was going to miss brown said but fortunately he met a friend who came to his table and lunched with him  a friend ruff remarked good what was he like  fair slight teutonic miss brown answered he wore thick spectacles and his moustache was positively yellow  ruff nodded  go on he said  towards the end of luncheon she continued an american came up to them  an american peter ruff interrupted how do you know that  miss brown smiled  he was cleanshaven and he wore neat clothes she said he talked with an accent you could have cut with a knife and he had a baedeker sticking out of his pocket after luncheon they all three went away to the smoking room  peter ruff nodded  anything else he asked  the girl smiled triumphantly  yes she declared there was something elsesomething which i think you will find interesting at the next table to me there was a manalone can you guess who he was  john dory ruff said calmly  the girl was disappointed  you knew she exclaimed  my dear violet he said i did not send you there on a fools errand  there is something doing then she exclaimed  there is likely he answered grimly to be a great deal doing    the two men who stood upon the hill and peter ruff who lay upon his stomach behind a huge boulder looked upon a new thing  far down in the valley from out of a black shedthe only sign of mans handiwork for many milesit camesomething grey at first moving slowly as though being pushed down a slight incline then afloat in the air gathering speedsomething between a torpedo with wings and a great prehistoric insect now and then it described strange circles but mostly it came towards them as swift and as true as an arrow shot from a bow the two men looked at one anotherthe shorter to whose cheeks the cumberland winds had brought no trace of colour gave vent to a hoarse exclamation  hes done it he growled  wait the other answered  over their heads the thing wheeled and seemed to stand still in the air the beating of the engine was so faint that peter ruff from behind the boulder could hear all that was said a man leaned out from his seata man with wan cheeks but blazing eyes  listen he said take your glasses theredue northcan you see a steeple  the men turned their field glasses in the direction toward which the other pointed yes they answered it is sixteen miles as the crow flies to barnham churchthirtytwo miles there and back wait  he swung round dived till he seemed about to touch the hillside then soared upwards and straight away peter ruff took out his watch the other two men gazed with fascinated eyes after the disappearing speck  if he does it the shorter one muttered  he will do it the other answered  he was back again before their eyes were weary of watching peter ruff from behind the boulder closed his watch thirtytwo miles in less than half an hour the youth leaned from his seat  is it enough he asked hoarsely  it is enough the two men answered together we will come down  the youth touched a lever and the machine glided down towards the valley falling all the while with the effortless grace a parachute the shed from which his machine had issued was midway down a slope with a short length of rails which ran apparently through it the machine seemed to hover for several moments above the building then descended slowly on to the rails and disappeared in the shed the two men were already halfway down the hill peter ruff rose from behind the boulder stretched himself with a sense of immense relief and lit a pipe as yet he dared not descend he simply changed his hiding place for a spot which enabled him to command a view of the handful of cottages at the back of the hill he had plenty to think about it was a wonderful thingthiswhich he had seen  the youth meanwhile was drinking deep of the poisonous cup he walked between the two menhis cheeks were flushed his eyes on fire  if all the world today had seen what we have seen the older man was saying there would be no more talk of wilbur wrights or farmans those men are babies playing with their toys  mine is the ideal principle the youth declared no one else has thought of it no one else has made use of it yet all the time i am afraidit is so simple  sell quick then the fairheaded man advised by tomorrow night i can promise you fifty thousand pounds  the youth stopped he drew a deep breath  i shall sell he declared i need money i want to live fifty thousand pounds is enough eleven weary months i have slept and toiled there in the shed  it is finished the older man declared tonight you shall come with us to london tomorrow night your pockets shall be full of gold it will be a change for you  the youth sobbed  god knows it will he muttered i havent two shillings in the world and i owe for my last petrol  the two men laughed heartily the elder took a little bundle of notes from his pocket and handed them to the boy  come he said not for another moment shall you feel as poor as that money will have no value for you in the future the fifty thousand pounds will only be a start after that you will get royalties if i had it i would give you a quarter of a million now for your plans i know that i can get you more  the youth laughed hysterically they entered the tiny inn and drank homemade winethe best they could get then a great car drew up outside and the olderthe cleanshaven man who looked like an americanhurried out and dragging a hamper from beneath the seat returned with a goldfoiled bottle in his hand  come he said a toast we have one bottle leftone bottle of the best  champagne the youth cried eagerly holding out his hand  the only wine for the conquerors the other declared pouring it out into the thick tumblers drink all of you to the franklin flying machine to the millions she will earnto tomorrow night  the youth drained his glass watched it replenished and drained it again then they went out to the car  there is one thing yet to be done he said wait here for me  they waited whilst he climbed up toward the shed the two men watched him a little group of rustics stood openmouthed around the great car then there was a little shout from above their heads came the sound of a great explosionred flames were leaping up from that black barn to the sky the two men looked at one another they rushed to the hill and met the youth descending  what the  he stopped them  i dared not leave it here he explained it would have been madness i am perfectly certain that i have been watched during the last few days i can build another in a week i have the plans in my pocket for every part  the older man wiped the perspiration from his forehead  you are surethat you have the plans he asked  the youth struck himself on the chest  they are here he answered every one of them  perhaps you are right then the other man answered it gave me a turn though you are sure that you can make it again in the time you say  of course the youth answered impatiently besides the thing is so simple it speaks for itself  they climbed into the car and in a few minutes were rushing away southwards  tomorrow nighttomorrow night it all begins the youth continued i must start with readymade clothes ill get the best i can eat the best i can drink wine go to the music halls tomorrow night  his speech ended in a waila strange halfstifled cry which rang out with a chill ghostly sound upon the black silence his face was covered with a wet towel a ghastly odor was in his nostrils his lips refused to utter any further sound he lay back among the cushions senseless the car slowed down  get the papers quick the elder man muttered opening the youths coat here they are catch hold dick my god whats that  he shook from head to foot the little fair man looked at him with contempt  a sheep bell on the moor he said are you sure you have everything  yes the other muttered  they both stood up and raised the prostrate form between them below them were the black waters of the lake  over with him the younger said quick  once more his companion shrank away  listen he muttered hoarsely  they both held their breaths from somewhere along the road behind came a faint sound like the beating of an engine  its a car the elder man exclaimed quick over with him  they lifted the body of the boy whose lips were white and speechless now and threw him into the water with a great splash he disappeared they watched for a moment only the ripples flowed away from the place where he had sunk they jumped back to their seats  theres something close behind the older man muttered get on fast fast  the younger man hesitated  perhaps he said slowly it would be better to wait and see who it is coming up behind our young friend there is safe the current has him and the tarn is bottomless  there was a moments indecisiona moment which was to count for much in the lives of three men then the elder ones counsels prevailed they crept away down the hill smoothly and noiselessly behind them the faint throbbing grew less and less distinct soon they heard it no more they drove into the dawn and through the long day    side by side on one of the big leather couches in the small smoking room of the milan hotel mr james p rounceby and his friend mr richard marnstam sat whispering together it was nearly two o clock and they were alone in the room some of the lights had been turned out the roar of life in the streets without had ceased it was an uneasy hour for those whose consciences were not wholly at rest  the two men were in evening dressrounceby in dinner coat and black tie as befitted his role of travelling american the glasses in front of them were only halffilled and had remained so for the last hour their conversation had been nervous and spasmodic it was obvious that they were waiting for some one  three oclock struck by the little timepiece on the mantel shelf a little exclamation of a profane nature broke from rouncebys lips he leaned toward his companion  say he muttered in a rather thick undertone how about this fellow vincent cawdor you havent any doubts about him i suppose hes on the square all right eh  marnstam wet his lips nervously  cawdors all right he said i had it direct from headquarters at paris what are you uneasy about eh  rounceby pointed towards the clock  do you see the time he asked  he said hed be late marnstam answered  rounceby put his hand to his forehead and found it moist  its been a silly game all along he muttered wed better have brought the young ass up here and jostled him  not so easy marnstam answered these young fools have a way of turning obstinate hed have chucked us sure anyhow hes safer where he is  they relapsed once more into silence a storm of rain beat upon the window rounceby glanced up it was as black out there as were the waters of that silent tarn the man shivered as the thought struck him marnstam who had no nerves twirled his moustache and watched his companion with wonder  you look as though you saw a ghost he remarked  perhaps i do rounceby growled  you had better finish your drink my dear fellow marnstam advised afterwards  suddenly he stiffened into attention he laid his hand upon his companions knee  listen he said there is some one coming  they leaned a little forward the swing doors were opened a girls musical laugh rang out from the corridor tall and elegant with her black lace skirt trailing upon the floor her left hand resting upon the shoulder of the man into whose ear she was whispering and whom she led straight to one of the writing tables miss violet brown swept into the room on her right and nearest to the two men was mr vincent cawdor  now you can go and talk to your friends she exclaimed lightly i am going to make victor listen to me  cawdor left his two companions and sank on to the couch by rouncebys side the young man with his opera hat still on his head and the light overcoat which he had been carrying on the floor by his side was seated before the writing table with his back to them miss brown was leaning over him with her hand upon the back of his chair they were out of hearing of the other three men  well rounceby my friend mr vincent cawdor remarked cheerfully youre having a late sitting eh  weve been waiting for you you fool rounceby answered what on earth are you thinking about bringing a crowd like this about with you eh  cawdor smiled reassuringly  dont you worry he said in a lower tone i know my way in and out of the ropes here better than you can teach me a big hotel like this is the safest and the most dangerous place in the worldjust how you choose to make it youve got to bluff em all the time thats why i brought the young ladyparticular friend of minereal nice girl too  and the young man rounceby asked suspiciously  cawdor grew more serious  thats captain lowther he said softlyprivate secretary to colonel dean whos the chief of the aeronaut department at aldershot he has a draft in his pocket for twenty thousand pounds it is yours if he is satisfied with the plans  twenty thousand pounds marnstam said thoughtfully it is very littlevery little indeed for the risks which we have run  cawdor moved his place and sat between the men he laid a hand upon marnstams shoulderanother on rouncebys knee  my dear friends he said impressively if you could have built a model or conducted these negotiations in the usual way you might have asked a million as it is i think i am the only man in england who could have dealt with this matterso satisfactorily  rounceby glanced suspiciously at the young man to whom miss brown was still devoting the whole of her attention  why dont he come out and talk like a man he asked whats the idea of his sitting over there with his back to us  i want him never to see your facesto deal only with me cawdor explained remember that he is in an official position the money he is going to part with is secret service money  the two men were beginning to be more reassured rounceby slowly produced a roll of oilskin from his pocket  hell look at them as he sits there he insisted there must be no copying or making notes mind  cawdor smiled in a superior fashion  my dear fellow he said you are dealing with the emissary of a governmentnot one of your own sort  rounceby glanced at his companion who nodded then he handed over the plans  tell him to look sharp he said its not so late but that there may be people in here yet  cawdor crossed the room with the plans and laid them down before the writing table rounceby rose to his feet and lit a cigar marnstam walked to the further window and back again they stood side by side rouncebys whole frame seemed to have stiffened with some new emotion  theres something wrong jim marnstam whispered softly in his ear youve got the old lady in your pocket  yes rounceby answered thickly and by heavens im going to use it  dont shoot unless its the worst marnstam counselled i shall go out of that window into the tree and run for the river but bluff first jimbluff for your life  there were swinging doors leading into the room from the hotel side and a small door exactly opposite which led to the residential part of the place both of these doors were opened at precisely the same moment through the former stepped two strong looking men in long overcoats and with the unmistakable appearance of policemen in plain clothes through the latter came john dory he walked straight up to the two men it spoke volumes for his courage that knowing their characters and believing them to be in desperate straits he came unarmed  gentlemen he said i hold warrants for your arrest i will not trouble you with your aliases you are known today i believe as james rounceby and richard marnstam will you come quietly  marnstams expression was one of bland and beautiful surprise  my dear sir he said edging however a little toward the windowyou must be joking what is the charge  you are charged with the wilful murder of a young man named victor franklin answered dory his body was recovered from longthorp tarn this afternoon you had better say nothing also with the theft of certain papers known to have been in his possession  now it is possible that at this precise moment marnstam would have made his spring for the window and rounceby his running fight for liberty the hands of both men were upon their revolvers and john dorys life was a thing of no account but at this juncture a thing happened there were in the room the two policemen guarding the swing doors and behind them the pale faces of a couple of night porters looking anxiously in vincent cawdor and miss brown were standing side by side a little in the background and the young man who had been their companion had risen also to his feet as though with some intention of intervening he moved a step forward almost in line with dory rounceby saw him and a new fear gripped him by the heart he shrank back his fingers relaxed their hold of his weapon the sweat was hot upon his forehead marnstam though he seemed for a moment stupefied realised the miracle which had happened and struck boldly for his own  if this is a joke he said it strikes me as being a particularly bad one i should like to know sir how you dare to come into this room and charge me and my friendmr rouncebywith being concerned in the murder of a young man who is even now actually standing by your side  john dory started back he looked with something like apprehension at the youth to whom marnstam pointed  my name is victor franklin that young man declared whats all this about  dory felt the ground give beneath his feet nevertheless he set his teeth and fought for his hand  you say that your name is victor franklin he asked  certainly  you are the inventor of a flying machine  i am  you were in westmoreland with these two men a few days go  i was the young man admitted  you left the village of scawton in a motor car with them  yes we quarrelled on the way and parted  you were robbed of nothing  victor franklin smiled  certainly not he answered i had nothing worth stealing except my plans and they are in my pocket now  there was a few moments intense silence dory wheeled suddenly round and looked to where mr vincent cawdor had been standing  where is mr cawdor he asked sharply  the gentleman with the grey moustache left a few seconds ago one of the men at the door said dory was very pale  gentlemen he said i have to offer you my apologies i have apparently been deceived by some false information the charge is withdrawn  he turned on his heel and left the room the two policemen followed him  keep them under observation dory ordered shortly but i am afraid this fellow cawdor has sold me  he found a hansom outside and sprang into it  number 27 southampton row he ordered  rounceby and his partner were alone in the little smoking room the former was almost inarticulate the night porter brought them brandy and both men drank  weve got to get to the bottom of this marnstam mr rounceby muttered  mr marnstam was thinking  do you remember that sound through the darkness he saidthe beating of an engine way back on the road  what of it rounceby demanded  it was a motor bicycle marnstam said quietly i thought so at the time  supposing some one followed us and pulled him out rounceby said hoarsely why are we treated like this i tell you weve been made fools of weve been treated like childrennot even to be punished well have the truth somehow out of that devil cawdor come  they made their way to the courtyard and found a cab  number 27 southampton row they ordered  they reached their destination some time before dory whose horse fell down in the strand and who had to walk they ascended to the fourth floor of the building and rang the bell of vincent cawdors roomno answer they plied the knockerno result rounceby peered through the keyhole  he hasnt come home yet he remarked there is no light anywhere in the place  the door of a flat across the passage was quietly opened mr peter ruff in a neat black smoking suit and slippers and holding a pipe in his hand looked out  excuse me gentlemen he said but i do not think that mr cawdor is in he went out early this evening and i have not heard him return  the two men turned away  we are much obliged to you sir mr marnstam said  can i give him any message peter ruff asked politely we generally see something of one another in the morning  you can tell him rounceby began  no message thanks marnstam interrupted we shall probably run across him ourselves tomorrow  john dory was nearly a quarter of an hour late after his third useless summons mr peter ruff presented himself again  i am afraid he said you will not find my neighbour at home there have been several people enquiring for him tonight without any result  john dory came slowly across the landing  good evening mr ruff he said  why its mr dory peter ruff declared come in do and have a drink  john dory accepted the invitation and his eyes were busy in that little sitting room during the few minutes which it took his host to mix that whisky and soda  nothing wrong with our friend opposite i hope peter ruff asked jerking his head across the landing  i hope not mr ruff john dory said no doubt in the morning he will be able to explain everything i must say that i should like to see him tonight though  he may turn up yet peter ruff remarked cheerfully hes like myselfa late bird  i fear not dory answered drily nice rooms you have here sir just a sitting room and bedroom eh  peter ruff stood up and threw open the door of the inner apartment  thats so he answered care to have a look round  the detective did look round and pretty thoroughly as soon as he was sure that there was no one concealed upon the premises he drank his whisky and soda and went  ill look in again to see cawdor he remarkedtomorrow perhaps or the next day  ill let him know if i see him about peter ruff declared sorry the lifts stopped three steps to the left and straight on goodnight    miss brown arrived early the following morning and was disposed to be inquisitive  i should like to know she said exactly what has become of mr vincent cawdor  peter ruff took her upstairs there was a little mound of ashes in the grate  she nodded  i imagined that she said but why did you send me out to watch yourself  my dear violet peter ruff answered there is no man in the world today who is my equal in the art of disguising himself at the same time i wanted to know whether i could deceive you i wanted to be quite sure that my study of mr vincent cawdor was a safe one i took those rooms in his name and in his own person i do not think that it occurred even to our friend john dory to connect us in his mind  very well she went on now tell me please what took you up to westmoreland  i followed rounceby and marnstam he answered i knew them when i was abroad studying crimei could tell you a good deal about both those men if it were worth whileand i knew when they hired a big motor car and engaged a crook to drive it that they were worth following i saw the trial of the flying machine and when they started off with young franklin i followed on a motor bicycle i fished him out of the tarn where they left him for dead brought him on to london and made my own terms with him  what about the body which was found in the longthorp tarn she asked  i had that telegram sent myself peter ruff answered  she looked at him severely  you went out of your way to make a fool of john dory she said frowning at him  that i admit he answered  it seems to me she continued that that after all has been the chief object of the whole affair i do not see that wethat is the firmprofit in the least  peter ruff chuckled  weve got a fourth share in the franklin flying machine he answered and im hanged if id sell it for a hundred thousand pounds  youve taken advantage of that young mans gratitude she declared  peter ruff shook his head  i earned the money he answered    chapter iv the indiscretion of letty shaw   amidst a storm of whispered criticisms the general opinion was that letty shaw was a silly little fool who ought to have known better when she had entered the restaurant a few minutes before midnight followed by austen abbott every one looked to see a third person following them no third person however appeared gustav himself conducted them to a small table laid for two covered with pink roses and handed his fair client the menu of a specially ordered supper there was no gainsaying the fact that letty and her escort proposed supping alone  the cafe at the milan was without doubt the fashionable rendezvous of the moment for those ladies connected with the stage who after their performance had not the time or the inclination to make the conventional toilet demanded by the larger restaurants letty shaw being one of the principal ornaments of the musical comedy stage was well known to every one in the room there was scarcely a person there who within the last fortnight had not found an opportunity of congratulating her upon her engagement to captain the honourable brian sotherst sotherst was rich and one of the most popular young men about town letty shaw although she had had one or two harmless flirtations was well known as a selfrespecting and hardworking young actress who loved her work and against whom no one had ever had a word to say consequently the shock was all the greater when within a fortnight of her engagement she was thus to be seen openly supping alone with the most notorious woman hunter about towna man of bad reputation a man too towards whom sotherst was known to have a special aversion nothing but a break with sotherst or a fit of temporary insanity seemed to explain even inadequately the situation  her best friendthe friend who knew her and believed in herrose to her feet and came sailing down the room she nodded gaily to abbott whom she hated and whom she had not recognized for years and laid her hand upon lettys arm  wheres brian she asked  letty shrugged her shouldersit was not altogether a natural gesture  on duty tonight she answered  her best friend paused for a moment  come over and join our party both of you she said dicky pennells here and gracie marshjust landed theyd love to meet you  letty shook her head slowly there was a look in her face which even her best friend did not understand  im afraid that we cant do that she said i am mr abbotts guest  and tonight austen abbott intervened looking up at the woman who stood between them i am not disposed to share miss shaw with anybody  her best friend could do no more than shake her head and go away the two were left alone for the rest of the evening when they departed together people who knew felt that a whiff of tragedy had passed through the room nobody understoodor pretended to understand even before her engagement letty had never been known to sup alone with a man that she should do so now and with this particular man was preposterous  something will come of it her best friend murmured sadly as she watched austen abbott help his companion on with her cloak  something did   peter ruff rose at his accustomed time the following morning and attired himself if possible with more than his usual care he wore the grey suit which he had carefully put out the night before but he hesitated long between the rival appeals of a red tie with white spots and a plain mauve one he finally chose the latter finding that it harmonised more satisfactorily with his socks and after a final survey of himself in the lookingglass he entered the next room where his coffee was set out upon a small round table near the fire together with his letters and newspapers  peter ruff was after all like the rest of us a creature of habit he made an invariable rule of glancing through the newspapers before he paid any regard at all to his letters or his breakfast in the absence of anything of a particularly sensational character he then opened his letters in leisurely fashion and went back afterwards to the newspaper as he finished his meal this morning however both his breakfast and letters remained for some time untouched the first paragraph which caught his eye as he shook open the daily telegraph was sufficiently absorbing there it was in great black type         terrible tragedy in the flat of a wellknown actress                    austen abbott shot dead                   arrest of captain sotherst  beyond the inevitable shock which is always associated with the taking of life and the unusual position of the people concerned in it there was little in the brief account of the incident to excite the imagination a policeman on the pavement outside the flat in which miss shaw and her mother lived fancied that he heard about two oclock in the morning the report of a revolver shot as nothing further transpired and as the sound was very indistinct he did not at once enter the building but kept it so far as possible under observation about twenty minutes later a young gentleman in evening dress came out into the street and the policeman noticed at once that he was carrying a small revolver which he attempted to conceal the constable thereupon whistled for his sergeant and accompanied by the young gentlemanwho made no effort to escapeascended to miss shaws rooms where the body of austen abbott was discovered lying upon the threshold of the sitting room with a small bullet mark through the forehead the inmates of the house were aroused and a doctor sent for the deceased man was identified as austen abbotta wellknown actorand the man under arrest gave his name at once as captain the honourable brian sotherst peter ruff sighed as he laid down the paper the case seemed to him perfectly clear and his sympathies were altogether with the young officer who had taken the law into his own hands he knew nothing of miss letty shaw and consequently did her perhaps less than justice in his thoughts of austen abbott on the other hand he knew a great dealand nothing of good it was absurd after all that any one should be punished for killing such a brute  he descended a few minutes later to his office and found miss brown busy arranging a bowl of violets upon his desk  isnt it horrible she cried as he entered carrying a bundle of papers under his arm i never have had such a shock  do you know any of them then peter ruff asked straightening his tie in the mirror  of course she answered why i was in the same company as letty shaw for a year i was at the milan too last night letty was there having supper alone with austen abbott we all said that thered be trouble but of course we never dreamed of this isnt there any chance for him peter cant he get off  peter ruff shook his head  im afraid not he answered they may be able to bring evidence of a quarrel and reduce it to manslaughter but what youve just told me about this supper party makes it all the worse it will come out in the evidence of course  captain sotherst is such a dear miss brown declared and so goodlooking and as for that brute austen abbott he ought to have been shot long ago  peter ruff seated himself before his desk and hitched up his trousers at the knees  no doubt you are right violet he said but people go about these things so foolishly to me it is simply exasperating to reflect how little use is made of persons such as myself whose profession in life it is to arrange these little matters take the present case for example captain sotherst had only to lay these facts before me and austen abbott was a ruined man i could have arranged the affair for him in halfadozen different ways whereas now it must be a life for a lifethe life of an honest young english gentleman for that of a creature who should have been kicked out of the world as vermin i have some letters give you violet if you please  she swung round in her chair reluctantly  i cant help thinking of that poor young fellow she said with a sigh  sentiment after office hours if you please said peter  then there came a knock at the door   his visitor lifted her veil and peter ruff recognized her immediately  what can i do for you lady mary he asked  she saw the recognition in his eyes even before he spoke and wondered at it  you know me she exclaimed  i know most people he answered drily it is part of my profession  tell meyou are mr peter ruff she said the famous specialist in the detection of crime you know that brian sotherst is my brother  yes he said i know it i am sorryvery sorry indeed  he handed her a chair she seated herself with a little tightening of the lips  i want more than sympathy from you mr ruff she warned him i want your help  it is my profession he admitted but your brothers case makes intervention difficult does it not  you mean she began  your brother himself does not deny his guilt i understand  he has not denied it she answeredvery likely he will not do so before the magistratebut neither has he admitted it mr ruff you are such a clever man cant you see the truth  peter ruff looked at her steadily for several moments  lady mary he said i can see what you are going to suggest you are going on the assumption that austen abbott was shot by letty shaw and that your brother is taking the thing on his shoulders  i am sure of it she declared the girl did it herself beyond a doubt brian would never have shot any one he might have horsewhipped him perhapseven beaten him to deathbut shot him in cold bloodnever  the provocation ruff began  there was no provocation she interrupted he was engaged to the girl and of course we hated it but she was an honest little thing and devoted to him  doubtless ruff admitted but all the same as you will hear before the magistrates or at the inquest she was having supper alone with austen abbott that night at the milan  lady marys eyes flashed  i dont believe it she declared  it is nevertheless true peter ruff assured her there is no shadow of doubt about it  lady mary was staggered for a few moment she seemed struggling to rearrange her thoughts  you see ruff continued the fact that miss shaw was willing to sup with austen abbott teteatete renders it more improbable that she should shoot him in her sitting room an hour or so later and then go calmly up to her mothers room as though nothing had happened  lady mary had lost some of her confidence but she was not daunted  even if we have been deceived in the girl she said thoughtfullyeven if she were disposed to flirt with other meneven then there might be a stronger motive than ever for her wishing to get rid of abbott he may have become jealous and threatened her  it is of course possible ruff assented politely your theory would at any rate account for your brothers present attitude  she looked at him steadfastly  you believe then she said that my brother shot austen abbott  i do he admitted frankly so does every man or woman of common sense in london on the facts as they are stated in the newspapers with the addition of which i have told you no other conclusion is possible  lady mary rose  then i may as well go she said tearfully  not at all peter ruff declared listen this is a matter of business with me i say that on the facts as they are known your brothers guilt appears indubitable i do not say that there may not be other facts in the background which alter the state of affairs if you wish me to search for them engage me and i will do my best  isnt that what i am here for the girl exclaimed  very well peter ruff said my services are at your disposal  you will do your bestmore than your best wont you she begged remember that he is my brothermy favourite brother  i will do what can be done peter ruff promised please sit down at that desk and write me two letters of introduction  she drew off her gloves and prepared to obey him  to whom she asked  to the solicitors who are defending your brother he said and to miss letty shaw  you mean to go and see her lady mary asked doubtfully  naturally peter ruff answered if your supposition is correct she might easily give herself away under a little subtle crossexamination it is my business to know how to ask people questions in such a way that if they do not speak the truth their words give some indication of it if she is innocent i shall know that i have to make my effort in another direction  what other direction can there be lady mary asked dismally  peter ruff said nothing he was too kindhearted to kindle false hopes  its a hopeless case of course miss brown remarked after lady mary had departed  im afraid so peter ruff answered still i must earn my money please get some one to take you to supper tonight at the milan and see if you can pick up any scandal  about letty she asked  about either of them he answered particularly i should like to know if any explanation has cropped up of her supping alone with austen abbott  i dont see why you cant take me yourself she remarked you are on the side of the law this time at any rate  i will he answered after a moments hesitation i will call for you at eleven oclock tonight  he rose and closed his desk emphatically  you are going out she asked  i am going to see miss letty shaw he answered  he took a taxicab to the flats and found a handful of curious people still gazing up at the third floor the parlourmaid who answered his summons was absolutely certain that miss shaw would not see him he persuaded her after some difficulty to take in his letter while he waited in the hall when she returned she showed him into a small sitting room and pulled down the blinds  miss shaw will see you sir for a few minutes she announced in a subdued tone poor dear young lady she continued she has been crying her eyes out all the morning  no wonder peter ruff said sympathetically its a terrible business this  one of the nicest young men as ever walked the girl declared firmly as for that brute he deserved all hes got and more  peter ruff was left alone for nearly a quarter of an hour then the door was softly opened and letty shaw entered there was no doubt whatever about her suffering ruff who had seen her only lately at the theatre was shocked under her eyes were blacker lines than her pencil had ever traced not only was she ghastly pale but her face seemed wan and shrunken she spoke to him the moment she entered leaning with on hand upon the sideboard  lady mary writes that you want to help us she said how can you how is it possible  even her voice had gone she spoke hoarsely and as though short of breath her eyes searched his face feverishly it seemed cruelty not to answer her at once and peter ruff was not a cruel man nevertheless he remained silent and it seemed to her that his eyes were like points of fire upon her face  what is the matter she cried with breaking voice what have you come for why dont you speak to me  madam peter ruff said i should like to help you and i will do what i can but in order that i may do so it is necessary that you should answer me two questionstruthfully  her eyes grew wider it was the face of a terrified child  why not she exclaimed what have i to conceal  peter ruffs expression never changed there was nothing about him as he stood there with his hands behind him his head thrown a little forward in the least inspiringnothing calculated to terrify the most timid person yet the girl looked at him with the eyes of a frightened bird  remember then he continued smoothly that what you say to me is sacred you and i are alone without witnesses or eavesdroppers was it brian sotherst who shot abbottor was it you  she gave a little cry her hands clasped the sides of her head in horror  i she exclaimed i god help me  he waited in a moment she looked up  you cannot believe that she said with a calmness for which he was scarcely prepared it is absurd i left the room by the inner door as he took up his hat to step out into the hall  incidentally he askedthis is not my other question mindwhy did you not let him out yourself  we had disagreed she answered curtly  peter ruff bent his head in assent  i see he remarked you had disagreed abbott probably hoped that you would relent so he waited for a few minutes brian sotherst who had escaped from his engagement in time he thought to come and wish you good night must have walked in and found him there by the bye how would captain sotherst get in  he had a key the girl answered my mother lives here with me and we have only one maid it was more convenient i gave him one washed in gold for a birthday present only a few days ago  thank you peter ruff said the revolver i understand was your property  she nodded  it was a present from brian she said he gave it to me in a joke and i had it on the table with some other curiosities  the first question peter ruff said is disposed of may i proceed to the second  the girl moistened her lips  yes she answered  why did you sup alone with austen abbott last night  she shrank a little away  why should i not she asked  you have been on the stage my dear miss shaw peter ruff continued for between four and five years during the whole of that time it has been your very wise habit to join supper parties of course when the company was agreeable to you but to sup alone with no man am i not right  you seem to know a great deal about me she faltered  am i not right he repeated  yes  you break your rule for the first time peter ruff continued in favour of a man of notoriously bad character a few weeks after the announcement of your engagement to an honourable young english gentleman you know very well the construction likely to be put upon your behaviouryou of all people would be the most likely to appreciate the risk you ran why did you run it in other words i repeat my question why did you sup alone with austen abbott last night  all this time she had been standing she came a little forward now and threw herself into an easychair  it doesnt help she exclaimed all this doesnt help  nor can i help you then peter ruff said stretching out his hand for his hat  she waved to him to put it down  i will tell you she said it has nothing to do with the case but since you ask you shall know there is a dear little girl in our companyfluffy dean we all call heronly eighteen years old we all love her she is so sweet and just like i was when i first went on the stage only much nicer she is very pretty she has no money and she is such an affectionate little dear that although she is as good as gold we are all terrified for her sake whenever she makes acquaintances several of us who are most interested made a sort of covenant we all took it in turns to look after her and try to see that she did not meet any one she shouldnt yet for all our precautions austen abbott got hold of her and turned her silly little head he was a man of experience and she was only a child she wouldnt listen to usshe wouldnt hear a word against him i took what seemed to me to be the only chance i went to him myselfi begged for mercy i begged him to spare the child i swore that ifanything happened to her i would start a crusade against him i would pledge my word that he should be cut by every decent man and woman on the stage he listened to what i had to say and at first he only smiled when i had finished he made me an offer he said that if i would sup with him alone at the milan and permit him to escort me home afterwards he would spare the child one further condition he madethat i was to tell no one why i did it it was the mans brutal vanity i made the promise but i break it now you have asked me and i have told you i went through with the supper although i hated it i let him come in for a drink as though he had been a friend then he tried to make love to me i took the opportunity of telling him exactly what i thought of him then i showed him the door and left him afterwardsafterwardsbrian came in they must have met upon the very threshold  peter ruff took up his hat  thank you he said  you see she continued drearily that it all has very little to do with the case i meant to keep it to myself because of course apart from anything else apart from brians meeting him coming out of my rooms it supplies an additional cause for anger on brians part  i see he answered i am much obliged to you miss shaw believe me that you have my sincere sympathy  peter ruffs farewell words were unheard letty had fallen forward in her chair her head buried in her hands  peter ruff went to berkeley square and found lady mary waiting for him sir william trencham the great solicitor was with her lady mary introduced the two men all the time she was anxiously watching ruffs face  mr ruff has been to see miss shaw she explained to sir william mr ruff tell me quickly she continued with her hand upon his shoulder did she say anything did you find anything out  he shook his head  no he said i found nothing out  you dont think then lady mary gasped that there is any chanceof getting her to confessthat she did it herself  why should she have done it herself peter ruff asked she admits that the man tried to make love to her she simply left him she was in her own home with her mother and servant within call there was no struggle in the roomwe know that there was no necessity for any  have you made any other enquiries lady mary asked  the few which i have made peter ruff answered gravely point all in the same direction i ascertained at the milan that your brother called there late last night and that he heard miss shaw had been supping alone with austen abbott he followed them home i have ascertained too that he had a key to miss shaws flat he apparently met austen abbott upon the threshold  lady mary covered her face with her hands she seemed to read in ruffs words the verdict of the two menthe verdict of common sense nevertheless he made one more request before leaving  i should like to see captain sotherst if you can get me an order he said to sir william  you can go with me tomorrow morning the lawyer answered the proceedings this morning of course were simply formal until after the inquest it will be easy to arrange an interview  lady mary looked up quickly  there is still something in your mind then she asked you think that there is a bare chance  there is always the hundredth chance peter ruff replied  peter ruff and miss brown supped at the milan that night as they had arranged but it was not a cheerful evening brian sotherst had been very popular among letty shaws little circle of friends and the general feeling was one of horror and consternation at this thing which had befallen him austen abbot too was known to all of them and although a good many of the menand even the womenwere outspoken enough to declare at once that it served him right nevertheless the shock of deathdeath without a seconds warninghad a paralysing effect even upon those who were his severest critics violet brown spoke to a few of her friendsintroduced peter ruff here and therebut nothing was said which could throw in any way even the glimmerings of a new light upon the tragedy it all seemed too hopelessly and fatally obvious  about twenty minutes before closing time the habitues of the place were provided with something in the nature of a sensation a little party entered who seemed altogether free from the general air of gloom foremost among them was a very young and exceedingly pretty girl with light golden hair waved in front of her forehead deep blue eyes and the slight airy figure of a child she was accompanied by another young woman whose appearance was a little too obvious to be prepossessing and three or four young mendark cleanshaven dressed with the irritating exactness of their classyoung stockbrokers or boys about town miss browns eyes grew very wide open  what a little beast she exclaimed  who peter ruff asked  that pretty girl there she answeredfluffy dean her name is she is letty shaws protege and she wouldnt have dreamed of allowing her to come out with a crowd like that tonight of all nights she continued indignantly when letty is away  peter ruff was interested  so that is miss fluffy dean he remarked looking at her curiously she seems a little excited  shes a horrid little wretch miss brown declared i hope that some one will tell letty and that she will drop her now a girl who would do such a thing as that when letty is in such trouble isnt worth taking care of just listen to them all  they were certainly becoming a little boisterous a magnum of champagne was being opened fluffy deans cheeks were already flushed and her eyes glittering every one at the table was talking a great deal and drinking toasts  this is the end of fluffy dean violet brown said severely i hate to be uncharitable but it serves her right  peter ruff paid his bill  let us go he said  in the taxicab on their way back to miss browns rooms ruff was unusually silent but just before he said good night to heron the pavement in fact outside her front doorhe asked a question  violet he said would you like to play detective for an hour or two  she looked at him in some surprise  you know i always like to help in anything thats going she said  letty shaw was an australian wasnt she he asked  yes  she was born there and lived there till she was nearly eighteenis that true he asked again  quite true miss brown answered  you know the offices of the p o line of steamers in pall mall he asked  she nodded  well  get a sailing list to australiathere should be a boat going thursday present yourself as a prospective passenger see how many young women alone there are going out and ask their names incidentally put in a little spare time watching the office  she looked at him with parted lips and wideopen eyes  do you think she began  he shook her hand warmly and stepped back into the taxicab  good night he said no questions please i shant expect you at the office at the usual time tomorrow at any rate telephone or run around if youve anything to tell me  the taxicab disappeared round the corner of the street miss brown was standing still upon the pavement with the latchkey in her hand      it was afternoon before the inquest on the body of austen abbott and there was gathered together in letty shaws parlor a curiously assorted little group of people there was miss shaw herselfor rather what seemed to be the ghost of herselfand her mother lady mary and sir william trencham peter ruff and violet brownand mr john dory the eyes of all of them were fixed upon peter ruff who was the latest arrival he stood in the middle of the room calmly taking off his gloves and glancing complacently down at his wellcreased trousers  lady mary he said and miss shaw i know that you are both anxious for me to explain why i ask you to meet me here this afternoon and why i also requested my friend mr dory from scotland yard who has charge of the case against captain sotherst to be present i will tell you  mr dory nodded a little impatiently  unless you have something very definite to say he remarked i think it would be as well to postpone any general discussion of this matter until after the inquest i must warn you that so far as i personally am concerned i must absolutely decline to allude to the subject at all it would be most unprofessional  i have something definite to say peter ruff declared mildly  lady marys eyes flashed with hopeletty shaw leaned forward in her chair with white drawn face  let it be understood peter ruff said with a slight note of gravity creeping into his tone that i am here solely as the agent of lady mary sotherst i am paid and employed by her my sole object is on her behalf therefore to discover proof of the innocence of captain sotherst i take it however he added turning towards the drooping figure in the easychair that miss shaw is as anxious to have the truth known  of course of course she murmured  in france peter ruff continued there is a somewhat curious custom which despite a certain theatricality yet has its points the scene of a crime is visited and its events so far as may be reconstructed let us suppose for a moment that we are now engaged upon something of the sort  letty shaw shrank back in her chair her thin white fingers were gripping its sides her eyes seemed to look upon terrible things  it is tooawful she faltered  madam peter ruff said firmly we seek the truth be so good as to humour me in this dory will you go to the front door stand upon the matso you are captain sotherstyou have just entered i am austen abbott you miss shaw have just ordered me from the room you see i move toward the door i open itso miss shaw he added turning swiftly towards her once more will you assure me that every one who was in the flat that night with the exception of your domestic servant is present now  yes she murmured  good then who he asked suddenly pointing to a door on the leftwho is in that room  they had all crowded after him to the thresholdthronging around him as he stood face to face with john dory his finger never waveredit was pointing steadily towards that closed door a few feet to the left suddenly letty shaw rushed past them with a loud shriek  you shall not go in she cried what business is it of his  she stood with her back to the door her arms outstretched like a cross her cheeks were livid her eyes seemed starting from her head  peter ruff and john dory laid their hands upon the girls wrists she clung to her place frantically she was dragged from it screaming peter ruff as was his right entered first almost immediately he turned round and his face was very grave  something has happened in here i am afraid he said please come in quietly  on the bed lay fluffy dean fully dressedmotionless one hand hung down toward the floorfrom the lifeless fingers a little phial had slipped the room was full of trunks addressed to                             miss smith                       passenger to melborne                          ss caroline  peter ruff moved over toward the bed and took up a piece of paper upon which were scribbled a few lines in pencil  i think he said that i must read these aloud you all have a right to hear them  no one spoke he continued   forgive me letty but i cannot go to australia they would only bring me back when i remember that awful moment my brain burnsi feel that i am going mad some day i should do thisbetter now give my love to the girls  fluffy   they sent for a doctor and john dory rang up scotland yard letty shaw had fainted and had been carried to her room while they waited about in strange halfbenumbed excitement peter ruff once more spoke to them  the reconstruction is easy enough now he remarked the partition between this sitting room and that little bedroom is only an artificial onesomething almost as flimsy as a screen you see he continued tapping with his knuckles you can almost put your hand through it if you look a little lower down you will see where an opening has been made fluffy dean was being taken care of by miss shawstaying with her here even miss dean hears her lovers voice in this roomhears him pleading with miss shaw on he night of the murder she has been sent home early from the theatre and it is just possible that she saw or had been told that austen abbott had fetched miss shaw after the performance and had taken her to supper she was mad with anger and jealousy the revolver was there upon the table with a silver box of cartridges she possessed herself of it and waited in her room what she heard proved at least her lovers infidelity she stood there at her door waiting when austen abbott comes out she shoots throws the revolver at him closes her door and goes off into a faint perhaps she hears footstepsa key in the door at any rate captain sotherst arrives a few minutes later he finds half in the hall half on the threshold of the sitting room austen abbott dead and miss shaws revolver by the side of him if he had been a wise young man he would have aroused the household why he did not do so we can perhaps guess he put two and two together a little too quickly it is certain that he believed that the dead man had been shot by his fiancee his first thought was to get rid of the revolver at any rate he walked down to the street with it in his hand and was promptly arrested by the policeman who had heard the shot naturally he refused to plead because he believed that miss shaw had killed the man probably in selfdefence she at first believed her lover guilty and when afterwards fluffy dean confessed she with feminine lack of common sense was trying to get the girl out of the country before telling the truth a visit of hers to the office of the steamship company gave me the clue i required  lady mary grasped both his hands  and scotland yard she exclaimed with a withering glance at dory have done their best to hang my brother  peter ruff raised his eyebrows  dear lady mary he said remember that it is the business of scotland yard to find a man guilty it is mine when i am employed for that purpose to find him innocent you must not be too hard upon my friend mr dory he and i seem to come up against each other a little too often as it is  a little too often john dory repeated softly but one cannot tell dont believe lady mary he added that we ever want to kill an innocent man  it is your profession though she answered to find criminalsand his she added touching peter ruff on the shoulder to look for the truth  peter ruff bowed lowthe compliment pleased him    chapter v delilah from streatham   it was a favourite theory with peter ruff that the morning papers received very insufficient consideration from the majority of the british public a glance at the headlines and a few of the spiciest paragraphs a vague look at the leading article and the sheets were thrown away to make room for more interesting literature it was not so with peter ruff novels he very seldom readhe did not in fact appreciate the necessity for their existence the whole epitome of modern life was he argued to be found among the columns of the daily press the police news perhaps was his favourite study but he did not neglect the advertisements it followed therefore as a matter of course that the appeal of m in the personal column of the daily mail was read by him on the morning of its appearanceread not once only nor twiceit was a paragraph which had its own peculiar interest for him  mr spencer fitzgerald if still in england is requested to communicate with m at vagalis library cooks alley ledham street soho    peter ruff laid the paper down upon his desk and looked steadily at a box of indiarubber bands almost his fingers as he parted with the newspaper had seemed to be shaking his eyes were certainly set in an unusually retrospective stare who was this who sought to probe his past to renew an acquaintance with a dead personality m could be but one person what did she want of him was it possible that after all a little flame of sentiment had been kept alight in her bosom toothat in the quiet moments her thoughts had turned towards him as his had so often done to her then a sudden ideaan ugly thoughtdrove the tenderness from his face she was no longer maud barnesshe was mrs john dory and john dory was his enemy could there be treachery lurking beneath those simple lines things had not gone well with john dory lately somehow or other his cases seemed to have crumpled into dust he was no longer held in the same esteem at headquarters yet could even john dory stoop to such means as these  he turned in his chair  miss brown he said please take your pencil  i am quite ready sir she answered  he marked the advertisement with a ring and passed it to her  reply to that as follows he said  dear sir  i notice in the daily mail of this morning that you are enquiring through the personal column for the whereabouts of mr spencer fitzgerald that gentleman has been a client of mine and i have been in occasional communication with him if you will inform me of the nature of your business i may perhaps be able to put you in touch with mr fitzgerald you will understand however that under the circumstances i shall require proofs of your good faith  truly yours  peter ruff  miss brown glanced through the advertisement and closed her notebook with a little snap  did you saydear sir she asked  certainly peter ruff answered  and you really mean she continued with obvious disapproval that i am to send this  i do not usually waste my time peter ruff reminded her mildly by giving you down communications destined for the wastepaper basket  she turned unwillingly to her machine  mr fitzgerald is very much better where he is she remarked  that depends he answered  she adjusted a sheet of paper into her typewriter  who do you suppose m is she asked  with your assistance peter ruff remarked a little sarcasticallywith your very kind assistancei propose to find out  miss brown sniffed and banged at the keys of her typewriter  that coaldealers girl from streatham she murmured to herself    a few politely worded letters were exchanged m declined to reveal her identity but made an appointment to visit mr ruff at his office the morning she was expected he wore an entirely new suit of clothes and was palpably nervous miss brown who had arrived a little late sat with her back turned upon him and ignored even his usual morning greeting the atmosphere of the office was decidedly chilly fortunately the expected visitor arrived early  peter ruff rose to receive his former sweetheart with an agitation perforce concealed yet to him poignant indeed for it was indeed maud who entered the room and came towards him with carefully studied embarrassment and half doubtfully extended hand he did not see the cheap millinery the slightly more developed figure the passing of that insipid prettiness which had once charmed him into the bloom of an overearly maturity his eyes were blinded with that sort of masculine chivalrythe heritage only of fools and very clever menwhich takes no note of such things it was miss brown who from her place in a corner of the room ran over the cheap attractions of this unwelcome visitor with an expression of scornful wonderwho understood the tinsel of her jewellery the cheap shoddiness of her readymade gown who appreciated with merciless judgment her mincing speech her cheap flirtatious method  maud with a diffidence not altogether assumed had accepted the chair which peter ruff had placed for her and sat fidgeting for a moment with the imitation gold purse which she was carrying  i am sure mr ruff she said looking demurely into her lap i ought not to have come here i feel terribly guilty its such an uncomfortable sort of position too isnt it  i am sorry that you find it so peter ruff said if there is anything i can do  you are very kind she murmured half raising her eyes to his and dropping them again but you see we are perfect strangers to one another you dont know me at all do you and i have only heard of you through the newspapers you might think all sorts of things about my coming here to make enquiries about a gentleman  i can assure you peter ruff said sincerely that you need have no fearsno fears at all just speak to me quite frankly mr fitzgerald was a friend of yours was he not  maud simpered  he was more than that she answered looking down we were engaged to be married  peter ruff sighed  i knew all about it he declared fitzgerald used to tell me everything  you were his friend she asked looking him in the face  i was peter ruff answered fervently his best friend no one was more grieved than i about thatlittle mistake  she sighed  in some ways she remarked softly you remind me of him  you could scarcely say anything peter ruff murmured which would give me more pleasure i am flattered  she shook her head  it isnt flattery she said its the truth you may be a few years older and spencer had a very nice moustache which you havent but you are really not unlike mr ruff do tell me where he is  peter ruff coughed  you must remember he said that mr fitzgeralds absence was caused by events of a somewhat unfortunate character  i know all about it she answered with a little sigh  you can appreciate the fact therefore peter ruff continued that as his friend and wellwisher i can scarcely disclose his whereabouts without his permission will you tell me exactly why you want to meet him again  she blushedlooked down and up againbetrayed in fact all the signs of confusion which might have been expected from her  must i tell you that she asked  you are married are you not peter ruff asked looking down at her wedding ring  she bit her lip with vexation what a fool she had been not to take it off  yes well nothat is to say  never mind peter ruff interrupted please dont think that i want to crossexamine you i only asked these questions because i have a sincere regard for fitzgerald i know how fond he was of you and i cannot see what there is to be gained from his point of view by reopening old wounds  i suppose then she remarked looking at him in such a manner that miss brown had to cover her mouth with her hands to prevent her screaming outi suppose you are one of those who think it a crime for a woman who is married even to want to see for a few moments an old sweetheart  on the contrary peter ruff answered as a bachelor i have no convictions of any sort upon the subject  she sighed  i am glad of that she said  i am to understand then peter ruff remarked that your reason for wishing to meet mr fitzgerald again is purely a sentimental one  i am afraid it is she murmured i have thought of him so often lately he was such a dear she declared with enthusiasm  i have never been sufficiently thankful she continued that he got away that night at the time i was very angry but often since then i have wished that i could have passed out with him into the fog and been lostbut i mustnt talk like this please dont misunderstand me mr ruff i am happily marriedquite happily married  peter ruff sighed  my friend fitzgerald he remarked will be glad to hear that  maud fidgeted it was not quite the effect she had intended to produce  of course she remarked looking away with a pensive air one has regrets  regrets peter ruff murmured  mr dory is not well off she continued and i am afraid that i am very fond of life and going about and everything is so expensive nowadays then i dont like his profession i think it is hateful to be always trying to catch people and put them in prisondont you mr ruff  peter ruff smiled  naturally he answered your husband and i work from the opposite poles of life he is always seeking to make criminals of the people whom i am always trying to prove worthy members of society  how noble maud exclaimed clasping her hands and looking up at him so much more remunerative too i should think she added after a moments pause  naturally peter ruff admitted a private individual will pay more to escape from the clutches of the law than the law will to secure its victims scotland yard expects them to come into its arms automaticallyregards them as a perquisite of its existence  i wish my husband were in your profession mr ruff maud said with a sidelong glance of her blue eyes which she had always found so effective upon her various admirers i am sure that i should be a great deal fonder of him  peter ruff leaned forward in his chair he too had expressive eyes at times  madam he saidand stopped but maud blushed all the same  she looked down into her lap  we are forgetting mr fitzgerald she murmured  peter ruff glanced up at the clock  it is a long story he said are you in a hurry mrs dory  not at all she assured him unless you want to close you office or anything it must be nearly one oclock  i wonder he asked if you would do me the honour of lunching with me we might go to the princes or the carltonwhichever you prefer i will promise to talk about mr fitzgerald all the time  oh i couldnt maud declared with a little gasp at leastwell im sure i dont know  you have no engagement for luncheon peter ruff asked quietly  oh no she answered but you see we live so quietly i have never been to one of those places id love to gobut if we were seen wouldnt people talk  peter ruff smiled just the same dear modest little thing  i can assure you he said that nothing whatever could be said against our lunching together people are not so strict nowadays you know and a married lady has always a great deal of latitude  she looked up at him with a dazzling smile  id simply love to go to princes she declared  cat miss brown murmured as peter ruff and his client left the room together  peter ruff returned from his luncheon in no very jubilant state of mind for some time he sat in his easychair with his legs crossed and his finger tips pressed close together looking steadily into space contrary to his usual custom he did not smoke miss brown watched him from behind her machine  disenchanted she asked calmly  peter ruff did not reply for several moments  i am afraid he admitted hesitatingly that marriage with john dory haswell not had a beneficial effect she allowed me for instance to hold her hand in the cab maud would never have permitted a stranger to take such a liberty in the old days  miss brown smiled curiously  is that all she asked  peter ruff felt that he was in the confessional  she certainly did seem he admitted to enjoy her champagne a great deal and she talked about her dull life at home a little more perhaps than was discreet to one who was presumably a stranger she was curious too about dining out poor little girl though just fancy john dory has never taken her anywhere but to lyons or an a b c and the pit of a theatre  which evening is it to be miss brown asked  something was said about thursday peter ruff admitted  and her husband miss brown enquired  he happens to be in glasgow for a few days peter ruff answered  miss brown looked at her employer steadily she addressed him by his christian name which was a thing she very seldom did in office hours  peter she said are you going to let that woman make a fool of you  he raised his eyebrows  go on he said say anything you want toonly if you please dont speak disrespectfully of maud  hasnt it ever occurred to you at all miss brown continued rising to her feet that this maud or whatever you want to call her may be playing a lowdown game of her husbands he hates you and he has vague suspicions cant you see that he is probably making use of your infatuation for his common middleclass little wife to try and get you to give yourself away cant you see it peter you are not going to tell me that you are so blind as all that  i must admit he answered with a sigh that although i think you go altogether too far some suspicion of the sort has interfered with my perfect enjoyment of the morning  miss brown drew a little breath of relief after all then his folly was not so consummate as it had seemed  what are you going to do about it then she asked  peter ruff coughedhe seemed in an unusually amenable frame of mind and submitted to crossexamination without murmur  the subject of mr spencer fitzgerald he remarked seemed somehow or other to drop into the background during our luncheon i propose therefore to continue to offer to mrs john dory my most respectful admiration if she accepts my friendship and is satisfied with it so much the better i must admit that it would give me a great deal of pleasure to be her occasional companionat such times when her husband happens to be in glasgow  and supposing miss brown asked that this is not all she wantssupposing for instance that she persists in her desire for information concerning mr spencer fitzgerald  then peter ruff admitted im afraid that i must conclude that her unchivalrous clod of a husband has indeed stooped to make a fool of her  and in that case miss brown demanded what shall you do  i was just thinking that out peter ruff said mildly when you spoke  the friendship of peter ruff with the wife of his enemy certainly appeared to progress in most satisfactory fashion the dinner and visit to the theatre duly took place mr ruff was afterwards permitted to offer a slight supper and to accompany his fair companion a portion of the way home in a taxicab she made several halfhearted attempts to return to the subject of spencer fitzgerald but her companion had been able on each occasion to avoid the subject whether or not she was the victim of her husbands guile there was no question about the reality of her enjoyment during the evening ruff when he remembered the flash of her eyes across the table the touch of her fingers in the taxi was almost content to believe her false to her truant lover if only she had not been married to john dory he realised with a little sigh that he might have taught her to forget that such a person existed as spencer fitzgerald might have induced her to become mrs peter ruff  on their next meeting however peter ruff was forced to realise that his secretarys instinct had not misled her it was alas no personal and sentimental regrets for her former lover which had brought the fair maud to his office the pleasures of her eveningthey dined at romanos and had a box at the empirewere insufficient this time to keep her from recurring continually to the subject of her vanished lover he tried strategyjealousy amongst other things  supposing he said as they sat quite close to one another in the box during the interval supposing i were to induce our friend to come to londoni imagine he would be fairly safe now if he kept out of your husbands waywhat would happen to me  you she murmured glancing at him from behind her fan and then dropping her eyes  certainlyme he continued dont you think that i should be doing myself a very ill turn if i brought you two together i have very few friends and i cannot afford to lose one i am quite sure that you still care for him  she shook her head  not a scrap she declared  then why did you put that advertisement in the paper ruff asked with smooth but swift directness  she was not quick enough to parry his question he read the truth in her disconcerted face knowing it now for a certainty he hastened to her aid  forgive me he said looking away i should not have asked that questionit is not my business i will write to fitzgerald i will tell him that you want to see him and that i think it would be safe for him to come to london  maud recovered herself quickly she thanked him with her eyes as well as her words  and you neednt be jealous really she whispered behind her fan i only want to see him once for a few minutesto ask a question after that i dont care what becomes of him  a poor sort of delilah really with her flushed face her too elaborately coiffured hair with its ugly ornament her readymade evening dress with its cheap attempts at smartness her cleaned gloves indifferent shoes but peter ruff thought otherwise  you mean that after i have found him for you you will still come out with me again sometimes he asked wistfully  of course she answered whenever i can without john knowing she added with an unpleasant little laugh if you only knew how i loved the music and the theatres and this sort of life what a good time your wife would have mr ruff she added archly  it was no joking matter with him he had to remember that he was in effect her tool that she was making use of him willing to betray her former lover at her husbands bidding it was enough to make him on his side burn for revenge yet he put the thought away from him with a shiver she was still the woman he had lovedshe was still sacred to him that night he pleaded an engagement and sent her home in a taxicab alone  john dory waiting patiently at home for his wifes return felt a certain uneasiness when she swept into their little sitting room in all her cheap splendour with flushed cheeksan obvious air of satisfaction with herself and disdain for her immediate surroundings john dory was a commonplace looking manthe absence of his collar and his somewhat shabby carpet slippers did not improve his appearance he had neglected to shave and he was drinking beer at headquarters he was not considered quite the smart young officer which he had once shown signs of becoming he looked at his wife with darkening face and his wife on her part thought of peter ruff in his immaculate evening clothes  well he remarked grumblingly you seem to find a good deal of pleasure in this gadding about  she threw her soiled fan on the table  if i do she answered you are not the one to sit there and reproach me with it are you  its gone far enough anyway john dory said its gone further than i meant it to go understand me maudits finished ill find your old sweetheart for myself  she laughed heartily  you neednt trouble she answered with a little toss of the head i am not such a fool as you seem to think me mr ruff has made an appointment with him  there was a change in john dorys face the mans eyes were brightthey almost glittered  you mean that your friend mr ruff is going to produce spencer fitzgerald he exclaimed  he has promised to she answered john she declared throwing herself into an easychair i feel horrid about it i wonder what mr ruff will think when he knows  you can feel how you like john dory answered bluntly so long as i get the handcuffs on spencer fitzgeralds wrists  she shuddered she looked at her husband with distaste  dont talk about it she begged sharply it makes me feel the meanest creature that ever crawled i cant help feeling too that mr ruff will think me a wretchquite the gentleman hes been all the time i never knew any one half so nice  john dory set down his empty glass  i wonder he said looking at her thoughtfully what made him take such a fancy to you rather sudden wasnt it eh  maud tossed her head  i dont see anything so wonderful about that she declared  listen to me maud her husband said rising to his feet you arent a foolnot quite youve spent some time with peter ruff how muchthink carefullyhow much does he remind you of spencer fitzgerald  not at all she answered promptly why he is years older and though spencer was quite the gentleman theres something about mr ruff and the way he dresses and knows his way aboutwell you can tell hes been a gentleman all his life  john dorys face fell  think again he said  she shook her head  cant see any likeness she declared he did remind me a little of him just at first though she added reflectivelylittle things he said and sort of mannerisms ive sort of lost sight of them the last few times though  when is this meeting with fitzgerald to come off john dory asked abruptly  she did not answer him at once a low triumphant smile had parted her lips  tomorrow night she said he is to meet me in mr ruffs office  at what time john dory asked  at eight oclock she answered mr ruff is keeping his office open late on purpose spencer thinks that afterwards he is going to take me out to dinner  you are sure of this john dory asked eagerly you are sure that the man ruff does not suspect you you believe he means that you shall meet fitzgerald  i am sure of it she answered he is even a little jealous she continued with an affected laugh he told mewell never mind  he told you what john dory asked  she laughed  never you mind she said i have done what you asked me anyway if mr ruff had not found me an agreeable companion he would not have bothered about getting spencer to meet me and now hes done it she added i do believe hes a little jealous  john dory glared but he said nothing it seemed to him that his hour of revenge was close at hand  it was the first occasion upon which words of this sort had passed between peter ruff and his secretary there was no denying the fact that miss violet brown was in a passion it was an hour past the time at which she usually left the office for an hour she had pleaded and peter ruff remained unmoved  you are a fool she cried to him at last i am a fool too that i have ever wasted my thoughts and time upon you why cant i make you see in every other way heaven knows you are clever enough and yet there comes this vulgar commonplace tawdry little woman from heaven knows where and makes such a fool of you that you are willing to fling away your careerto hold your wrists out for john dorys handcuffs  my dear violet peter ruff answered deprecatingly you really worry meyou do indeed  not half so much as you worry me she declared look at the time its already past seven at eight oclock mrs doryyour maudis coming in here hoping to find her old sweetheart  why not he murmured  why not indeed miss brown answered angrily dont you knowcant you believethat close on her heels will come her husbandthat mr spencer fitzgerald if ever he comes to life in this room will leave it between two policemen  peter ruff sighed  what a pessimist you are my dear violet he said  she came up to him and laid her hands upon his shoulders  peter she said i will tell you somethingi must i am fond of you peter i always have been dont make me miserable if there is no need for it tell me honestlydo you really believe in this woman  he removed her hands gently and raised them to his lips  my dear girl he said i believe in every one until i find them out i look upon suspicion as a vice but at the same time he added there are always certain precautions which one takes  what precautions can you take she cried can you sit there and make yourself invisible john dory is not a fool the moment he is in this room with the door closed behind him it is the end  we must hope not peter ruff said cheerfully there are other things which may happen you know  she turned away from him a little drearily  you do not mind if i stay she said i am not working tonight perhaps later on i may be of use  as you will he answered you will excuse me for a little time wont you i have some preparations to make  she turned her head away from him he left the room and ascended the stairs to his own apartments  eight oclock was striking from st martins church when the door of peter ruffs office was softly opened and closed again a man in a slouch hat and overcoat entered and after feeling along the wall for a moment turned up the electric light violet brown rose from her place with a little sob she stretched out her hand to him  peter she cried peter  my name the newcomer said calmly is mr spencer fitzgerald  oh listen to me she begged there is still time if you hurry think how many clever men before you have been deceived by the woman in whom they trusted please please go hurry upstairs and put those things away  madam the newcomer said i am much obliged to you for your interest but i think that you are making a mistake i have come here to meet  he stopped short there was a soft knocking at the door a stifled scream broke from violet browns lips  it is too late she cried peter peter  she sank into her chair and covered her face with her hands the door was opened and maud came in when she saw who it was who sat in peter ruffs place she gave a little cry perhaps after all she had not believed that this thing would happen  spencer she cried spencer have you really come back  he held out his hands  you are glad to see me he asked  she came slowly forward the man rose from his place and came towards her with outstretched hands then through the door came john dory and one caught a glimpse of others behind him  if my wife is not glad to see you mr spencer fitzgerald he aid in a tone from which he vainly tried to keep the note of triumph i can assure you that i am you slipped away from me cleverly at daisy villa but this time i think you will not find it so easy  maud shrank back and her husband took her place but mr spencer fitzgerald looked upon them both as one who looks upon figures in a dream miss brown rose hurriedly from her seat she came over to him and thrust her arm through his  peter she said taking his hand in hers dont shoot it isnt worth while you should have listened to me  the little man in the goldrimmed spectacles looked at her looked at mr john dory looked at the woman who was shrinking back now against the wall  really he said this is the most extraordinary situation in which i ever found myself  we will help you to realise it john dory cried and the triumph in his tone had swelled into a deeper note i came here to arrest mr fitzgerald but i hear this young lady call you peter perhaps this may be the solution  the little man struck the table with the flat of his hand  come he said this is getting a bit too thick first of allyou he said turning to miss brownmy name is not peter and i have no idea of shooting anybody as for that lady against the wall i dont know hernever saw her before in my life as for you he added turning to john dory you talk about arresting mewhat for  mr john dory smiled  there is an old warrant he said which i have in my pocket but i fancy that there are a few little things since then which we may have to enquire into  this beats me the little man declared who do you think i am  mr spencer fitzgerald to start with john dory said it seems to me not impossible that we may find another pseudonym for you  you can find as many as you like the little man answered testily but my name is james fitzgerald and i am an actor employed at the shaftesbury theatre as i can prove with the utmost ease i never called myself spencer nor to my knowledge was i ever called by such a name nor as i remarked before have i ever seen any one of you three people before with the exception of miss brown here whom i have seen on the stage  john dory grunted  it was mr spencer fitzgerald he said a clerk in howell  wilsons bookshop who leapt out of the window of daisy villa two years ago it may be mr james fitzgerald now gentlemen of your profession have a knack of changing their names  my professions as good as yours anyway the little man exclaimed we arent all fools in it my friend mr peter ruff said to me that there was a young lady whom i used to know who was anxious to meet me again and would i step around here about eight oclock here i am and all i can say is if thats the young lady i never saw her before in my life  there was a moments breathless silence then the door was softly opened violet brown went staggering back like a woman who sees a ghost she bit her lips till the blood came it was peter ruff who stood looking in upon thempeter ruff carefully dressed in evening clothes his silk hat at exactly the correct angle his coat and white kid gloves upon his arm  dear me he said you dont seem to be getting on very well mr dory he added with a note of surprise in his tone this is indeed an unexpected pleasure  the man who stood by the desk turned to him the others were stricken dumb  look here he said theres some mistake you told me to come here at eight oclock to meet a young lady whom i used to know well i never saw her before in my life he added pointing to maud theres a man there who wants to arrest melord knows what for and heres miss brown whom i have seen at the theatre several times but who never condescended to speak to me before telling me not to shoot whats it all about ruff is it a practical joke  peter ruff laid down his coat and hat and sat upon the table with his hands in his pockets  is it possible he said that i have made a mistake isnt your second name spencer  the man shook his head  my name is james fitzgerald he said i havent missed a day at the shaftesbury theatre for three years as you can find out by going round the corner i never called myself spencer i was never clerk in a bookshop and i never saw that lady before in my life  maud came out from her place against the wall and leaned eagerly forward john dory turned his head slowly towards his wife a sickening fear had arisen in his heartgripped him by the throat fooled once more and by peter ruff  it isnt spencer maud said huskily mr ruff she added turning to him you know very well that this is not the mr spencer fitzgerald whom you promised to bring here tonightmr spencer fitzgerald to whom i was once engaged  peter ruff pointed to the figure of her husband  madam he said my invitation did not include your husband  john dory took a step forward and laid his hands upon the shoulders of the man who called himself mr james fitzgerald he looked into his face long and carefully then he turned away and gripping his wife by the arm he passed out of the room the door slammed behind him the sound of heavy footsteps was heard descending to the floor below  violet brown crossed the room to where peter ruff was still sitting with a queer look upon his face and gripping him by the shoulders shook him  how dare you she exclaimed how dare you do you know that i have nearly cried my eyes out  peter ruff came back from the world into which for the moment his thoughts had taken him  violet he said you have known me for some years you have been my secretary for some months if you choose still to take me for a fool i cannot help it  but she exclaimed pointing to mr james fitzgerald  peter ruff nodded  i have been practising on him for some time he said with an air of selfsatisfaction  a thin mobile face you see and plenty of experience in the art of making up it is astonishing what one can do if one tries  mr james fitzgerald picked up his hat and coat  it was worth more than five quid he growled when i saw the handcuffs in that fellows hand i felt a cold shiver go down my spine  peter ruff counted out two banknotes and passed them to his confederate  you have earned the money he said go and spend it perhaps violet he added turning towards her i have been a little inconsiderate come and have dinner with me and forget it  she drew a little sigh  you are sure she murmured that you wouldnt rather take maud    chapter vi the little lady from servia   westward sped the little electric brougham driven without regard to police regulations or any rule of the road silent and swift wholly regardless of other vehiclesas though indeed its occupants were assuming to themselves the rights of royalty inside peter ruff a little breathless was leaning forward tying his white cravat with the aid of the little polished mirror set in the middle of the dark green cushions at his right hand was lady mary watching his proceedings with an air of agonised impatience  let me tell you she begged  kindly wait till i have tied this and put my studs in peter ruff interrupted it is impossible for me to arrive at a ball in this condition and i cannot give my whole attention to more than one thing at a time  we shall be there in five minutes she exclaimed what is the good unless you understand of your coming at all  peter ruff surveyed his tie critically fortunately it pleased him he began to press the studs into their places with firm fingers around them surged the traffic of piccadilly in front the gleaming arc of lights around hyde park corner they had several narrow escapes once the brougham swayed dangerously as they cut in on the wrong side of an island lamppost a policeman shouted after them another held up his handthe driver of the brougham took no notice  i am ready peter ruff said quietly  my younger brothermaurice she began breathlesslyyouve never met him i know but youve heard me speak of him he is private secretary to sir james wentley  minister for foreign affairs ruff asked swiftly  yes maurice wants to go in for the diplomatic service he is a dear and so clever  is it maurice who is in trouble peter ruff asked why didnt he come himself  i am trying to explain lady mary protested this afternoon he had an important paper to turn into cipher and hand over to the prime minister at the duchess of montfords dance tonight the prime minister will arrive in a motor car from the country at about two oclock and the first thing he will ask for will be that paper it has been stolen  at what time did your brother finish copying it and when did he discover its loss ruff asked with a slight air of weariness these preliminary enquiries always bored him  he finished it in his own rooms at halfpast seven lady mary answered he discovered its loss at eleven oclockdirectly he had arrived at the ball  why didnt he come to me himself peter ruff asked i like to have these particulars at first hand  he is in attendance upon sir james at the ball lady mary answered there is trouble in the east as you know and sir james is expecting dispatches tonight maurice is not allowed to leave  has he told sir james yet  he had not when i left lady mary answered if he is forced to do so it will be ruin mr ruff you must help us maurice is such a dear but a mistake like this at the very beginning of his career would be fatal here we are that is my brother waiting just inside the hall  a young man came up to them in the vestibule he was somewhat pale but otherwise perfectly selfpossessed from the shine of his glossy black hair to the tips of his patent boots he was in appearance everything that a young englishman of birth and athletic tastes could hope to be peter ruff liked the look of him he waited for no introduction but laid his hand at once upon the young mans shoulder  between seventhirty and arriving here he said drawing him on one sidequick tell me whom did you see what opportunities were there of stealing the paper and by whom  i finished it at five and twenty past seven the young man said sealed it in an official envelope and stood it up on my desk by the side of my coat and hat and muffler which my servant had laid there ready for me to put on my bedroom opens out from my sitting room while i was dressing two men called for mepaul jermyn and count von hern they walked through to my bedroom first and then sat together in the sitting room until i came out the door was wide open and we talked all the time  they called accidentally peter ruff asked  noby appointment the young man replied we were all coming on here to the dance and we had agreed to dine together first at the savoy  you say that you left the paper on your desk with your coat and hat peter ruff asked was it there when you came out  apparently so the young man answered it seemed to be standing in exactly the same place as where i had left it i put it into my breast pocket and it was only when i arrived here that i fancied the envelope seemed lighter i went off by myself and tore it open there was nothing inside but half a newspaper  what about the envelope peter ruff asked that must have been the same sort of one as you had used or you would have noticed it  it was the honorable maurice answered  it was a sort which you kept in your room  yes the young man admitted  the packet was changed then by some one in your room or some one who had access to it peter ruff said how about your servant  it was his evening off i let him put out my things and go at seven oclock  you must tell me the nature of the contents of the packet peter ruff declared dont hesitate you must do it remember the alternative  the young man did hesitate for several moments but a glance into his sisters appealing face decided him  it was our official reply to a secret communication from russia respectinga certain matter in the balkans  peter ruff nodded  where is count von hern he asked abruptly  inside dancing  i must use a telephone at once peter ruff said ask one of the servants here where i can find one  peter ruff was conducted to a gloomy waiting room on the table of which stood a small telephone instrument he closed the door but he was absent for only a few minutes when he rejoined lady mary and her brother they were talking together in agitated whispers the latter turned towards him at once  do you mean that you suspect count von hern he asked doubtfully he is a friend of the danish ministers and every one says that hes such a good chap he doesnt seem to take the slightest interest in politicsspends nearly all his time hunting or playing polo  i dont suspect any one peter ruff answered i only know that count von hern is an austrian spy and that he took your paper has he been out of your sight at all since you rejoined him in the sitting room i mean to sayhad he any opportunity of leaving you during the time you were dining together or did he make any calls en route either on the way to the savoy or from the savoy here  the young man shook his head  he has not been out of my sight for a second  who is the other manjermyn peter ruff asked i never heard of him  an americancousin of the duchess he could not have had the slightest interest in the affair  please take me into the ballroom peter ruff said to lady mary your brother had better not come with us i want to be as near the count von hern as possible  they passed into the crowded rooms unnoticed purposely avoiding the little space where the duchess was still receiving the late comers among her guests they found progress difficult and lady mary felt her heart sink as she glanced at the little jewelled watch which hung from her wrist suddenly peter ruff came to a standstill  dont look for a moment he said but tell me as soon as you canwho is that tall young man like a goliath talking to the little dark woman you see whom i mean  lady mary nodded and they passed on in a moment or two she answered him  how strange that you should ask she whispered in his ear that is mr jermyn  they were on the outskirts now of the ballroom itself one of lady marys partners came up with an open programme and a face full of reproach  do please forgive me captain henderson lady mary begged i have hurt my foot and i am not dancing any more  but surely i was to take you in to supper the young officer protested goodhumouredly dont tell me that you are going to cut that  i am going to cut everything tonight with everybody lady mary said please forgive me come to tea tomorrow and ill explain  the young man bowed and with a curious glance at ruff accepted his dismissal another partner was simply waved away  please turn round and come back peter ruff said i want to see those two again  but we havent found count von hern yet she protested surely that is more important is it not i believe that i saw him dancing just nowthere with the tall girl in yellow  never mind about him for the moment ruff answered walk down this corridor with me do you mind talking all the time please it will sound more natural and i want to listen  the young american and his partner had found a more retired seat now about three quarters of the way down the pillared vestibule which bordered the ballroom he was bending over his companion with an air of unmistakable devotion but it was she who talked she seemed indeed to have a good deal to say to him the slim white fingers of one hand played all the time with a string of magnificent pearls her dark soft eyesblack as aloes and absolutely unenglishflashed into his a delightful smile hovered at the corners of her lips all the time she was talking and he was listening lady mary and her partner passed by unnoticed at the end of the vestibule they turned and retraced their steps peter ruff was very quiethe had caught a few of those rapid words but the womans foreign accent had troubled him  if only she would speak in her own language he muttered  lady marys hand suddenly tightened upon his arm  look she exclaimed that is count von hern  a tall fair young man very exact in his dress very stiff in his carriage with a not unpleasant face was standing talking to jermyn and his companion jermyn who apparently found the intrusion an annoyance was listening to the conversation between the two with a frown upon his face and a general attitude of irritation as lady mary and her escort drew near the reason for the young americans annoyance became clearerhis two companions were talking softly but with great animation in a foreign language which it was obvious that he did not understand peter ruffs elbow pressed against his partners arm and their pace slackened he ventured even to pause for a moment looking into the ballroom as though in search of some one and he had by no means the appearance of a man likely to understand hungarian then to lady marys surprise he touched the count von hern on the shoulder and addressed him  i beg your pardon sir he said but i fancy that we accidentally exchanged programmes a few minutes ago at the buffet i have lost mine and picked up one which does not belong to me as we were standing side by side it is possibly yours  i believe not sir he answered with that pleasant smile which had gone such a long way toward winning him the reputation of being a good fellow amongst a fairly large circle of friends i believe at any rate he added glancing at his programme that this is my own you mistake me probably for some one else  peter ruff without saying a word was actor enough to suggest that he was unconvinced the count goodhumouredly held out his programme  you shall see for yourself he remarked that is not yours is it besides i have not been to the buffet at all this evening  peter ruff cast a swift glance down the programme which the count had handed him then he apologised profusely  i was mistaken he admitted i am very sorry  the count bowed  it is of no consequence sir he said and resumed his conversation  peter ruff passed on with lady mary at a safe distance she glanced at him enquiringly  it was his programme i wanted to see peter ruff explained it is as i thought he has had four dances with the countess  who is she lady mary asked quickly  the little dark lady with whom he is talking now peter ruff continued he seems too to be going early he has no dances reserved after the twelfth we will go downstairs at once if you please i must speak to your brother  have you been able to think of anything she asked anxiously is there any chance at all do you think  i believe so peter ruff answered it is most interesting dont be too sanguine though the odds are against us and the time is very short is the driver of your electric brougham to be trusted  absolutely she assured him he is an old servant  will you lend him to me peter ruff asked and tell him that he is to obey my instructions absolutely  of course she answered you are going away then  peter ruff nodded he was a little sparing of words just then the thoughts were chasing one another through his brain he was listening too for the sweep of a dress behind  is there nothing i can do lady mary begged eagerly  peter ruff shook his head in the distance he saw the honourable maurice come quickly toward them with a firm but imperceptible gesture he waved him away  dont let your brother speak to me he said we cant tell who is behind what time did you say the prime minister was expected  at two oclock lady mary said anxiously  peter ruff glanced at his watch it was already half an hour past midnight  very well he said i will do what i can if my theory is wrong it will be nothing if i am rightwell there is a chance anyhow in the meantime  in the meantime she repeated breathlessly  take your brother back to the ballroom peter ruff directed make him dancedance yourself dont give yourselves away by looking anxious when the time is shortsay at a quarter to twohe can come down here and wait for me  if you dont come she exclaimed  then we shall have lost peter ruff said calmly if you dont see me again tonight you had better read the newspapers carefully for the next few days  you are going to do something dangerous she protested  there is danger in interfering at all in such a matter as this he answered but you must remember that it is not only my professionit is my hobby remember too he added with a smile that i do not often lose  for twenty minutes peter ruff sat in the remote corner of lady marys electric brougham drawn up at the other side of the square and waited at last he pressed a button they glided off before them was a large closed motor car they started in discreet chase  fortunately however the chase was not a long one the car which peter ruff had been following was drawn up before a plain solidlooking house unlit and of gloomy appearance the little lady with the wonderful eyes was already halfway up the flagged steps hastily lifting the flap and looking behind as they passed her pursuer saw her open the door with a latchkey and disappear peter ruff pulled the checkstring and descended for several moments he stood and observed the house into which the lady whom he had been following had disappeared then he turned to the driver  i want you to watch that house he said never to take your eyes off it when i reappear from it if i do at all i shall probably be in a hurry directly you see me be on your box ready to start a good deal may depend upon our getting away quickly  very good sir the man answered how long am i to wait here for you  peter ruffs lips twisted into a curious little smile  until two oclock he answered if i am not out by then you neednt bother any more about me you can return and tell your mistress exactly what has happened  hadnt i better come and try and get you out sir the man asked begging your pardon but her ladyship told me that there might be queer doings im a bit useful in a scrap sir he added i do a bit of sparring regularly  peter ruff shook his head  if theres any scrap at all he said you had better be out of it do as i have said  the motor car had turned round and disappeared now and in a few moments peter ruff stood before the door of the house into which the little lady had disappeared the problem of entrance was already solved for him the door had been left unlatched only a footstool had been placed against it inside peter ruff without hesitation pushed the door softly open and entered replaced the footstool in its former position and stood with his back to the wall in the darkest corner of the hall looking around himlistening intently nearly opposite the door of a room stood ajar it was apparently lit up but there was no sound of any one moving inside upstairs in one of the rooms on the first floor he could hear light footstepsa womans voice humming a song he listened to the first few bars and understanding became easier those first few bars were the opening ones of the servian national anthem  with an effort peter ruff concentrated his thoughts upon the immediate present the little lady was upstairs the servants had apparently retired for the night he crept up to the halfopen door and peered in the room as he had hoped to find it was empty but madames easychair was drawn up to the fire and some coffee stood upon the hob stealthily peter ruff crept in and glanced around seeking for a hiding place a movement upstairs hastened his decision he pushed aside the massive curtains which separated this from a connecting room he had scarcely done so when light footsteps were heard descending the stairs  peter ruff found his hiding place all that could have been desired this secondary room itself was almost in darkness but he was just able to appreciate the comforting fact that it possessed a separate exit into the hall through the folds of the curtain he had a complete view of the further apartment the little lady had changed her gown of stiff white satin for one of flimsier material and seated in the easychair she was busy pouring herself out some coffee she took a cigarette from a silver box and lighting it curled herself up in the chair and composed herself as though to listen to her as well as to peter ruff as he crouched in his hiding place the moments seemed to pass slowly enough yet as he realised afterward it could not have been ten minutes before she sat upright in a listening attitude there was some one coming peter ruff too heard a mans firm footsteps come up the flagged stones  the little lady sprang to her feet  paul she exclaimed  paul jermyn came slowly to meet her he seemed a little out of breath his tie was all disarranged and his collar unfastened  the little lady however noticed none of these things she looked only into his face  have you got it she asked eagerly  he thrust his hand into his breastcoat pocket and held an envelope out toward her  sure he answered i promised  she gave a little sob and with the packet in her hand came running straight toward the spot where peter ruff was hiding  he shrank back as far as possible she stopped just short of the curtain opened the drawer of a table which stood there and slipped the packet in then she came back once more to where paul jermyn was standing  my friend she cried holding out her handsmy dear dear friend shall i ever be able to thank you enough  why if you try he answered smiling i think that you could  she laid her hand upon his arma little caressing foreign gesture  tell me she said how did you manage it  we left the dance together jermyn said i could see that he wanted to get rid of me but i offered to take him in my motor car i told the man to choose some back streets and while we were passing through one of them i took von hern by the throat we had a struggle of course but i got the paper  what did you do with von hern she asked  i left him on his doorstep the young american answered he wasnt really hurt but he was only half conscious i dont think hell bother any one tonight  you dear brave man she murmured paul what am i to say to you  he laughed  thats what im here to ask he declared you wouldnt give me my answer at the ball perhaps youll give it me now  they sprang apart ruff felt his nerves stiffenfelt himself constrained to hold even his breath as he widened a little the crack in the curtains this was no stealthy entrance the door had been flung open von hern his dress in wild disorder pale as a ghost and with a great bloodstain upon his cheek stood confronting them  when you have done with your lovemaking he called out ill trouble you to restore my property  the electric light gleamed upon a small revolver which flashed out toward the young american paul jermyn never hesitated for a moment he seized the chair by his side and flung it at von hern there was a shot the crash of the falling chair a cry from jermyn who never hesitated however in his rush the two men closed a second shot went harmlessly to the ceiling the little lady stole awaystole softly across the room toward the table she opened the drawer suddenly the blood in her veins was frozen into fear from nowhere it seemed to her came a hand which held her wrists like iron  madam peter ruff whispered from behind the curtain i am sorry to deprive you of it but this is stolen property  her screams rang through the room even the two men released one another  it is gone it is gone she cried some one was hiding in the room quick  she sprang into the hall the two men followed her the front door was slammed they heard flying footsteps outside von hern was out first clearing the little flight of steps in one bound across the road he saw a flying figure a level stream of fire poured from his handtwice three times but peter ruff never faltered round the corner he tore the man had kept his wordthe brougham was already moving slowly  jump in sir the man cried throw yourself in never mind about the door  they heard the shouts behind peter ruff did as he was bid and sat upon the floor raising himself gradually to the seat when they had turned another corner then he put his head out of the window  back to the duchess of montfords he ordered  the latest of the guests had ceased to arrivea few were already departing it was an idle time however with the servants who loitered in the vestibules of montford house and they looked with curiosity upon this strange guest who arrived at five minutes to two limping a little and holding his left arm in his right hand one footman on the threshold nearly addressed him but the words were taken out of his mouth when he saw lady mary and her brotherthe honorable maurice sothersthasten forward to greet him  peter ruff smiled upon them benignly  you can take the paper out of my breastcoat pocket he said  the young mans fingers gripped it through lady marys great thankfulness however the sudden fear came shivering  you are hurt she whispered there is blood on your sleeve  just a graze peter ruff answered von hern wasnt much good at a running target back to the ballroom young man he added dont you see whos coming  the prime minister came up the tented way into montford house he too wondered a little at the man whom he met on his way out holding his left arm and looking more as though he had emerged from a street fight than from the duchess of montfords ball peter ruff went home smiling    chapter vii the demand of the doublefour   it was about this time that peter ruff found among his letters one morning a highlyscented little missive addressed to him in a handwriting with which he had once been familiar he looked at it for several moments before opening it even as the paper cutter slid through the top of the envelope he felt that he had already divined the nature of its contents   frivolity theatre  march 10th  my dear mr ruff i expect that you will be surprised to hear from me again but i do hope that you will not be annoyed i know that i behaved very horridly a little time ago but it was not altogether my fault and i have been more sorry for it than i can tell youin fact john and i have never been the same since and for the present at any rate i have left him and gone on the stage a lady whom i knew got me a place in the chorus here and so far i like it immensely  wont you come and meet me after the show tomorrow night and i will tell you all about it i should like so much to see you again  maud   peter ruff placed this letter in his breastcoat pocket and withheld it from his secretarys notice he felt however very little pleasure at the invitation it conveyed he hesitated for some time in fact whether to accept it or not finally after his modest dinner that evening he bought a stall for the frivolity and watched the piece the girl he had come to see was there in the second row of the chorus but she certainly did not look her best in the somewhat scant costume required by the part she showed no signs whatever of any special abilityneither her dancing nor her singing seemed to entitle her to any consideration she carried herself with a certain amount of selfconsciousness and her eyes seemed perpetually fixed upon the occupants of the stalls peter ruff laid down his glasses with something between a sigh and a groan there was something to him inexpressibly sad in the sight of his old sweetheart so transformed so utterly changed from the prim somewhat genteel young person who had accepted his modest advances with such ladylike diffidence she seemed indeed to have lost those very gifts which had first attracted him nevertheless he kept his appointment at the stagedoor  she was among the first to come out and she greeted him warmlyalmost noisily with her new profession she seemed to have adopted a different and certainly more flamboyant deportment  i thought youd come tonight she declared with an arch look i felt certain i saw you in the stalls you are going to take me to supper arent you shall we go to the milan  peter ruff assented without enthusiasm handed her into a hansom and took his place beside her she wore a very large hat untidily put on some of the paint seemed still to be upon her face her voice too seemed to have become louder and her manner more assertive there were obvious indications that she no longer considered brandy and soda an unladylike beverage peter ruff was not pleased with himself or proud of his companion  youll take some wine he suggested after he had ordered with a few hints from her a somewhat extensive supper  champagne she answered decidedly ive got quite used to it nowadays she went on i could laugh to think how strange it tasted when you first took me out  tell me peter ruff said why you have left your husband  she laughed  because he was dull and because he was cross she answered and because the life down at streatham was simply intolerable i think it was a little your fault too she said making eyes at him across the table you gave me a taste of what life was like outside streatham and i never forgot it  peter ruff did not respondhe led the conversation indeed into other channels on the whole the supper was scarcely a success maud who was growing to consider herself something of a bohemian and who certainly looked for some touch of sentiment on the part of her old admirer was annoyed by the quiet deference with which he treated her she reproached him with it once bluntly  say she exclaimed you dont seem to want to be so friendly as you did you havent forgiven me yet i suppose  peter ruff shook his head  it is not that he said but i think that you have scarcely done a wise thing in leaving your husband i cannot think that this life on the stage is good for you  she laughed scornfully  well she said i never thought to have you preaching at me  they finished their supper maud accepted a cigarette and did her best to change her companions mood she only alluded once more to her husband  i dont see how i could have stayed with him anyhow she said you know hes been put backhe only gets two pounds fifteen a week now he couldnt expect me to live upon that  put back peter ruff repeated  she nodded  he seemed to have a lot of bad luck this last year she said all his cases went wrong and they dont think so much of him at scotland yard as they did i am not sure that he hasnt begun to drink a little  i am sorry to hear it peter ruff said gravely  i dont see why you should be she answered bluntly he was no friend of yours nor isnt now he may not be so dangerous as he was but if ever you come across him you take my tip and be careful he means to do you a mischief some day if he can i am not sure she added that he doesnt believe that it was partly your fault about my leaving home  i should be sorry for him to think that peter ruff answered while we are upon the subject cant you tell me exactly why your husband dislikes me so  for one thing because you have been up against him in several of his cases and have always won  and for the other  well she said doubtfully he seems to connect you in his mind somehow with a boy who was in love with me oncemr spencer fitzgeraldyou know who i mean  ruff nodded  he still has that in his mind has he he remarked  oh hes mad she declared however dont let us talk about him any more  the lights were being put out peter ruff paid his bill and they rose together  come down to the fiat for an hour or so she begged taking his arm i have a dear little place with another girlcarrie pearce ill sing to you if you like come down and have one drink anyhow  peter ruff shook his head firmly  i am sorry he said but you must excuse me in some ways i am very oldfashioned he added i never sit up late and i hate music  just drive as far as the door with me then she begged  peter ruff shook his head  you must excuse me he said handing her into the hansom and maud he addedif i may call you sotake my advice give it upgo back to your husband and stick to himyoull be better off in the long run  she would have answered him scornfully but there was something impressive in the crisp clear wordsin his expression too as he looked into her eyes she threw herself back in a corner of the cab with an affected little laugh and turned her head away from him  peter ruff walked back into the cloakroom for his coat and hat and sighed softly to himself it was the end of the one sentimental episode of his life  it had been the study of peter ruffs life so far as possible to maintain under all circumstances an equable temperament to refuse to recognize the meaning of the word nerves and to be guided in all his actions by that profound common sense which was one of his natural gifts yet there were times when like any other ordinary person he suffered acutely from presentiments he left his rooms for instance at five oclock on the afternoon of the day following his supper with maud suffering from a sense of depression for which he found it altogether impossible to account it was true that the letter which he had in his pocket the appointment which he was on his way to keep were both of them probable sources of embarrassment and annoyance if not of danger he was being invited without the option of refusal to enter upon some risky undertaking which would yield him neither fee nor reward yet his common sense told him that it was part of the game in paris he had looked upon his admittance into the order of the doublefour as one of the steppingstones to success in his career through them he had gained knowledge which he could have acquired in no other way through them for instance he had acquired the information that madame la comtesse de pilitz was a servian patriot and a friend of the crown prince and that the count von hern posing in england as a sportsman and an idler was a highly paid and dangerous austrian spy there had been other occasions too upon which they had come to his aid now they had made an appeal to himan appeal which must be obeyed his timeperhaps even his safetymust be placed entirely at their disposal it was only an ordinary return a thing expected of hima thing which he dared not refuse yet he knew very well what he could not explain to themthat the whole success of his life depended so absolutely upon his remaining free from any suspicion of wrongdoing that he had received his summons with something like dismay and proceeded to obey it with unaccustomed reluctance  he drove to cireys cafe in regent street where he dismissed the driver of his hansom and strolled in with the air of an habitue he selected a corner table ordered some refreshment and asked for a box of dominoes the place was fairly well filled a few women were sitting about a sprinkling of frenchmen were taking their aperitif here and there a man of affairs on his way from the city had called in for a glass of vermouth peter ruff looked them over recognizing the typerecognizing even some of their faces apparently the person whom he was to meet had not yet arrived  he lit a cigarette and smoked slowly presently the door opened and a woman entered in a long fur coat a large hat and a thick veil she raised it to glance around disclosing the unnaturally pale face and dark swollen eyes of a certain type of frenchwoman she seemed to notice no one in particular her eyes traveled over peter ruff without any sign of interest nevertheless she took a seat somewhere near his and ordered some vermouth from the waiter whom she addressed by name when she had been served and the waiter had departed she looked curiously at the dominoes which stood before her neighbor  monsieur plays dominoes perhaps she remarked taking one of them into her fingers and examining it a very interesting game  peter ruff showed her a domino which he had been covering with his handit was a double four she nodded and moved from her seat to one immediately next him  i had not imagined peter ruff said that it was a lady whom i was to meet  monsieur is not disappointed i trust she said smiling if i talk banalities monsieur must pardon it both the waiters here are spies and there are always people who watch monsieur is ready to do us a service  to the limits of my ability peter ruff answered madame will remember that we are not in paris that our police system if not so wonderful as yours is still a closer and a more present thing they have not the brains at scotland yard but they are persistenthard to escape  do i not know it the woman said it is through them that we send for you one of us is in danger  do i know him peter ruff asked  it is doubtful she answered monsieurs stay in paris was so brief if monsieur will recognize his nameit is jean lemaitre himself  peter ruff started slightly  i thought he said with some hesitation that lemaitre did not visit this country  he came well disguised the woman answered it was thought to be safe nevertheless it was a foolish thing they have tracked him down from hotel to apartments till he lives now in the back room of a wretched little cafe in soho even from there we cannot get him awaythe whole district is watched by spies we need help  for a genius like lemaitre peter ruff said thoughtfully to have even thought of soho was foolish he should have gone to hampstead or balham it is easy to fool our police if you know how on the other hand they hang on to the scent like leeches when once they are on the trail how many warrants are there out against jean in this country  better not ask that the woman said grimly you remember the raid on a private house in the holloway road two years ago when two policemen were shot and a spy was stabbed jean was in thatit is sufficient  are any plans made at all peter ruff asked  but naturally the woman answered there is a motor car even now of sixtyhorsepower stands ready at a garage in putney if jean can once reach it he can reach the coast at a certain spot near southampton there is a small steamer waiting after that everything is easy  my task then peter ruff said thoughtfully is to take jean lemaitre from this cafe in soho as far as putney and get him a fair start  it is enough she answered there is a cordon of spies around the district every day they seem to chose in upon us they search the houses one by one only last night the hotel de netherlandsa miserable little place on the other side of the streetwas suddenly surrounded by policemen and every room ransacked it may be our turn tonight  in one hours time peter ruff said glancing at his watch i shall present myself as a doctor at the cafe tell me the address tell me what to say which will insure my admission to jean lemaitre  the cafe she answered is called the hotel de flandres you enter the restaurant and you walk to the desk there you find always monsieur antoine you say to him simplythe doublefour he will answer that he understands and he will conduct you at once to lemaitre  ruff nodded  in the meantime he said let it be understood in the cafeif there is any one who is not in the secretthat one of the waiters is sick i shall come to attend him  she nodded thoughtfully  as well that way as any other she answered monsieur is very kind a bientot  she shook hands and they parted peter ruff drove back to his rooms rang up an adjoining garage for a small covered car such as are usually let out to medical men and commenced to pack a small black bag with the outfit necessary for his purpose now that he was actually immersed in his work the sense of depression had passed away the keen stimulus of danger had quickened his blood he knew very well that the woman had not exaggerated there was no man more wanted by the french or the english police than the man who had sought his aid and the district in which he had taken shelter was in some respects the very worst for his purpose nevertheless peter ruff who believed at the bottom of his heart in his star went on with his preparations feeling morally certain that jean lemaitre would sleep on the following night in his native land  at precisely the hour agreed upon a small motor brougham pulled up outside the door of the hotel de flandres and its occupantwhom ninetynine men out of a hundred would at once unhesitatingly have declared to be a doctor in moderate practicepushed open the swing doors of the restaurant and made his way to the desk he was of medium height he wore a frockcoata little frayed gray trousers which had not been recently pressed and thick boots  i understand that one of your waiters requires my attendance he said in a tone not unduly raised but still fairly audible i am dr gilette  dr gilette antoine repeated slowly   and number doublefour the doctor murmured  antoine descended from his desk  but certainly monsieur he said the poor fellow declares that he suffers if he is really ill he must go it sounds brutal but what can one do we have so few rooms here and so much business monsieur will come this way  antoine led the way from the cafe into a very smelly region of narrow passages and steep stairs  it is to be arranged antoine whispered as they ascended  without a doubt the doctor answered were there spies in the cafe  two antoine answered  the doctor nodded and said no more he mounted to the third story antoine led him through a small sittingroom and knocked four times upon the door of an inner room it suddenly was opened a manunshaven terrified with that nameless fear in his face which one sees reflected in the expression of some trapped animalstood there looking out at them  doublefour the doctor said softly go back into the room please antoine will kindly leave us  who are you the man gasped  doublefour the doctor answered obey me and be quick for your life strip  the man obeyed  barely twenty minutes later the doctorstill carrying his bagdescended the stairs he entered the cafe from a somewhat remote door antoine hurried to meet him and walked by his side through the place he asked many questions but the doctor contented himself with shaking his head almost in silence he left antoine who conducted him even to the door of his motor the proprietor of the cafe watched the brougham disappear and then returned to his desk sighing heavily  a man who had been sipping a liqueur dose at hand laid down his paper  one of your waiters ill did i understand he asked monsieur antoine was at once eloquent it was the illfortune which had dogged him for the last four months the man had been taken ill there in the restaurant he was a gasconspoke no englishand had just arrived it was not possible for him to be removed at the moment so he had been carried to an empty bedroom then had come the doctor and forbidden his removal now for a week he had lain there and several of his other voyageurs had departed one did not know how these things got about but they spoke of infection the doctor who had just leftdr gilette of russell square a most famous physicianhad assured him that there was no infectionno fear of any but what did it matterthat people were so hard to convince monsieur would like a cigar but certainly there were here some of the best  antoine undid the cabinet and opened a box of havanas john dory selected one and called for another liqueur  you have trouble often with your waiters i dare say he remarked they tell me that all frenchmen who break the law in their own country find their way sooner or later to these parts you have to take them without characters i suppose  antoine lifted his shoulders  but what could one do he exclaimed characters they were easy enough to writebut were they worth the paper they were written on indeed no  not only your waiters dory continued but those who stay in the hotels round here have sometimes an evil name  antoine shrugged his shoulders  for myself he said i am particular we have but a few rooms but we are careful to whom we let them  do you keep a visitors book  but no monsieur antoine protested for why the necessity there are so few who come to stay for more than the nightjust now scarcely any one at all  there entered at that moment a tall thin man dressed in dark clothes who walked with his hands in his overcoat pockets as though it were a habit he came straight to dory and handed him a piece of paper  john dory glanced it through and rose to his feet a gleam of satisfaction lit his eyes  monsieur antoine he said i am sorry to cause you any inconvenience but here is my card i am a detective officer from scotland yard and i have received information which compels me with your permission to examine at once the sleeping apartments in your hotel  antoine was fiercely indignant  but monsieur he exclaimed i do not understand examine my rooms but it is impossible who dares to say that i harbor criminals  i have information upon which i can rely john dory answered firmly this comes from a man who is no friend of mine but he is wellknown you can read for yourself what he says  monsieur antoine with trembling fingers took the piece of paper from john dorys hands it was addressed to   mr john dory detective  if you wish to find jean lemaitre search in the upper rooms of the hotel de flandres i have certain information that he is to be found there  peter ruff   never antoine declared will i suffer such an indignity  dory raised a police whistle to his lips  you are foolish he said already there is a cordon of men about the place if you refuse to conduct me upstairs i shall at once place you under arrest  antoine white with fear poured himself out a liqueur of brandy  well well he said what must be done then come  he led the way out into that smelly network of passages up the stairs to the first floor room after room he threw open and begged dory to examine some of them were garishly furnished with gilt mirrors cheap lace curtains tied back with blue ribbons others were dark miserable holes into which the fresh air seemed never to have penetrated on the third floor they reached the little sittingroom which bore more traces of occupation than some of the rooms below antoine would have passed on but dory stopped him  there is a door there he said we will try that  it is the sick waiter who lies within antoine protested monsieur can hear him groan  there was indeed something which sounded like a groan to be heard but dory was obstinate  if he is so ill he demanded how is he able to lock the door on the inside monsieur antoine that door must be opened  antoine knocked at it softly  francois he said there is another doctor here who would see you let us in  there was no answer antoine turned to his companion with a little shrug of the shoulders as one who would sayi have done my best what would you have  dory put his shoulder to the door  listen he shouted through the keyhole mr sick waiter or whoever you are if you do not unlock this door i am coming in  i have no key said a faint voice i am locked in please break open the door  but that is not the voice of francois antoine exclaimed in amazement  well soon see who it is dory answered  he charged at the door fiercely at the third assault it gave way they found themselves in a small back bedroom and stretched on the floor very pale and apparently only halfconscious lay peter ruff there was a strong smell of chloroform about john dory threw open the window his fingers trembled a little it was like fatethis at the end of every unsuccessful effort there was this manpeter ruff  what the devil are you doing here he asked  peter ruff groaned  help me up he begged and give me a little brandy  antoine set him in an easychair and rang the bell furiously  it will come directly he exclaimed but who are you  peter ruff waited for the brandy when he had sipped it he drew a little breath as though of relief  i heard he said speaking still with an evident effort that lemaitre was here i had secret information i thought at first that i would let you knowi sent you a note early this morning afterwards i discovered that there was a reward and i determined to track him down myself he was in here hiding as a sick waiter i do not think peter ruff added that monsieur antoine had any idea i presented myself as representing a charitable society and i was shown here to visit him he was too clever though was jean lemaitretoo quick for me  you were a fool to come alone john dory said dont you know the mans record how long ago did he leave  about ten minutes peter ruff answered you must have missed him somewhere as you came up i crawled to the window and i watched him go he left the restaurant by the side entrance and took a taxicab at the corner there it went northward toward new oxford street  dory turned on his heelthey heard him descending the stairs peter ruff rose to his feet  i am afraid he said as he plunged his head into a basin of water and came into the middle of the room rubbing it vigorously with a small towel i am afraid that our friend john dory will get to dislike me soon he passed out unnoticed eh antoine  antoines face wore a look of great relief  there was not a soul who looked he said we passed under the nose of the gentleman from scotland yard he sat there reading his paper and he had no idea i watched jean step into the motor even by now he is well on his way southwards twice he changes from motor to train and back they will never trace him  peter ruff who was looking amazingly better sipped a further glass of liqueur together he and antoine descended to the street  mind peter ruff whispered i consider that accounts are squared between me and doublefour now let them know that this sort of thing isnt in my line  for an amateur antoine said bowing low monsieur commands my heartfelt congratulations    chapter viii mrs bognors star boarder  in these days the duties of miss brown as peter ruffs secretary had become multifarious together with the transcribing of a vast number of notes concerning cases some of which he undertook and some of which he refused she had also to keep his cash book a note of his investments and a record of his social engagements notwithstanding all these demands upon her time however there were occasions when she found herself of necessity idle in one of these she broached the subject which had often been in her mind they were alone and not expecting callers consequently she sat upon the hearthrug and addressed her employer by his christian name  peter she said softly do you remember the night when you came through the fog and burst into my little flat  quite well he answered but it is a subject to which i prefer that you do not allude  i will be careful she answered i only spoke of it for this reason before you left when we were sitting together you sketched out the career which you proposed for yourself in many respects i suppose you have been highly successful but i wonder if it has ever occurred to you that your work has not proceeded upon the lines which you first indicated  he nodded  i think i know what you mean he said go on  that night she murmured softly you spoke as a hunted man you spoke as one at war with society you spoke as one who proposes almost a campaign against it when you took your rooms here and called yourself peter ruff it was rather in your mind to aid the criminal than to detect the crime fate seems to have decreed otherwise why i wonder  things have gone that way peter ruff remarked  i will tell you why she continued it is because at the bottom of your heart there lurks a strong and unconquerable desire for respectability in your heart you are on the side of the law and established things you do not like crime you do not like criminals you do not like the idea of associating with them you prefer the company of lawabiding people even though their ways be narrow it was part of that sentiment peter which led you to fall in love with a coalmerchants daughter i can see that you will end your days in the halo of respectability  peter ruff was a little thoughtful he scratched his chin and contemplated the tip of his faultless patent boot selfanalysis interested him and he recognized the truth of the girls words  you know i am rather like that he admitted when i see a family party i envy them when i hear of a man who has brothers and sisters and aunts and cousins and gives family dinnerparties to family friends i envy him i do not care about the loose ends of life i do not care about restaurant life and ladies who transfer their regards with the same facility that they change their toilettes you have very admirable powers of observation violet you see me i believe as i really am  that being so she remarked what are you going to say to sir richard dyson  peter ruff was frank  upon my soul he answered i dont know  youll have to make up your mind very soon she reminded him he is coming here at twelve oclock  peter ruff nodded  i shall wait until i hear what he has to say he remarked  his letter gave you a pretty clear hint violet said that it was something outside the law  the law has many outposts peter ruff said one can thread ones way in and out if one knows the ropes i dont like the man but he introduced me to his tailor i have never had any clothes like those he has made me  she sighed  you are a vain little person she said  you are an impertinent young woman he answered get back to your work dont you hear the lift stop  she rose reluctantly and resumed her place in front of her desk  if its risky she whispered leaning round towards him dont you take it on ive heard one or two things about sir richard lately  peter ruff nodded he too quitted his easychair and took up a bundle of papers which lay upon his desk there was a sharp tap at the door  come in he said  sir richard dyson entered he was dressed quietly but with the perfect taste which was obviously an instinct with him and he wore a big bunch of violets in his buttonhole nevertheless the spring sunshine seemed to find out the lines in his face his eyes were baggyhe had aged even within the last few months  well mr ruff he said shaking hands how goes it  i am very well sir richard peter ruff answered please take a chair  sir richard took the easychair and discovering a box of cigarettes upon the table helped himself then his eyes fell upon miss brown  cant do without your secretary he remarked  impossible peter ruff answered as i told you before i am her guarantee that what you say to me or before her is spoken as though to the dead  sir richard nodded  just as well he remarked for i am going to talk about a man who i wish were dead  there are few of us peter ruff said who have not our enemies  have you any experience of blackmailers sir richard asked  in my profession peter ruff answered i have come across such persons  i have come to see you about one sir richard proceeded many years ago there was a fellow in my regiment who went to the badnever mind his name he passes today as ted jonesthat name will do as well as another i am not sir richard continued a goodnatured man but some devilish impulse prompted me to help that fellow i gave him money three or four times somehow i dont think its a very good thing to give a man money he doesnt value itit comes too easily he spends it and wants more  theres a good deal of truth in what you say sir richard peter ruff admitted  our friend for instance wanted more sir richard continued he came to me for it almost as a matter of course i refused he came again i lost my temper and punched his head then his little game began  peter ruff nodded  he had something to work upon i suppose he remarked  most certainly he had sir richard admitted if ever i achieved sufficient distinction in any branch of life to make it necessary that my biography should be written i promise you that you would find it in many places a little highly colored in other words mr ruff i have not always adhered to the paths of righteousness  a faint smile flickered across peter ruffs face  sir richard he said your candor is admirable  there was one time sir richard continued when i was really on my last legs it was just before i came into the baronetcy i had borrowed every penny i could borrow i was even hard put to it for a meal i went to paris and i called myself by another mans name i got introduced to a somewhat exclusive club there my assumed name was a good oneit was the name in fact of a relative whom i somewhat resembled i was accepted without question i played cards and i lost somewhere about eighteen thousand francs  a sum peter ruff remarked which you probably found it inconvenient to pay  there was only one course sir richard continued and i took it i went back the next night and gave checks for the amount of my indebtednesschecks which had no more chance of being met than if i were to draw tonight upon the bank of england for a million pounds i went back however with another resolve i was considered to have discharged my liabilities and we played again i rose a winner of something like sixty thousand francs but i played to win mr ruff do you know what that means  you cheated peter ruff said in an undertone  quite true sir richard admitted i cheated there was a scandal and i disappeared i had the money and though my checks for the eighteen thousand francs were met there was a considerable balance in my pocket when i escaped out of france there was enough to take me out to americabig game shooting in the far west no one ever associated me with the impostor who had robbed these young french noblemenno one that is to say except the person who passes by the name of teddy jones  how did he get to know peter ruff asked  the story wouldnt interest you sir richard answered he was in paris at the timewe came across one another twice he heard the scandal and put two and two together i shipped him off to australia when i came into the title he has come back lately i can tell you he has pretty well drained me dry he has become a regular parasite a coldblooded leech he doesnt get drunk now he looks after his health i believe he even saves his money theres scarcely a week i dont hear from him he keeps me a pauper he has brought me at last to that state when i feel that there must be an ending  you have come to seek my help peter ruff said slowly from what you say about this man i presume that he is not to be frightened  not for a single moment sir richard answered the law has no terrors for him he is as slippery as an eel he has his story pat he even has his witnesses ready i can assure you that mr teddy jones isnt by any means an ordinary sort of person  he is not to be bluffed peter ruff said slowly he is not to be bribed what remains  i have come here sir richard said for your advice mr ruff  the blackmailer peter ruff said is a criminal  he is a scoundrel sir richard assented  he is not fit to live peter ruff repeated  he contaminates the world with every breath he draws sir richard assented  perhaps peter ruff said you had better give me his address and the name he goes under  he lives at a boardinghouse in russell street bloomsbury sir richard said it is mrs bognors boardinghouse she calls it i believe the american home from home the number is 17  a boardinghouse peter ruff repeated thoughtfully makes it a little hard to get at him privately doesnt it  fling him a bait and he will come to you sir richard answered he is an adventurer pure and simple though perhaps you wouldnt believe it to look at him now he has grown fat on the money he has wrung from me  you had better leave the matter in my hands for a few days peter ruff said i will have a talk with this gentleman and see whether he is really so unmanageable if he is there is of course only one way and for that way sir richard you would have to pay a little high  if i were to hear tomorrow sir richard said quietly that teddy jones was dead i would give five thousand pounds to the man who brought me the information  peter ruff nodded  it would be worth that he saidquite i will drop you a line in the course of the next few days  sir richard took up his hat lit another of peter ruffs cigarettes and departed they heard the rattle of the lift as it descended then miss brown turned round in her chair  dont you do it peter she said solemnly the time has gone by for that sort of thing the man may be unfit to live but you dont need to risk as much as that for a matter of five thousand pounds  peter ruff nodded  quite right he said quite right violet at the same time five thousand pounds is an excellent sum we must see what can be done  peter ruffs method of seeing what could be done was at first the very obvious one of seeking to discover any incidents in the past of the person known as teddy jones likely to reflect present discredit upon him if brought to light from the first it was quite clear that the career of this gentleman had been far from immaculate his researches proved beyond a doubt that the gentleman in question had resorted during the last ten or fifteen years to many and very questionable methods of obtaining a living at the same time there was nothing which peter ruff felt that the man might not brazen out his present mode of life seemedon the surface at any rateto be beyond reproach there was only one association which was distinctly questionable and it was in this one direction therefore that peter ruff concentrated himself the case for some reason interested him so much that he took a close and personal interest in it and he was rewarded one day by discovering this enemy of sir richards sitting toward five oclock in the afternoon in a cafe in regent street engrossed in conversation with a person whom peter ruff knew to be a very black sheep indeeda man who had been tried for murder and concerning whom there were still many unpleasant rumors from behind his paper in a corner of the cafe peter ruff watched these two men teddy jonesor major edward jones as it seemed he was now calledwas a person whose appearance no longer suggested the poverty against which he had been struggling most of his life he was well dressed and tolerably well turned out his face was a little puffy and he had put on flesh during these days of his ease his eyes too had a somewhat furtive expression although his general deportment was one of braggadocio peter ruff quick always in his likes or dislikes found the man repulsive from the start he felt that he would have a genuine pleasure apart from the matter of the five thousand pounds in accelerating major joness departure from a world which he certainly did not adorn  the two men conducted their conversation in a subdued tone which made it quite impossible for peter ruff in his somewhat distant corner to overhear a single word of it it was obvious however that they were not on the best of terms major joness companion was protesting and apparently without success against some course of action or speech of his companions the conversation on the other hand never reached a quarrel and the two men left the place together apparently on ordinary terms of friendliness peter ruff at once quitted his seat and crossed the room toward the spot where they had been sitting he dived under the table and picked up a newspaperit was the only clue left to him as to the nature of their conversation more than once major jones who had soon after their arrival sent a waiter for it had pointed to a certain paragraph as though to give weight to his statements peter ruff had noticed the exact position of that paragraph he smoothed out the paper and found it at once it was an account of the murder of a wealthy old woman living on the outskirts of a country village not far from london peter ruffs face did not change as he called for another vermouth and read the description slowly yet he was aware that he had possibly stumbled across the very thing for which he had searched so urgently the particulars of the murder he already knew well as at one time he had felt inclined to aid the police in their so far fruitless investigations he therefore skipped the description of the tragedy and devoted his attention to the last paragraph toward which he fancied that the finger of major jones had been chiefly directed it was a list of the stolen property which consisted of jewelry gold and notes to a very considerable amount with the waiters permission he annexed the paper cut out the list of articles with a sharp penknife and placed it in his pocketbook before he left the cafe  in the course of some of the smaller cases with which peter ruff had been from time to time connected he had more than once come into contact with the authorities at scotland yard and he had several acquaintances therenot including mr john doryto whom at times he had given valuable information for the first time he now sought some return for his many courtesies he drove straight from the cafe to the office of the chief of the criminal investigation department the questions he asked there were only two but they were promptly and courteously answered peter ruff left the building and drove back to his rooms in a somewhat congratulatory frame of mind after all it was chance which was the chief factor in the solution of so many of these cases often he had won less success after months of untiring effort than he had gained during that few minutes in the cafe in regent street  peter ruff became an inmate of that very select boardinghouse carried on by mrs bognor at number 17 russell street bloomsbury he arrived with a steamer trunk an elaborate travelingbag and a dressingcase took the best vacant room in the house and dressed for dinner mrs bognor looked upon him as a valuable addition to her clientele and introduced him freely to her other guests among these was major edward jones major jones sat at mrs bognors right hand and was evidently the show guest of the boardinghouse peter ruff without the least desire to attack his position sat upon her left and monopolized the conversation on the third night it turned by chance upon precious stones peter ruff drew a little chamois leather bag from his pocket  i am afraid he said that my tastes are peculiar i have been in the east and i have seen very many precious stones in their uncut state to my mind there is nothing to be compared with opals these are a few i brought home from india perhaps you would like to look at them mrs bognor  they were passed round amidst a little chorus of admiration  the large one with the blue fire peter ruff remarked is i think remarkably beautiful i have never seen a stone quite like it  it is wonderful murmured the young lady who was sitting at major joness right hand what a fortunate man you are mr ruff to have such a collection of treasures  peter ruff bowed across the table major jones who was beginning to feel that his position as show guest was in danger thrust his hand into his waistcoat pocket and produced a ladys ring in which was set a single opal  very pretty stones he remarked carelessly but i cant say i am very fond of them heres one that belonged to my sister and my grandmother before her i have it in my pocket because i was thinking of having the stone reset and making a present of it to a friend of mine  peter ruffs popularity wanedhe had said nothing about making a present to any one of even the most insignificant of his opals and the one which major jones now handed round was certainly a magnificent stone peter ruff examined it with the rest and under the pretext of studying the setting gazed steadfastly at the inside through his eyeglass major jones from the other side of the table frowned and held out his hand for the ring  a very beautiful stone indeed peter ruff declared passing it across the tablecloth really i do not think that there is one in my little collection to be compared with it have you many treasures like this major jones  oh a few the major answered carelessly family heirlooms most of them  you will have to give me the ring major jones the young lady on his right remarked archly its bad luck you know to give it to any one who is not born in october and my birthday is on the twelfth  my dear miss levey major jones answered whispering in her ear more unlikely things have happened than that i should beg your acceptance of this little trifle  sooner or later peter ruff said genially i should like to have a little conversation with you major i fancy that we ought to be able to find plenty of subjects of common interest  delighted im sure the latter answered utterly unsuspicious shall we go into the smokingroom now or would you rather play a rubber first  if it is all the same to you peter ruff said i think we will have a cigar first there will be plenty of time for bridge afterwards  may i offer you a cigar sir major jones inquired passing across a wellfilled case  peter ruff sighed  i am afraid major he said that there is scarcely time you see i have a warrant in my pocket for your arrest and i am afraid that by the time we got to the station  major jones leaned forward in his chair he gripped the sides tightly with both hands his eyes seemed to be protruding from his head  for my what he exclaimed in a tone of horror  for your arrest peter ruff explained calmly surely you must have been expecting it during all these years you must have grown used to expecting it at every moment  major jones collapsed he looked at ruff as one might look at a man who has taken leave of his senses yet underneath it all was the cowards fear  what are you talking about man he exclaimed what do you mean lower your voice for heavens sake consider my position here some one might overhear if this is a joke let me tell you that its a dd foolish one  peter ruff raised his eyebrows  i do not wish he said to create a disturbancemy manner of coming here should have assured you of that at the same time business is business i hold a warrant for your arrest and i am forced to execute it  do you mean that you are a detective then major jones demanded  he was a big man but his voice seemed to have grown very small indeed  naturally peter ruff answered i should not come here without authority  what is the charge the other man faltered  blackmail peter ruff said slowly the information against you is lodged by sir richard dyson  it seemed to peter ruff who was watching his companion closely that a wave of relief passed over the face of the man who sat cowering in his chair he certainly drew a little gaspstretched out his hands as though to thrust the shadow of some fear from him his voice when he spoke was stronger some faint show of courage was returning to him  there is some ridiculous mistake he declared let us talk this over like sensible men mr ruff if you will wait until i have spoken to sir richard i can promise you that the warrant shall be withdrawn and that you shall not be the loser  i am afraid it is too late for anything of that sort peter ruff said sir richards patience has been completely exhausted by your repeated demands  he never told me so major jones whined i quite thought that he was always glad to help an old friend as a matter of fact i had not meant to ask him for anything else the last few hundreds i had from him was to have closed the thing up it was the end  peter ruff shook his head  no he said it was not the end it never would have been the end sir richard sought my advice and i gave it him without hesitation sooner or later i told him he would have to adopt different measures i convinced him i represent those measures  but the matter can be arranged major jones insisted with a little shudder i am perfectly certain it can be arranged mr ruff you are not an ordinary police officeri am sure of that give me a chance of having an interview with sir richard before anything more is done i will satisfy him i promise you that why if we leave the place together like this every one here will get to know about it  be reasonable peter ruff answered of course everyone will get to know about it blackmailing cases always excite a considerable amount of interest your photograph will probably be in the daily mirror tomorrow or the next day in the meantime i must trouble you to pay your respects to mrs bognor and to come with me  to sir richards house major jones asked eagerly  to the policestations peter ruff answered  major jones did not rise he sat for a few moments with his head buried in his hands  mr ruff he said hoarsely listen to me i have been fortunate lately in some investments i am not so poor as i was i have my checkbook in my pocket and a larger balance in the bank now than i have ever had before if i write you a check for say a hundredno twofive he cried desperately watching peter ruffs unchanging facefive hundred pounds will you come round with me to sir richards house in a hansom at once  peter ruff shook his head  five thousand pounds would not buy your liberty from me major jones he said  the man became abject  have pity then he pleaded my health is not goodi couldnt stand imprisonment think of what it means to a man of my age suddenly to leave everything worth having in life just because he may have imposed a little on the generosity of a friend think how you would feel and be merciful  peter ruff shook his head slowly his face was immovable but there was a look in his eyes from which the other man shrank  major jones he said you ask me be merciful you appeal to my pity for such as you i have no pity nor have i ever shown any mercy you know very well and i know that when once the hand of the law touches your shoulder it will not be only a charge o blackmail which the police will bring against you  there is nothing elsenothing else he cried take half my fortune mr ruff let me get away give me a chancejust a sporting chance  i wonder peter ruff said what chance that poor old lady in weston had no i am not saying you murdered her you never had the pluck your confederate did that and you handled the booty what were the initials inside that ring you showed us tonight major jones  let me go to my bedroom he said in a strange faraway tone you can come with me and stand outside  peter ruff assented  to save scandal he said yes  three flights of stairs they climbed when at last they reached the door the trembling man made one last appeal  mr ruff he said have a little mercy give me an hours startjust a chance for my life  peter ruff pushed him in the door  i am not a hard man he said but i keep my mercy for men  he took the key from the inside of the door locked it and with the key in his pocket descended to the drawingroom the young lady who had sat on major joness right was singing a ballad suddenly she paused in the middle of her song the four people who were playing bridge looked up mrs bognor screamed  what was that she asked quickly  it sounded peter ruff said very much like revolver shot  i see sir richard remarked with a queer look in his eyes as he handed over a roll of notes to peter ruff the jury brought it in suicide what i cant understand is  dont try peter ruff interrupted briskly it isnt in the bond that you should understand  sir richard helped himself to a drink a great burden had passed from his shoulders but he was not feeling at his best that morning he could scarcely keep his eyes from peter ruff  ruff he said i have known you some time and i have known you to be a square man i have known you to do goodnatured actions i came to you in desperation but i scarcely expected this  peter ruff emptied his own tumbler and took up his hat  sir richard he said you are like a good many other people now that the thing is done you shrink from the thought of it you even wonder how i could have planned to bring about the death of this man listen sir richard pity for the deserving or for those who have in them one single quality one single grain of good is a sentiment which deserves respect pity for vermin who crawl about the world leaving a poisonous trail upon everything they touch is a false and unnatural sentiment for every hopelessly corrupt man who is induced to quit this life there is a more deserving one somewhere or other for whom the world is a better place  so that after all you are a philanthropist mr ruff sir richard said with a forced smile  peter ruff shook his head  a philosopher he answered buttoning up his notes    chapter ix the perfidy of miss brown   peter ruff came down to his office with a single letter in his hand bearing a french postmark he returned his secretarys morning greeting a little absently and seated himself at his desk  violet he asked have you ever been to paris  she looked at him compassionately  more times than you i think peter she answered  he nodded  that he exclaimed is very possible could you get ready to leave by the twotwenty this afternoon  what alone she exclaimed  nowith me he answered  she shut down her desk with a bang  of course i can she exclaimed what a spree  then she caught sight of a certain expression on peter ruffs face and she looked at him wonderingly  is anything wrong peter she asked  no he answered i cannot say that anything is wrong i have had an invitation to present myself before a certain society in paris of which you have some indirect knowledge what the summons means i cannot say  yet you go she exclaimed  i go he answered i have no choice if i waited here twentyfour hours i should hear of it  they can have nothing against you she said on the contrary the only time they have appealed for your aid you gave itvery valuable aid it must have been too  peter ruff nodded  i cannot see he admitted what they can have against me and yet somehow the wording of my invitation seemed to me a little ominous perhaps he added walking to the window and standing looking out for a moment i have a liver this morning i am depressed violet what does it mean when you are depressed  shall you wear your gray clothes for traveling she asked a little irrelevantly  i have not made up my mind peter ruff answered i thought of wearing my brown with a brown overcoat what do you suggest  i like you in brown she answered simply i should change if i were you  he smiled faintly  i believe he said that you have a sort of superstition that as i change my clothes i change my humors  should i be so very far wrong she asked dont think that i am laughing at you peter the greatest men in the world have had their foibles  peter ruff frowned  we shall be away for several days he said be sure that you take some wraps it will be cold crossing  are you going to close the office altogether she asked  peter ruff nodded  put up a notice he saidback on friday pack up your books and take them round to the bank before you leave the lift man will call you a taxicab  he watched her preparations with a sort of gloomy calm  i wish youd tell me what is the matter with you she asked as she turned to follow her belongings  i do not know peter ruff said i suppose i am suffering from what you would call presentiments be at charingcross punctually  why do you go at all she asked these people are of no further use to you only the other day you were saying that you should not accept any more outside cases  i must go peter ruff answered i am not afraid of many things but i should be afraid of disobeying this letter  they had a comfortable journey down a cool bright crossing and found their places duly reserved for them in the french train miss brown in her neat traveling clothes and furs was conscious of looking her best and she did all that was possible to entertain her traveling companion but peter ruff seemed like a man who labors under some sense of apprehension he had faced death more than once during the last few yearsfaced it without flinching and with a certain cool disregard which can only come from the highest sort of courage yet he knew when he read over again in the train that brief summons which he was on his way to obey that he had passed under the shadow of some new and indefinable fear he was perfectly well aware too that both on the steamer and on the french train he was carefully shadowed this fact however did not surprise him he even went out of his way to enter into conversation with one of the two men whose furtive glances into their compartment and whose constant proximity had first attracted his attention the man was civil but vague nevertheless when they took their places in the diningcar they found the two men at the next table peter ruff pointed them out to his companion  doublefours he whispered dont you feel like a criminal  she laughed and they took no more notice of the men but as the train drew near paris he felt some return of the depression which had troubled him during the earlier part of the day he felt a sense of comfort in his companions presence which was a thing utterly strange to him on the other hand he was conscious of a certain regret that he had brought her with him into an adventure of which he could not foresee the end  the lights of paris flashed around themthe train was gradually slackening speed peter ruff with a sigh began to collect their belongings  violet he said i ought not to have brought you something in his voice puzzled her there had been every few times during all the years she had known him when she had been able to detect anything approaching sentiment in his toneand those few times had been when he had spoken of another woman  why not she asked eagerly  peter ruff looked out into the blackness through the glittering arc of lights and perhaps for once he suffered his fancy to build for him visions of things that were not of earth if so however it was a moment which swiftly passed his reply was in a tone as matter of fact as his usual speech  because he said i do not exactly see the end of my present expeditioni do not understand its object  you have some apprehension she asked  none at all he answered why should i there is an unwritten bargain he added a little more slowly to which i subscribed with our friends here and i have certainly kept it in fact the balance is on my side there is nothing for me to fear  the train crept into the gare du nord and they passed through the usual routine of the customs house then in an omnibus they rumbled slowly over the cobblestones through the region of barely lit streets and untidy cafes down the rue lafayette across the famous square and into the rue de rivoli  our movements peter ruff remarked dryly are too well known for us to attempt to conceal them we may as well stop at one of the large hotels it will be more cheerful for you while i am away  they engaged rooms at the continental miss brown whose apartments were in the wing of the hotel overlooking the gardens ascended at once to her room peter ruff who had chosen a small suite on the other side went into the bar for a whiskey and soda a man touched him on the elbow  for monsieur he murmured and vanished  peter ruff turned and opened the note it bore a faint perfume it had a coronet upon the flap of the envelope and it was written in a delicate feminine handwriting  dear mr ruff  if you are not too tired with your journey will you call soon after one oclock to meet some old friends  blanche de maupassim   peter ruff drank his whiskey and soda went up to his rooms and made a careful toilet then he sent a page up for violet who came down within a few minutes she was dressed with apparent simplicity in a highnecked gown a large hat and a single rope of pearls in place of the usual gold purse she carried a small white satin bag exquisitely handpainted everything about her bespoke that elegant restraint so much a feature of the parisian woman of fashion herself peter ruff who had told her to prepare for supping out was at first struck by the simplicity of her attire afterwards he came to appreciate its perfection  they went to the cafe de paris where they were the first arrivals people however began to stream in before they had finished their meal and peter ruff comparing his companions appearance with the more flamboyant charms of these ladies from the opera and the theatres began to understand the numerous glances of admiration which the impressionable frenchmen so often turned in their direction there was between them toward the end of the meal something which amounted almost to nervousness  you are going to keep your appointment tonight peter his companion asked  peter ruff nodded  as soon as i have taken you home he said i shall probably return late so we will breakfast here tomorrow morning if you like at halfpast twelve i will send a note to your room when i am ready  she looked him in the eyes  peter she said supposing that note doesnt come  he shrugged his shoulders  my dear violet he said you and ior rather i for you are not concerned in thislive a life which is a little different from the lives of most of the people around us the million pay their taxes and they expect police protection in times of danger for me there is no such resource my life has its own splendid compensations i have weapons with which to fight any ordinary danger what i want to explain to you is thisthat if you hear no more of me you can do nothing if that note does not come to you in the morning you can do nothing wait here for three days and after that go back to england you will find a letter on your desk telling you there exactly what to do  you have something in your mind she said of which you have not told me  i have nothing he answered firmly upon my honor i know of no possible cause of offense which our friends could have against me their summons is i will admit somewhat extraordinary but i go to obey it absolutely without fear you can sleep well violet we lunch here tomorrow without a doubt  they drove back to the hotel almost in silence violet was looking fixedly out of the window of the taxicab as though interested in watching the crowds upon the street peter ruff appeared to be absorbed in his own thoughts yet perhaps they were both of them nearer to one another than either surmised their parting in the hall of the continental hotel was unemotional enough for a moment peter ruff had hesitated while her hand had lain in his he had opened his lips as though he had something to say her eyes grew suddenly softerseemed to seek his as though begging for those unspoken words but peter ruff did not say them then  i shall be back all right he said good night violet sleep well  he turned back towards the waiting taxicab  number 16 rue de st quintaine he told the man it was not a long ride in less than a quarter of an hour peter ruff presented himself before a handsome white house in a quiet aristocraticlooking street at his summons the postern door flew open and a manservant in plain livery stood at the second entrance  madame la marquise peter ruff asked  the man bowed in silence and took the visitors hat and overcoat he passed along a spacious hall and into a delightfully furnished reception room where an old lady with gray hair sat in the midst of a little circle of men peter ruff stood for a moment upon the threshold looking around him she held out her hands  it is monsieur peter ruff is it not at last then i am gratified i have wished for so long to see one who has become so famous  peter ruff took her hands in his and raised them gallantly to his lips  madame he said this is a pleasure indeed at my last visit here you were in italy  i grow old she answered i leave paris but little now where one has lived one should at least be content to die  madame speaks a philosophy peter ruff answered which as yet she has no need to learn  the old lady turned to a man who stood upon her right  and this from an englishman she exclaimed  there were others who took peter ruff by the hand then the servants were handing round coffee in little sevres cups on the sideboard was a choice of liqueurs and bottles of wine peter ruff found himself hospitably entertained with both small talk and refreshments but every now and then his eyes wandered back to where madame sat in her chair her hair as white as snowbeautiful still in spite of the cruel mouth and the narrow eyes  she is wonderful he murmured to a man who stood by his side  she is eightysix was the answer in a whisper and she knows everything  as the clock struck two a tall footman entered the room and wheeled madames chair away several of the guests left at the same time ruff when the door was closed counted those who remained as he had imagined would be the case he found that there were eight  a tall graybearded man who from the first had attached himself to ruff and who seemed to act as a sort of master of ceremonies now approached him once more and laid his hand upon his shoulder  mon ami he said we will now discuss if it pleases you the little matter concerning which we took the liberty of asking you to favor us with a visit  what here peter ruff asked in some surprise  his friend who had introduced himself as monsieur de founcelles smiled  but why not he asked ah but i think i understand he added almost immediately you are english monsieur peter ruff and in some respects you have not moved with the times confess now that your idea of a secret society is a collection of strangely attired men who meet in a cellar and build subterranean passages in case of surprise in paris i think we have gone beyond that sort of thing we of the doublefour have no headquarters save the drawingroom of madame no hidingplaces whatsoever no meetingplaces save the fashionable cafes or our own reception rooms the police follow uswhat can they discovernothing what is there to discovernothing our lives are lived before the eyes of all paris there is never any suspicion of mystery about any of our movements we have our hobbies and we indulge in them monsieur the marquis de sogrange here is a great sportsman monsieur le comte owns many racehorses i myself am an authority on pictures and own a collection which i have bequeathed to the state paris knows us well as men of fashion and markparis does not guess that we have perfected an organization so wonderful that the whole criminal world pays toll to us  dear me peter ruff said this is very interesting  we have a trained army at our disposal monsieur de founcelles continued who numerically as well as in intelligence outnumber the whole force of gendarmes in paris no criminal from any other country can settle down here and hope for success unless he joins us an exploit which is inspired by us cannot fail our agents may count on our protection and receive it without question  i am bewildered peter ruff said frankly i do not understand how you gentlemenwhom one knows by name so well as patrons of sport and society can spare the time for affairs of such importance  monsieur de founcelles nodded  we have very valuable aid he said there is below usthe doublefourthe eight gentlemen now present an executive council composed of five of the shrewdest men in france they take their orders from us we plan and they obey we have imagination and special sources of knowledge they have the most perfect machinery for carrying out our schemes that it is possible to imagine i do not wish to boast mr ruff but if i take a directory of paris and place after any mans name whatever his standing or estate a black cross that man dies before seven days have passed you buy your evening papera man has committed suicide you read of a letter found by his side an unfortunate love affaira tale of jealousy or reckless speculation mr ruff the majority of these explanations are false they are invented and arranged for by us this year alone five men in paris of position have been found dead and accounted for excellent reasons suicides in each one of these cases monsieur ruff although not a soul has a suspicion of it the removal of these men was arranged for by the doublefour  i trust peter ruff said that it may never be my illfortune to incur the displeasure of so marvelous an association  on the contrary monsieur ruff the other answered the attention of the association has been directed towards certain incidents of your career in a most favorable manner we have spoken of you often lately mr ruff between ourselves we arrive now at the object for which we begged the honor of your visit it is to offer you the presidency of our executive council  peter ruff had thought of many things but he had not thought of this he gasped recovered himself and realized at once the dangers of the position in which he stood  the council of five he said thoughtfully  precisely monsieur de founcelles replied the salaryforgive me for giving such prominence to a matter which you doubtless consider of secondary importanceis ten thousand pounds a year with a residence here and in londonalso servants  it is princely peter ruff declared i cannot imagine monsieur how you could have believed me capable of filling such a position  there is not much about you mr ruff which we do not know monsieur de founcelles answered there are points about your career which we have marked with admiration your work over here was rapid and comprehensive we know all about your checkmating the count von hern and the comtesse de pilitz we have appealed to you for aid once onlyyour response was prompt and brilliant you have all the qualifications we desire you are still young physically you are sound you speak all languages and you are unmarried  i am what peter ruff asked with a start  a bachelor monsieur de founcelles answered we who have made crime and its detection a lifelong study have reduced many matters concerning it to almost mathematical exactitude of one thing we have become absolutely convincedit is that the great majority of cases in which the police triumph are due to the treachery of women the criminal who steers clear of the other sex escapes a greater danger than the detectives who dog his heels it is for that reason that we choose only unmarried men for our executive council  peter ruff made a gesture of despair and i am to be married in a month he exclaimed  there was a murmur of dismay if those other seven men had not once intervened it was because the conduct of the affair had been voted into the hands of monsieur de founcelles and there was little which he had left unsaid nevertheless they had formed a little circle around the two men every word passing between them had been listened to eagerly gestures and murmured exclamations had been frequent enough there arose now a chorus of voices which their leader had some difficulty in silencing  it must be arranged  but it is impossiblethis  monsieur ruff amuses himself with us  gentlemen peter ruff said i can assure you that i do nothing of the sort the affair was arranged some months ago and the young lady is even now in paris purchasing her trousseau  monsieur de founcelles with a wave of the hand commanded silence there was probably a way out in any case one must be found  monsieur ruff he said putting aside for one moment your sense of honor which of course forbids you even to consider the possibility of breaking your wordsupposing that the young lady herself should withdraw  you dont know miss brown peter ruff interrupted it is a pleasure to which i hope to attain monsieur de founcelles declared smoothly let us consider once more my proposition i take it for granted that apart from this threatened complication you find it agreeable  i am deeply honored by it peter ruff declared  well that being so monsieur de founcelles said more cheerfully we must see whether we cannot help you tell me who is this fortunate young ladythis miss brown  she is a young person of good birth and some means peter ruff declared she is in a small way an actress she has also been my secretary from the first monsieur de founcelles nodded his head thoughtfully  ah he said she knows your secrets then i presume  she does peter ruff assented she knows a great deal  a young person to be conciliated by all means monsieur de founcelles declared well we must see when monsieur ruff may i have the opportunity of making the acquaintance of this young lady  tomorrow morning or rather this morning if you will peter ruff answered we are taking breakfast together at the cafe de paris it will give me great pleasure if you will join us  on the contrary monsieur de founcelles declared i must beg of you slightly to alter your plans i will ask you and mademoiselle to do me the honor of breakfasting at the ritz with the marquis de sogrange and myself at the same hour we shall find there more opportunity for a short discussion  i am entirely at your service peter ruff answered there were signs now of a breakingup of the little party  we must all regret dear monsieur ruff monsieur de founcelles said as he made his adieux this temporary obstruction to the consummation of our hopes let us pray that mademoiselle will not be unreasonable  you are very kind peter ruff murmured  peter ruff drove through the gray dawn to his hotel in the splendid automobile of monsieur de founcelles whose homeward route lay in that direction it was four oclock when he accepted his key from a sleepylooking clerk and turned towards the staircase the hotel was wrapped in semigloom sweepers and cleaners were at work the palms had been turned out into the courtyard dust sheets lay over the furniture one person only save himself and the untidylooking servants was astir from a distant corner which commanded the entrance he saw violet stealing away to the corridor which led to her part of the hotel she had sat there all through the night to see him come into be assured of his safety peter ruff stared after her disappearing figure as one might have watched a ghost  the luncheonparty was a great success peter ruff was human enough to be proud of his companionproud of her smartness which was indubitable even here surrounded as they were by frenchwomen of the best class proud of her accent of the admiration which she obviously excited in the two frenchmen his earlier enjoyment of the meal was a little clouded from the fact that he felt himself utterly outshone in the matter of general appearance no tailor had ever suggested to him a coat so daring and yet so perfect as that which adorned the person of the marquis de sogrange the deep violet of his tie was a shade unknown in bond streetinimitablea true education in color they had the bearing too these frenchmen he watched monsieur de founcelles bending over violet and he was suddenly conscious of a wholly new sensation he did not recognizecould not even classify it he only knew that it was not altogether pleasant and that it set the warm blood tingling through his veins  it was not until they were sitting out in the winter garden taking their coffee and liqueurs that the object of their meeting was referred to then monsieur de founcelles drew violet a little away from the others and the marquis with a meaning smile took peter ruffs arm and led him on one side monsieur de founcelles wasted no words at all  mademoiselle he said monsieur ruff has doubtless told you that last night i made him the offer of a great position among us  she looked at him with twinkling eyes  go on please she said  i offered him a position of great dignityof great responsibility monsieur de founcelles continued i cannot explain to you its exact nature but it is in connection with the most wonderful organization of its sort which the world has ever known  the doublefour she murmured  attached to the post is a princely salary and but one condition monsieur de founcelles said watching the girls face the condition is that mr ruff remains a bachelor  violet nodded  peters told me all this she remarked he wants me to give him up  monsieur de founcelles drew a little closer to his companion there was a peculiar smile upon his lips  my dear young lady he said softly forgive me if i point out to you that with your appearance and gifts a marriage with our excellent friend is surely not the summit of your ambitions here in paris i promise you herewe can do much better than that for you you have not perhaps a dot good that is our affair give up our friend here and we deposit in any bank you like to name the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand francs  two hundred and fifty thousand francs violet repeated slowly  monsieur de founcelles nodded  it is enough he asked  she shook her head  it is not enough she answered  monsieur de founcelles raised his eyebrows  we do not bargain he said coldly and money is not the chief thing in the world it is for you then to name a sum  monsieur de founcelles she said can you tell me the amount of the national debt of france  somewhere about nine hundred million francs i believe he answered  she nodded  that is exactly my price she declared  for giving up peter ruff he gasped  she looked at her employer thoughtfully  he doesnt look worth it does he she said with a queer little smile i happen to care for him thoughthats all  monsieur de founcelles shrugged his shoulders he knew men and women and for the present he accepted defeat he sighed heavily  i congratulate our friend and i envy him he said if ever you should change your mind mademoiselle  it is our privilege isnt it she remarked with a brilliant smile if i do i shall certainly let you know  on the way home peter ruff was genialmiss brown silent he had escaped from a difficult position and his sense of gratitude toward his companion was strong he showed her many little attentions on the voyage which sometimes escaped him from dover they had a carriage to themselves  peter miss brown said after he had made her comfortable when is it to be  when is what to be he asked puzzled  our marriage she answered looking at him for a moment in most bewildering fashion and then suddenly dropping her eyes  peter ruff returned her gaze in blank amazement  what do you mean violet he exclaimed  just what i say she answered composedly when are we going to be married  peter ruff frowned  what nonsense he said we are not going to be married you know that quite well  oh no i dont she declared smiling at him in a heavenly fashion at your request i have told monsieur de founcelles that we were engaged incidentally i have refused two hundred and fifty thousand francs and i believe an admirer for your sake i declared that i was going to marry you and i must keep my word  peter ruff began to feel giddy  look here violet he said you know very well that we arranged all that between ourselves  arranged all that she repeated with a little laugh perhaps we did you asked me to marry you and you posed as my fiancee you kept it up just as long as youit suits me to keep it up a little longer  do you mean to saydo you seriously mean that you expect me to marry you he asked aghast  i do she admitted i have meant you to for some time peter  she was very alluring and peter ruff hesitated she held out her hands and leaned towards him her muff fell to the floor she had raised her veil and a faint perfume of violets stole into the carriage her lips were a little parted her eyes were saying unutterable things  you dont want me to sue you do you peter she murmured  peter ruff sighedand yielded    chapter x wonderful john dory   the woman who had been peter ruffs first love had fallen upon evil days her prettiness was on the wanepowder and rouge late hours and excesses of many kinds had played havoc with it even in these few months her clothes were showy but cheap her boots themselves unclean and down at heel told the story she stood upon the threshold of peter ruffs office and looked half defiantly half doubtfully at violet who was its sole occupant  can i do anything for you the latter asked noticing the womans hesitation  i want to see mr ruff the visitor said  mr ruff is out at present violet answered  when will he be in  i cannot tell you violet said perhaps you had better leave a message or will you call again mr ruff is very uncertain in his movements  maud sank into a chair  ill wait she declared  i am not sure violet remarked raising her eyebrows whether that will be convenient there may be other clients in mr ruff himself may not be back for several hours  are you his secretary maud asked without moving  i am his secretary and also his wife violet declared the woman raised herself a little in her chair  some people have all the luck she muttered its only a few months ago that mr ruff was glad enough to take me out you remember when i used to come here  i remember violet assented  i was all right then the woman continued and nownow im down and out she added with a little sob you see what i am like you look as though you didnt care to have me in the office and i dont wonder at it you look as though you were afraid id come to beg and you are righti have come to beg  i am sure mr ruff will do what he can for you violet said although  i see you know all about it maud interrupted with a hard little laugh i came once to wheedle information out of him i came to try and betray the only man who ever really cared for me mr ruff was too clever and i am thankful for it i have been as big a fool as a woman can be but i am payingoh i am paying for it right enough  she swayed in her chair and violet was only just in time to catch her she led the fainting woman to an inner room made her comfortable upon a sofa and sent out for some food and a bottle of wine down in the street below john dory who had tracked his wife to the building was walking away with face as black as night he knew that maud had lost her position that she was in need of moneyalmost penniless he had waited to see to whom she would turn hopingpoor fool as he called himselfthat she would come back to him and it was his enemy to whom she had gone he had seen her enter the building he knew that she had not left it in the morning they brought him another reportshe was still within it was the end this he told himself there must be a settlement between him and peter ruff  mr john dory who had arrived at clenarvon court in a fourwheel cab from the nearest railway station was ushered by the butler to the door of one of the rooms on the ground floor overlooking the park a policeman was there on guarda policeman by his attitude and salute although he was in plain clothes john dory nodded and turned to the butler  you see the man knows me he said here is my card i am john dory from scotland yard i want to have a few words with the sergeant  the butler hesitated  our orders are very strict sir he said i am afraid that i cannot allow you to enter the room without a special permit from his lordship you see we have had no advice of your coming  john dory nodded  quite right he answered if every one were to obey his orders as literally there would be fewer robberies however you see that this man recognizes me  the butler turned toward an elderly gentleman in a pink coat and ridingbreeches who had just descended into the hall  his lordship is here he said he will give you permission without a doubt there is a gentleman from scotland yard your lordship he explained who wishes to enter the morningroom to speak with the sergeant  inspector john dory at your lordships service saluting i have been sent down from town to help in this little business  lord clenarvon smiled  i should have thought that under the circumstances he said two of you would have been enough still it is not for me to complain pray go in and speak to the sergeant you will find him inside rather dull work for him im afraid and quite unnecessary  i am not so sure your lordship dory answered the clenarvon diamonds are known all over the world and i suppose there isnt a thieves den in europe that does not know that they will remain here exposed with your daughters other wedding presents  lord clenarvon smiled once more and shrugged his shoulders he was a man who had unbounded faith in his fellowcreatures  i suppose he said it is the penalty one has to pay for historical possessions go in and talk to the sergeant by all means mr dory i hope that graves will succeed in making you comfortable during your stay here  john dory was accordingly admitted into the room which was so jealously guarded at first sight it possessed a somewhat singular appearance the windows had every one of them been boarded up and the electric lights consequently fully turned on a long table stood in the middle of the apartment serving as support for a long glass showcase open at the top within this from end to end stretched the presents which a large circle of acquaintances were presenting to one of the most popular young women in society on the occasion of her approaching marriage to the duke of rochester in the middle the wonderful clenarvon diamonds set in the form of a tiara flashed strange lights into the somberly lit apartment at the end of the table a police sergeant was sitting with a little pile of newspapers and illustrated journals before him he rose to his feet with alacrity at his superiors entrance  good morning saunders john dory said i see youve got it pretty snug in here  pretty well thank you sir saunders answered is there anything stirring  john dory looked behind to be sure that the door was closed then he stopped for a moment to gaze at the wonderful diamonds and finally sat on the table by his subordinates side  not exactly that saunders he said to tell you the truth i came down here because of that list of guests you sent me up  saunders smiled  i think i can guess the name you singled out sir he said  it was peter ruff of course dory said what is he doing here in the house under his own name and as a guest  i have asked no questions sir saunders answered i underlined the name in case it might seem worth your while to make inquiries  john dory nodded  nothing has happened of course he asked  nothing saunders answered you see with the windows all boarded up there is practically only the ordinary door to guard so we feel fairly secure  no one hanging about the detective asked mr ruff himself for instance hasnt been trying to make your acquaintance  no sign of it sir the man answered i saw him pass through the hall yesterday afternoon as i went off duty and he was in riding clothes all splashed with mud i think he has been hunting every day  john dory muttered something between his lips and turned on his heel  how many men have you here saunders he asked  only two sir beside myself the man replied  the detective went round the boarded windows examining the work carefully until he reached the door  i am going to see if i can have a word with his lordship he said  he caught lord clenarvon in the act of mounting his horse in the great courtyard  what is it mr dory the earl asked stooping down  there is one name your lordship among your list of guests concerning which i wish to have a word with you the detective saidthe name of mr peter ruff  dont know anything about him lord clenarvon answered cheerfully you must see my daughter lady mary it was she who sent him his invitation seems a decent little fellow and rides as well as the best youll find lady mary about somewhere if youd like to ask her  lord clenarvon hurried off with a little farewell wave of his crop and john dory returned into the house to make inquiries respecting lady mary in a very few minutes he was shown into her presence she smiled at him cheerfully  another detective she exclaimed i am sure i ought to feel quite safe now what can i do for you mr dory  i have had a list of the guests sent to me dory answered in which i notice the name of mr peter ruff  lady mary nodded  well she asked  i have just spoken to his lordship the detective continued and he referred me to you  do you want to know all about mr ruff lady mary asked smiling  if your ladyship will pardon my saying so i think that neither you nor any one else could tell me that what i wished to say was that i understood that we at scotland yard were placed in charge of your jewels until after the wedding mr peter ruff is as you may be aware a private detective himself  i understand perfectly lady mary said i can assure you mr dory that mr ruff is here entirely as a personal and very valued friend of my own on two occasions he has rendered very signal service to my familyservices which i am quite unable to requite  in that case your ladyship there is nothing more to be said i conceive it however to be my duty to tell you that in our opinionthe opinion of scotland yardthere are things about the career of mr peter ruff which need explanation he is a person whom we seldom let altogether out of our sight  lady mary laughed frankly  my dear mr dory she said this is one of the cases then in which i can assure you that i know more than scotland yard there is no person in the world in whom i have more confidence and with more reason than mr peter ruff  john dory bowed  i thank your ladyship he said i trust that your confidence will never be misplaced may i ask one more question  certainly lady mary replied so long as you make no insinuations whatever against my friend  i should be very sorry to do so john dory declared i simply wish to know whether mr ruff has any instructions from you with reference to the care of your jewels  certainly not lady mary replied decidedly mr ruff is here entirely as my guest he has been in the room with the rest of us to look at them and it was he by the bye who discovered a much more satisfactory way of boarding the windows anything else mr dory  i thank your ladyship nothing the detective answered with your permission i propose to remain here until after the ceremony  just as you like of course lady mary said i hope you will be comfortable  john dory bowed and returned to confer with his sergeant afterwards finding the morning still fine he took his hat and went for a walk in the park  as a matter of fact this in some respects the most remarkable of the adventures which had ever befallen mr peter ruff came to him by accident lady mary had read the announcement of his marriage in the paper had driven at once to his office with a magnificent present and insisted upon his coming with his wife to the party which was assembling at clenarvon court in honor of her own approaching wedding peter ruff had taken few holidays of late years and for several days had thoroughly enjoyed himself the matter of the clenarvon jewels he considered perhaps with a slight professional interest but so far as he could see the precautions for guarding them were so adequate that the subject did not remain in his memory he had however a very distinct and disagreeable shock when on the night of john dorys appearance he recognized among a few newlyarrived guests the marquis de sogrange he took the opportunity as soon as possible of withdrawing his wife from a little circle among whom they had been talking to a more retired corner of the room she saw at once that something had happened to disturb him  violet he said dont look behind now  i recognized him at once she interrupted it is the marquis de sogrange  peter ruff nodded  it will be best for you he said not to notice him of course his presence here may be accidental he has a perfect right to enter any society he chooses at the same time i am uneasy  she understood in a moment  the clenarvon diamonds she whispered he nodded  it is just the sort of affair which would appeal to the doublefour he said they are worth anything up to a quarter of a million and it is an enterprise which could scarcely be attempted except by some one in a peculiar position violet if i were not sure that he had seen me i should leave the house this minute  why she asked wonderingly  dont you understand peter ruff continued softly that i myself am still what they call a corresponding member of the doublefour and they have a right to appeal to me for help in this country as i have a right to appeal to them for help or information in france we have both made use of one another to some extent no doubt if the marquis has any scheme in his mind he would look upon me as a valuable ally  she turned slowly pale  peter she said you wouldnt dreamyou wouldnt dare to be so foolish  he shook his head firmly  my dear girl he said we talked that all out long ago a few years since i felt that i had been treated badly that i was an alien and that the hand of the law was against me i talked wildly then perhaps when i put up my sign and sat down for clients i meant to cheat the law if i could things have changed violet i want nothing of that sort i have kept my hands clean and i mean to do so why years ago he continued when i was feeling at my wildest these very jewels were within my grasp one foggy night and i never touched them  what would happen if you refused to help  i do not know peter ruff answered the conditions are a little severe but after all there are no hard and fast rules it rests with the marquis himself to shrug his shoulders and appreciate my position perhaps he may not even exchange a word with me here is lord sotherst coming to talk to you and captain hamilton is waiting for me to tell him an address remember dont recognize sogrange  dinner that night was an unusually cheerful meal peter ruff who was an excellent raconteur told many stories the marquis de sogrange was perhaps the next successful in his efforts to entertain his neighbors violet found him upon her left hand and although he showed not the slightest signs of having ever seen her before they were very soon excellent friends after dinner sogrange and peter ruff drifted together on their way to the billiardroom sogrange however continued to talk courteously of trifles until having decided to watch the first game they found themselves alone on the leather divan surrounding the room  this is an unexpected pleasure my friend sogrange said watching the ash of his cigar professional  peter ruff shook his head not in the least he answered i have had the good fortune to render lady mary and her brother at different times services which they are pleased to value highly we are here as ordinary guestsmy wife and i the marquis sighed  ah that wife of yours ruff he said she is charming i admit and you are a lucky man but it was a pricea very great price to pay  you perhaps are ambitious marquis peter ruff answered i have not done so badly a little contents me  sogrange looked at him as though he were some strange creature  i see he murmured i see with you of course the commercial side comes uppermost mr ruff what do you suppose the income from my estate amounts to peter ruff shook his head he did not even know that the marquis was possessed of estates  somewhere about seven millions of francs sogrange declared there are few men in paris more extravagant than i and i think that we frenchmen know what extravagance means but i cannot spend my income do you think that it is for the sake of gain that i have come across the channel to add the clenarvon diamonds to our coffers  peter ruff sat very still  you mean that he said  of course sogrange answered didnt you realize it directly you saw me what is there do you think in a dull english houseparty to attract a man like myself dont you understand that it is the gamblers instinctthe restless desire to be playing pitchandtoss with fate with honor with life and death if you willthat brings such as myself into the ranks of the doublefour it is the weariness which kills peter ruff one must needs keep it from ones bones  marquis peter ruff answered i do not profess to understand you i am not weary of life in fact i love it i am looking forward to the years when i have enough moneyand it seems as though that time is not far offwhen i can buy a little place in the country and hunt a little and shoot a little and live a simple outofdoor life you see marquis we are as far removed as the poles  obviously sogrange answered  your confidence peter ruff continued the confidence with which you have honored me inspires me to make you one request i am here indeed as a friend of the family you will not ask me to help in any designs you may have against the clenarvon jewels  sogrange leaned back in his chair and laughed softly his lips when they parted from his white teeth resolved themselves into lines which at that moment seemed to peter ruff more menacing than mirthful sogrange was in many ways a man of remarkable appearance  oh peter ruff he said you are a bourgeois little person you should have been the burgomaster in a little german town or a french mayor with a chain about your neck we will see i make no promises all that i insist upon for the present is that you do not leave this houseparty without advising methat is to say if you are really looking forward to that pleasant life in the country where you will hunt a little and shoot a little and grow into the likeness of a vegetable you with your charming wife peter ruff you should be ashamed to talk like that come i must play bridge with the countess i am engaged for a table  the two men parted peter ruff was uneasy on his way from the room lord sotherst insisted upon his joining a pool  charming fellow sogrange the latter remarked as he chalked his cue he has been a great friend of the governorshe and his father before him our families have intermarried once or twice  he seems very agreeable peter ruff answered devoting himself to the game  the following night being the last but one before the wedding itself a large dinnerparty had been arranged for and the resources of even so princely a mansion as clenarvon court were strained to their utmost by the entertainment of something like one hundred guests in the great banquetinghall the meal was about halfway through when those who were not too entirely engrossed in conversation were startled by hearing a dull rumbling sound like the moving of a number of pieces of heavy furniture people looked doubtfully at one another peter ruff and the marquis de sogrange were among the first to spring to their feet  its an explosion somewhere the latter cried sounds close at hand too  they made their way out into the hall exactly opposite now was the room in which the wedding presents had been placed and where for days nothing had been seen but a closed door and a man on duty outside the door now stood wide open and in place of the single electric light which was left burning through the evening the place seemed almost aflame  ruff sogrange and lord sotherst were the first three to cross the threshold they were met by a rush of cold wind opposite to them two of the windows with their boardings had been blown away sergeant saunders was still sitting in his usual place at the end of the table his head bent upon his folded arms the man who had been on duty outside was standing over him white with horror far away in the distance down the park one could faintly hear the throbbing of an engine and peter ruff through the chasm saw the lights of a great motorcar flashing in and out amongst the trees the room itselfthe whole glittering array of presentsseemed untouched only the great centerpiecethe clenarvon diamondshad gone even as they stood there the rest of the guests crowding into the open door john dory tore through his face white with excitement peter ruffs calm voice penetrated the din of tongues  lord sotherst he said you have telephones in the keepers lodges there is a motorcar being driven southwards at full speed telephone down and have your gates secured dory i should keep every one out of the room some one must telephone for a doctor i suppose your man has been hurt  the guests were wild with curiosity but lord clenarvon with an insistent gesture led the way back to the diningroom  whatever has happened he said the people who are in charge there know best how to deal with the situation there is a detective from scotland yard and his subordinates and a gentleman in whom i also have most implicit confidence we will resume our dinner if you please ladies and gentlemen  unwillingly the people were led away john dory was already in his greatcoat ready to spring into the powerful motorcar which had been ordered out from the garage a doctor who had been among the guests was examining the man saunders who sat in that still unnatural position at the head of the table  the poor fellow has been shot in the back of the head with some peculiar implement he said the bullet is very longalmost like a needleand it seems to have penetrated very nearly to the base of the brain  is he dead peter ruff asked  the doctor shook his head  no he answered an inch higher up and he must have died at once i want some of the menservants to help me carry him to a bedroom and plenty of hot water some one else must go for my instrument case  lord sotherst took these things in charge and john dory turned to the man whom they had found standing over him  tell us exactly what happened he said briefly  i was standing outside the door the man answered i heard no sound insidethere was nothing to excite suspicion in any way suddenly there was this explosion it took me perhaps thirty or forty seconds to get the key out of my pocket and unlock the door when i entered the side of the room was blown in like that the diamonds were gone saunders was leaning forward just in the position he is in now and there wasnt another soul in sight then you and the others came  john dory rushed from the room they had brought him word that the car was waiting at such a moment he was ready even to forget his ancient enmity he turned towards peter ruff whose calm bearing somehow or other impressed even the detective with a sense of power  will you come along he asked  peter ruff shook his head  thank you dory no he said i am glad you have asked me but i think you had better go alone  a few seconds later the pursuit was started saunders was carried out of the room followed by the doctor there remained only peter ruff and the man who had been on duty outside peter ruff seated himself where saunders had been sitting and seemed to be closely examining the table all round for some moments once he took up something from between the pages of the book which the sergeant had apparently been reading and put it carefully into his own pocketbook then he leaned back in the chair with his hands clasped behind his head and his eyes fixed upon the ceiling as though thinking intently  hastings he said to the policeman who all the time was pursuing a stream of garrulous inconsequent remarks i wonder whether youd step outside and see mr richards the butler ask him if he would be so good as to spare me a moment  ill do it sir the man answered with one more glance through the open space lord he added they must have been in through there and out again like cats  it was quick work certainly peter ruff answered genially but then an enterprise like this would of course only be attempted by experts  peter ruff was not left alone long mr richards came hurrying in  this is a terrible business sir he said his lordship has excused me from superintending the service of the dinner anything that i can do for you i am to give my whole attention to these were my orders  very good of you richards peter ruff answered very thoughtful of his lordship in the first place then i think we will have the rest of this jewelry packed in cases at once not that anything further is likely to happen he continued but still it would be just as well out of the way i will remain here and superintend this if you will send a couple of careful servants in the meantime i want you to do something else for me  certainly sir the man answered  i want a plan of the house peter ruff said with the names of the guests who occupy this wing  the butler nodded gravely  i can supply you with it very shortly sir he said there is no difficulty at all about the plan as i have several in my room but it will take me some minutes to pencil in the names  peter ruff nodded  i will superintend things here until you return he said  it is to be hoped sir the man said as he retreated that the gentleman from scotland yard will catch the thieves after all they hadnt more than ten minutes start and our daimler is a flyer  im sure i hope so peter ruff answered heartily  but alas no such fortune was in store for mr john dory at daybreak he returned in a borrowed trap from a neighboring railway station  our tires had been cut he said in reply to a storm of questions they began to go one after the other as soon as we had any speed on we traced the car to salisbury and there isnt a village within forty miles that isnt looking out for it  peter ruff who had just returned from an early morning walk nodded sympathetically  shall you be here all day mr dory he asked theres just a word or two i should like to have with you  dory turned away he had forced himself in the excitement of the moment to speak to his ancient enemy but in this hour of his humility the mans presence was distasteful to him  i am not sure he said shortly it depends on how things may turn out  the daily life at clenarvon court proceeded exactly as usual breakfast was served early as there was to be big days shoot the marquis de sogrange and peter ruff smoked their cigarettes together afterwards in the great hall then it was that peter ruff took the plunge  marquis he said i should like to know exactly how i stand with youthe doublefour that is to saysupposing i range myself for an hour or so on the side of the law  sogrange smiled  you amuse yourself mr ruff he remarked genially  not in the least peter ruff answered i am serious  sogrange watched the blue cigarette smoke come down his nose  my dear friend he said i am no amateur at this game when i choose to play it i am not afraid of scotland yard i am not afraid he concluded with a little bow even of you  do you ever bet marquis peter ruff asked  twentyfive thousand francs sogrange said smiling that your efforts to aid mr john dory are unavailing  peter ruff entered the amount in his pocketbook it is a bargain he declared our bet i presume carries immunity for me  by all means sogrange answered with a little bow  the marquis beckoned to lord sotherst who was crossing the hall  my dear fellow he said do tell me the name of your hatter in london delions failed me at the last moment and i have not a hat fit for the ceremony tomorrow  ill lend you halfadozen if you can wear them lord sotherst answered smiling the governors sure to have plenty too  sogrange touched his head with a smile  alas he said my head is small even for a frenchmans imagine meotherwise i trust suitably attiredwalking to the church tomorrow in a hat which came to my ears  lord sotherst laughed  scotts will do you all right he said you can telephone  i shall send my man up sogrange determined he can bring me back a selection tell me at what hour is the first drive this morning and are the places drawn yet  come into the gunroom and well see lord sotherst answered  peter ruff made his way to the back quarters of the house in a little sittingroom he found the man he sought sitting alone peter ruff closed the door behind him  john dory he said i have come to have a few words with you  the detective rose to his feet he was in no pleasant mood though the telephone wires had been flashing their news every few minutes it seemed indeed as though the car which they had chased had vanished into space  what do you want to say to me he asked gruffly  i want if i can peter ruff said earnestly to do you a service  dorys eyes glittered  i think he said that i can do without your services  dont be foolish peter ruff said you are harboring a grievance against me which is purely an imaginary one now listen to the facts you employ your wifewhich after all dory i think was not quite the straight thingto try and track down a young man named spencer fitzgerald who was formerly in a small way a client of mine i find your wife an agreeable companionwe become friends then i discover her object and know that i am being fooled the end of that little episode you remember but tell me why should you bear me illwill for defending my friend and myself  the detective came slowly up to peter ruff he took hold of the lapel of the others coat with his left hand and his right hand was clenched but peter ruff did not falter  listen to me said dory i will tell you what grudge i bear against you it was your entertainment of my wife which gave her the taste for luxury and for gadding about mind i dont blame you for that altogether but there the fact remains she left me she went on the stage  stop peter ruff said you must still hold me blameless she wrote to me i went out with her once the only advice i gave her was to return to you so far as i am concerned i have treated her with the respect that i would have shown my own sister  you lie dory cried fiercely a month ago i saw her come to your fiat i watched for hours she did not leave itshe did not leave it all that night  if you object to her visit peter ruff said quietly it is my wife whom you must blame  john dory relaxed his hand and took a quick step backwards  your wife he muttered  exactly peter ruff answered maudmrs dorycalled to see me she was illshe had lost her situationshe was even i believe faint and hungry i was not present my wife talked to her and was sorry for her while the two women were there together your wife fainted she was put to bed in our one spare room and she has been shown every attention and care tell me how long is it since you were at home  not for ten days dory answered bitterly why  because when you go back you will find your wife there peter ruff answered she has given up the stage her one desire is to settle down and repay you for the trouble she has caused you you neednt believe me unless you like ask my wife she is here she will tell you  dory was overcome he went back to his seat by the window and he buried his face for a moment in his hands  ruff he said i dont deserve this ive had bad times lately though everything has gone against me i think i have been a bit careless with the troubles at home and that  stop peter ruff insisted now i come to the immediate object of my visit to you you have had some bad luck at headquarters i know of it i am going to help you to reinstate yourself brilliantly with that let us shake hands and bury all the soreness that there may be between us  john dory stared at his visitor  do you mean this he asked  i do answered peter please do not think that i mean to make any reflection upon your skill it is just a chance that i was able to see what you were not able to see in an hours time you shall restore the clenarvon diamonds to lord clenarvon you shall take the reward which he has just offered of a thousand pounds and i promise you that the manner in which you shall recover the jewels shall be such that you will be famous for a long time to come  you are a wonderful man said dory hoarsely do you mean then that the jewels were not with those men in the motorcar  of course not peter ruff answered but come along the story will develop  at halfpast ten that morning a motorcar turned out from the garage at clenarvon court and made its way down the avenue in it was a single passengerthe darkfaced parisian valet of the marquis de sogrange as the car left the avenue and struck into the main road it was hailed by peter ruff and john dory who were walking together along the lane  say my man peter ruff said addressing the chauffeur are you going to the station  yes sir the man answered i am taking down the marquis de sogranges servant to catch the eleven oclock train to town  you dont mind giving us a lift peter ruff asked already opening the door  certainly not sir the man answered touching his hat  peter ruff and john dory stepped into the tonneau of the car the man civilly lifted the hatbox from the seat and made room for his enforced companions nevertheless it was easy to see that he was not pleased  theres plenty of room here for three peter ruff said cheerfully as they sat on either side of him drive slowly please chauffeur now mr lemprise peter ruff added we will trouble you to change places  what do you mean the man called out suddenly pale as death  he was held as though in a vice john dorys arm was through his on one side and peter ruffs on the other apart from that the muzzle of a revolver was pressed to his forehead  on second thoughts peter ruff said i think we will keep you like this driver he called out please return to the court at once  the man hesitated  you recognize the gentleman who is with me peter ruff said he is the detective from scotland yard i have full authority from lord clenarvon over all his servants please do as i say  the man hesitated no more the car was backed and turned the frenchman struggling all the way like a wild cat once he tried to kick the hatbox into the road but john dory was too quick for him so they drove up to the front door of the court to be welcomed with cries of astonishment from the whole of the shooting party who were just starting foremost among them was sogrange they crowded around the car peter ruff touched the hatbox with his foot  if we could trouble your lordship he said to open that hatbox you will find something that will interest you mr dory has planned a little surprise for you in which i have been permitted to help  the women who gathered that something was happening came hastening out from the hall they all crowded round lord clenarvon who was cutting through the leather strap of the hatbox inside the silk hat which reposed there were the clenarvon diamonds monsieur le marquis de sogrange was one of the foremost to give vent to an exclamation of delight  monsieur le marquis peter ruff said this should be a lesson to you i hope to have the characters of your servants more rigidly verified mr dory tells me that this man came into your employ at the last moment with a forged recommendation he is in effect a dangerous thief  you amaze me sogrange exclaimed  we are all interested in this affair peter ruff said and my friend john dory here is perhaps too modest properly to explain the matter if you care to come with me we can reconstruct in a minute the theft  john dory and peter ruff first of all handed over their captive who was now calm and apparently resigned to the two policemen who were still on duty in the court afterwards peter ruff led the way up one flight of stairs and turned the handle of the door of an apartment exactly over the morningroom it was the bedroom of the marquis de sogrange  mr dorys chase in the motorcar he said was as you have doubtless gathered now merely a blind it was obvious to his intelligence that the blowing away of the window was merely a ruse to cover the real method of the theft if you will allow me i will show you how it was done  the floor was of hardwood covered with rugs one of these near the fireplace peter ruff brushed aside the seventh square of hardwood from the mantelpiece had evidently been tampered with with very little difficulty he removed it  you see he explained the ceiling of the room below is also of paneled wood having removed this it is easy to lift the second one especially as light screws have been driven in and string threaded about them there is now a hole through which you can see into the room below has dory returned ah here he is  the detective came hurrying into the room bearing in his hand a peculiarshaped weapon a handful of little darts like those which had been found in the wounded mans head and an ordinary fishingrod in a linen case  there is the weapon peter ruff said which it was easy enough to fire from here upon the man who was leaning forward exactly below then here you will see is a somewhat peculiar instrument which shows a great deal of ingenuity in its details  he opened the linen case which was by the bye secured by a padlock and drew out what was to all appearance an ordinary fishingrod fitted at the end with something that looked like an iron hand peter ruff dropped it through the hole until it reached the table moved it backwards and forwards and turned round with a smile  you see he said the theft after all was very simple personally i must admit that it took me a great deal by surprise but my friend mr dory has been on the right track from the first i congratulate him most heartily  dory was a little overcome lady mary shook him heartily by the hand but as they trooped downstairs she stooped and whispered in peter ruffs ear  i wonder how much of this was john dory she said smiling  peter ruff said nothing the detective was already on the telephone wiring his report to london every one was standing about in little knots discussing this wonderful event sogrange sought lord clenarvon and walked with him arm in arm down the stairs  i cannot tell you clenarvon he said how sorry i am that i should have been the means of introducing a person like this to the house i had the most excellent references from the prince of strelitz no doubt they were forged my own man was taken ill just before i left and i had to bring some one  my dear sogrange lord clenarvon said dont think of it what we must be thankful for is that we had so brilliant a detective in the house  as john dory sogrange remarked with a smile lord clenarvon nodded  come he said i dont see why we should lose a days sport because the diamonds have been recovered i always felt that they would turn up again some day or other you are keen i know sogrange  rather the marquis answered but excuse me for one moment there is mrs ruff looking charming there in the corner i must have just a word with her  he crossed the room and bowed before violet  my dear lady he said i have come to congratulate you you have a clever husbanda little cleverer even than i thought i have just had the misfortune to lose to him a bet of twentyfive thousand francs  violet smiled a little uneasily  peter doesnt gamble as a rule she remarked  sogrange sighed  this alas was no gamble he said he was betting upon certainties but he won will you tell him from me when you see him that although i have not the money in my pocket at the moment i shall pay my debts tell him that we are as careful to do that in france as we are to keep our word  he bowed and passed out with the shootingparty on to the terrace peter ruff came up a few minutes later and his wife gave him the message  i did that man an injustice peter ruff said with a sigh of relief i cant explain now dear ill tell you all about it later in the day  theres nothing wrong is there she asked him pleadingly  on the contrary peter ruff declared everything is right i have made friends with dory and i have won a thousand pounds when we leave here i am going to look out for that little estate in the country if you come out with the lunch dear i want you to watch that man hamiltons coat its exactly what i should like to wear myself at my own shooting parties see if you can make a sketch of it when he isnt looking  violet laughed  ill try she promised      book two    chapter i recalled by the doublefour   it is the desire of madame that you should join our circle here on thursday evening next at ten oclock  the man looked up from the sheet of notepaper which he held in his hand and gazed through the open frenchwindows before which he was standing it was a very pleasant and very peaceful prospect there was his croquet lawn smoothshaven the hoops neatly arranged the chalkmark firm and distinct upon the boundary beyond the tennis court the flower gardens and to the left the walled fruit garden a little farther away was the paddock and orchard and a little farther still the farm which for the last four years had been the joy of his life his meadows were yellow with buttercups a thin line of willows showed where the brook wound its lazy way through the bottom fields it was a home this in which a man could well lead a peaceful life could dream away his days to the music of the west wind the gurgling stream the song of birds and the low murmuring of insects peter ruff stood like a man turned to stone for even as he looked these things passed away from before his eyes the roar of the world beat in his earsthe world of intrigue of crime the world where the strong man hewed his way to power and the weaklings fell like corn before the sickle  it is the desire of madame  peter ruff clenched his fists as he stood there it was a message from a world every memory of which had been deliberately crushed a world indeed in which he had seemed no longer to hold any place scarcely yet of middle age wellpreserved upright with neat figure dressed in the conventional tweeds and gaiters of an english country gentleman he not only had loved his life but he looked the part he was peter ruff esquire of aynesford manor in the county of somerset it could not be for him this strange summons  the rustle of a womans soft draperies broke in upon his reverie he turned around with his usual morning greeting upon his lips if country life had agreed with peter ruff it had transformed his wife her cheeks were no longer pale the extreme slimness of her figure was no longer apparent she was just a little more matronly perhaps but without doubt a most beautiful woman she came smiling across the rooma dream of white muslin and pink ribbons  another forage bill my dear peter she demanded passing her arm through his put it away and admire my new morning gown it came straight from paris and you will have to pay a great deal of money for it  he pulled himself togetherhe had no secrets from his wife  listen he said and read aloud   rue de st quintaine  paris  dear mr ruff it is a long time since we had the pleasure of a visit from you it is the desire of madame that you should join our circle here on thursday evening next at ten oclock  sogrange   violet was a little perplexed she failed somehow to recognize the sinister note underlying those few sentences it sounds friendly enough she remarked you are not obliged to go of course  peter ruff smiled grimly  yes it sounds all right he admitted  they wont expect you to take any notice of it surely she continued when you bought this place peter and left your london offices you gave them definitely to understand that you had retired into private life that all these things were finished with you  there are some things peter ruff said slowly which are never finished  but you resigned she reminded him i remember your letter distinctly  from the doublefour he answered no resignation is recognized save death i did what i could and they accepted my explanations gracefully and without comment now that the time has come however when they think they need my help you see they do not hesitate to claim it  you will not go peter you will not think of going she begged  he twisted the letter between his fingers and sat down to his breakfast  no he said i shall not go  that morning peter ruff spent upon his farm looking over his stock examining some new machinery and talking crops with his bailiff in the afternoon he played his customary round of golf it was the sort of day which as a rule he found completely satisfactory yet somehow or other a certain sense of weariness crept in upon him toward its close  two days later he received another letter this time it was couched in different terms on a square card at the top of which was stamped a small coronet he read as follows  madame de maupassim at home saturday evening may 2nd at ten oclock  in small letters at the bottom lefthand corner were added the words  to meet friends  peter ruff put the card upon the fire and went out for a mornings rabbit shooting with his keeper when he returned luncheon was ready but violet was absent he rang the bell  where is your mistress jane he asked the parlormaid  the girl had no idea mrs ruff had left for the village several hours before since then she had not been seen peter ruff ate his luncheon alone and understood the afternoon wore on and at night he traveled up to london he knew better than to waste time by purposeless inquiries instead he took the nine oclock train the next morning to paris  it was a chamber of death into which he was ushered dismalyet of its sort unique marvelous the room itself might have been the sleeping apartment of an empresslofty with white paneled walls adorned simply with gilded lines with high windows closely curtained now so that neither sound nor the light of day might penetrate into the room in the middle of the apartment upon a canopy bedside which had once adorned a kings palace lay madame de maupassim her face was already touched with the finger of death yet her eyes were undimmed and her lips unquivering her hands covered with rings lay out before her upon the lace coverlid supported by many pillows she was issuing her last instructions with the cold precision of the man of affairs who makes the necessary arrangements for a few days absence from his business  peter ruff who had not even been allowed sufficient time to change his traveling clothes was brought without hesitation to her bedside she looked at him in silence for a moment with a cold glitter in her eyes  you are four days late monsieur peter ruff she remarked why did you not obey your first summons  madame he answered i thought there must be a misunderstanding four years ago i gave notice to the council that i had married and retired into private life a country farmer is of no further use to the world  the womans thin lip curled  from death and the double four she said there is no resignation which counts you are as much our creature today as i am the creature of the disease which is carrying me across the threshold of death  peter ruff remained silent the womans words seemed full of dread significance besides how was it possible to contradict the dying  it is upon the unwilling of the world she continued speaking slowly yet with extraordinary distinctness that its greatest honors are often conferred the name of my successor has been balloted for secretly it is you peter ruff who have been chosen  this time he was silent because he was literally bereft of words this woman was dying and fancying strange things he looked from one to the other of the stern pale faces of those who were gathered around her bedside seven of them there werethe same seven at that moment their eyes were all focused upon him peter ruff shrank back  madame he murmured this cannot be  her lips twitched as though she would have smiled what we have decided she said we have decided nothing can alter that not even the will of mr peter ruff  i have been out of the world for four years peter ruff protested i have no longer ambitions no longer any desire  you lie the woman interrupted you lie or you do yourself an injustice we gave you four years and looking into your face i think that it has been enough i think that the weariness is there already in any case the charge which i lay upon you in these my last moments is one which you can escape by death only  a low murmur of voices from those others repeated her words  by death only  peter ruff opened his lips but closed them again without speech a wave of emotion seemed passing through the room something strange was happening it was death itself which had come among them  a morning journalist wrote of the death of madame eloquently and with feeling she had been a broadminded aristocrat a woman of brilliant intellect and great friendships a woman of whose inner life during the last ten or fifteen years little was known yet who in happier times might well have played a great part in the history of her country  peter ruff drove back from the cemetery with the marquis de sogrange and for the first time since the death of madame serious subjects were spoken of  i have waited here patiently he declared but there are limits i want my wife  sogrange took him by the arm and led him into the library of the house in the rue de st quintaine the six men who were already there waiting rose to their feet  gentlemen the marquis said is it your will that i should be spokesman  there was a murmur of assent then sogrange turned toward his companion and something new seemed to have crept into his mannera solemn almost a threatening note  peter ruff he continued you have trifled with the one organization in this world which has never allowed liberties to be taken with it men who have done greater service than you have died for the disobedience of a day you have been treated leniently according to the will of madame according to her will and in deference to the position which you must now take up among us we will treat you as no other has ever been treated by us the doublefour admits your leadership and claims you for its own  i am not prepared to discuss anything of the sort peter ruff declared doggedly until my wife is restored to me  the marquis smiled  the traditions of your race mr ruff he said are easily manifest in you now hear our decision your wife shall be restored to you on the day when you take up this position to which you have become entitled sit down and listen  peter ruff was a rebel at heart but he felt the grip of iron  during these four years when you my friend have been growing turnips and shooting your game events in the great world have marched new powers have come into being a new page of history has been opened as everything which has good at the heart evolves toward the good so we of the doublefour have lifted our great enterprise onto a higher plane the world of criminals is still at our beck and call we still claim the right to draw the line between moral theft and immoral honesty but today the doublefour is concerned with greater things within the four walls of this room within the hearing of these my brothers whose fidelity is as sure as the stones of paris i tell you a great secret the government of our country has craved for our aid and the aid of our organization it is no longer the wealth of the world alone which we may control but the actual destinies of nations  what i suppose you mean to say is peter ruff remarked that youve been going in for politics  you put it crudely my english bulldog sogrange answered but you are right we are occupied now by affairs of international importance more than once during the last few month ours has been the hand which has changed the policy of an empire  most interesting peter ruff declared but so far as i personally am concerned  listen interrupted the marquis not a hundred yards from the french embassy in london there is waiting for you a house and servants no less magnificent than the embassy itself you will become the ambassador in london of the doublefour titular head of our association a personage whose power is second to none in your great city i do not address words of caution to you my friend because we have satisfied ourselves as to your character and capacity before we consented that you should occupy your present position but i ask you to remember this the will of madame lives even beyond the grave the spirit which animated her when alive breathes still in all of us in london you will wield a great power use it for the common good and remember thisthe doublefour has never failed the doublefour never can fail  i am glad to hear you are so confident peter ruff said of course if i have to take this thing on i shall do my best but if i might venture to allude for a moment to anything so trifling as my own domestic affairs i am very anxious to know about my wife  sogrange smiled  you will find mrs ruff awaiting you in london he announced your address is porchester house porchester square  when do i go there peter ruff asked  tonight was the answer  and what do i do when i get there he persisted  for three days the marquis told him you will remain indoors and give audience to whoever may come to you at the end of that time you will understand a little more of our purpose and our objectsperhaps even of our power  i see difficulties peter ruff remarked there will be a good many people who will remember me when i had offices in southampton row my name you see is uncommon  sogrange drew a document from the breast pocket of his coat  when you leave this house tonight he proclaimed we bid goodby forever to mr peter ruff you will find in this envelope the title deeds of a small property which is our gift to you henceforth you will be known by the name and title of your estates  title peter ruff gasped  you will reappear in london sogrange continued as the baron de grost  peter ruff shook his head  it wont do he declared people will find me out  there is nothing to be found out the marquis went on a little wearily your country life has dulled your wits baron the title and the name are justly yoursthey go with the property for the rest the history of your family and of your career up to the moment when you enter porchester house tonight will be inside this packet you can peruse it upon the journey and remember that we can at all times bring a hundred witnesses if necessary to prove that you are who you declare yourself to be when you get to charingcross do not forget that it will be the carriage and servants of the baron de grost which await you  peter ruff shrugged his shoulders  well he said thoughtfully i suppose i shall get used to it  naturally sogrange answered for the moment we are passing through a quiet time necessitated by the mortal illness of madame you will be able to spend the next few weeks in getting used to your new position you will have a great many callers inspired by us who will see that you make the right acquaintances and that you join the right clubs at the same time let me warn you always to be ready there is trouble brewing just now all over europe in one way or another we may become involved at any moment the whole machinery of our society will be explained to you by your secretary you will find him already installed at porchester house a glass of wine baron before you leave  peter ruff glanced at the clock  there are my things to pack he began  sogrange smiled  your valet is already on the front seat of the automobile which is waiting he remarked you will find him attentive and trustworthy the clothes which you brought with you we have taken the liberty of dispensing with you will find others in your trunk and at porchester house you can send for any tailor you choose one toast baron we drink to the doublefourto the great cause  there was a murmur of voices sogrange lifted once more his glass  may peter ruff rest in peace he said we drink to his ashes we drink long life and prosperity to the baron de grost    chapter ii prince alberts card debts   it was half past twelve and every table at the berkeley bridge club was occupied on the threshold of the principal room a visitor who was being shown around was asking questions of the secretary  is there any gambling here he inquired  the secretary shrugged his shoulders  i am afraid that some of them go a little beyond the club points he answered you see that table against the wall they are playing shilling auction there  the table near the wall was perhaps the most silent the visitor looked at it last and most curiously  who is the dissipatedlooking boy playing there he asked  prince albert of trent the secretary answered  and who is the little man rather like napoleon who sits in the easychair and watches  the baron de grost  never heard of him the visitor declared  he is a very rich financier who has recently blossomed out in london the secretary said one sees him everywhere he has a goodlooking wife who is playing in the other room  a goodlooking wife the visitor remarked thoughtfully but yes i thank you very much mr courtledge for showing me round i will find my friends now  he turned away leaving courtledge alone for a minute or two on the threshold of the card room the secretarys attention was riveted upon the table near the wall and the frown on his face deepened just as he was moving off the baron de grost rose and joined him  they are playing a little high in here this evening the latter remarked quietly  courtledge frowned  i wish i had been in the club when they started he said gloomily my task is all the more difficult now  the baron de grost looked pensively for a moment at the cigarette which he was carrying  by the bye mr courtledge he asked with apparent irrelevance what was the name of the tall man with whom you were talking just now  count von hern he was brought in by one of the attaches at the german embassy  baron de grost passed his arm through the secretarys and led him a little way through the corridor  i thought i recognized our friend he remarked his presence here this evening is quite interesting  why this evening  baron de grost avoided the question  mr courtledge he said i think that you will allow me to ask you something without thinking me impertinent you know that my wife and i have taken some interest in prince albert it is on his account is it not that you look so gloomy tonight as though you had an execution in front of you  courtledge nodded  i am afraid he announced that we have come to the end of our tether with that young man its a pity too for he isnt a bad sort and it will do the club no good if it gets about but he hasnt settled up for a fortnight and the matter came before the committee this afternoon he owes one man over seven hundred pounds  the baron de grost listened gravely  are you going to speak to him tonight he asked  i must i am instructed by the committee to ask him not to come to the club again until he has discharged his obligations  de grost smoked thoughtfully for a few moments  well he said i suppose there is no getting out of it dont rub it in too thick though i mean to have a talk with the boy afterwards and if i am satisfied with what he says the money will be all right  courtledge raised his eyebrows  you know of course that he has a very small income and no expectations  i know that baron de grost answered at the same time it is hard to forget that he really is a member of the royal house even though the kingdom is a small one  not only is the kingdom a small one courtledge remarked but there are something like five lives between him and the succession however its very goodnatured of you baron to think of lending him a hand ill let him down as lightly as i can you know him better than any one i wonder if you could make an excuse to send him out of the room id rather no one saw me talking to him  quite easy said the baron ill manage it  the rubber was just finishing as de grost reentered the room he touched the young man who had been the subject of their conversation upon the shoulder  my wife would like to speak to you for a moment he said she is in the other room  prince albert rose to his feet he was looking very pale and the ashtray in front of him was littered with cigarette ends  i will go and pay my respects to the baroness he declared it will change my luck perhaps au revoir  he passed out of the room and all eyes followed him  has the prince been losing again tonight the baron asked  one of the three men at the table shrugged his shoulders  he owes me about five hundred pounds he said and to tell you the truth id really rather not play any more i dont mind high points but his doubles are absurd  why not break up the table the baron suggested the boy can scarcely afford such stakes  he strolled out of the room in time to meet the prince who was standing in the corridor a glance at his face was sufficientthe secretary had spoken he would have hurried off but the baron intercepted him  you are leaving prince he asked  yes was the somewhat curt reply  i will walk a little way with you if i may de grost continued my wife brought lady brownloe and the brougham only holds two comfortably  prince albert made no reply he seemed just then scarcely capable of speech when they had reached the pavement however the baron took his arm  my young friend he inquired how much does it all amount to  the prince turned towards him with darkening face  you knew then he demanded that mr courtledge was going to speak to me of my debts  i was sorry to hear that it had become necessary the baron answered you must not take it too seriously you know very well that at a club like the berkeley which has such a varied membership card debts must be settled on the spot  mine will be settled before midday tomorrow the young man declared sullenly i am not sure that it may not be tonight  de grost was silent for a moment they had turned into piccadilly he summoned a taxicab  do you mind coming round to my house and talking to me for a few minutes he asked  the young man hesitated  ill come round later on he suggested i have a call to make first  de grost held open the door of the taxicab  i want a talk with you he said before you make that call  you speak as though you knew where i was going the prince remarked  his companion made no reply but the door of the taxicab was still open and his hand had fallen ever so slightly upon the others shoulder the prince yielded to the stronger will he stepped inside  they drove in silence to porchester square the baron led the way through into his own private sanctum and closed the door carefully cigars cigarettes whiskey and soda and liqueurs were upon the sideboard  help yourself prince he begged and then if you dont mind i am going to ask you a somewhat impertinent question  the prince drank the greater part of a whiskey and soda and lit a cigarette then he set his tumbler down and frowned  baron de grost he said you have been very kind to me since i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance i hope you will not ask me any question that i cannot answer  on the contrary his host declared the question which i shall ask will be one which it will be very much to your advantage to answer i will put it as plainly as possible you are going as you admit yourself to pay your card debts tonight or tomorrow morning and you are certainly not going to pay them out of your income where is the money coming from  albert of trent seemed suddenly to remember that after all he was of royal descent he drew himself up and bore himself for a moment as a prince should  baron de grost he said you pass the limits of friendship when you ask such a question i take the liberty of wishing you goodnight  he moved towards the door the baron however was in the waya strong motionless figure and his tone when he spoke again was convincing  prince he declared i speak in your own interests you have not chosen to answer my question let me answer it for you the money to pay your debts and i know not how much besides was to come from the government of a country with whom none of your name or nationality should willingly have dealings  the prince started violently the shock caused him to forget his newfound dignity  how in the devils name do you know that he demanded  i know more the baron continued i know the consideration which you were to give for this money  then the prince began plainly to show the terror which had crept into his heartthe terror and the shame he looked at his host like a man dazed with hearing strange things  it comes to nothing he said in a hard unnatural tone it is a foolish bargain indeed between me and the throne are four lives my promise is not worth the paper it is written upon i shall never succeed  that prince is probably where you are misinformed the baron replied you are just now in disgrace with your family and you hear from them only what the newspapers choose to tell  has anything been kept back from me the prince asked  tell me this first de grost insisted am i not right in assuming that you have signed a solemn undertaking that in the event of your succeeding to the throne of your country you will use the whole of your influence towards concluding a treaty with a certain power one of the provisions of which is that that power shall have free access to any one of your ports in the event of war with england  there was a moments silence the prince clutched the back of the chair against which he was leaning  supposing it were true he muttered it is after all an idle promise  the baron shook his head slowly  prince he said it is no such idle promise as it seems the man who is seeking to trade upon your poverty knew more than he would tell you you may have read in the newspapers that your two cousins are confined to the palace with slight colds the truth has been kept quiet but it is none the less known to a few of us the socalled cold is really a virulent attack of diphtheria and according to tonights reports neither prince cyril nor prince henry are expected to live  is this true the prince gasped  it is true his host declared my information can be relied upon  the prince sat down suddenly he was looking whiter than ever and very scared  even then he murmured there is john  you have been out of touch with your family for some months de grost reminded his visitor one or two of us however know what you probably will soon hear prince john has taken the vows and solemnly resigned before the archbishop his heirship he will be admitted into the roman catholic church in a week or two and will go straight to a monastery  its likely enough the prince gasped he always wanted to be a monk  you see now the baron continued that your friends generosity was not so wonderful a thing count von hern was watching you tonight at the bridge club he has gone home he is waiting now to receive you apart from that the man nisch with whom you have played so much is a confederate of his a political tout not to say a spy  the brute prince albert muttered i am obliged to you baron for having warned me he added rising slowly to his feet i shall sign nothing there is another way  de grost shook his head  my young friend he said there is another way indeed but not the way you have in your mind at this moment i offer you an alternative i will give you notes for the full amount you owe tonight so that you can if you will go back to the club direct from here and pay everythingon one condition  condition  you must promise to put your hand to no document which the count von hern may place before you and pledge your word that you have no further dealings with him  but why should you do this for me the prince exclaimed i do not know that i shall ever be able to pay you  if you succeed to the throne you will pay me the baron de grost said if you do not succeed remember that i am a rich man and that i shall miss this money no more than the sixpence which you might throw to a crossingsweeper  the prince was silent his host unlocked a small cabinet and took from it a bundle of notes  tell me the whole amount you owe he insisted every penny mind  sixteen hundred pounds was the broken reply  de grost counted a little roll and laid it upon the table  there are two thousand pounds he said listen prince a name such as you bear carries with it certain obligations remember that and try and shape your life accordingly take my advicego back to your own country and find some useful occupation there even if you only rejoin your regiment and wear its uniform the time may come when your country will require you for her work comes sooner or later to every man you are leading a rotten life over here a life which might have led to disaster and dishonor a life as you know which might have ended in your rooms tonight with a small bullet hole in your forehead brave men do not die like that take up the money please  the baron de grost sent a cipher dispatch to paris that night and received an answer which pleased him  it is a small thing he read but it is well done particulars of a matter of grave importance will reach you tomorrow letter    chapter iii the ambassadors wife   alone in his study with fastlocked door peter baron de grost sat reading word by word with zealous care the despatch from paris which had just been delivered into his hands from the splendid suite of reception rooms which occupied the whole of the lefthand side of the hall came the faint sound of music the street outside was filled with automobiles and carriages setting down their guests madame was receiving tonight a gathering of very distinguished men and women and it was only for a few moments and on very urgent business indeed that her husband had dared to leave her side  the room in which he sat was in darkness except for the single heavily shaded electric lamp which stood by his elbow nevertheless there was sufficient illumination to show that peter had achieved one at least of his ambitions he was wearing court dress with immaculate black silk stockings and diamond buckles upon his shoes a red ribbon was in his buttonhole and a french order hung from his neck his passion for clothes was certainly amply ministered to by the exigencies of his new position once more he read those last few words of this unexpectedly received despatch read them with a frown upon his forehead and the light of trouble in his eyes for three months he had done nothing but live the life of an ordinary man of fashion and wealth his first task for which to tell the truth he had been anxiously waiting was here before him and he found it little to his liking again he read slowly to himself the last paragraph of sogranges  as ever dear friend one of the greatest sayings which the men of my race have ever perpetrated once more justifies itselfcherchez la femme of monsieur we have no manner of doubt we have tested him in every way and to all appearance madame should also be above suspicion yet those things of which i have spoken have happened for two hours this morning i was closeted with picon here very reluctantly he has placed the matter in my hands i pass it on to you it is your first undertaking cher baron and i wish you bon fortune a man of gallantry as i know you are you may regret that it should be a woman and a beautiful woman too against whom the finger must be pointed yet after all the fates are strong and the task is yours  sogrange   the music from the reception rooms grew louder and more insistent peter rose to his feet and moving to the fireplace struck a match and carefully destroyed the letter which he had been reading then he straightened himself glanced for a moment at the mirror and left the room to join his guests   monsieur le baron jests the lady murmured  the baron de grost shook his head  indeed no madame he answered earnestly france has offered us nothing more delightful in the whole history of our entente than the loan of yourself and your brilliant husband monsieur de lamborne makes history among us politically while madame  the baron sighed and his companion leaned a little towards him her dark eyes were full of sentimental regard  yes she murmured continue it is my wish  i am the good friend of monsieur de lamborne the baron said and in his tone there seemed to lurk some faraway touch of regret yet madame knows that her conquests here have been many  the ambassadors wife fanned herself and remained silent for a moment a faint smile playing at the corners of her full curving lips she was indeed a very beautiful womanelegant a parisienne to the fingertips with pale cheeks but eyes dark and soft eyes trained to her service whose flash was an inspiration whose very droop had set beating the hearts of men less susceptible than the baron de grost her gown was magnificent of amber satin a color daring but splendid the outline of her figure as she leaned slightly back in her seat might indeed have been traced by the inspired finger of some great sculptor de grost whose reputation as a man of gallantry was well established felt the whole charm of her presencefelt too the subtle indications of preference which she seemed inclined to accord to him there was nothing which eyes could say which hers were not saying during those few minutes the baron indeed glanced around a little nervously his wife had still her moments of unreasonableness it was just as well that she was engaged with some of her guests at the farther end of the apartments  you are trying to turn my head his beautiful companion whispered you flatter me  it is not possible he answered  again the fan fluttered for a moment before her face she sighed  ah monsieur she continued dropping her voice until it scarcely rose above a whisper there are not many men like you you speak of my husband and his political gifts yet what after all do they amount to what is his position indeed if one glanced behind the scenes compared with yours  the face of the baron de grost became like a mask it was as though suddenly he had felt the thrill of danger close at hand danger even in that scented atmosphere wherein he sat  alas madame he answered it is you now who are pleased to jest your husband is a great and powerful ambassador i unfortunately have no career no place in life save the place which the possession of a few millions gives to a successful financier  she laughed very softly and again her eyes spoke to him monsieur she murmured you and i together could make a great alliance is it not so  madame he faltered doubtfully if one dared hope  once more the fire of her eyes this time not only voluptuous was the man stupid she wondered or only cautious  if that alliance were once concluded she said softly one might hope for everything  if it rests only with me he began seriously oh madame  he seemed overcome madame was gracious but was he really stupid or only very much in earnest  to be one of the worlds money kings she whispered it is wonderfulthat it is powersupreme absolute power there is nothing beyond there is nothing greater  then the baron who was watching her closely caught another gleam in her eyes and he began to understand he had seen it before among a certain type of her countrywomenthe greed of money he looked at her jewels and he remembered that for an ambassador her husband was reputed to be a poor man the cloud of misgiving passed away from him he settled down to the game  if money could only buy the desire of ones heart he murmured alas  his eyes seemed to seek out monsieur de lamborne among the moving throngs she laughed softly and her hand brushed his  money and one other thing monsieur le baron she whispered in his ear can buy the jewels from a crowncan buy even the heart of a woman  a movement of approaching guests caught them up and parted them for a time the baroness de grost was at home from ten till one and her rooms were crowded the baron found himself drawn on one side a few minutes later by monsieur de lamborne himself  i have been looking for you de grost the latter declared where can we talk for a moment  his host took the ambassador by the arm and led him into a retired corner monsieur de lamborne was a tall slight man somewhat cadaverous looking with large features hollow eyes thin but carefully arranged gray hair and a pointed gray beard he wore a frilled shirt and an eyeglass suspended by a broad black ribbon hung down upon his chest his face as a rule was imperturbable enough but he had the air just now of a man greatly disturbed  we cannot be overheard here de grost remarked it must be an affair of a few words only though  monsieur de lamborne wasted no time in preliminaries this afternoon he said i received from my government papers of immense importance which i am to hand over to your foreign minister at eleven oclock tomorrow morning  the baron nodded  well  de lambornes thin fingers trembled as they played nervously with the ribbon of his eyeglass  listen he continued dropping his voice a little bernadine has undertaken to send a copy of their contents to berlin by tomorrow nights mail  how do you know that  the ambassador hesitated  we too have spies at work he remarked grimly bernadine wrote and sent a messenger with the letter to berlin the mans body is drifting down the channel but the letter is in my pocket  the letter from bernadine  yes  what does he say  simply that a verbatim copy of the document in question will be despatched to berlin tomorrow evening without fail  there are no secrets between us de grost declared smoothly what is the special importance of this document  de lamborne shrugged his shoulders  since you ask he said i will tell you you know of the slight coolness which there has been between our respective governments our people have felt that the policy of your ministers in expending all their energies and resources in the building of a great fleet to the utter neglect of your army is a wholly onesided arrangement so far as we are concerned in the event of a simultaneous attack by germany upon france and england you would be utterly powerless to render us any measure of assistance if germany should attack england alone it is the wish of your government that we should be pledged to occupy alsacelorraine you on the other hand could do nothing for us if germanys first move were made against france  the baron was deeply interested although the matter was no new one to him  go on he directed i am waiting for you to tell me the specific contents of this document  the english government has asked us two questions first how many complete army corps we consider she ought to place at our disposal in this eventuality and secondly at what point should we expect them to be concentrated the despatch which i received tonight contains the reply to these questions  which bernadine has promised to forward to berlin tomorrow night the baron remarked softly  de lamborne nodded  you perceive he said the immense importance of the affair the very existence of that document is almost a casus belli  at what time did the despatch arrive the baron asked and what has been its history since  it arrived at six oclock and went straight into the inner pocket of my coat it has not been out of my possession for a single second even while i talk to you i can feel it  and your plans how are you intending to dispose of it tonight  on my return to the embassy i shall place it in the safe lock it up and remain watching it until morning  there doesnt seem to be much chance for bernadine the baron remarked thoughtfully  but there must be no chanceno chance at all monsieur de lamborne asserted with a note of passion in his thin voice it is incredible preposterous that he should even make the attempt i want you to come home with me and share my vigil you shall be my witness in case anything happens we will watch together  de grost reflected for a moment  bernadine makes few mistakes he said thoughtfully monsieur de lamborne passed his hand across his forehead  do i not know it he muttered in this instance though it seems impossible for him to succeed the time is so short and the conditions so difficult i may count upon your assistance baron  the baron drew from his pocket a crumpled piece of paper  i received a telegram from headquarters this after noon he said with instructions to place myself entirely at your disposal  you will return with me then to the embassy monsieur de lamborne asked eagerly  the baron de grost did not at once reply he was standing in one of his characteristic attitudes his hands clasped behind him his head a little thrust forward watching with every appearance of courteous interest the roomful of guests stationary just now listening to the performance of a famous violinist it was perhaps by accident that his eyes met those of madame de lamborne but she smiled at him subtly more perhaps with her wonderful eyes than her lips themselves she was the centre of a very brilliant group a most beautiful woman holding court as was only right and proper among her admirers the baron sighed  no he said i shall not return with you de lamborne i want you to follow my suggestions if you will  but assuredly  leave here early and go to your club remain there until one then come to the embassy i shall be there awaiting your arrival  you mean that you will go there alone i do not understand the ambassador protested why should i go to my club i do not at all understand  nevertheless do as i say de grost insisted for the present excuse me i must look after my guests  the music had ceased there was a movement toward the supperroom the baron offered his arm to madame de lamborne who welcomed him with a brilliant smile her husband although for a frenchman he was by no means of a jealous disposition was conscious of a vague feeling of uneasiness as he watched them pass out of the room together a few minutes later he made his excuses to his wife and with a reluctance for which he could scarcely account left the house there was something in the air he felt which he did not understand he would not have admitted it to himself but he more than half divined the truth the vacant seat in his wifes carriage was filled that night by the baron de grost  at one oclock precisely monsieur de lamborne returned to his house and heard with wellsimulated interest that monsieur le baron de grost awaited his arrival in the library he found de grost gazing with obvious respect at the ponderous safe let into the wall  a very fine affairthis he remarked motioning with his head toward it  the best of its kind monsieur de lamborne admitted no burglar yet has ever succeeded in opening one of its type here is the packet he added drawing the document from his pocket you shall see me place it in safety myself  the baron stretched out his hand and examined the sealed envelope for a moment closely then he moved to the writingtable and placing it upon the letter scales made a note of its exact weight finally he watched it deposited in the ponderous safe suggested the word to which the lock was set and closed the door monsieur de lamborne heaved a sigh of relief  i fancy this time he said that our friends at berlin will be disappointed couch or easychair baron  the couch if you please de grost replied a strong cigar and a long whiskey and soda so now for our vigil  the hours crawled away once de grost sat up and listened  any rats about he inquired  the ambassador was indignant  i have never heard one in my life he answered this is quite a modern house  de grost dropped his matchbox and stooped to pick it up  any lights on anywhere except in this room he asked  certainly not monsieur de lamborne answered it is past three oclock and every one has gone to bed  the baron rose and softly unbolted the door the passage outside was in darkness he listened intently for a moment and returned yawning  one fancies things he murmured apologetically  for example de lamborne demanded  the baron shook his head  one mistakes he declared the nerves become over sensitive  the dawn broke and the awakening hum of the city grew louder and louder de grost rose and stretched himself  your servants are moving about in the house he remarked i think that we might consider our vigil at an end  monsieur de lamborne rose with alacrity  my friend he said i feel that i have made false pretenses to you with the day i have no fear a thousand pardons for your sleepless night  my sleepless night counts for nothing the baron assured him but before i go would it not be as well that we glance together inside the safe  de lamborne shook out his keys  i was about to suggest it he replied  the ambassador arranged the combination and pressed the lever slowly the great door swung back the two men peered in  untouched de lamborne exclaimed a little note of triumph in his tone  de grost said nothing but held out his hand  permit me he interposed  de lamborne was conscious of a faint sense of uneasiness his companion walked across the room and carefully weighed the packet  well de lamborne cried why do you do that what is wrong  the baron turned and faced him  my friend he said this is not the same packet the ambassador stared at him incredulously  you are jesting he exclaimed miracles do not happen the thing is impossible  it is the impossible then which has happened de grost replied swiftly this packet can scarcely have gained two ounces in the night besides the seal is fuller i have an eye for these details  de lamborne leaned against the back of the table his eyes were a little wild but he laughed hoarsely  we fight then against the creatures of another world he declared no human being could have opened that safe last night  the baron hesitated  monsieur de lamborne he said the room adjoining is your wifes  it is the salon of madame the ambassador admitted  what are the electrical appliances doing there the baron demanded dont look at me like that de lamborne remember that i was here before you arrived  my wife takes an electric massage every day monsieur de lamborne answered in a hard unnatural voice in what way is monsieur le baron concerned in my wifes doings  i think that there need be no answer to that question de grost said quietly it is a greater tragedy which we have to face  quick as lightning the frenchmans hand shot out de grost barely avoided the blow  you shall answer to me for this sir de lamborne cried it is the honor of my wife which you assail  i maintain only the baron answered that your safe was entered from that room a search will prove it  there will be no search there de lamborne declared fiercely i am the ambassador of france and my power under this roof is absolute i say that you shall not cross that threshold  de grosts expression did not change only his hands were suddenly outstretched with a curious gesturethe four fingers were raised the thumbs depressed monsieur de lamborne collapsed  i submit he muttered it is you who are the master search where you will   monsieur has arrived the woman demanded breathlessly  the proprietor of the restaurant himself bowed a reply his client was evidently wellknown to him he answered her in frenchfrench with a very guttural accent  monsieur has ascended some few minutes ago myself i have not had the pleasure of wishing him bon aperitif but fritz announced his coming  the woman drew a little sigh of relief a vague misgiving had troubled her during the last few hours she raised her veil as she mounted the narrow staircase which led to the one private room at the hotel de lorraine she entered without tapping the room at the head of the stairs pushing open the illvarnished door with its whitecurtained top at first she thought that the little apartment was empty  are you there she exclaimed advancing a few steps  the figure of a man glided from behind the worn screen close by her side and stood between her and the door  madame de grost said bowing low  even then she scarcely realized that she was trapped you she cried you baron but i do not understand you have followed me here  on the contrary madame he answered i have preceded you  her colossal vanity triumphed over her natural astuteness the man had employed spies to watch her he had lost his head it was an awkward matter this but it was to be arranged she held out her hands  monsieur she said let me beg you now to go away if you care to come and see me this evening i will explain everything it is a little family affair which brings me here  a family affair madame with bernadine the enemy of france de grost declared gravely  she collapsed miserably her fingers grasping at the air the cry which broke from her lips harsh and unnatural before he could tell what was happening she was on her knees before him  spare me she begged trying to seize his hands  madame de grost answered i am not your judge you will kindly hand over to me the document which you are carrying  she took it from the bosom of her dress de grost glanced at it and placed it in his breastpocket  and now she faltered  de grost sighedshe was a very beautiful woman  madame he said the career of a spy is as you have doubtless sometimes realized a dangerous one  it is finished she assured him breathlessly monsieur le baron you will keep my secret never again i swear it will i sin like this you yourself shall be the trustee of my honor  her eyes and arms besought him but it was surely a changed manthis there was none of the suaveness the delicate responsiveness of her late host at porchester house the man who faced her now possessed the features of a sphinx there was not even pity in his face  you will not tell my husband she gasped  your husband already knows madame was the quiet reply only a few hours ago i proved to him whence had come the leakage of so many of our secrets lately  she swayed upon her feet  he will never forgive me she cried  there are others de grost declared who forgive more rarely even than husbands  a sudden illuminating flash of horror told her the truth she closed her eyes and tried to run from the room  i will not be told she screamed i will not hear i do not know who you are i will live a little longer  madame de grost said the doublefour wages no war with women save with spies only the spy has no sex for the sake of your family permit me to send you back to your husbands house  that night two receptions and a dinner party were postponed all london was sympathizing with monsieur de lamborne and a great many women swore never again to take a sleeping draught madame de lamborne lay dead behind the shelter of those drawn blinds and by her side an empty phial    chapter iv the man prom the old testament   bernadine sometimes called the count von hern was lunching at the savoy with the pretty wife of a cabinet minister who was just sufficiently conscious of the impropriety of her action to render the situation interesting  i wish you would tell me count von hern she said soon after they had settled down in their places why my husband seems to object to you so much i simply dared not tell him that we were going to lunch together and as a rule he doesnt mind what i do in that way  bernadine smiled slowly  ah well he remarked your husband is a politician and a very cautious man i dare say he is like some of those others who believe that because i am a foreigner and live in london therefore i am a spy  you a spy she laughed what nonsense  why nonsense  she shrugged her shoulders she was certainly a very pretty woman and her black gown set off to fullest advantage her deep red hair and fair complexion  i suppose because i cant imagine you anything of the sort she declared you see you hunt and play polo and do everything which the ordinary englishmen do then one meets you everywhere i think count von hern that you are much too spoilt for one thing to take life seriously  you do me an injustice he murmured  of course she chattered on i dont really know what spies do one reads about them in these silly stories but i have never felt sure that as live people they exist at all tell me count what could a foreign spy do in england  bernadine twirled his fair moustache and shrugged his shoulders  indeed my dear lady he admitted i scarcely know what a spy could do nowadays a few years ago you english people were all so trusting your fortifications your battleships not to speak of your country itself were wholly at the disposal of the enterprising foreigner who desired to acquire information the party who governed great britain then seemed to have some strange idea that these things made for peace today however all that is changed  you seem to know something about it she remarked  i am afraid that mine is really only the superficial point of view he answered but i do know that there is a good deal of information which seems absolutely insignificant in itself for which some foreign countries are willing to pay for instance there was a cabinet council yesterday i believe and some one was going to suggest that a secret but official visit be paid to your new harbor works up at rosyth an announcement will probably be made in the papers during the next few days as to whether the visit is to be undertaken or not yet there are countries who are willing to pay for knowing even such an insignificant item of news as that a few hours before the rest of the world  lady maxwell laughed  well i could earn that little sum of money she declared gayly for my husband has just made me cancel a dinnerparty for next thursday because he has to go up to the stupid place  bernadine smiled it was really a very unimportant matter but he loved to feel even in his idle moments that he was not altogether wasting his time  i am sorry he said that i am not myself acquainted with one of these mythical personages that i might return you the value of your marvelous information if i dared think however that it would be in any way acceptable i could offer you the diversion of a restaurant dinnerparty for that night the duchess of castleford has kindly offered to act as hostess for me and we are all going on to the gaiety afterwards  delightful lady maxwell exclaimed i should love to come  bernadine bowed  you have then dear lady fulfilled your destiny he said you have given secret information to a foreign person of mysterious identity and accepted payment  now bernadine was a man of easy manners and unruffled composure to the natural insouciance of his aristocratic bringing up he had added the steely reserve of a man moving in the large world engaged more often than not in some hazardous enterprise yet for once in his life and in the midst of the idlest of conversations he gave himself away so utterly that even this woman with whom he was lunchinga very butterfly lady indeed could not fail to perceive it she looked at him in something like astonishment without the slightest warning his face had become set in a rigid stare his eyes were filled with the expression of a man who sees into another world the healthy color faded from his cheeks he was white even to the parted lips the wine dripped from his raised glass onto the tablecloth  why whatever is the matter with you she demanded is it a ghost that you see  bernadines effort was superb but he was too clever to deny the shock  a ghost indeed he answered the ghost of a man whom every newspaper in europe has declared to be dead  her eyes followed his the two people who were being ushered to a seat in their immediate vicinity were certainly of somewhat unusual appearance the man was tall and thin as a lath and he wore the clothes of the fashionable world without awkwardness yet with the air of one who was wholly unaccustomed to them his cheekbones were remarkably high and receded so quickly towards his pointed chin that his cheeks were little more than hollows his eyes were dry and burning flashing here and there as though the man himself were continually oppressed by some furtive fear his thick black hair was short cropped his forehead high and intellectual he was a strange figure indeed in such a gathering and his companion only served to accentuate the anachronisms of his appearance she was above all things a woman of the momentfair almost florid a little thickset with tightlylaced yet passable figure her eyes were blue her hair lightcolored she wore magnificent furs and as she threw aside her boa she disclosed a mass of jewelry around her neck and upon her bosom almost barbaric in its profusion and setting  what an extraordinary couple lady maxwell whispered  bernadine smiled  the man looks as though he had stepped out of the old testament he murmured  lady maxwells interest was purely feminine and was riveted now upon the jewelry worn by the woman bernadine under the mask of his habitual indifference which had easily reassumed seemed to be looking away out of the restaurant into the great square of a halfsavage city looking at that marvelous crowd numbered by their thousands even by their hundreds of thousands of men and women whose arms flashed out toward the snowhung heavens whose lips were parted in one chorus of rapturous acclamation looking beyond them to the tall emaciated form of the bareheaded priest in his long robes his windtossed hair and wild eyes standing alone before that multitude in danger of death or worse at any momenttheir idol their hero and again as the memories came flooding into his brain the scene passed away and he saw the bare room with its whitewashed walls and blockedup windows he felt the darkness lit only by those flickering candles he saw the white passionwrung faces of the men who clustered together around the rude table waiting he heard their murmurs he saw the fear born in their eyes it was the night when their leader did not come  bernadine poured himself out a glass of wine and drank it slowly the mists were clearing away now he was in london at the savoy restaurant and within a few yards of him sat the man with whose name all europe once had rungthe man hailed by some as martyr and loathed by others as the most fiendish judas who ever drew breath bernadine was not concerned with the moral side of this strange encounter how best to use his knowledge of this mans identity was the question which beat upon his brain what use could be made of him what profit for his country and himself and then a feara sudden startling fear little profit perhaps to be made but the dangerthe danger of this man alive with such secrets locked in his bosom the thought itself was terrifying and even as he realized it a significant thing happenedhe caught the eye of the baron de grost lunching alone at a small table just inside the restaurant  you are not at all amusing his guest declared it is nearly five minutes since you have spoken  you too have been absorbed he reminded her  it is that womans jewels she admitted i never saw anything more wonderful the people are not english of course i wonder where they come from  one of the eastern countries without a doubt he replied carelessly  lady maxwell sighed  he is a peculiarlooking man she said but one could put up with a good deal for jewels like that what are you doing this afternoonpicturegalleries or your club  neither unfortunately bernadine answered i have promised to go with a friend to look at some polo ponies  do you know she remarked that we have never been to see those japanese prints yet  the gallery is closed until monday he assured her falsely if you will honor me then i shall be delighted  she shrugged her shoulders but said nothing she had an idea that she was being dismissed but bernadine without the least appearance of hurry gave her no opportunity for any further suggestions he handed her into the automobile and returned at once into the restaurant he touched baron de grost upon the shoulder  my friend the enemy he exclaimed smiling  at your service in either capacity the baron replied bernadine made a grimace and accepted the chair which de grost had indicated  if i may i will take my coffee with you he said i am growing old it does not amuse me so much to lunch with a pretty woman one has to entertain and one forgets the serious business of lunching i will take my coffee and cigarettes in peace  de grost gave an order to the waiter and leaned back in his chair  now he suggested tell me exactly what it is that has brought you back into the restaurant  bernadine shrugged his shoulders  why not the pleasure of this few minutes conversation with you he asked  the baron carefully selected a cigar and lit it  that he said goes well but there are other things  as for instance  de grost leaned back in his chair and watched the smoke of his cigar curl upwards  one talks too much he remarked before the cards are upon the table it is not wise  they chatted upon various matters de grost himself seemed in no hurry to depart nor did his companion show any signs of impatience it was not until the two people whose entrance had had such a remarkable effect upon bernadine rose to leave that the mask was for a moment lifted de grost had called for his bill and paid it the two men strolled out together  baron bernadine said suavely linking his arm through the other mans as they passed into the foyer there are times when candor even among enemies becomes an admirable quality  those times i imagine de grost answered grimly are rare besides who is to tell the real thing from the false  you do less than justice to your perceptions my friend bernadine declared smiling  de grost merely shrugged his shoulders bernadine persisted  come he continued since you doubt me let me be the first to give you a proof that on this occasion at any rate i am candor itself you had a purpose in lunching at the savoy today that purpose i have discovered by accident we are both interested in those people the baron de grost shook his head slowly  really he began  let me finish bernadine insisted perhaps when you have heard all that i have to say you may change your attitude we are interested in the same people but in different ways if we both move from opposite directions our friend will vanishhe is clever enough at disappearing as he has proved before we do not want the same thing from him i am convinced of that let us move together and made sure that he does not evade us  is it an alliance which you are proposing de grost asked with a quiet smile  why not enemies have united before today against a common foe  de grost looked across the palm court to where the two people who formed the subject of their discussion were sitting in a corner both smoking both sipping some redcolored liqueur  my dear bernadine he said i am much too afraid of you to listen any more you fancy because this mans presence here was an entire surprise to you and because you find me already on his track that i know more than you do and that an alliance with me would be to your advantage you would try to persuade me that your object with him would not be my object listen i am afraid of youyou are too clever for me i am going to leave you in sole possession  de grosts tone was final and his bow valedictory bernadine watched him stroll in a leisurely way through the foyer exchanging greetings here and there with friends watched him enter the cloakroom from which he emerged with his hat and overcoat watched him step into his automobile and leave the restaurant he turned back with a clouded face and threw himself into an easy chair  ten minutes passed uneventfully people were passing backwards and forwards all the time but bernadine through his halfclosed eyes did little save watch the couple in whom he was so deeply interested at last the man rose and with a word of farewell to his companion came out from the lounge and made his way up the foyer turning toward the hotel he walked with quick nervous strides glancing now and then restlessly about him in his eyes to those who understood there was the furtive gleam of the hunted man it was the passing of one who was afraid  the woman left to herself began to look around her with some curiosity bernadine to whom a new idea had occurred moved his chair nearer to hers and was rewarded by a glance which certainly betrayed some interest a swift and unerring judge in such matters he came to the instant conclusion that she was not unapproachable he acted immediately and upon impulse rising to his feet he approached her and bowed easily but respectfully  madame he said it is impossible that i am mistaken i have had the pleasure have i not of meeting you in st petersburg  her first reception of his coming was reassuring enough at his mention of st petersburg however she frowned  i do not think so she answered in french you are mistaken i do not know st petersburg  then it was in paris bernadine continued with conviction madame is parisian without a doubt  she shook her head smiling  i do not think that i remember meeting you monsieur she replied doubtfully but perhaps  she looked up and her eyes dropped before his he was certainly a very personable looking man and she had spoken to no one for so many months  believe me madame i could not possibly be mistaken bernadine assured her smoothly you are staying here for long  she shrugged her shoulders  heaven knows she declared my husband he has i think what you call the wander fever for myself i am tired of it in rome we settle down we stay five days all seems pleasant and suddenly my husbands whim carries us away without an hours notice the same thing at monte carlo the same in paris who can tell what will happen here to tell you the truth monsieur she added a little archly i think that if he were to come back at this moment we should probably leave england tonight  your husband is very jealous bernadine whispered softly  she shrugged her shoulders  partly jealous and partly he has the most terrible distaste for acquaintances he will not speak to strangers himself or suffer me to do so it is sometimesoh it is sometimes very triste  madame has my sympathy bernadine assured her it is an impossible lifethis no husband should be so exacting  she looked at him with her round blue eyes a touch of added color in her cheeks  if one could but cure him she murmured  i would ask your permission to sit down bernadine remarked but i fear to intrude you are afraid perhaps that your husband may return  she shook her head  it will be better that you do not stay she declared for a moment or two he is engaged he has an appointment in his room with a gentleman but one never knows how long he may be  you have friends in london then bernadine remarked thoughtfully  of my husbands affairs the woman said there is no one so ignorant as i yet since we left our own country this is the first time i have known him willingly speak to a soul  your own country bernadine repeated softly that was russia of course your husbands nationality is very apparent  the woman looked a little annoyed with herself she remained silent  may i not hope bernadine begged that you will give me the pleasure of meeting you again  she hesitated for a moment  he does not leave me she replied i am not alone for five minutes during the day  bernadine scribbled the name by which he was known in that locality on a card and passed it to her  i have rooms in st jamess street quite close to here he said if you could come and have tea with me today or tomorrow it would give me the utmost pleasure  she took the card and crumpled it in her hand all the time though she shook her head  monsieur is very kind she answered i am afraidi do not think that it would be possible and now if you please you must go away i am terrified lest my husband should return  bernadine bent low in a parting salute  madame he pleaded you will come  bernadine was a handsome man and he knew well enough how to use his soft and extraordinarily musical voice he knew very well as he retired that somehow or other she would accept his invitation even then he felt dissatisfied and ill at ease as he left the place he had made a little progress but after all was it worth while supposing that the man with whom her husband was even at this moment closeted was the baron de grost he called a taxicab and drove at once to the embassy of his country  even at that moment de grost and the russianpaul hagon he called himselfwere standing face to face in the latters sittingroom no conventional greetings of any sort had been exchanged de grost had scarcely closed the door behind him before hagon addressed him breathlessly almost fiercely  who are you sir he demanded and what do you want with me  you had my letter de grost inquired  i had your letter the other admitted it told me nothing you speak of business what business have i with any here  my business is soon told de grost replied but in the first place i beg that you will not unnecessarily alarm yourself there is believe me no need for it no need whatever although to prevent misunderstandings i may as well tell you at once that i am perfectly well aware who it is that i am addressing  hagon collapsed into a chair he buried his face in his hands and groaned  i am not here necessarily as an enemy de grost continued you have very excellent reasons i make no doubt for remaining unknown in this city or wherever you may be as yet let me assure you that your identity is not even suspected except by myself and one other those few who believe you alive believe that you are in america there is no need for any one to know that father  stop the man begged piteously stop  de grost bowed  i beg your pardon he said  now tell me the man demanded what is your price i have had money there is not much left sophia is extravagant and traveling costs a great deal but why do i weary you with these things he added let me know what i have to pay for your silence  i am not a blackmailer de grost answered sternly i am myself a wealthy man i ask from you nothing in moneyi ask you nothing in that way at all a few words of information and a certain paper which i believe you have in your possession is all that i require  information hagon repeated shivering  what i ask de grost declared is really a matter of justice at the time when you were the idol of all russia and the leader of the great revolutionary party you received funds from abroad  i accounted for them hagon muttered up to a certain point i accounted for everything  you received funds from the government of a european power de grost continued funds to be applied towards developing the revolution i want the name of that power and proof of what i say  hagon remained motionless for a moment he had seated himself at the table his head resting upon his hand and his face turned away from de grost  you are a politician then he asked slowly  i am a politician de grost admitted i represent a great secret power which has sprung into existence during the last few years our aim at present is to bring closer together your country and great britain russia hesitates because an actual rapprochement with us is equivalent to a permanent estrangement with germany  hagon nodded  i understand he said in a low tone i have finished with politics i have nothing to say to you  i trust de grost persisted suavely that you will be better advised  hagon turned round and faced him  sir he demanded do you believe that i am afraid of death  de grost looked at him steadfastly  no he answered you have proved the contrary  if my identity is discovered hagon continued i have the means of instant death at hand i do not use it because of my love for the one person who links me to this world for her sake i live and for her sake i bear always the memory of the shameful past publish my name and whereabouts if you will i promise you that i will make the tragedy complete but for the rest i refuse to pay your price a great power trusted me and whatever its motives may have been its money came very near indeed to freeing my people i have nothing more to say to you sir  the baron de grost was taken aback he had scarcely contemplated refusal  you must understand he explained that this is not a personal matter even if i myself would spare you those who are more powerful than i will strike the society to which i belong does not tolerate failure i am empowered even to offer you its protection if you will give me the information for which i ask  hagon rose to his feet and before de grost could foresee his purpose had rung the bell  my decision is unchanging he said you can pull down the roof upon my head but i carry next my heart an instant and unfailing means of escape  a waiter stood in the doorway  you will take this gentleman to the lift hagon directed  there was once more a touch in his manner of that half divine authority which had thrilled the great multitude of his believers de grost was forced to admit defeat  not defeat he said to himself as he followed the man to the lift only a check  nevertheless it was a serious check he could not for the moment see his way further arrived at his house he followed his usual custom and made his way at once to his wifes rooms violet was resting upon a sofa but laid down her book at his entrance  violet he declared i have come for your advice  he refuses then she asked eagerly  absolutely what am i to do bernadine is already upon the scent he saw him at the savoy today and recognized him  has bernadine approached him yet violet inquired  not yet he is half afraid to move i think he realizes or will very soon how serious this mans existence may be for germany  violet was thoughtful for several moments then she looked up quickly  bernadine will try the woman she asserted you say that hagon is infatuated  blindly de grost replied he scarcely lets her out of his sight  your people watch bernadine  always  very well then violet went on you will find that he will attempt an intrigue with the woman the rest should be easy for you  de grost sighed as he bent over his wife  my dear he said there is no subtlety like the subtlety of a woman  bernadines instinct had not deceived him and the following afternoon his servant who had already received orders silently ushered madame hagon into his apartments she was wrapped in magnificent sables and heavily veiled bernadine saw at once that she was very nervous and wholly terrified he welcomed her in as matteroffact a manner as possible  madame he declared this is quite charming of you you must sit in my easychair here and my man shall bring us some tea i drink mine always after the fashion of your country with lemon but i doubt whether we make it so well wont you unfasten your jacket i am afraid that my rooms are rather warm  madame had collected herself but it was quite obvious that she was unused to adventures of this sort her hand when he took it trembled and more than once she glanced furtively toward the door  yes i have come she murmured i do not know why it is not right for me to come yet there are times when i am weary times when paul seems fierce and when i am terrified sometimes i even wish that i were back  your husband seems very highly strung bernadine remarked he has doubtless led an exciting life  as to that she replied gazing around her now and gradually becoming more at her ease i know but little he was a student professor at moschaume when i met him i think that he was at one of the universities in st petersburg  bernadine glanced at her covertly it came to him as an inspiration that the woman did not know the truth  you are from russia then after all he said smiling i felt sure of it  yes reluctantly paul is so queer in these things he will not let me talk of it he prefers that we are taken for french people indeed it is not i who desire to think too much of russia it is not a year since my father was killed in the riots and two of my brothers were sent to siberia  bernadine was deeply interested  they were among the revolutionaries he asked  she nodded  yes she answered  and your husband  he too was with them in sympathy secretly too i believe that he worked among them only he had to be careful you see his position at the college made it difficult  bernadine looked into the womans eyes and he knew then that she was speaking the truth this man was indeed a great master he had kept her in ignorance  always bernadine said a few minutes later as he passed her tea i read with the deepest interest of the peoples movement in russia tell me what became eventually of their great leaderthe wonderful father paul  she set down her cup untasted and her blue eyes flashed with a fire which turned them almost to the color of steel  wonderful indeed she exclaimed wonderful judas it was he who wrecked the cause it was he who sold the lives and liberty of all of us for gold  i heard a rumor of that bernadine remarked but i never believed it  it was true she declared passionately  and where is he now bernadine asked  dead she answered fiercely torn to pieces we believe one night in a house near moscow may it be so  she was silent for a moment as though engaged in prayer bernadine spoke no more of these things he talked to her kindly keeping up always his role of respectful but hopeful admirer  you will come again soon he begged when at last she insisted upon going  she hesitated  it is so difficult she murmured if my husband knew  bernadine laughed and touched her fingers caressingly  need one tell him he whispered you see i trust you i pray that you will come  bernadine was a man rarely moved towards emotion of any sort yet even he was conscious of a certain sense of excitement as he stood looking out upon the embankment from the windows of paul hagons sittingroom a few days later madame was sitting on the sofa close at hand it was for her answer to a certain question that he waited  monsieur she said at last turning slowly towards him it must be no indeed i am sorry for you have been very charming to me and without you i should have been dull but to come to your rooms and dine alone tonight it is impossible  your husband cannot return before the morning bernadine reminded her  it makes no difference she answered paul is sometimes fierce and rough but he is generous and all his life he has worshiped me he behaves strangely at times but i know that he caresall the time more perhaps than i deserve  and there is no one else bernadine asked softly who can claim even the smallest place in your heart  monsieur the woman begged you must not ask me that i think that you had better go away  bernadine stood quite still for several moments it was the climax towards which he had steadfastly guided the course of this mild intrigue  madame he declared you must not send me away you shall not  she held out her hand  then you must not ask impossible things she answered  then bernadine took the plunge he became suddenly very grave  sophia he said i am keeping a great secret from you and i can do it no longer when you speak to me of your husband you drive me mad if i believed that you really loved him i would go away and leave it to chance whether or not you ever discovered the truth as it is  well she interposed breathlessly  as it is he continued i am going to tell you now your husband has deceived youhe is deceiving you every moment  she looked at him incredulously  you mean that there is another woman  bernadine shook his head  worse than that he answered your husband stole even your love under false pretenses you think that his life is a strange one that his nerves have broken down that he flies from place to place for distraction for change of scene it is not so he left rome he left nice he left paris for one and the same reason he left because he was in peril of his life i know little of your history but i know as much as this if ever a man deserved the fate from which he flees your husband deserves it  you are mad she faltered  no i am sane he went on it is you who are mad not to have understood your husband goes ever in fear of his life his real name is one branded with ignominy throughout the world the man whom you have married to whom you are so scrupulously faithful is the man who sent your father to death and your brothers to siberia  father paul she screamed  you have lived with him you are his wife bernadine declared  the color had left her cheeks her eyes with their penciled brows were fixed in an almost ghastly stare her breath was coming in uneven gasps she looked at him in silent terror  it is not true she cried at last it cannot be true  sophia he said you can prove it for yourself i know a little of your husband and his doings does he not carry always with him a black box which he will not allow out of his sight  always she assented how did you know by night his hand rests upon it by day if he goes out it is in my charge  fetch it now bernadine directed and i will prove my words  she did not hesitate for a moment she disappeared into the inner room and came back only a few moments absent carrying in her hand a black leather despatchbox  you have the key he asked  yes she answered looking at him and trembling but i dare notoh i dare not open it  sophia he said if my words are not true i will pass out of your life for always i challenge you if you open that box you will know that your husband is indeed the greatest scoundrel in europe  she drew a key from a gold chain around her neck  there are two locks she told him the other is a combination but i know the word whos that  she started suddenly there was a loud tapping at the door bernadine threw an antimacassar half over the box but he was too late de grost and hagon had crossed the threshold the woman stood like some dumb creature hagon transfixed stood with his eyes riveted upon bernadine his face was distorted with passion he seemed like a man beside himself with fury de grost came slowly forward into the middle of the room  count von hern he said i think that you had better leave  the woman found words  not yet she cried not yet paul listen to me this man has told me a terrible thing  the breath seemed to come through hagons teeth like a hiss  he has told you  listen to me she continued it is the truth which you must tell now he says that youyou are father paul  hagon did not hesitate for a second  it is true he admitted  then there was a silenceshort but tragical hagon seemed suddenly to have collapsed he was like a man who has just had a stroke he stood muttering to himself  it is the endthisthe end he said in a low tone sophia  she shrank away from him he drew himself up once more the great light flashed in his face  it was for your sake he said simply for your sake sophia i came to you poor and you would have nothing to say to me my love for you burned in my veins like fever it was for you i did itfor your sake i sold my honor the love of my country the freedom of my brothers for your sake i risked an awful death for your sake i have lived like a hunted man with the cry of the wolves always in my ears and the fear of death and of eternal torture with me day by day no other man since the world was made has done more have pity on me  she was unmoved her face had lost all expression no one noticed in that rapt moment that bernadine had crept from the room  it was you she cried who killed my father and sent my brothers into exile  god help me he moaned  she turned to de grost  take him away with you please she said i have finished with him  sophia he pleaded  she leaned across the table and struck him heavily upon the cheek  if you stay here she muttered i shall kill you myself  that night the body of an unknown foreigner was found in the attic of a cheap lodginghouse in soho the discovery itself and the verdict at the inquest occupied only a few lines in the morning newspapers those few lines were the epitaph of one who was very nearly a rienzi the greater part of his papers de grost mercifully destroyed but one in particular he preserved within a week the much delayed treaty was signed at paris london and st petersburg    chapter v the first shot   de grost and his wife were dining together at the corner table in a fashionable but somewhat bohemian restaurant both had been in the humor for reminiscences and they had outstayed most of their neighbors  i wonder what people really think of us violet remarked pensively i told lady amershal when she asked us to go there this evening that we always dined together alone somewhere once a week and she absolutely refused to believe me with your own husband my dear she kept on repeating  her ladyships tastes are more catholic the baron declared dryly yet after all violet the real philosophy of married life demands something of this sort  violet smiled and fingered her pearls for a minute  what the real philosophy of married life may be i do not know she said but i am perfectly content with our rendering of it what a fortunate thing peter with your intensely practical turn of mind that nature endowed you with so much sentiment  de grost gazed reflectively at the cigarette which he had just selected from his case  well he remarked there have been times when i have cursed myself for a fool but on the whole sentiment keeps many fires burning  she leaned towards him and dropped her voice a little tell me she begged do you ever think of the years we spent together in the country do you ever regret  he smiled thoughtfully  it is a hard question that he admitted there were days there which i loved but there were days too when the restlessness came days when i longed to hear the hum of the city and to hear men speak whose words were of life and death and the great passions i am not sure violet whether after all it is well for one who has lived to withdraw absolutely from the thrill of life  she laughed softly but gayly  i am with you she declared absolutely i think that the fairies must have poured into my blood the joy of living for its own sake i should be an ungrateful woman indeed if i found anything to complain of nowadays yet there is one thing that troubles me she went on after a moments pause  and that he asked  the danger she said slowly i do not want to lose you peter there are times when i am afraid  de grost flicked the ash from his cigarette  the days are passing he remarked when men point revolvers at one another and hire assassins to gain their ends now it is more a battle of wits we play chess on the board of life still but we play with ivory pieces instead of steel and poison our brains direct and not our muscles  she sighed  it is only the one man of whom i am afraid you have outwitted him so often and he does not forgive  de grost smiled it was an immense complimentthis  bernadine he murmured softly otherwise our friend the count von hern  bernadine she repeated all that you say is true but when one fails with modern weapons one changes the form of attack bernadine at heart is a savage  the hate of such a man de grost remarked complacently is worth having he has had his own way over here for years he seems to have found the knack of living in a maze of intrigue and remaining untouchable there were a dozen things before i came upon the scene which ought to have ruined him yet there never appeared to be anything to take hold of even the criminal department once thought they had a chance i remember john dory telling me in disgust that bernadine was like one of those marvelous criminals one only reads about in fiction who seem when they pass along the dangerous places to walk upon the air and leave no trace behind  before you came she said he had never known a failure do you think that he is a man likely to forgive  i do not de grost answered grimly it is a battle of course a battle all the time yet violet between you and me if bernadine were to go half the savor of life for me would depart with him  then there came a curious and wholly unexpected interruption a man in dark plain clothes still wearing his overcoat and carrying a bowler hat had been standing in the entrance of the restaurant for a moment or two looking around the room as though in search of some one at last he caught the eye of the baron de grost and came quickly toward him  charles the baron remarked raising his eyebrows i wonder what he wants  a sudden cloud had fallen upon their little feast violet watched the coming of her husbands servant and the reading of the note which he presented to his master with an anxiety which she could not wholly conceal the baron read the note twice scrutinizing a certain part of it closely with the aid of the monocle which he seldom used then he folded it up and placed it in the breast pocket of his coat  at what hour did you receive this charles he asked  a messenger brought it in a taxicab about ten minutes ago sir the man replied he said that it was of the utmost importance and that i had better try and find you  a district messenger  a man in ordinary clothes charles answered he looked like a porter in a warehouse or something of that sort i forgot to say that you were rung up on the telephone three times previously by mr greening  the baron nodded  you can go he said there is no reply  the man bowed and retired de grost called for his bill  is it anything serious violet inquired  no not exactly serious he answered i do not understand what has happened but they have sent for me to gowell where it was agreed that i should not go except as a matter of urgent necessity  violet knew better than to show any signs of disquietude  it is in london she asked  certainly her husband replied i shall take a taxicab from here i am sorry dear to have one of our evenings disturbed in this manner i have always done my best to avoid it but this summons is urgent  she rose and he wrapped her cloak around her  you will drive straight home wont you he begged i dare say that i may be back within an hour myself  and if not she asked in a low tone  if not there is nothing to be done  violet bit her lip but as he handed her into the small electric brougham which was waiting she smiled into his face  you will come back and soon peter she declared confidently wherever you go i am sure of that you see i have faith in my star which watches over you  he kissed her fingers and turned away the commissionaire had already called him a taxicab  to london bridge he ordered after a moments hesitation and drove off  the traffic citywards had long since finished for the day and he reached his destination within ten minutes of leaving the restaurant here he paid the man and entering the station turned to the refreshment room and ordered a liqueur brandy while he sipped it he smoked a cigarette and carefully reread in a strong light the note which he had received the signature especially he pored over for some time at last however he replaced it in his pocket paid his bill and stepping out once more on to the platform entered a telephone booth a few minutes later he left the station and turning to the right walked slowly as far as tooley street he kept on the righthand side until he arrived at the spot where the great arches with their scanty lights make a gloomy thoroughfare into bermondsey in the shadow of the first of these he paused and looked steadfastly across the street there were few people passing and practically no traffic in front of him was a row of warehouses all save one of which was wrapped in complete darkness it was the one where some lights were still burning which de grost stood and watched  the lights such as they were seemed to illuminate the ground floor only from his hidden post he could see the shoulders of a man apparently bending over a ledger diligently writing at the next window a youth seated upon a tall stool was engaged in presumably the same occupation there was nothing about the place in the least mysterious or out of the way even the blinds of the offices had been left undrawn the man and the boy who were alone visible seemed in a sense to be working under protest every now and then the former stopped to yawn and the latter performed a difficult balancing feat upon his stool de grost having satisfied his curiosity came presently from his shelter almost running into the arms of a policeman who looked at him closely the baron who had an unlighted cigarette in his mouth stopped to ask for a light and his appearance at once set at rest any suspicions the policeman might have had  i have a warehouse myself down in these parts he remarked as he struck the match but i dont allow my people to work as late as that  he pointed across the way and the policeman smiled  they are very often late there sir he said its a continental wine business and theres always one or two of them over time  its bad business all the same de grost declared pleasantly good night policeman  good night sir  de grost crossed the road diagonally as though about to take the short cut across london bridge but as soon as the policeman was out of sight he retraced his steps to the building which they had been discussing and turning the battered brass handle of the door walked calmly in on his right and left were counting houses framed with glass in front the cavernous and ugly depths of a gloomy warehouse he knocked upon the windowpane on the right and passed forward a step or two as though to enter the office the boy who had been engaged in the lefthand counting house came gliding from his place passed silently behind the visitor and turned the key of the outer door what followed seemed to happen as though by some mysteriously directed force the figures of men came stealing out from the hidden places the clerk who had been working so hard at his desk calmly divested himself of a false mustache and wig and assuming a more familiar appearance strolled out into the warehouse de grost looked around him with absolutely unruffled composure he was the centre of a little circle of men respectably dressed but every one of them hardfeatured with something in their faces which suggested not the ordinary toiler but the fighting animalthe man who lives by his wits and knows something of danger on the outskirts of the circle stood bernadine  really de grost declared this is most unexpected in the matter of dramatic surprises my friend bernadine you are certainly in a class by yourself  bernadine smiled  you will understand of course he said that this little entertainment is entirely for your amusementwell stagemanaged perhaps but my supers are not to be taken seriously since you are here baron might i ask you to precede me a few steps to the tasting office  by all means de grost answered cheerfully it is this way i believe  he walked with unconcerned footsteps down the warehouse on either side of which were great bins and a wilderness of racking until he came to a small glassenclosed office built out from the wall without hesitation he entered it and removing his hat selected the more comfortable of the two chairs bernadine alone of the others followed him inside closing the door behind de grost who appeared exceedingly comfortable stretched out his hand and took a small black bottle from a tiny mahogany racking fixed against the wall by his side  you will excuse me my dear bernadine he said but i see my friend greening has been tasting a few wines the xx upon the label here signifies approval with your permission  he half filled a glass and pushed the bottle toward bernadine  greenings taste is unimpeachable de grost declared setting down his glass empty no use being a director of a city business you know unless one interests oneself personally in it greenings judgment is simply marvelous i have never tasted a more beautiful wine if the boom in sherry does come he continued complacently we shall be in an excellent position to deal with it  bernadine laughed softly  oh my friendpeter ruff or baron de grost or whatever you may choose to call yourself he said i am indeed wise to have come to the conclusion that you and i are too big to occupy the same little spot on earth  de grost nodded approvingly  i was beginning to wonder he remarked whether you would not soon arrive at that decision  having arrived at it bernadine continued looking intently at his companion the logical sequence naturally occurs to you  precisely my dear bernadine de grost asserted you say to yourself no doubt one of us two must go being yourself you would naturally conclude that it must be i to tell you the truth i have been expecting some sort of enterprise of this description for a considerable time  bernadine shrugged his shoulders  your expectations he said seem scarcely to have provided you with a safe conduct  de grost gazed reflectively into his empty glass  you see he explained i am such a lucky person your arrangements tonight however are i perceive unusually complete  i am glad you appreciate them bernadine remarked dryly  i would not for a moment de grost continued ask an impertinent or an unnecessary question but i must confess that i am rather concerned to know the fate of my managerthe gentleman whom you yourself with the aid i presume of mr clarkson so ably represented  bernadine sighed  alas he said your manager was a very obstinate person  and my clerk  incorruptible absolutely incorruptible i congratulate you de grost your society is one of the most wonderful upon the face of this earth i know little about it but my admiration is very sincere their attention to details and the personnel of their staff is almost perfect i may tell you at once that no sum that could be offered tempted either of these men  i am delighted to hear it de grost replied but i must plead guilty to a little temporary anxiety as to their present whereabouts  at this moment bernadine remarked they are within a few feet of us but as you are doubtless aware access to your delightful river is obtainable from these premises to be frank with you my dear baron we are waiting for the tide to rise  so thoughtful about these trifles de grost murmured but their present position they are i trust not uncomfortable  bernadine stood up and moved to the further end of the office he beckoned his companion to his side and drawing an electric torch from his pocket flashed the light into a dark corner behind an immense bin the forms of a man and a youth bound with ropes and gagged lay stretched upon the floor de grost sighed  i am afraid he said that mr greening at any rate is most uncomfortable  bernadine turned off the light  at least baron he declared if such extreme measures should become necessary i can promise you one thingyou shall have a quicker passage into eternity than they  de grost resumed his seat  has it really come to that he asked will nothing but so crude a proceeding as my absolute removal satisfy you  nothing else is i fear practicable bernadine replied unless you decide to listen to reason believe me my dear friend i shall miss you and our small encounters exceedingly but unfortunately you stand in the way of my career you are the only man who has persistently balked me you have driven me to use against you means which i had grown to look upon as absolutely extinct in the upper circles of our profession  de grost peered through the glass walls of the office  eight men not counting yourself he remarked and my poor manager and his faithful clerk lying bound and helpless it is heavy odds bernadine  there is no question of odds i think bernadine answered smoothly you are much too clever a person to refuse to admit that you are entirely in my power  and as regards terms i really dont feel in the least anxious to make my final bow with so little notice de grost said to tell you the truth i have been finding life quite interesting lately  bernadine eyed his prisoner keenly such absolute composure was in itself disturbing he was for the moment aware of a slight sensation of uneasiness which his common sense however speedily disposed of  there are two ways he announced of dealing with an opponent there is the oldfashioned onecrude but in a sense eminently satisfactorywhich sends him finally to adorn some other sphere  i dont like that one de grost interrupted get on with the alternative  the alternative bernadine declared is when his capacity for harm can be destroyed  that needs a little explanation de grost murmured  precisely for instance if you were to become absolutely discredited i think that you would be effectually out of my way your people do not forgive  then discredit me by all means de grost begged it sounds unpleasant but i do not like your callous reference to the river  bernadine gazed at his ancient opponent for several moments after all what was this but the splendid bravado of a beaten man who is too clever not to recognize defeat  i shall require he said your code the keys of your safe which contains a great many documents of interest to me and a free entry into your house  de grost drew a bunch of keys reluctantly from his pocket and laid them upon the desk  you will find the code bound in green morocco leather he announced on the lefthand side underneath the duplicate of a proposed treaty between italy and some other power between ourselves bernadine i really expect that that is what you are after  bernadines eyes glistened  what about the safe conduct into your house he asked  de grost drew his case from his pocket and wrote few lines on the back of one of his cards  this will insure you entrance there he said and access to my study if you see my wife please reassure her as to my absence  i shall certainly do so bernadine agreed with a faint smile  if i may be pardoned for alluding to a purely personal matter de grost continued what is to become of me  you will be bound and gagged in the same manner as your manager and his clerk bernadine replied smoothly i regret the necessity but you see i can afford to run no risks at four oclock in the morning you will be released it must be part of our agreement that you allow the man who stays behind the others for the purpose of setting you free to depart unmolested i think i know you better than to imagine you would be guilty of such gaucherie as an appeal to the police  that unfortunately de grost declared with a little sigh is as you well know out of the question you are too clever for me bernadine after all i shall have to go back to my farm  bernadine opened the door and called softly to one of his men in less than five minutes de grost was bound hand and foot bernadine stepped back and eyed his adversary with an air of illdisguised triumph  i trust baron he said that you will be as comfortable as possible under the circumstances  de grost lay quite still he was powerless to move or speak  immediately bernadine continued i have presented myself at your house verified your safe conduct and helped myself to certain papers which i am exceedingly anxious to obtain he went on i shall telephone here to the man whom i leave in charge and you will be set at liberty in due course if for any reason i meet with treachery and i do not telephone you will join mr greening and his young companion in a littleshall we call it aquatic recreation i wish you a pleasant hour and success in the future baronas a farmer  bernadine withdrew and whispered his orders to his men soon the electric light was turned out and the place was in darkness the front door was opened and closed the group of confederates upon the pavement lit cigarettes and wished one another good night with the brisk air of tired employees released at last from long labors then there was silence  it was barely eleven when bernadine reached the west end of london his clothes had become a trifle disarranged and he called for a few minutes at his rooms in st jamess street afterwards he walked to porchester house and rang the bell to the servant who answered it he handed his masters card  will you show me the way to the library he asked i have some papers to collect for the baron de grost  the man hesitated even with the card in his hand it seemed a somewhat unusual proceeding  will you step inside sir he begged i should like to show this to the baroness the master is exceedingly particular about any one entering his study  do what you like so long as you do not keep me waiting bernadine replied your masters instructions are clear enough  violet came down the great staircase a few moments later still in her dinner gown her face a little pale her eyes luminous bernadine smiled as he accepted her eagerly offered hand she was evidently anxious a thrill of triumph warmed his blood once she had been less kind to him than she seemed now  my husband gave you this she exclaimed  a few minutes ago bernadine answered he tried to make his instructions as clear as possible we are jointly interested in a small matter which needs immediate action  she led the way to the study  it seems strange she remarked that you and he should be working together i always thought that you were on opposite sides  it is a matter of chance bernadine told her your husband is a wise man baroness he knows when to listen to reason  she threw open the door of the study which was in darkness  if you will wait a moment she said closing the door i will turn on the electric light  she touched the knobs in the wall and the room was suddenly flooded with illumination at the further end of the apartment was the great safe close to it in an easy chair his evening coat changed for a smoking jacket with a neatly tied black tie replacing his crumpled white cravat the baron de grost sat awaiting his guest a fierce oath broke from bernadines lips he turned toward the door only in time to hear the key turn violet tossed it lightly in the air across to her husband  my dear bernadine the latter remarked on the whole i do not think that this has been one of your successes my keys if you please  bernadine stood for a moment his face dark with passion he bit his lip till the blood came and the veins at the back of his clenched hands were swollen and thick nevertheless when he spoke he had recovered in great measure his selfcontrol  your keys are here baron de grost he said placing them upon the table if a bungling amateur may make such a request of a professor may i inquire how you escaped from your bonds passed through the door of a locked warehouse and reached here before me  the baron de grost smiled as he pushed the cigarettes across to his visitor  really he said you have only to think for yourself for a moment my dear bernadine and you will understand in the first place the letter you sent me signed greening was clearly a forgery there was no one else anxious to get me into their power hence i associated it at once with you naturally i telephoned to the chief of my staffi too am obliged to employ some of these ununiformed policemen my dear bernadine as you may be aware it may interest you to know further that there are seven entrances to the warehouse in tooley street through one of these something like twenty of my men passed and were already concealed in the place when i entered at another of the doors a motorcar waited for me if i had chosen to lift my finger at any time your men would have been overpowered and i might have had the pleasure of dictating terms to you in my own office such a course did not appeal to me you and i as you know dear count von hern conduct our peculiar business under very delicate conditions and the least thing we either of us desire is notoriety i managed things as i thought for the best the moment you left the place my men swarmed in we kindly but gently ejected your guard released greening and my clerk and i passed you myself in fleet street a little more comfortable i think in my fortyhorsepower motorcar than you in that very disreputable hansom as to my presence here i have an entrance from the street there which makes me independent of my servants the other details are too absurdly simple one need not enlarge upon them  bernadine turned slowly to violet  you knew he muttered you knew when you brought me here  naturally she answered we have telephones in every room in the house  i am at your service bernadine declared calmly  de grost laughed  my dear fellow he said need i say that you are free to come or go to take a whiskey and soda with me or to depart at once exactly as you feel inclined the door was locked only until you restored to me my keys  he crossed the room fitted the key in the lock and turned it  we do not make war as those others he remarked smiling  bernadine drew himself up  i will not drink with you he said i will not smoke with you but some day this reckoning shall come  he turned to the door de grost laid his finger upon the bell  show count von hern out he directed the astonished servant who appeared a moment or two later    chapter vi the seven suppers of andrea korust   peter baron de grost was enjoying what he had confidently looked forward to as an evenings relaxation pure and simple he sat in one of the front rows of the stalls of the alhambra his wife by his side and an excellent cigar in his mouth an hour or so ago he had been in telephonic communication with paris had spoken with sogrange himself and received his assurance of a calm in political and criminal affairs amounting almost to stagnation it was out of season and though his popularity was as great as ever neither he nor his wife had any social engagements hence this evening at a music hall which peter for his part was finding thoroughly amusing  the place was packedsome said owing to the engagement of andrea korust and his brother others to the presence of mademoiselle sophie celaire in her wonderful danse des apaches the violinist that night had a great reception three times he was called before the curtain three times he was obliged to reiterate his grateful but immutable resolve never to yield to the nightly storm which demanded more from a man who has given of his best slim with the worn face and hollow eyes of a genius he stood and bowed his thanks but when he thought the time had arrived he disappeared and though the house shook for minutes afterwards nothing could persuade him to reappear  afterwards came the turn which notwithstanding the furore caused by andrea korusts appearance was generally considered to be equally responsible for the packed housethe apache dance of mademoiselle sophie celaire peter sat slightly forward in his chair as the curtain went up for a time he seemed utterly absorbed by the performance violet glanced at him once or twice curiously it began to occur to her that it was not so much the dance as the dancer in whom her husband was interested  you have seen her beforethis mademoiselle celaire she whispered  yes said peter nodding i have seen her before  the dance proceeded it was like many others of its sort only a little more daring a little more finished mademoiselle celaire in her tightfitting shabby black frock with her wild mass of hair her flashing eyes her seductive gestures was without doubt a marvelous person peter baron de grost watched her every movement with absorbed attention when the curtain went down he forgot to clap his eyes followed her off the stage violet shrugged her shoulders she was looking very handsome herself in a black velvet dinner gown and a hat so exceedingly parisian that no one had had the heart to ask her to remove it  my dear peter she remarked reprovingly a moderate amount of admiration for that very agile young lady i might perhaps be inclined to tolerate but having watched you for the last quarter of an hour i am bound to confess that i am becoming jealous  of mademoiselle celaire he asked  of mademoiselle sophie celaire  he leaned a little towards her his lips were parted he was about to make a statement or a confession just then a tall commissionaire leaned over from behind and touched him on the shoulder  for monsieur le baron de grost he announced handing peter a note  peter glanced towards his wife  you permit me he murmured breaking the seal  violet shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly her husband was already absorbed in the few lines hastily scrawled across the sheet of notepaper which he held in his hand                      monsieur le baron de ghost                     dear monsieur le baron              4  come to my dressingroom without  4                 fail as soon as you receive this                               sophie celaire   violet looked over his shoulder  the hussy she exclaimed indignantly her husband raised his eyebrows with his forefinger he merely tapped the two numerals  the doublefour she gasped  he looked around and nodded the commissionaire was waiting peter took up his silk hat from under the seat  if i am detained dear he whispered youll make the best of it wont you the car will be here and frederick will be looking out for you  of course she answered cheerfully i shall be quite all right  she nodded brightly and peter took his departure he passed through a door on which was painted private and through a maze of scenery and stage hands and ballet ladies by a devious route to the region of the dressingrooms his guide conducted him to the door of one of these and knocked  entrez monsieur a shrill feminine voice replied  peter entered and closed the door behind him the commissionaire remained outside mademoiselle celaire turned to greet her visitor  it is a few words i desire with you as quickly as possible if you please monsieur le baron she said advancing towards him listen  she had brushed out her hair and it hung from her head straight and a little stiff almost like the hair of an indian woman she had washed her face too free of all cosmetics and her pallor was almost waxen she wore a dressing gown of green silk her discarded black frock lay upon the floor  i am entirely at your service mademoiselle peter answered bowing continue if you please  you sup with me tonightyou are my guest  he hesitated  i am very much honored he murmured it is an affair of urgency then mademoiselle will remember that i am not alone here  she threw out her hands scornfully  they told me in paris that you were a genius she exclaimed cannot you feel then when a thing is urgent do you not know it without being told you must meet me with a carriage at the stage door in forty minutes we sup in hamilton place with andrea korust and his brother  with whom peter asked surprised  with the korust brothers she repeated i have just been talking to andrea he calls himself a hungarian bah they are as much hungarian those young men as i am  peter leaned slightly against the table and looked thoughtfully at his companion he was trying to remember whether he had ever heard anything of these young men  mademoiselle he said the prospect of partaking of any meal in your company is in itself enchanting but i do not know your friends the korust brothers apart from their wonderful music i do not recollect ever having heard of them before in my life what excuse have i then for accepting their hospitality pardon me too if i add that you have not as yet spoken as to the urgency of this affair  she turned from him impatiently and throwing herself back into the chair from which she had risen at his entrance she began to exchange the thick woolen stockings which she had been wearing upon the stage for others of fine silk  oh la la she exclaimed you are very slow monsieur le baron it is perhaps my stage name which has misled you i am marie lapouse does that convey anything to you  a great deal peter admitted quickly you stand very high upon the list of my agents whom i may trust  then stay here no longer she begged for my maid waits outside and i need her services go back and make your excuses to your wife in forty minutes i shall expect you at the stage door  an affair of diplomacy this or brute force he inquired  heaven knows what may happen she replied to tell you the truth i do not know myself be prepared for anything but for heavens sake go now i can dress no further without my maid and andrea korust may come in at any moment i do not wish him to find you here  peter made his way thoughtfully back to his seat he explained the situation to his wife so far as he could and sent her home then he waited about until the car returned smoking a cigarette and trying once more to remember if he had ever heard anything from sogrange of andrea korust or his brother punctually at the time stated he was outside the stage door of the musichall and a few minutes later mademoiselle celaire appeared a dazzling vision of fur and smiles and jewelry imperfectly concealed a small crowd pressed around to see the famous frenchwoman peter handed her gravely across the pavement into his waiting car one or two of the loungers gave vent to a groan of envy at the sight of the diamonds which blazed from her neck and bosom peter smiled as he gave the address to his servant and took his place by the side of his companion  they see only the externals this mob he remarked they picture to themselves perhaps a little supper for two alas  mademoiselle celaire laughed at him softly  you need not trouble to assume that most disconsolate of expressions my dear baron she assured him your reputation as a man of gallantry is beyond question but remember that i know you also for the most devoted and loyal of husbands we waste no time in folly you and i it is the business of the doublefour  peter was relieved but his innate politeness forbade his showing it  proceed he said  the brothers korust she went on leaning towards him have a weeks engagement at the alhambra their salary is six hundred pounds they play very beautifully of course but i think that it is as much as they are worth  peter agreed with her fervently he had no soul for music  they have taken the furnished house belonging to one of your dukes in hamilton place for which we are now bound taken it too at a fabulous rent mademoiselle celaire continued they have installed there a chef and a whole retinue of servants they are here for seven nights they have issued invitations for seven supper parties  hospitable young men they seem to be peter murmured i read in one of the stage papers that andrea is a count in his own country and that they perform in public only for the love of their music and for the sake of the excitement and travel  a paragraph wholly inspired and utterly false mademoiselle celaire declared firmly sitting a little forward in the car and laying her hand ablaze with jewels upon his coat sleeve listen they call themselves hungarians bah i know that they are in touch with a great european court both of them the court of the country to which they belong they have plans plans and schemes connected with their visit here which i do not understand i have done my best with andrea korust but he is not a man to be trusted i know that there is something more in these seven supper parties than idle hospitality i and others like me artistes and musicians are invited to give the assembly a properly bohemian tone but there are to be other guests attracted there no doubt because the papers have spoken of these gatherings  you have some idea of what it all means in your mind peter suggested  it is too vague to put into words she declared shaking her head we must both watch afterwards we will if you like compare notes  the car drew up before the doors of a handsome house in hamilton place a footman received peter and relieved him of his hat and overcoat a trim maid performed the same office for mademoiselle celaire they met a moment or two later and were ushered into a large drawingroom in which a dozen or two of men and women were already assembled and from which came a pleasant murmur of voices and laughter the apartment was hung with pale green satin the furniture was mostly chippendale upholstered in the same shade a magnificent grand piano stood open in a smaller room just visible beyond only one thing seemed strange to the two newly arrived guests the room was entirely lit with shaded candles giving a certain mysterious but not unpleasant air of obscurity to the whole suite of apartments through the gloom the jewels and eyes of the women seemed to shine with a new brilliance slight eccentricities of toilette for a part of the gathering was distinctly bohemian were softened and subdued the whole effect was somewhat weird but also picturesque  andrea korust advanced from a little group to meet his guests off the stage he seemed at first sight frailer and slighter than ever his dress coat had been exchanged for a velvet dinner jacket and his white tie for a drooping black bow he had a habit of blinking nearly all the time as though his large brown eyes which he seldom wholly opened were weaker than they appeared to be nevertheless when he came to within a few paces of his newly arrived visitors they shone with plenty of expression without any change of countenance however he held out his hand  dear andrea mademoiselle celaire exclaimed you permit me that i present to you my dear friend well known in parisalas many years agomonsieur le baron de grost monsieur le baron was kind enough to pay his respects to me this evening and i have induced him to become my escort here  it was my good fortune peter remarked smiling that i saw mademoiselle celaires name upon the bills this eveningmy good fortune since it has procured for me the honor of an acquaintance with a musician so distinguished  you are very kind monsieur le baron korust replied  you stay here i regret to hear a very short time  alas andrea korust admitted it is so for myself i would that it were longer i find your london so attractive the people so friendly they fall in with my whims so charmingly i have a hatred you know of solitude i like to make acquaintances wherever i go to have delightful women and interesting men around to forget that life is not always gay if i am too much alone i am miserable and when i am miserable i am in a very bad way indeed i cannot then make music  peter smiled gravely and sympathetically  and your brother does he too share your gregarious instincts  korust paused for a moment before replying his eyes were quite wide open now if one could judge from his expression one would certainly have said that the baron de grosts attempts to ingratiate himself with his host were distinctly unsuccessful  my brother has exactly opposite instincts he said slowly he finds no pleasure in society at the sound of a womans voice he hides  he is not here then peter asked glancing around  andrea korust shook his head  it is doubtful whether he joins us this evening at all he declared my sister however is wholly of my disposition monsieur le baron will permit that i present him  peter bowed low before a very handsome young woman with flashing black eyes and a type of features undoubtedly belonging to one of the countries of eastern europe she was picturesquely dressed in a gown of flaming red silk made as though in one piece without trimming or flounces and she seemed inclined to bestow upon her new acquaintance all the attention that he might desire she took him at once into a corner and seated herself by his side it was impossible for peter not to associate the empressement of her manner with the few words which andrea korust had whispered into her ear at the moment of their introduction  so you she murmured are the wonderful baron de grost i have heard of you so often  wonderful peter repeated with twinkling eyes i have never been called that before i feel that i have no claims whatever to distinction especially in a gathering like this  she shrugged her shoulders and glanced carelessly across the room  they are well enough she admitted but one wearies of genius on every side of one genius is not the best thing in the world to live with you know it has whims and fancies for instance look at these roomsthe gloom the obscurityand i love so much the light  peter smiled  it is the privilege of genius he remarked to have whims and to indulge in them  she sighed  to do andrea justice she said it is perhaps scarcely a whim that he chooses to receive his guests in semidarkness he has weak eyes and he is much too vain to wear spectacles tell me you know every one here  no one peter declared please enlighten me if you think it necessary for myself he added dropping his voice a little i feel that the happiness of my evening is assured without making any further acquaintances  but you came as the guest of mademoiselle celaire she reminded him doubtfully with a faint regretful sigh and a provocative gleam in her eyes  i saw mademoiselle celaire tonight for the first time for years peter replied i called to see her in her dressingroom and she claimed me for an escort this evening i am alas a very occasional wanderer in the pleasant paths of bohemia  if that is really true she murmured i suppose i must tell you something about the people or you will feel that you have wasted your opportunity  mademoiselle peter whispered  she held out her hand and laughed into his face  no she interrupted i shall do my duty opposite you is mademoiselle trezani the famous singer at covent garden do i need to tell you that i wonder rudolf maesterling the dramatist stands behind her there in the corner he is talking to the wonderful cleo whom all the world knows monsieur guyer there he is manager i believe of the alhambra and talking to him is marborg the great pianist one of the ladies talking to my brother is esther braithwaite whom of course you know by sight she is leading lady is she not at the hilarity the other is miss ransome they tell me that she is your only really great english actress  peter nodded appreciatively  it is all most interesting he declared now tell me please who is the military person with the stiff figure and sallow complexion standing by the door he seems quite alone  the girl made a little grimace  i suppose i ought to be looking after him she admitted rising reluctantly to her feet he is a soldier just back from indiaa general noseworthy with all sorts of letters after his name if mademoiselle celaire is generous perhaps we may have a few minutes conversation later on she added with a parting smile  say rather if mademoiselle korust is kind de grost replied bowing it depends upon that only  he strolled across the room and rejoined mademoiselle celaire a few moments later they stood apart in a corner  i should like my supper peter declared  they wait for one more guest mademoiselle celaire announced  one more guest do you know who it is  no idea she answered one would imagine that it was some one of importance are you any wiser than when you came dear master she added under her breath  not a whit he replied promptly  she took out her fan and waved it slowly in front of her face  yet you must discover what it all means tonight or not at all she whispered the dear andrea has intimated to me most delicately that another escort would be more acceptable if i should honor him again  that helps he murmured see our last guest arrives  a tallsparelooking man was just being announced they heard his name as andrea presented him to a companion  colonel mayson  mademoiselle celaire saw a gleam in her companions eyes  it is comingthe idea she whispered  very vaguely he admitted  who is this colonel mayson  our only military aeronaut peter replied  she raised her eyebrows  aeronaut she repeated doubtfully i see nothing in that both my own country and germany are years ahead of poor england in the air is it not so  peter smiled and held out his arm  see he said supper has been announced afterwards andrea korust will play to us and i think that colonel mayson and his distinguished brother officer from india will talk we shall see  they passed into a room whose existence had suddenly been revealed by the drawing back of some beautiful brocaded curtains supper was a delightful meal charmingly served peter putting everything else out of his head for the moment thoroughly enjoyed himself and remembering his duty as a guest contributed in no small degree towards the success of the entertainment he sat between mademoiselle celaire and his hostess both of whom demanded much from him in the way of attention but he still found time to tell stories which were listened to by every one and exchanged sallies with the gayest only andrea korust from his place at the head of the table glanced occasionally towards his popular guest with a curious halfhidden expression of distaste and suspicion  the more the baron de grost shone the more uneasy he became the signal to rise from the meal was given almost abruptly mademoiselle korust hung on to peters arm her own wishes and her brothers orders seemed absolutely to coincide she led him towards a retiring corner of the music room on the way however peter overheard the introduction which he had expected  general noseworthy is just returned from india colonel mayson korust said in his usual quiet tired tone you will perhaps find it interesting to talk together a little as for me i play because all are polite enough to wish it but conversation disturbs me not in the least  peter passed smiling on to the corner pointed out by his companion which was the darkest and most secluded in the room he took her fan and gloves lit her cigarette and leaned back by her side  how does your brother a stranger to london find time to make the acquaintance of so many interesting people he asked  he brought many letters she replied he has friends everywhere  i have an idea peter remarked that an acquaintance of my own the count von hern spoke to me once about him  she took her cigarette from her lips and turned her head slightly peters expression was one of amiable reminiscence his cheeks were a trifle flushed his appearance was entirely reassuring she laughed at her brothers caution she found her companion delightful  yes the count von hern is a friend of my brothers she admitted carelessly  and of yours he whispered his arm slightly pressed against hers  she laughed at him silently and their eyes met decidedly peter baron de grost found it hard to break away from his old weakness andrea korust from his place near the piano breathed a sigh of relief as he watched a moment or two later however mademoiselle korust was obliged to leave her companion to receive a late but unimportant guest and almost simultaneously colonel mayson passed by on his way to the farther end of the apartment andrea korust was bending over the piano to give some instructions to his accompanist peter leaned forward and his face and tone were strangely altered  you will find general noseworthy of the indian army a little inquisitive colonel he remarked  the latter turned sharply round there was meaning in those few words without doubt there was meaning too in the still cold face which seemed to repel his question he passed on thoughtfully mademoiselle korust with a gesture of relief came back and threw herself once more upon the couch  we must talk in whispers she said gayly andrea always declares that he does not mind conversation but too much noise is of course impossible besides mademoiselle celaire will not spare you to me for long  there is a whole language he replied which was made for whispers and as for mademoiselle celaire  well  he laughed softly  mademoiselle celaire is i think more your brothers friend than mine he murmured at least i will be generous he has given me a delightful evening i resign my claims upon mademoiselle celaire  it would break your heart she declared  his voice sank even below a whisper decidedly peter baron de grost did not improve  he rose to leave precisely at the right time neither too early nor too late he had spent altogether a most amusing evening there were one or two little comedies which had diverted him extremely at the moment of parting the beautiful eyes of mademoiselle korust had been raised to his very earnestly  you will come again very soontomorrow night she had whispered is it necessary that you bring mademoiselle celaire  it is altogether unnecessary peter replied  let me try and entertain you instead then  it was precisely at that instant that andrea had sent for his sister peter watched their brief conversation with much interest and intense amusement she was being told not to invite him there again and she was rebelling without a doubt he had made a conquest she returned to him flushed and with a dangerous glitter in her eyes  monsieur le baron she said leading him on one side i am ashamed and angry  your brother is annoyed because you have asked me here tomorrow night he asked quickly  it is so she confessed indeed i thank you that you have spared me the task of putting my brothers discourtesy into words andrea takes violent fancies like that sometimes i am ashamed but what can i do  nothing mademoiselle he admitted with a sigh i obey of course did your brother mention the source of his aversion to me  he is too absurd sometimes she declared one must treat him like a great baby  nevertheless there must be a reason peter persisted gently  he has heard some foolish thing from count von hern she admitted reluctantly do not let us think anything more about it in a few days it will have passed and meanwhile  she paused he leaned a little towards her she was looking intently at a ring upon her finger  if you would really like to see me she whispered and if you are sure that mademoiselle celaire would not object could you not ask me to tea tomorrowor the next day  tomorrow peter insisted with a becoming show of eagerness shall we say at the canton at five  she hesitated  isnt that rather a public place she objected  anywhere else you like  she was silent for a moment she seemed to be waiting for some suggestion from him none came however  the carlton at five she murmured i am angry with andrea i feel even that i could break his wonderful violin in two  peter sighed once more  i should like to twist von herns neck he declared lucky for him that hes in st petersburg let us forget this unpleasant matter mademoiselle the evening has been too delightful for such memories  mademoiselle celaire turned to her escort eagerly as soon as they were alone together in the car  as an escort let me tell you my dear baron she exclaimed with some pique that you are a miserable failure for the rest  for the rest i will admit that i am puzzled peter said i need to think i have the glimmerings of an ideano more  you will act it is an affair for usfor the doublefour  without a doubtan affair and a serious one peter assured her i shall act exactly how i cannot say until after tomorrow  tomorrow she repeated inquiringly  mademoiselle korust takes tea with me he explained  in a quiet sort of way the series of supper parties given by andrea korust became the talk of london the most famous dancer in the world broke through her unvarying rule and night after night thrilled the distinguished little gathering an opera singer the star of the season sang a great genius recited and andrea himself gave always of his best apart from this wonderful outpouring of talent andrea korust himself seemed to possess the peculiar art of bringing into touch with one another people naturally interested in the same subjects on the night after the visit of peter baron de grost his grace the duke of rosshire was present the man in whose hands lay the destinies of the british navy and curiously enough on the same night a great french writer on naval subjects was present whom the duke had never met and with whom he was delighted to talk for some time apart on another occasion the military secretary to the french embassy was able to have a long and instructive chat with a distinguished english general on the subject of the recent maneuvers and the latter received in the strictest confidence some very interesting information concerning the new type of french guns on the following evening the greatest of our colonial statesmen a redhot imperialist was able to chat about the resources of the empire with an english politician of similar views whom he chanced never to have previously met altogether these parties seemed to be the means of bringing together a series of most interesting people interesting not only in themselves but in their relations to one another it was noticeable however that from this side of his little gatherings andrea korust remained wholly apart he frankly admitted that music and cheerful companionship were the only two things in life he cared for politics or matters of world import seemed to leave him unmoved if a serious subject of conversation were started at supper time he was frankly bored and took no particular pains to hide the fact it is certain that whatever interesting topics were alluded to in his presence he remained entirely outside any understanding of them mademoiselle celaire who was present most evenings although with other escorts was entirely puzzled she could see nothing whatever to account for the warning which she had received and which she had passed on as was her duty to the baron de grost she failed also to understand the faint but perceptible enlightenment to which peter himself had admittedly attained after that first evening take that important conversation for instance between the french military attach and the english general without a doubt it was of interest and especially so to the country which she was sure claimed his allegiance but it was equally without doubt that andrea korust neither overheard a word of that conversation nor betrayed the slightest curiosity concerning it mademoiselle celaire was a clever woman and she had never felt so hopelessly at fault  the seventh and last of these famous supper parties was in full swing notwithstanding the shaded candles which left the faces of the guests a little indistinct the scene was a brilliant one mademoiselle celaire was wearing her famous diamonds which shone through the gloom like pinpricks of fire garda desmaines the wonderful garda sat next to her host her bosom and hair on fire with jewels yet with the most wonderful light of all glowing in her eyes a famous actor who had thrown his proverbial reticence to the winds kept his immediate neighbors in a state of semihysterical mirth the clink of wine glasses the laughter of beautiful women the murmur of cultivated voices rising and swelling through the faint mysterious gloom made a picturesque a wonderful scene pale as a marble statue with the covert smile of the gracious host andrea korust sat at the head of his table well pleased with his company as indeed he had the right to be by his side was a great american statesman who was traveling around the world and yet had refused all other invitations of this sort he had come for the pleasure of meeting the famous dutch writer and politician mr van jool the two were already talking intimately it was at this point that tragedy or something like it intervened a impatient voice was heard in the hall outside a voice which grew louder and louder more impatient finally more passionate people raised their heads to listen the american statesman who was perhaps the only one to realize exactly what was coming slipped his hand into his pocket and gripped something cold and hard then the door was flung open an apologetic and much disturbed butler made the announcement which had evidently been demanded of him  mr von tassen  a silence followedbreathlessthe silence before the bursting of the storm mr von tassen was the name of the american statesman and the man who rose slowly from his place by his hosts side was the exact double of the man who stood now upon the threshold gazing in upon the room the expression of the two alone was different the newcomer was furiously angry and looked it the sham mr von tassen was very much at his ease it was he who broke the silence and his voice was curiously free from all trace of emotion he was looking his double over with an air of professional interest  on the whole he said calmly very good a little stouter i perceive and the eyebrows a trifle too regular of course when you make faces at me like that it is hard to judge of the expression i can only say that i did the best i could  who the devil are you masquerading in my name the newcomer demanded with emphasis this man is an impostor he added turning to andrea korust what is he doing at your table  andrea leaned forward and his face was an evil thing to look upon  who are you he hissed out  the sham mr von tassen turned away for a moment and stooped down the trick has been done often enough upon the stage often in less time but seldom with more effect the wonderful wig disappeared the spectacles the lines in the face the makeup of diabolical cleverness with his back to the wall and his fingers playing with something in his pocket peter baron de grost smiled upon his host  since you insist upon knowingthe baron de grost at your service he announced  andrea korust was for the moment speechless one of the women shrieked the real mr von tassen looked around him helplessly  will some one be good enough to enlighten me as to the meaning of this he begged is it a roast if so i only want to catch on let me get to the joke if there is one if not i should like a few words of explanation from you sir he added addressing peter  presently the latter replied in the meantime let me persuade you that i am not the only impostor here  he seized a glass of water and dashed it in the face of mr van jool there was a moments scuffle and no more of mr van jool what emerged was a good deal like the shy maurice korust who accompanied his brother at the music hall but whose distaste for these gatherings had been andreas continual lament the baron de grost stepped back once more against the wall his host was certainly looking dangerous mademoiselle celaire was leaning forward staring through the gloom with distended eyes around the table every head was turned towards the centre of the disturbance it was peter again who spoke  let me suggest andrea korust he said that you send your gueststhose who are not immediately interested in this affairinto the next room i will offer mr von tassen then the explanation to which he is entitled  andrea korust staggered to his feet the nerve had failed he was shaking all over he pointed to the music room  if you would be so good ladies and gentlemen he begged we will follow you immediately  they went with obvious reluctance all their eyes seemed focussed upon peter he bore their scrutiny with calm cheerfulness for a moment he had feared korust but that moment had passed a servant obeying his masters gesture pulled back the curtains after the departing crowd the four men were alone  mr von tassen peter said easily you are a man who loves adventures tonight you experience a new sort of one over in your great country such methods are laughed at as the cheap device of sensation mongers nevertheless they exist tonight is a proof that they exist  get on to facts sir the american admonished youve got to explain to me what you mean by passing yourself off as thomas von tassen before you leave this room  peter bowed  with much pleasure mr von tassen he declared for your information i might tell you that you are not the only person in whose guise i have figured in fact i have had quite a busy week i have beenlet me seei have been monsieur le marquis de beau kunel on the night when our shy friend maurice korust was playing the part of general henderson i have also been his grace the duke of rosshire when my friend maurice here was introduced to me as francois defayal known by name to me as one of the greatest writers on naval matters a little awkward about the figure i found his grace but otherwise i think that i should have passed muster wherever he was known i have also passed as sir william laureston on the evening when my rival artist here sang the praises of imperial england  andrea korust leaned forward with venomous eyes  you mean that it was you who was here last night in sir william laurestons place he almost shrieked  most certainly peter admitted but you must remember that after all my performances have been no more difficult than those of your shy but accomplished brother whenever i took to myself a strange personality i found him there equally good as to detail and with his subject always at his finger tips we settled that little matter of the canal didnt we peter remarked cheerfully laying his hand upon the shoulder of the young man  they stared at him those two whitefaced brothers like tigercats about to spring mr von tassen was getting impatient  look here he protested you may be clearing matters up so far as regards mr andrea korust and his brother but im as much in the fog as ever where do i come in  your pardon sir peter replied i am getting nearer things now these two young menwe will not call them hard namesare suffering from an excess of patriotic zeal they didnt come and sit down on a camp stool and sketch obsolete forts as those others of their countrymen do when they want to pose as the bland and really exceedingly ignorant foreigner they went about the matter with some skill it occurred to them that it might be interesting to their country to know what sir william laureston thought about the strength of the imperial navy and to what extent his country was willing to go in maintaining their allegiance to great britain then there was the duke of rosshire they thought theyd like to know his views as to the development of the navy during the next ten years there was that little matter too of the french guns it would certainly be interesting to them to know what monsieur le marquis de beau kunel had to say about them these people were all invited to sit at the hospitable board of our host here i however had an inkling on the first night of what was going on and i was easily able to persuade those in authority to let me play their several parts you sir peter added turning to mr von tassen you sir floored me you were not an englishman and there was no appeal which i could make i simply had to risk you i counted upon your not turning up unfortunately you did fortunately you are the last guest this is the seventh supper  mr von tassen glanced around at the three men and made up his mind  what do you call yourself he asked peter  the baron de grost peter replied  then my friend the baron de grost von tassen said i think that you and i had better get out of this so i was to talk about germany with mr van jool eh  i have already explained your views peter declared with twinkling eyes mr van jool was delighted  mr von tassen shook with laughter  say he exclaimed this is a great story if youre ready baron de grost lead the way to where we can get a whiskey and soda and a chat  mademoiselle celaire came gliding out to them  i am not going to be left here she whispered taking peters arm  peter looked back from the door  at any rate mr andrea korust he said your first supper was a success colonel mayson was genuine our real english military aeronaut was here and he has disclosed to you maurice korust all that he ever knew henceforth i presume your great country will dispute with us for the mastery of the air  queer country this mr von tassen remarked pausing on the step to light a cigar seems kind of humdrum after new york but theres no use talking things do happen over here anyway    chapter vii major kosuths mission   his host very fussy as he always was on the morning of his big shoot came bustling towards peter baron de grost with a piece of paper in his hand the party of men had just descended from a large brake and were standing about on the edge of the common examining cartridges smoking a last cigarette before the business of the morning and chatting together over the prospects of the days sport in the distance a cloud of dust indicated the approach of a fast traveling motorcar  my dear baron sir william bounderby said i want you to change your stand today i must have a good man at the far corner as the birds go off my hand from there and addington was missing them shockingly yesterday besides there is a new man coming on your left and i know nothing of his shootingnothing at all  peter smiled  anywhere you choose to put me sir william he assented they came badly for addington yesterday and well for me however ill do my best  i wish people wouldnt bring strangers especially to the one shoot where im keen about the bag i told portal he could bring his brotherinlaw and hes bringing this foreign fellow instead dont suppose he can shoot for nuts did you ever hear of him i wonder the count von hern he calls himself  the motorcar had come to a standstill by this time from it descended mr portal himself a large neighboring land owner a man of culture and travel with him was bernadine in a very correct shooting suit and tyrolese hat on the other side of mr portal was a short thick set man with olive complexion keen black eyes black mustache and imperial who was dressed in city clothes sir williams eyebrows were slightly raised as he advanced to greet the party peter was at once profoundly interested  mr portal introduced his guests  you will forgive me i am sure for bringing a spectator bounderby he said major kosuth whom i have the honor to presentmajor kosuth sir william bounderbyis high up in the diplomatic service of a country with whom we must feel every sympathythe young turks the count von hern who takes my brotherinlaws place is probably known to you by name  sir william welcomed his visitors cordially  you do not shoot major kosuth he asked  very seldom the turk answered i come today with my good friend count von hern as a spectator if you permit  delighted sir william replied we will find you a safe place near your friend  the little party began to move toward the wood it was just at this moment that bernadine felt a touch upon his shoulder and turning around found peter by his side  an unexpected pleasure my dear count the latter declared suavely i had no idea that you took interest in such simple sports  the manners of count von hern were universally quoted as being almost too perfect it is a regrettable fact however that at that moment he sworesoftly perhaps but with distinct vehemence a moment later he was exchanging the most cordial of greetings with his old friend  you have the knack my dear de grost he remarked of turning up in the most surprising places i certainly did not know that among your many accomplishments was included a love for field sports  peter smiled quietly he was a very fine shot and knew it  one must amuse oneself these days he said there is little else to do  bernadine bit his lip  my absence from this country i fear has robbed you of an occupation  it has certainly deprived life of some of its savor peter admitted blandly by the bye will you not present me to your friend i have the utmost sympathy with the intrepid political party of which he is a member  von hern performed the introduction with a reluctance which he wholly failed to conceal the turk however had been walking on his other side and his hat was already lifted peter had purposely raised his voice  it gives me the greatest pleasure major kosuth peter said to welcome you to this country in common i believe with the majority of my country people i have the utmost respect and admiration for the movement which you represent  major kosuth smiled slowly his features were heavy and unexpressive there was something of gloom however in the manner of his response  you are very kind baron he replied and i welcome very much this expression of your interest in my party i believe that the hearts of your country people are turned towards us in the same manner i could wish that your countrys political sympathies were as easily aroused  bernadine intervened promptly  major kosuth has been here only one day he remarked lightly i tell him that he is a little too impatient see we are approaching the wood it is as well here to refrain from conversation  we will resume it later peter said softly i have interests in turkey and it would give me great pleasure to have a talk with major kosuth  financial interests the latter inquired with some eagerness  peter nodded  i will explain after the first drive he said turning away  peter walked rather quickly until he reached a bend in the wood and overtaking his host paused for a moment  lend me a loader for half an hour sir william he begged i have to send my servant to the village with a telegram  with pleasure sir william answered there are several to spare ill send one to your stand theres von hern going the wrong way he exclaimed in a tone of annoyance  peter was just in time to stop the whistle from going to his mouth  do me another favor sir william he pleaded give me time to send off my telegram before the count sees what im doing hes such an inquisitive person he went on noticing his hosts look of blank surprise thank you ever so much  peter hurried on to his place it was round the corner of the wood and for the moment out of sight of the rest of the party he tore a sheet from his pocketbook and scribbled out a telegram his man had disappeared and a substitute taken his place by the time von hern arrived the latter was now all amiability it was hard to believe from his smiling salutation that he and the man to whom he waved his hand in so airy a fashion had ever declared war to the death  the shooting began a few minutes later major kosuth from a campstool a few yards behind his friend watched with somewhat languid interest he gave one indeed the impression that his thoughts were far removed from this simple country party the main object of whose existence for the present seemed to be the slaying of a certain number of inoffensive birds he watched the indifferent performance of his friend and the remarkably fine shooting of his neighbor on the left with the same lackluster eye and want of enthusiasm the beat was scarcely over before peter resigning his smoking guns lit a cigarette and strolled across to the next stand he plunged at once into a conversation with kosuth notwithstanding bernadines illconcealed annoyance  major kosuth he began i sympathize with you it is a hard task for a man whose mind is centered upon great events to sit still and watch a performance of this sort be kind to us all and remember that this represents to us merely a few hours of relaxation we too have our more serious moments  you read my thoughts well major kosuth declared i do not seek to excuse them for half a lifetime we turks have toiled and striven always in danger of our lives to help forward those things which have now come to pass i think that our lives have become tinged with somberness and apprehension now that the first step is achieved we go forward still with trepidation we need friends baron de grost  you cannot seriously doubt but that you will find them in this country peter remarked there has never been a time when the english nation has not sympathized with the cause of liberty  it is not the hearts of your people major kosuth said which i fear it is the antics of your politicians sympathy is a great thing and good to have but turkey today needs more the heart of a nation is big but the number of those in whose hands it remains to give practical expression to its promptings is few  bernadine who had stood as much as he could seized forcibly upon his friend  you must remember our bargain kosuth he insisted no politics today until tomorrow evening we rest now i want to introduce you to a very old friend of minethe lordlieutenant of the county  no man was better informed in current political affairs but peter instead of joining the cheerful afternoon tea party at the close of the day raked out a file of the times from the library and studied it carefully in his room there were one or two items of news concerning which he made pencil notes he had scarcely finished his task before a servant brought in a dispatch he opened it with interest and drew pencil and paper towards him it was from paris and in the code which he had learned by heart no written key of which existed carefully he transposed it on to paper and read it through it was dated from paris a few hours back  kosuth left for england yesterday envoy from new turkish government requiring loan one million pounds asked for guarantee that it was not for warlike movement against bulgaria declined to give same communicated with english ambassador and informed kosuth yesterday that neither government would sanction loan unless undertaking were given that the same was not to be applied for war against bulgaria turkey is under covenant to enter into no financial obligations with any other power while the interest of former loans remains in abeyance kosuth has made two efforts to obtain loan privately from prominent english financier and french syndicate both have declined to treat on representations from government kosuth was expected return direct to turkey if as you say he is in england with bernadine we commend the affair to your utmost vigilance germany exceedingly anxious enter into close relations with new government of turkey fear kosuths association with bernadine proof of bad faith have had interview with minister for foreign affairs who relies upon our help french secret service at your disposal if necessary  peter read the message three times with the greatest care he was on the point of destroying it when violet came into the room she was wearing a long tea jacket of sheeny silk her beautiful hair was most becomingly arranged her figure as light and girlish as ever she came into the room humming gayly and swinging a gold purse upon her finger  won three rubbers out of four peter she declared and a compliment from the duchess am i a pupil to be proud of  she stopped short her lips formed themselves into the shape of a whistle she knew very well the signs her husbands eyes were kindling there was a firm set about his lips the palm of his hand lay flat upon that sheet of paper  it was true she murmured it was bernadine who was shooting today  peter nodded  he was on the next stand he replied  then there is something doing of course violet continued my dear peter you may be an enigma to other people to me you have the most expressive countenance i ever saw you have had a cable which you have just transcribed if i had been a few minutes later i think you would have torn up the result as it is i think i have come just in time to hear all about it  peter smiled grimly but fondly he uncovered the sheet of paper and placed it in her hands  so far he said there isnt much to tell you von hern turned up this morning with a major kosuth who was one of the leaders of the revolution in turkey i wired paris and this is the reply  she read the message through thoughtfully and handed it back peter lit a match and standing over the fireplace calmly destroyed it  a million pounds is not a great sum of money violet remarked why could not kosuth borrow it for his country from a private individual  a million pounds is not a large sum to talk about peter replied but it is an exceedingly large sum for any one even a multimillionaire to handle in cash and turkey i gather wants it at once besides considerations which might be a security from a government are no security at all as applied to a private individual  she nodded  do you think that kosuth means to go behind the existing treaty and borrow from germany  peter shook his head  i cant quite believe that he said it would mean the straining of diplomatic relations with both countries it is out of the question  then where does bernadine come in  i do not know peter answered  violet laughed  what is it that you are going to try and find out she asked  i am trying to discover who it is that bernadine and kosuth are waiting to see peter replied the worst of it is i darent leave here i shall have to trust to the others  she glanced at the clock  well go and dress she said im afraid ive a little of your blood in me after all life seems more stirring when bernadine is on the scene   the shooting party broke up two days later and peter and his wife returned at once to town the former found the reports which were awaiting his arrival disappointing bernadine and his guest were not in london or if they were they had carefully avoided all the usual haunts peter read his reports over again smoked a very long cigar alone in his study and finally drove down to the city and called upon his stockbroker who was also a personal friend things were flat in the city and the latter was glad enough to welcome an important client he began talking the usual market shop until his visitor stopped him  i have come to you edwardes more for information than anything peter declared although it may mean that i shall need to sell a lot of stock can you tell me of any private financier who could raise a loan of a million pounds in cash within the course of a week  the stockbroker looked dubious  in cash he repeated money isnt raised that way you know i doubt whether there are many men in the whole city of london who could put up such an amount with only a weeks notice  but there must be some one peter persisted think it would probably be a firm or a man not obtrusively english i dont think the jews would touch it and a german citizen would be impossible  semipolitical eh  peter nodded  it is rather that way he admitted  would your friend count von hern be likely to be concerned in it  why peter asked with immovable face  nothing only i saw him coming out of heseltinewrigges office the other day the stockbroker remarked carelessly  and who is mr heseltinewrigge  a very wealthy american financier the stockbroker replied not at all an unlikely person for a loan of the sort you mention  american citizen peter inquired  without a doubt of german descent i should say but nothing much left of it in his appearance he settled over here in a huff because new york society wouldnt receive his wife  i remember all about it peter declared she was a chorus girl wasnt she nothing particular against her but the fellow had no tact do you know him edwardes  slightly the stockbroker answered  give me a letter to him peter said give my credit as good a leg as you can i shall probably go as a borrower  mr edwardes wrote a few lines and handed them to his client  office is nearly opposite he remarked wish you luck whatever your scheme is  peter crossed the street and entered the building which his friend had pointed out he ascended in the lift to the third floor knocked at the door which bore mr heseltinewrigges name and almost ran into the arms of a charmingly dressed little lady who was being shown out by a broadshouldered typical american peter hastened to apologize  i beg your pardon he said raising his hat i was rather in a hurry and i quite thought i heard some one say come in  the lady replied pleasantly her companion who was carrying his hat in his hand paused reluctantly  did you want to see me he asked  if you are mr heseltinewrigge i did peter admitted i am the baron de grost and i have a letter of introduction to you from mr edwardes  mr heseltinewrigge tore open the envelope and glanced through the contents of the note peter meanwhile looked at his wife with genuine but respectfully cloaked admiration the lady obviously returned his interest  why if youre the baron de grost she exclaimed didnt you marry vi brown she used to be at the gaiety with me years ago  i certainly did marry violet brown peter confessed and if you will allow me to say so mrs heseltinewrigge i should have recognized you anywhere from your photographs  say isnt that queer the little lady remarked turning to her husband i should love to see vi again  if you will give me your address peter declared promptly my wife will be delighted to call upon you  the man looked up from the note  do you want to talk business with me baron he asked  for a few moments only peter answered i am afraid i am a great nuisance and if you wish it i will come down to the city again  thats all right mr heseltinewrigge replied myra wont mind waiting a minute or two come through here  he turned and led the way into a quietlooking suite of offices where one or two clerks were engaged writing at open desks they all three passed into an inner room  any objections to my wife coming in mr heseltinewrigge asked theres scarcely any place for her out there  delighted peter answered  she glanced at the clock  remember we have to meet the count von hern at half past one at princes charles she reminded him  her husband nodded there was nothing in peters expression to denote that he had already achieved the first object of his visit  i shall not detain you he said your name has been mentioned to me mr heseltinewrigge as a financier likely to have a large sum of money at his disposal i have a scheme which needs money providing the security is unexceptionable are you in a position to do a deal  how much do you want mr heseltinewrigge asked  a million to a million and a half peter answered  dollars  pounds  it was not mr heseltinewrigges pose to appear surprised nevertheless his eyebrows were slightly raised  say what is this scheme he inquired  first of all peter replied i should like to know whether theres any chance of business if i disclose it  not an atom mr heseltinewrigge declared i have just committed myself to the biggest financial transaction of my life and it will clean me out  then i wont waste your time peter announced rising  sit down for a moment mr heseltinewrigge invited biting the end off a cigar and passing the box toward peter thats all right my wife doesnt mind say it strikes me as rather a curious thing that you should come in here and talk about a million and a half when thats just the amount concerned in my other little deal  peter smiled  as a matter of fact it isnt at all queer he answered i dont want the money i came to see whether you were really interested in the other affairthe turkish loan you know  mr heseltinewrigge withdrew his cigar from his mouth and looked steadily at his visitor  say baron he declared youve got a nerve  not at all peter replied im here as much in your interests as my own  whom do you represent anyway mr heseltinewrigge inquired  a company you have never heard of peter replied our offices are in the underground places of the world and we dont run to brass plates i am here because i am curious about that loan turkey hasnt a shadow of security to offer you everything which she can pledge is pledged to guarantee the interest on existing loans to france and england she is prevented by treaty from borrowing in germany if you make a loan without security mr heseltinewrigge i suppose you understand your position the loan may be repudiated at any moment  kind of a philanthropist arent you baron mr heseltinewrigge remarked quietly  not in the least peter assured him i know there is some tricky work going on and i havent brains enough to get to the bottom of it thats why ive come blundering in to you and why i suppose youll be telling the whole story to the count von hern at luncheon in an hours time  mr heseltinewrigge smoked in silence for a moment or two  this transaction of mine he said at last isnt one i can talk about i guess im on to what you want to know but i simply cant tell you the security is unusual but its good enough for me  it seems so to you beyond a doubt peter replied still you have to do with a remarkably clever young man in the count von hern i dont want to ask you any questions you feel i ought not to but i do wish youd tell me one thing  go right ahead mr heseltinewrigge invited dont be shy  what day are you concluding this affair  mr heseltinewrigge scratched his chin for a moment thoughtfully and glanced at his diary well ill risk that he decided a week today i hand over the coin  peter drew a little breath of relief a week was an immense time he rose to his feet  that ends our business then for the present he said now i am going to ask both of you a favor perhaps i have no right to but as a man of honor mr heseltinewrigge you can take it from me that i ask it in your interests as well as my own dont tell the count von hern of my visit to you  mr heseltinewrigge held out his hand  thats all right he declared you hear myra  ill be dumb baron she promised say when do you think vi can come and see me  peter was guilty of snobbery he considered it quite a justifiable weapon  she is at windsor this afternoon he remarked  what at the gardenparty mrs heseltinewrigge almost shrieked  peter nodded  i believe theres some fete or other tomorrow he said but were alone this evening why wont you dine with us say at the carlton  wed love to the lady assented promptly  at eight oclock peter said taking his leave  the dinner party was a great success mrs heseltinewrigge found herself among the class of people with whom it was her earnest desire to become acquainted and her husband was well satisfied to see her keen longing for society likely to be gratified the subject of peters call at the office in the city was studiously ignored it was not until the very end of the evening indeed that the host of this very agreeable party was rewarded by a single hint it all came about in the most natural manner they were speaking of foreign capitals  i love paris mrs heseltinewrigge told her host just adore it charles is often there on business and i always go along  peter smiled there was just a chance here  your husband does not often have to leave london though he remarked carelessly  she nodded  not often enough she declared i just love getting about last week we had a perfectly horrible trip though we started off for belfast quite unexpectedly and i hated every minute of it  peter smiled inwardly but he said never a word his companion was already chattering on about something else peter crossed the hall a few minutes later to speak to an acquaintance slipped out to the telephone booth and spoke to his servant  a bag and a change he ordered at euston station at twelve oclock in time for the irish mail your mistress will be home as usual  an hour later the dinner party broke up early the next morning peter crossed the irish channel he returned the following day and crossed again within a few hours in five days the affair was finished except for the denouement  peter ascended in the lift to mr heseltinewrigges office the following thursday calm and unruffled as usual but nevertheless a little exultant it was barely half an hour since he had become finally prepared for this interview he was looking forward to it now with feelings of undiluted satisfaction mr heseltinewrigge was in he was told and he was at once admitted to his presence the financier greeted him with a somewhat curious smile  say this is very nice of you to look me up again he exclaimed still worrying about that loan eh  peter shook his head  no im not worrying about that any more he answered accepting one of his hosts cigars the fact of it is that if it were not for me you would be the one who would have to do the worrying  mr heseltinewrigge stopped short in the act of lighting his cigar  im not quite on he remarked whats the trouble  there is no trouble fortunately peter replied only a little disappointment for our friends the count von hern and major kosuth i have brought you some information which i think will put an end to that affair of the loan  mr heseltinewrigge sat quite still for a moment he brows were knitted he showed no signs of nervousness  go right on he said  the security upon which you were going to advance a million and a half to the turkish government peter continued consisted of two dreadnoughts and a cruiser being built to the order of that country by messrs shepherd  hargreaves at belfast  quite right mr heseltinewrigge admitted quietly i have been up and seen the boats i have seen the shipbuilders too  did you happen to mention to the latter peter inquired that you were advancing money upon those vessels  certainly not mr heseltinewrigge replied kosuth wouldnt hear of such a thing if the papers got wind of it thered be the devil to pay all the same i have got an assignment from the turkish government  not worth the paper its written on peter declared blandly  mr heseltinewrigge rose unsteadily to his feet he was a strong silent man but there was a queer look about his mouth  what the devil do you mean he demanded  briefly this peter explained the first payment when these ships were laid down was made not by turkey but by an emissary of the german government who arranged the whole affair in constantinople the second payment was due ten months ago and not a penny has been paid notice was given to the late government twice and absolutely ignored according to the charter therefore these ships reverted to the shipbuilding companies who retained possession of the first payment as indemnity against loss the count von herns position was this he represents the german government you were to find a million and a half of money with the ships as security you also have a contract from the count von hern to take those ships off your hands provided the interest on the loan became overdue a state of affairs which i can assure you would have happened within the next twelve months practically therefore you were made use of as an independent financier to provide the money with which the turkish government broadly speaking have sold the ships to germany you see according to the charter of the shipbuilding company these vessels cannot be sold to any foreign government without the consent of downing street that is the reason why the affair had to be conducted in such a roundabout manner  all this is beyond me mr heseltinewrigge said hoarsely i dont care a dn who has the ships in the end so long as i get my money  but you would not get your money peter pointed out because there will be no ships i have had the shrewdest lawyers in the world at work upon the charter and there is not the slightest doubt that these vessels are or rather were the entire property of messrs shepherd  hargreaves today they belong to me i have bought them and paid two hundred thousand pounds deposit i can show you the receipt and all the papers  mr heseltinewrigge said only one word but that word was profane  i am sorry of course that you have lost the business peter concluded but surely its better than losing your money  mr heseltinewrigge struck the table fiercely with his fist there was a gray and unfamiliar look about his face  dn it the moneys gone he declared hoarsely they changed the day kosuth had to go back i paid it twentyfour hours ago  peter whistled softly  if only you had trusted me a little more he murmured i tried to warn you  mr heseltinewrigge snatched up his hat  they dont leave till the twotwenty he shouted well catch them at the milan if we dont im ruined by god im ruined  they found major kosuth in the hall of the hotel he was wearing a fur coat and was otherwise attired for traveling his luggage was already being piled upon a cab mr heseltinewrigge wasted no words upon him  you and i have got to have a talk right here and now he declared wheres the count  major kosuth frowned gloomily  i do not understand you he said shortly our business is concluded and i am leaving by the twotwenty train  you are doing nothing of the sort the american answered standing before him grim and threatening  the turk showed no sign of terror he gripped his silverheaded cane firmly  i think he said that there is no one here who will prevent me  peter who saw a fracas imminent hastily intervened if you will permit me for a moment he said there is a little explanation i should perhaps make to major kosuth  the turk took a step towards the door  i have no time to listen to explanations from you or any one he replied my cab is waiting i depart if mr heseltinewrigge is not satisfied with our transaction i am sorry but it is too late to alter anything  for a moment it seemed as though a struggle between the two men was inevitable already people were glancing at them curiously for mr heseltinewrigge came of a primitive school and he had no intention whatever of letting his man escape fortunately at that moment count von hern came up and peter at once appealed to him  count he said may i beg for your good offices my friend mr heseltinewrigge here is determined to have a few words with major kosuth before he leaves surely this is not an unreasonable request when you consider the magnitude of the transaction which has taken place between them let me beg of you to persuade major kosuth to give us ten minutes there is plenty of time for the train and this is not the place for a brawl  it will not take us long kosuth to hear what our friend has to say he remarked we shall be quite quiet in the smokingroom let us go in there and dispose of the affair  the turk turned unwillingly in the direction indicated all four men passed through the cafe up some stairs and into the small smokingroom the room was deserted peter led the way to the far corner and standing with his elbow leaning upon the mantelpiece addressed them  the position is this he said mr heseltinewrigge has parted with a million and a half of his own money a loan to the turkish government on security which is not worth a snap of the fingers  it is a lie major kosuth exclaimed  my dear baron you are woefully misinformed the count declared  peter shook his head slowly  no he said i am not misinformed my friend here has parted with the money on the security of two battleships and a cruiser now building in shepherd  hargreaves yard at belfast the two battleships and cruiser in question belong to me i have paid two hundred thousand pounds on account of them and hold the shipbuilders receipt  you are mad bernadine cried contemptuously  peter shook his head and continued  the battleships were laid down for the turkish government and the money with which to start them was supplied by the secret service of germany the second installment was due ten months ago and has not been paid the time of grace provided for has expired the shipbuilders in accordance with their charter were consequently at liberty to dispose of the vessels as they thought fit on the statement of the whole of the facts to the head of the firm he has parted with these ships to me i need not say that i have a purchaser within a mile from here it is a fancy of mine count von hern that those ships will sail better under the british flag  there was a moments tense silence the face of the turk was black with anger bernadine was trembling with rage  this is a tissue of lies he exclaimed  peter shrugged his shoulders  the facts are easy enough for you to prove he said and i have here he added producing a roll of papers copies of the various documents for your inspection your scheme of course was simple enough it fell through for this one reason only a final notice pressing for the second installment and stating the days of grace was forwarded to constantinople about the time of the recent political troubles the late government ignored it in fairness to major kosuth we will believe that the present government was ignorant of it but the fact remains that messrs shepherd  hargreaves became at liberty to sell those vessels and that i have bought them you will have to give up that money major kosuth  by god he shall the american muttered  bernadine leaned a little towards his enemy  you must give us a minute or two he insisted we shall not go away i promise you within five minutes you shall hear our decision  peter sat down at the writingtable and commenced a letter mr heseltinewrigge mounted guard over the door and stood there a grim figure of impatience before the five minutes was up bernadine crossed the room  i congratulate you baron he said dryly you are either an exceedingly lucky person or you are more of a genius than i believe kosuth is even now returning his letters of credit to your friend you are quite right the loan cannot stand  i was sure peter answered that you would see the matter correctly  you and i bernadine continued know very well that i dont care a fig about turkey new or old the ships i will admit that i intended to have for my own country as it is i wish you joy of them before they are completed we may be fighting in the air  peter smiled and side by side with bernadine strolled across to heseltinewrigge who was buttoning up a pocketbook with trembling fingers  personally peter said i believe that the days of wars are over  that may or may not be bernadine answered one thing is very certain even if the nations remain at peace there are enmities which strike only deeper as the years pass i am going to take a drink now with my disappointed friend kosuth if i raise my glass to the day you will understand  peter smiled  my friend mr heseltinewrigge and i are for the same destination he replied pushing open the swing door which led to the bar i return your good wishes count i too drink to the day  bernadine and kosuth left a few minutes afterwards mr heseltinewrigge who was feeling himself again watched them depart with illconcealed triumph  say you had those fellows on toast baron he declared admiringly i couldnt follow the whole affair but i can see that youre in for big things sometimes remember this if money counts at any time im with you  peter clasped his hand  money always counts he said and friends    chapter viii the man behind the curtain   peter baron de grost glanced at the card which his butler had brought in to him carelessly at first afterwards with that curious rigidity of attention which usually denotes the setting free of a flood of memories  the gentleman would like to see you sir the man announced  you can show him in at once peter replied the servant withdrew peter during those few minutes of waiting stood with his back to the room and his face to the window looking out across the square in reality seeing nothing completely immersed in this strange flood of memories john dorysir john dory nowhis quondam enemy and he had met but seldom during these years of their prosperity the figure of this man who had once loomed so largely in his life had gradually shrunk away into the background their avoidance of each other arose perhaps from a sort of instinct which was certainly no matter of illwill still the fact remained that they had scarcely exchanged a word for years and peter turned to receive his unexpected guest with a curiosity which he did not trouble wholly to conceal  sir john dorychief commissioner now of scotland yard a person of weight and importancehad changed a great deal during the last few years his hair had become gray his walk more dignified there was the briskness however of his best days in his carriage and in the flash of his brown eyes he held out his hand to his ancient foe with a smile  my dear baron he said i hope you are going to say that you are glad to see me  unless peter replied with a goodhumored grimace your visit is official i am more than gladi am charmed sit down i was just going to take my morning cigar you will join me good now i am ready for the worst that can happen  the two men seated themselves john dory pulled at his cigar appreciatively sniffed its flavor for a moment and then leaned forward in his chair  my visit baron he announced is semiofficial i am here to ask you a favor  an official favor peter demanded quickly  his visitor hesitated as though he found the question hard to answer  to tell you the truth he declared this call of mine is wholly an inspiration it does not in any way concern you personally or your position in this country what that may be i do not know except that i am sure it is above any suspicion  quite so peter murmured how diplomatic you have become my dear friend  john dory smiled  perhaps i am fencing about too much he said i know of course that you are a member of a very powerful and wealthy french society whose object and aims so far as i know are entirely harmless  i am delighted to be assured that you recognize that fact peter admitted  i might add john dory continued that this harmlessnessis of recent date  really you do seem to know a good deal peter confessed  i find myself still fencing dory declared a matter of habit i suppose i didnt mean to when i came i made up my mind to tell you simply that guillot was in london and to ask you if you could help me to get rid of him  peter looked thoughtfully into his companions face but he did not speak he understood at such moments the value of silence  we speak together dory continued softly as men who understand one another guillot is the one criminal in europe whom we all fear not i alone mind youit is the same in berlin in petersburg in vienna he has never been caught it is my honest belief that he never will be caught at the same time wherever he arrives the thunderclouds gather he leaves behind him always a trail of evil deeds  very well put peter murmured quite picturesque  can you help me to get rid of him dory inquired i have my hands full just now as you can imagine what with the political crisis and these constant mass meetings i want guillot out of the country if you can manage this for me i shall be your eternal debtor  why do you imagine peter asked that i can help you in this matter  there was a brief silence john dory knocked the ash from his cigar  times have changed he said the harmlessness of your great society my dear baron is at present admitted but there were days  exactly peter interrupted as shrewd as ever i perceive do you know anything of the object of his coming  nothing  anything of his plans  nothing  you know where he is staying  naturally dory answered he has taken a secondfloor flat in crayshaw mansions shaftesbury avenue as usual he is above all petty artifices he has taken it under the name of monsieur guillot  i really dont know whether there is anything i can do peter decided but i will look into the matter for you with pleasure perhaps i may be able to bring a little influence to bearindirectly of course if so it is at your service lady dory is well i trust  in the best of health sir john replied accepting the hint and rising to his feet i shall hear from you soon  without a doubt peter answered i must certainly call upon monsieur guillot  peter certainly wasted no time in paying his promised visit that same afternoon he rang the bell at the flat in crayshaw mansions a typical french butler showed him into the room where the great man sat monsieur guillot slight elegant preeminently a dandy was lounging upon a sofa being manicured by a young lady he threw down his petit journal and rose to his feet however at his visitors entrance  my dear baron he exclaimed but this is charming of you mademoiselle he added turning to the manicurist you will do me the favor of retiring for a short time permit me  he opened the door and showed her out then he came back to peter  a visit of courtesy monsieur le baron he asked  without a doubt peter replied  it is beyond all measure charming of you guillot declared but let me ask you a little question is it peace or war  it is what you choose to make it peter answered  the man threw out his hands there was the shadow of a frown upon his pale forehead it was a matter for protest this  why do you come he demanded what have we in common the society has expelled me very well i go my own way why not i am free of your control today you have no more right to interfere with my schemes than i with yours  we have the ancient right of power peter said grimly you were once a prominent member of our organization the spoilt protege of madame a splendid maker if you will of criminal history those days have passed we offered you a pension which you have refused it is now our turn to speak we require you to leave this city in twentyfour hours  the face was livid with anger he was of the fair type of frenchman with deepset eyes and a straight cruel mouth only partly concealed by his golden mustache just now notwithstanding the veneer of his too perfect clothes and civilized air the beast had leaped out his face was like the face of a snarling animal  i refuse he cried it is i who refuse i am here on my own affairs what they may be is no business of yours or of any one elses that is my answer to you baron de grost whether you come to me for yourself or on behalf of the society to which i no longer belong that is my answerthat and the door he added pressing the bell if you will we fight if you are wise forget this visit as quickly as you can  peter took up his hat the manservant was already in the room  we shall probably meet again before your return monsieur guillot he remarked  guillot had recovered himself his smile was wicked but his bow perfection  to the fortunate hour monsieur le baron he replied  peter drove hack to berkeley square and without a moments hesitation pressed the levers which set to work the whole underground machinery of the great power which he controlled thenceforward monsieur guillot was surrounded with a vague army of silent watchers they passed in and out of his fiat their motor cars were as fast as his in the streets their fancy in restaurants identical with his guillot moved through it all like a man wholly unconscious of espionage showing nothing of the murderous anger which burned in his blood the reports came to peter every hour although there was indeed nothing worth chronicling monsieur guillots visit to london would seem indeed to be a visit of gallantry he spent most of his time with mademoiselle louise the famous dancer he was prominent at the empire to watch her nightly performance they were a noticeable couple supping together at the milan afterwards monsieur guillot was indeed a man of gallantry but he had the reputation of using these affairs to cloak his real purposes those who watched him watched only the more closely monsieur guillot who stood it very well at first unfortunately lost his temper he drove in the great motor car which he had brought with him from paris to berkeley square and confronted peter  my friend he exclaimed though indeed the glitter in his eyes knew nothing of friendship it is intolerable this do you think that i do not see through these dummy waiters these obsequious shopmen these ladies who drop their eyes when i pass these commissionaires these wouldbe acquaintances i tell you that they irritate me this incompetent futile crowd you pit them against me bah you should know better when i choose to disappear i shall disappear and no one will follow me when i strike i shall strike and no one will discover what my will may be you are out of date dear baron with your thirdrate army of stupid spies you succeed in one thing onlyyou succeed in making me angry  it is at least an achievement that peter declared  perhaps monsieur guillot admitted fiercely yet mark now the result i defy you you and all of them look at your clock it is five minutes to seven it goes well that clock eh  it is the correct time peter said  then by midnight guillot continued shaking his fist in the others face i shall have done that thing which brought me to england and i shall have disappeared i shall have done it in spite of your watchers in spite of your spies in spite even of you monsieur le baron de grost there is my challenge voila take it up if you will at midnight you shall hear me laugh i have the honor to wish you goodnight  peter opened the door with his own hands  this is excellent he declared you are now indeed the monsieur guillot of old almost you persuade me to take up your challenge  guillot laughed derisively  as you please he exclaimed by midnight tonight  the challenge of monsieur guillot was issued precisely at four minutes before seven on his departure peter spent the next halfhour studying certain notes and sending various telephone messages afterwards he changed his clothes at the usual time and sat down to a teteatete dinner with his wife three times during the course of the meal he was summoned to the telephone and from each call he returned more perplexed finally when the servants had left the room he took his chair around to his wifes side  violet he said you were asking me just now about the telephone you were quite right these were not ordinary messages which i have been receiving i am engaged in a little matter which i must confess perplexes me i want your advice perhaps your help  i am quite ready she answered smiling it is a long time since you gave me anything to do  you have heard of guillot  she reflected for a moment  you mean the wonderful frenchman she asked the head of the criminal department of the doublefour  the man who was at its head when it existed the criminal department as you know has all been done away with the doublefour has now no more concern with those who break the law save in those few instances where great issues demand it  but monsieur guillot still exists  he not only exists answered peter but he is here in london a rebel and a defiant one do you know who came to see me the other morning  she shook her head  sir john dory peter continued he came here with a request he begged for my help guillot is here committed to some enterprise which no one can wholly fathom dory has enough to do with other things as you can imagine just now besides i think he recognizes that monsieur guillot is rather a hard nut for the ordinary english detective to crack  and you she demanded breathlessly  i join forces with dory peter admitted sogrange agrees with me guillot was associated with the doublefour too long for us to have him make scandalous history either here or in paris  you have seen him  i have not only seen him but declared war against him  and he  guillot is defiant peter replied he has been here only this evening he mocks at me he swears that he will bring off this enterprise whatever it may be before midnight tonight and he has defied me to stop him  but you will she murmured softly  peter smiled the conviction in his wifes tone was a subtle compliment which he did not fail to appreciate  i have hopes he confessed and yet let me tell you this violet i have never been more puzzled ask yourself now what enterprise is there worthy of a man like guillot in which he could engage himself here in london between now and midnight any ordinary theft is beneath him the purloining of the crown jewels perhaps he might consider but i dont think that anything less in the way of robbery would bring him here he has his code and he is as vain as a peacock yet money is at the root of everything he does  how does he spend his time here violet asked  he has a handsome flat in shaftesbury avenue peter answered where he lives to all appearance the life of an idle man of fashion the whole of his spare time is spent with mademoiselle louise the danseuse at the empire you see it is halfpast eight now i have eleven men altogether at work and according to my last report he was dining with her in the grillroom at the milan they have just ordered their coffee ten minutes ago and the car is waiting outside to take mademoiselle to the empire guillots box is engaged there as usual if he proposes to occupy it he is leaving himself a very narrow margin of time to carry out any enterprise worth speaking of  violet was thoughtful for several moments then she crossed the room took up a copy of an illustrated paper and brought it across to peter he smiled as he glanced at the picture to which she pointed and the few lines underneath  it has struck you too then he exclaimed good you have answered me exactly as i hoped somehow i scarcely trusted myself i have both cars waiting outside we may need them you wont mind coming to the empire with me  mind she laughed i only hope i may be in at the finish  if the finish peter remarked is of the nature which i anticipate i shall take particularly good care that you are not  the curtain was rising upon the first act of the ballet as they entered the most popular musichall in london and were shown to the box which peter had engaged the house was fullcrowded in fact almost to excess they had scarcely taken their seats when a roar of applause announced the coming of mademoiselle louise she stood for a moment to receive her nightly ovation a slim beautiful creature looking out upon the great house with that faint bewitching smile at the corners of her lips which every photographer in europe had striven to reproduce then she moved away to the music an exquisite figure the personification of all that was alluring in her sex violet leaned forward to watch her movements as she plunged into the first dance peter was occupied looking around the house monsieur guillot was there sitting insolently forward in his box sleek and immaculate he even waved his hand and bowed as he met peters eye somehow or other his confidence had its effect peter began to feel vaguely troubled after all his plans were built upon a surmise it was so easy for him to be wrong no man would show his hand so openly unless he were sure of the game then his face cleared a little in the box adjoining guillots the figure of a solitary man was just visible a man who had leaned over to applaud louise but who was now sitting back in the shadows peter recognized him at once notwithstanding the obscurity this was so much to the good at any rate he took up his hat  for a quarter of an hour you will excuse me violet he said watch guillot if he leaves his place knock at the door of your own box and one of my men who is outside will come to you at once he will know where to find me  peter hurried away pausing for a moment in the promenade to scribble a line or two at the back of one of his own cards presently he knocked at the door of the box adjoining guillots and was instantly admitted violet continued her watch she remained alone until the curtain fell upon the first act of the ballet a few minutes later peter returned she knew at once that things were going well he sank into a chair by her side  i have messages every five minutes he whispered in her ear and i am venturing upon a bold stroke there is still something about the affair though which i cannot understand you are absolutely sure that guillot has not moved  violet pointed with her program across the house there he sits she remarked he left his chair as the curtain went down but he could scarcely have gone out of the box for he was back within ten seconds  peter looked steadily across at the opposite box guillot was sitting a little further back now as though he no longer courted observation something about his attitude puzzled the man who watched him with a sudden quick movement he caught up the glasses which stood by his wifes side the curtain was going up for the second act and guillot had turned his head peter held the glasses only for a moment to his eyes and then glanced down at the stage  my god he muttered the mans a genius violet the small motor is coming for you  he was out of the box in a single step violet looked after him looked down upon the stage and across at guillots box it was hard to understand  the curtain had scarcely rung up upon the second act of the ballet when a young lady who met from all the loungers and even from the doorkeeper himself the most respectful attention issued from the stagedoor at the empire and stepped into the large motor car which was waiting drawn up against the curb the door was opened from inside and closed at once she held out her hands as yet ungloved to the man who sat back in the corner  at last she murmured and i thought indeed that you had forsaken me  he took her hands and held them tightly but he answered only in a whisper he wore a sombre black cloak and a broadbrimmed black hat a muffler concealed the lower part of his face she put her finger upon the electric light but he stopped her  i must not be recognized he said thickly forgive me louise if i seem strange at first but there is more in it than i can tell you no one must know that i am in london tonight when we reach this place to which you are taking me and we are really alone then we can talk i have so much to say  she looked at him doubtfully it was indeed a moment of indecision with her then she began to laugh softly  dear one but you have changed she exclaimed compassionately after all why not i must not forget that things have gone so hardly with you it seems odd indeed to see you sitting there muffled up like an old man afraid to show yourself you know how foolish you are with your black cape and that queer hat you are so different from all the others if you seek to remain unrecognized why do you not dress as all the men do any one who was suspicious would recognize you from your clothes  it is true he muttered i did not think of it  she leaned towards him  you will not even kiss me she murmured  not yet he answered  she made a little grimace  but you are cold  you do not understand he answered they are watching meeven tonight they are watching me oh if you only knew louise how i have longed for this hour that is to come  her vanity was assuaged she patted his hand but came no nearer  you are a foolish man she said very foolish  it is not for you to say that he replied if i have been foolish were not you often the cause of my folly again she laughed  oh la la it is always the same it is always you men who accuse for that presently i shall reprove you but nowas for now behold we have arrived  it is a crowded thoroughfare the man remarked nervously looking up and down shaftesbury avenue  stupid she cried stepping out i do not recognize you tonight little one even your voice is different follow me quickly across the pavement and up the stairs there is only one flight the flat i have borrowed is on the second floor i do not care very much that people should recognize me either under the circumstances there is nothing they love so much she added with a toss of the head as finding an excuse to have my picture in the paper  he followed her down the dim hall and up the broad flat stairs keeping always some distance behind on the first landing she drew a key from her pocket and opened a door it was the door of monsieur guillots sittingroom a round table in the middle was laid for supper one light alone and that heavily shaded was burning  oh la la she exclaimed how i hate this darkness wait till i can turn on the lights dear friend and then you must embrace me it is from outside i believe no do not follow i can find the switch for myself remain where you are i return instantly  she left him alone in the room closing the door softly in the passage she reeled for a moment and caught at her side she was very pale guillot coming swiftly up the steps frowned as he saw her  he is there he demanded harshly  he is there louise replied but indeed i am angry with myself see i am faint it is a terrible thing this which i have done he did me no harm that young man except that he was stupid and heavy and that i never loved him who could love him indeed but guillot  he passed on scarcely heeding her words but she clung to his arm  dear one she begged promise that you will not really hurt him promise me that or i will shriek out and call the people from the streets here you would not make an assassin of me promise  guillot turned suddenly towards her and there were strange things in his face he pointed down the stairs  go back louise he ordered back to your rooms for your own sake remember that you have left the theatre too ill to finish your performance you have had plenty of time already to get home quick leave me to deal with this young man i tell you to go  she retreated down the stairs dumb her knees shaking with fear guillot entered the room closing the door behind him even as he bowed to that dark figure standing in the corner his left hand shot forward the bolt  monsieur he said  what is the meaning of this the visitor interrupted haughtily i am expecting mademoiselle louise i did not understand that strangers had the right of entry into this room  guillot bowed low  monsieur he said once more it is a matter for my eternal regret that i am forced to intrude even for a moment upon an assignation so romantic but there is a little matter which must first be settled i have some friends here who have a thing to say to you  he walked softly with catlike tread along by the wall to where the thick curtains shut out the inner apartment he caught at the thick velvet dragged it back and the two rooms were suddenly flooded with light in the recently discovered one two stalwartlooking men in plain clothes but of very unmistakable appearance were standing waiting guillot staggered back they were strangers to him he was like a man who looks upon a nightmare his eyes protruded the words which he tried to utter failed him then with a swift nervous presentiment he turned quickly around towards the man who had been standing in the shadows here too the unexpected had happened it was peter baron de grost who threw his muffler and broadbrimmed hat upon the table  five minutes to eleven i believe monsieur guillot peter declared i win by an hour and five minutes  guillot said nothing for several seconds after all though he had great gifts he recovered alike his power of speech and his composure  these gentlemen he said pointing with his left hand towards the inner roomi do not understand their presence in my apartments  peter shrugged his shoulders  they represent i am afraid the obvious end of things he explained you have given me a run for my money i confess a monsieur guillot who is remarkably like you still occupies your box at the empire and mademoiselle jeanne lemere the accomplished understudy of the lady who has just left us is sufficiently like the incomparable louise to escape perhaps detection for the first few minutes but you gave the game away a little my dear guillot when you allowed your quarry to come and gaze even from the shadows of his box at the woman he adored  where ishe guillot faltered  he is on his way back to his country home peter replied i think that he will be cured of his infatuation for mademoiselle the assassins whom you planted in that room are by this time in bow street the price which others beside you knew my dear guillot was placed upon that unfortunate young head will not pass this time into your pocket for the rest  the rest is of no consequence guillot interrupted bowing i admit that i am vanquished as for those gentlemen there he added waving his hand towards the two men who had taken a step forward i have a little oath which is sacred to me concerning them i take the liberty therefore to admit myself defeated monsieur le baron and to take my leave  no one was quick enough to interfere they had only a glimpse of him as he stood there with the revolver pressed to his temple an impression of a sharp report of guillot staggering back as the revolver slipped from his fingers on to the floor even his death cry was stifled they carried him away without any fuss and peter was just in time after all to see the finish of the second act of the ballet the sham monsieur guillot still smirked at the sham louise but the box by his side was empty  it is over violet asked breathlessly  it is over peter answered  it was after all an unrecorded tragedy in an obscure corner of the morning papers one learned the next day that a frenchman who had apparently come to the end of his means had committed suicide in a furnished flat of shaftesbury avenue two foreigners were deported without having been brought up for trial for being suspected persons a little languid interest was aroused at the inquest when one of the witnesses deposed to the deceaseds having been a famous french criminal nothing further transpired however and the readers of the halfpenny press for once were deprived of their sensation for the rest peter received with much satisfaction a remarkably handsome signet ring bearing some famous arms and a telegram from sogrange well done baron may the successful termination of your enterprise nerve you for the greater undertaking which is close at hand i leave for london by the night train sogrange    chapter ix the ghosts of havana harbor   we may now sogrange remarked buttoning up his ulster and stretching himself out to the full extent of his steamer chair consider ourselves at sea i trust my friend that you are feeling quite comfortable  peter lying at his ease upon a neighboring chair with a pillow behind his head a huge fur coat around his body and a rug over his feet had all the appearance of being very comfortable indeed his reply however was a little shortalmost peevish  i am comfortable enough for the present thank you heaven knows how long it will last  sogrange waved his arms towards the great uneasy plain of blue sea the showers of foam leaping into the sunlight away beyond the disappearing coast of france  last he repeated for eight days i hope consider my dear baron what could be more refreshing more stimulating to our jaded nerves than this think of the december fogs you have left behind the cold driving rain the puddles in the street the gray skieslondon in short at her ugliest and worst  that is all very well peter protested but i have left several other things behind too  as for instance sogrange inquired genially  my wife peter informed him violet objects very much to these abrupt separations this week too i was shooting at saxthorpe and i had also several other engagements of a pleasant nature besides i have reached that age when i find it disconcerting to be called out of bed in the middle of the night to answer a long distance telephone call and told to embark on a white star liner leaving liverpool early the next morning it may be your idea of a pleasure trip it isnt mine  sogrange was amused his smile however was hidden only the tip of his cigarette was visible  anything else  nothing much except that i am always seasick peter replied deliberately i can feel it coming on now i wish that fellow would keep away with his beastly mutton broth the whole ship seems to smell of it  sogrange laughed softly but without disguise  who said anything about a pleasure trip he demanded  peter turned his head  you did you told me when you came on at cherbourg that you had to go to new york to look after some property there that things were very quiet in london and that you hated traveling alone therefore you sent for me at a few hours notice  is that what i told you sogrange murmured  yes wasnt it true peter asked suddenly alert  not a word of it sogrange admitted it is quite amazing that you should have believed it for a moment  i was a fool peter confessed you see i was tired and a little cross besides somehow or other i never associated a trip to america with  sogrange interrupted him quietly but ruthlessly  lift up the label attached to the chair next to yours read it out to me  peter took it into his hand and turned it over a quick exclamation escaped him  great heavens the count von hernbernadine  just so sogrange assented nice clear writing isnt it  peter sat bolt upright in his chair  do you mean to say that bernadine is on board sogrange shook his head  by the exercise my dear baron he said of a superlative amount of ingenuity i was able to prevent that misfortune now lean over and read the label on the next chair  peter obeyed his manner had acquired a new briskness la duchesse della nermino he announced  sogrange nodded  everything just as it should be he declared change those labels my friend as quickly as you can  peters fingers were nimble and the thing was done in a few seconds  so i am to sit next the spanish lady he remarked feeling for his tie  not only that but you are to make friends with her sogrange replied you are to be your captivating self baron the duchesse is to forget her weakness for hot rooms she is to develop a taste for sea air and your society  is she peter asked anxiously old or young  sogrange showed a disposition to fence with the question not old he answered certainly not old fifteen years ago she was considered to be one of the most beautiful women in the world  the ladies of spain peter remarked with a sigh are inclined to mature early  in some cases sogrange assured him there are no women in the world who preserve their good looks longer you shall judge my friend madame comes how about that seasickness now  gone peter declared briskly absolutely a fancy of mine never felt better in my life  an imposing little procession approached along the deck there was the deck steward leading the way a very smart french maid carrying a wonderful collection of wraps cushions and books a blackbrowed pallid manservant holding a hot water bottle in his hand and leading a tiny pekinese spaniel wrapped in a sealskin coat and finally madame la duchesse it was so obviously a procession intended to impress that neither peter nor sogrange thought it worth while to conceal their interest  the duchesse save that she was tall and wrapped in magnificent furs presented a somewhat mysterious appearance her features were entirely obscured by an unusually thick veil of black lace and the voluminous nature of her outer garments only permitted a suspicion as to her figure which was at that time at once the despair and the triumph of her corsetiere with both hands she was holding her furlined skirts from contact with the deck disclosing at the same time remarkably shapely feet encased in trim patent shoes with plain silver buckles and a little more black silk stocking than seemed absolutely necessary the deck steward after a halfpuzzled scrutiny of the labels let down the chair next to the two men the duchesse contemplated her prospective neighbors with some curiosity mingled with a certain amount of hesitation it was at that moment that sogrange shaking away his rug rose to his feet  madame la duchesse permits me to remind her of my existence he said bowing low it is some years since we met but i had the honor of a dance at the palace in madrid  she held out her hand at once yet somehow peter felt sure that she was thankful for her veil her voice was pleasant and her air the air of a great lady she spoke french with the soft sibilant intonation of the spaniard  i remember the occasion perfectly marquis she admitted your sister and i once shared a villa in mentone  i am flattered by your recollection duchesse sogrange murmured  it is a great surprise to meet with you here though she continued i did not see you at cherbourg or on the train  i motored from paris sogrange explained and arrived contrary to my custom i must confess somewhat early will you permit that i introduce an acquaintance whom i have been fortunate enough to find on boardmonsieur le baron de grostmadame la duchesse della nermino  peter was graciously received and the conversation dealt for a few moments with the usual banalities of the voyage then followed the business of settling the duchesse in her place when she was really installed and surrounded with all the paraphernalia of a great and fanciful lady including a handful of long cigarettes she raised for the first time her veil peter who was at the moment engaged in conversation with her was a little shocked by the result her features were worn her face deadwhite with many signs of the ravages wrought by the constant use of cosmetics only her eyes had retained something of their former splendor these latter were almost violet in color deepset with dark rims and were sufficient almost in themselves to make one forget for a moment the less prepossessing details of her appearance a small library of books was by her side but after a while she no longer pretended any interest in them she was a born conversationalist a creature of her country entirely and absolutely feminine to whom the subtle and flattering deference of the other sex was the breath of life itself peter burned his homage upon her altar with a craft which amounted to genius in less than half an hour madame la duchesse was looking many years younger the vague look of apprehension had passed from her face their voices had sunk to a confidential undertone punctuated often by the music of her laughter sogrange with a murmured word of apology had slipped away long ago decidedly for an englishman peter was something of a marvel  madame la duchesse moved her head towards the empty chair  he is a great friend of yoursthe marquis de sogrange she asked with a certain inflection in her tone which peter was not slow to notice  indeed no he answered a few years ago i was frequently in paris i made his acquaintance then but we have met very seldom since  you are not traveling together then  by no means i recognized him only as he boarded the steamer at cherbourg  he is not a popular man in our world she remarked one speaks of him as a schemer  is there anything left to scheme for in france peter asked carelessly he is perhaps a monarchist  his ancestry alone would compel a devoted allegiance to royalism the duchesse declared but i do not think that he is interested in any of these futile plots to reinstate the house of orleans i monsieur le baron am spanish  i have scarcely lived so far out of the world as to have heard nothing of the duchesse della nermino peter replied with empressement the last time i saw you duchesse you were in the suite of the infanta  like all englishmen i see you possess a memory she said smiling  duchesse peter answered lowering his voice without the memories which one is fortunate enough to collect as one passes along life would be a dreary place the most beautiful things in the world cannot remain always with us it is well then that the shadow of them can be recalled to us in the shape of dreams  her eyes rewarded him for his gallantry peter felt that he was doing very well indeed he indulged himself in a brief silence presently she returned to the subject of sogrange  i think she remarked that of all the men in the world i expected least to see the marquis de sogrange on board a steamer bound for new york what can a man of his type find to amuse him in the new world  one wonders indeed peter assented as a matter of fact i did read in a newspaper a few days ago that he was going to mexico in connection with some excavations there he spoke to me of it just now they seem to have discovered a ruined temple of the incas or something of the sort  the duchesse breathed what sounded very much like a sigh of relief  i had forgotten she admitted that new york itself need not necessarily be his destination  for my own part peter continued it is quite amazing the interest which the evening papers always take in the movements of one connected ever so slightly with their world i think that a dozen newspapers have told their readers the exact amount of money i am going to lend or borrow in new york the stocks i am going to bull or bear the mines i am going to purchase my presence on an american steamer is accounted for by the journalists a dozen times over yours duchesse if one might say so without appearing over curious seems the most inexplicable what attraction can america possibly have for you  she glanced at him covertly from under her sleepy eyelids peters face was like the face of a child  you do not perhaps know she said that i was born in cuba i lived there in fact for many years i still have estates in the country  indeed he answered are you interested then in this reported salvage of the maine  there was a short silence peter who had not been looking at her when he had asked his question turned his head surprised at her lack of response his heart gave a little jump the duchesse had all the appearance of a woman on the point of fainting one hand was holding a scent bottle to her nose the other thin and white ablaze with emeralds and diamonds was gripping the side of her chair her expression was one of blank terror peter felt a shiver chill his own blood at the things he saw in her face he himself was confused apologetic yet absolutely without understanding his thoughts reverted at first to his own commonplace malady  you are ill duchesse he exclaimed you will allow me to call the deck steward or perhaps you would prefer your own maid i have some brandy in this flask  he had thrown off his rug but her imperious gesture kept him seated she was looking at him with an intentness which was almost tragical  what made you ask me that question she demanded  his innocence was entirely apparent not even peter could have dissembled so naturally  that question he repeated vaguely you mean about the maine it was the idlest chance duchesse i assure you i saw something about it in the paper yesterday and it seemed interesting but if i had had the slightest idea that the subject was distasteful to you i would not have dreamed of mentioning it even nowi do not understand  she interrupted him all the time he had been speaking she had shown signs of recovery she was smiling now faintly and with obvious effort but still smiling  it is altogether my own fault baron she admitted graciously please forgive my little fit of emotion the subject is a very sore one among my countrypeople and your sudden mention of it upset me it was very foolish  duchesse i was a clumsy idiot peter declared penitently i deserve that you should be unkind to me for the rest of the voyage  i could not afford that she answered forcing another smile i am relying too much upon you for companionship ah could i trouble you she added for the moment i need my maid she passes there  peter sprang up and called the young woman who was slowly pacing the deck he himself did not at once return to his place he went instead in search of sogrange and found him in his stateroom sogrange was lying upon a couch in a silk smoking suit with a french novel in his hand and an air of contentment which was almost fatuous he laid down the volume at peters entrance  dear baron he murmured why this haste no one is ever in a hurry upon a steamer remember that we cant possibly get anywhere in less than eight days and there is no task in the world nowadays which cannot be accomplished in that time to hurry is a needless waste of tissue and to a person of my nervous temperament exceedingly unpleasant  peter sat down on the edge of the bunk  i presume you have quite finished he said if so listen to me i am moving in the dark is it my fault that i blunder by the merest accident i have already committed a hideous faux pas you ought to have warned me  what do you mean  i have spoken to the duchesse of the maine disaster  the eyes of sogrange gleamed for a moment but he lay perfectly still  why not he asked a good many people are talking about it it is one of the strangest things i have ever heard of that after all these years they should be trying to salve the wreck  it seems worse than strange peter declared what can be the use of trying to stir up bitter feelings between two nations who have fought their battles and buried the hatchet i call it an act of insanity  a bugle rang sogrange yawned and sat up  would you mind touching the bell for my servant baron he asked dinner will be served in half an hour afterwards we will talk you and i  peter turned away not wholly pleased  the sooner the better he grumbled or i shall be putting my foot into it again  after dinner the two men walked on deck together the night was dark but fine with a strong wind blowing from the northwest the deck steward called their attention to a long line of lights stealing up from the horizon on their starboard side  thats the lusitania sir shell be up to us in half an hour  they leaned over the rail soon the blue fires began to play about their mast head sogrange watched them thoughtfully  if one could only read those messages he remarked with a sigh it might help us  peter knocked the ash from his cigar and was silent for a time he was beginning to understand the situation  my friend he said at last i have been doing you an injustice i have come to the conclusion that you are not keeping me in ignorance of the vital facts connected with our visit to america willfully at the present moment you know just a little more but a very little more than i do  what perception sogrange murmured my dear baron sometimes you amaze me you are absolutely right i have some pieces and i am convinced that they would form a puzzle the solution of which would be interesting to us but how or where they fit in i frankly dont know you have the facts so far  certainly peter replied  you have heard of sirdeller  you mean the sirdeller peter asked  naturally i mean the man whose very movements sway the money markets of the world the man who could if he chose ruin any nation make war impossible who could if he had ten more years of life and was allowed to live draw to himself and his own following the entire wealth of the universe  very eloquent peter remarked well take the rest for granted  then sogrange continued you have probably also heard of don pedro prince of marsine one time pretender to the throne of spain  quite a striking figure in european politics peter assented quickly he is suspected of radical proclivities and is still it is rumored an active plotter against the existing monarchy  very well sogrange said now listen carefully four months ago sirdeller was living at the golden villa near nice he was visited more than once by marsine introduced by the count von hern the result of those visits was a long series of cablegrams to certain great engineering firms in america almost immediately the salvage of the maine was started it is a matter of common report that the entire cost of these works is being undertaken by sirdeller  now peter murmured you are really beginning to interest me  this week sogrange went on it is expected that the result of the salvage works will be made known that is to say it is highly possible that the question of whether the maine was blown up from outside or inside will be settled once and for all this week mind baron now see what happens sirdeller returns to america the count von hern and prince marsine come to america the duchesse della nermino comes to america the duchesse sirdeller and marsine are upon this steamer the count von hern travels by the lusitania only because it was reported that sirdeller at the last minute changed his mind and was traveling by that boat mix these things up in your brainthe conjurers hat let us call it sogrange concluded laying his hand upon peters arm sirdeller the duchesse von hern marsine the raising of the mainemix them up and what sort of an omelette appears  peter whistled softly  no wonder he said that you couldnt make the pieces of the puzzle fit tell me more about the duchesse  sogrange considered for a moment  the principal thing about her which links her with the present situation he explained is that she was living in cuba at the time of the maine disaster married to a rich cuban  the affair was suddenly illuminated by the searchlight of romance peter for the first time saw not the light but the possibility of it  marsine has been living in germany has he not he asked  he is a personal friend of the kaiser sogrange replied  they both looked up and listened to the crackling of the electricity above their heads  i expect bernadine is a little annoyed peter remarked  it isnt pleasant to be out of the party sogrange agreed nearly everybody however believed at the last moment that sirdeller had transferred his passage to the lusitania  its going to cost him an awful lot in marconigrams peter said by the bye wouldnt it have been better for us to have traveled separately and incognito  sogrange shrugged his shoulders slightly  von hern has at least one man on board he replied i do not think that we could possibly have escaped observation besides i rather imagine that any move we are able to make in this matter must come before we reach fire island  have you any theory at all peter asked  not the ghost of a one sogrange admitted one more fact though i forgot to mention you may find it important the duchesse comes entirely against von herns wishes they have been on intimate terms for years but for some reason or other he was exceedingly anxious that she should not take this voyage she on the other hand seemed to have some equally strong reason for coming the most useful piece of advice i could give you would be to cultivate her acquaintance  the duchesse  peter never finished his sentence his companion drew him suddenly back into the shadow of a lifeboat  look  a door had opened from lower down the deck and a curious little procession was coming towards them a man burly and broadshouldered who had the air of a professional bully walked by himself ahead two others of similar build walked a few steps behind and between them a thin insignificant figure wrapped in an immense fur coat and using a strong walking stick came slowly along the deck it was like a procession of prison warders guarding a murderer or perhaps a nerveracked royal personage moving the end of his days in the midst of enemies with halting steps the little old man came shambling along he looked neither to the left nor to the right his eyes were fixed and yet unseeing his features were pale and bony there was no gleam of life not even in the stonecold eyes like some machinemade man of a new and physically degenerate age he took his exercise under the eye of his doctor a strange and miserablelooking object  there goes sirdeller sogrange whispered look at himthe man whose might is greater than any emperors there is no haven in the universe to which he does not hold the key look at himmaster of the world  peter shivered there was something depressing in the sight of that mournful procession  he neither smokes nor drinks sogrange continued women as a sex do not exist for him his religion is a doubting calvinism he has a doctor and a clergyman always by his side to inject life and hope if they can look at him well my friend he represents a great moral lesson  thanks peter replied i am going to take the taste of him out of my mouth with a whiskey and soda afterwards im for the duchesse  but the duchesse apparently was not for peter he found her in the musicroom with several of the little marconi missives spread out before her and she cut him dead peter however was a brave man and skilled at the game of bluff so he stopped by her side and without any preamble addressed her  duchesse he said you are a woman of perceptions which do you believe then in your heart to be the more trustworthythe count von hern or i  she simply stared at him he continued promptly  you have received your warning i see  from whom  from the count von hern why believe what he says he may be a friend of yourshe may be a dear friendbut in your heart you know that he is both unscrupulous and selfish why accept his word and distrust me i at least am honest  she raised her eyebrows  honest she repeated whose word have i for that save your own and what concern is it of mine if you possess every one of the bourgeois qualities in the world you are presuming sir  my friend sogrange will tell you that i am to be trusted peter persisted  i see no reason why i should trouble myself about your personal characteristics she replied coldly they do not interest me  on the contrary duchesse peter continued fencing wildly you have never in your life been more in need of any ones services than you are of mine  the conflict was uneven the duchesse was a nervous highly strung woman the calm assurance of peters manner oppressed her with a sense of his mastery she sank back upon the couch from which she had arisen  i wish you would tell me what you mean she said you have no right to talk to me in this fashion what have you to do with my affairs  i have as much to do with them as the count von hem peter insisted boldly  i have known the count von hern she answered for very many years you have been a shipboard acquaintance of mine for a few hours  if you have known the count von hern for many years peter asserted you have found out by this time that he is an absolutely untrustworthy person  supposing he is she said will you tell me what concern it is of yours do you suppose for one moment that i am likely to discuss my private affairs with a perfect stranger  you have no private affairs peter declared sternly they are the affairs of a nation  she glanced at him with a little shiver  from that moment he felt that he was gaining ground she looked around the room it was still filled but in their corner they were almost unobserved  how much do you know she asked in a low tone which shook with passion  peter smiled enigmatically  perhaps more even than you duchesse he replied i should like to be your friend you need oneyou know that  she rose abruptly to her feet  for tonight it is enough she declared wrapping her fur cloak around her you may talk to me tomorrow baron i must think if you desire really to be my friend there is perhaps one service which i may require of you but tonight no  peter stood aside and allowed her to step past him he was perfectly content with the progress he had made her farewell salute was by no means ungracious as soon as she was out of sight he returned to the couch where she had been sitting she had taken away the marconigrams but she had left upon the floor several copies of the new york herald he took them up and read them carefully through the last one he found particularly interesting so much so that he folded it up placed it in his coat pocket and went off to look for sogrange whom he found at last in the saloon watching a noisy game of up jenkins peter sank upon the cushioned seat by his side  you were right he remarked bernadine has been busy  sogrange smiled  i trust he said that the duchesse is not proving faithless  so far peter replied i have kept my end up tomorrow will be the test bernadine had filled her with caution she thinks that i know everythingwhatever everything may be unless i can discover a little more than i do now tomorrow is going to be an exceedingly awkward day for me  there is every prospect of your acquiring a great deal of valuable information before then sogrange declared sit tight my friend something is going to happen  on the threshold of the saloon ushered in by one of the stewards a tall powerfullooking man with a square welltrimmed black beard was standing looking around as though in search of some one the steward pointed out with an unmistakable movement of his head peter and sogrange the man approached and took the next table  steward he directed bring me a glass of vermouth and some dominoes  peters eyes were suddenly bright sogrange touched his foot under the table and whispered a word of warning the dominoes were brought the newcomer arranged them as though for a game then he calmly withdrew the doublefour and laid it before sogrange  it has been my misfortune marquis he said never to have made your acquaintance although our mutual friends are many and i think i may say that i have the right to claim a certain amount of consideration from you and your associates you know me  certainly prince sogrange replied i am charmed permit me to present my friend the baron de grost  the newcomer bowed and glanced a little nervously around  you will permit me he begged i travel incognito i have lived so long in england that i have permitted myself the name of an englishman i am traveling under the name of mr james fanshawe  mr fanshawe by all means sogrange agreed in the meantime  i claim my rights as a corresponding member of the doublefour the newcomer declared my friend the count von hern finds menace to certain plans of ours in your presence upon this steamer unknown to him i come to you openly i claim your aid not your enmity  let us understand one another clearly sogrange said you claim our aid in what  mr fanshawe glanced around the saloon and lowered his voice  i claim your aid towards the overthrowing of the usurping house of brangaza and the restoration to power in spain of my own line  sogrange was silent for several moments peter was leaning forward in his place deeply interested decidedly this american trip seemed destined to lead towards events  our active aid towards such an end sogrange said at last is impossible the society of the doublefour does not interfere in the domestic policy of other nations for the sake of individual members  then let me ask you why i find you upon this steamer mr fanshawe demanded in a tone of suppressed excitement is it for the sea voyage that you and your friend the baron de grost cross the atlantic this particular week on the same steamer as myself as mr sirdeller andand the duchesse one does not believe in such coincidences one is driven to conclude that it is your intention to interfere  the affair almost demands our interference sogrange replied smoothly with every due respect to you prince there are great interests involved in this move of yours  the prince was a big man but for all his large features and bearded face his expression was the expression of a peevish and passionate child he controlled himself with an effort  marquis he said this is necessaryi say that it is necessary that we conclude an alliance  sogrange nodded approvingly  it is well spoken he said but rememberthe baron de grost represents england and the english interests of our society  the prince of marsines face was not pleasant to look upon  forgive me if you are an englishman by birth baron he said turning towards him but a more interfering nation in other peoples affairs than england has never existed in the pages of history she must have a finger in every pie bah  peter leaned over from his place  what about germanymr fanshawe he asked with emphasis  the prince tugged at his beard he was a little nonplussed  the count von hern he confessed has been a good friend to me the rulers of his country have always been hospitable and favorably inclined towards my family the whole affair is of his design i myself could scarcely have moved in it alone one must reward ones helpers there is no reason however he added with a meaning glance at peter why other helpers should not be admitted  the reward which you offer to the count von hern peter remarked is of itself absolutely inimical to the interests of my country  listen the prince demanded tapping the table before him it is true that within a year i am pledged to reward the count von hern in certain fashion it is not possible that you know the terms of our compact but from your words it is possible that you have guessed very well accept this from me remain neutral now allow this matter to proceed to its natural conclusion let your government address representations to me when the time comes adopting a bold front and i promise that i will obey them it will not be my fault that i am compelled to disappoint the count von hern my seaboard would be at the mercy of your fleet superior force must be obeyed  it is a matter this sogrange said for discussion between my friend and me i think that you will find that we are neither of us unreasonable in short prince i see no insuperable reason why we should not come to terms  you encourage me the prince declared in a gratified tone do not believe marquis that i am actuated in this matter wholly by motives of personal ambition no it is not so a great desire has burned always in my heart but it is not that alone which moves me i assure you that of my certain knowledge spain is honeycombedis rotten with treason a revolution is a certainty how much better that that revolution should be conducted in a dignified manner that i with my reputation for democracy which i have carefully kept before the eyes of my people should be elected president of the new spanish republic even if it is the gold of the american which places me there in a year or two what may happen who can say this craving for a republic is but a passing dream spain at heart is monarchial she will be led back to the light it is but a short step from the presidents chair to the throne  sogrange and his companion sat quite still they avoided looking at each other  there is one thing more the prince continued dropping his voice as if even at that distance he feared the man of whom he spoke i shall not inform the count von hern of our conversation it is not necessary and between ourselves the count is jealous he sends me message after message that i remain in my stateroom that i seek no interview with sirdeller that i watch only he is too much of the spythe count von hern he does not understand that code of honor relying upon which i open my heart to you  you have done your cause no harm sogrange assured him with subtle sarcasm we come now to the duchesse  the prince leaned towards him it was just at this moment that a steward entered with a marconigram which he presented to the prince the latter tore it open glanced it through and gave vent to a little exclamation the fingers which held the missive trembled his eyes blazed with excitement he was absolutely unable to control his feelings  my two friends he cried in a tone broken with emotion it is you first who shall hear the news this message has just arrived sirdeller will have received its duplicate the final report of the works in havana harbor will await us on our arrival in new york but the substance of it is this the maine was sunk by a torpedo discharged at close quarters underneath her magazine gentlemen the house of brangaza is ruined  there was a breathless silence  your information is genuine sogrange asked softly  without a doubt the prince replied i have been expecting this message i shall cable to von hern we are still in communication he may not have heard  we were about to speak of the duchesse peter reminded him  the prince shook his head  another time he declared another time  he hurried away it was already half past ten and the saloon was almost empty the steward came up to them  the saloon is being closed for the night sir he announced  let us go on deck peter suggested  they found their way up on to the windward side of the promenade which was absolutely deserted far away in front of them now were the disappearing lights of the lusitania the wind roared by as the great steamer rose and fell on the black stretch of waters peter stood very near to his companion  listen sogrange he said the affair is clear now save for one thing  you mean sirdellers motives  not at all peter answered an hour ago i came across the explanation of these the one thing i will tell you afterwards now listen sirdeller came abroad last year for twelve months travel he took a great house in san sebastian  where did you hear this sogrange asked  i read the story in the new york herald peter continued it is grossly exaggerated of course but this is the substance of it sirdeller and his suite were stopped upon the spanish frontier and treated in an abominable fashion by the customs officers he was forced to pay a very large sum unjustly i should think he paid under protest appealed to the authorities with no result at san sebastian he was robbed right and left his privacy intruded upon in short he took a violent dislike and hatred to the country and every one concerned in it he moved with his entire suite to nice to the golden villa there he expressed himself freely concerning spain and her government count von hern heard of it and presented marsine the plot was without doubt bernadines cant you imagine how he would put it a revolution he would tell sirdeller is imminent in spain here is the new president of the republic money is no more to you than water you are a patriotic american have you forgotten that a warship of your country with six hundred of her devoted citizens was sent to the bottom by the treachery of one of this effete race the war was an inefficient revenge the country still flourishes it is for you to avenge america with money marsine can establish a republic in spain within twentyfour hours sirdeller hesitates he would point out that it had never been proved that the destruction of the maine was really due to spanish treachery it is the idea of a business man which followed he at his own expense would raise the maine if it were true that the explosion occurred from outside he would find the money you see the message has arrived after all these years the sea has given up its secret marsine will return to spain with an unlimited credit behind him the house of brangaza will crumble up like a pack of cards  sogrange looked out into the darkness perhaps he saw in that great black gulf the pictures of these happenings which his companion had prophesied perhaps for a moment he saw the panorama of a city in flames the passing of a great country under the thrall of these new ideas at any rate he turned abruptly away from the side of the vessel and taking peters arm walked slowly down the deck  you have solved the puzzle baron he said gravely now tell me the one thing your story seems to dovetail everywhere  the one thing peter said is connected with the duchesse it was she of her own will who decided to come to america i believe that but for her coming bernadine and the prince would have waited in their own country money can flash from america to england over the wires it does not need to be fetched they have still one fear it is connected with the duchesse let me think  they walked up and down the deck the lights were extinguished one by one except in the smokingroom a strange breed of sailors from the lower deck came up with mops and buckets the wind changed its quarter and the great ship began to roll peter stopped abruptly  i find this motion most unpleasant he said i am going to bed tonight i cannot think tomorrow i promise you we will solve this hush  he held out his hand and drew his companion back into the shadow of a lifeboat a tall figure was approaching them along the deck as he passed the little ray of light thrown out from the smokingroom the mans features were clearly visible it was the prince he was walking like one absorbed in thought his eyes were set like a sleepwalkers with one hand he gesticulated the fingers of the other were twitching all the time his head was lifted to the skies there was something in his face which redeemed it from its disfiguring petulance  it is the man who dreams of power peter whispered it is one of his best moments this he forgets the vulgar means by which he intends to rise he thinks only of himself the dictator king perhaps emperor he is of the breed of egoists  again and again the prince passed manifestly unconscious even of his whereabouts peter and sogrange crept away unseen to their staterooms  in many respects the room resembled a miniature court of justice the principal sittingroom of the royal suite which was the chief glory of the adriatic had been stripped of every superfluous article of furniture or embellishment curtains had been removed all evidences of luxury disposed of temporarily the apartment had been transformed into a bare cheerless place seated on a high chair with his back to the wall was sirdeller at his right hand was a small table on which stood a glass of milk a phial a stethoscope behind his doctor at his left hand a smoothfaced silent young manhis secretary before him stood the duchesse peter and sogrange guarding the door was one of the watchmen who from his great physique might well have been a policeman out of livery sirdeller himself in the clear light which streamed through the large window seemed more aged and shrunken than ever his eyes were deep set no tinge of color was visible in his cheeks his chin protruded his shaggy gray eyebrows gave him an unkempt appearance he wore a black velvet gown a strangely cut black morning coat and trousers felt slippers and his hands were clasped upon a stout ash walkingstick he eyed the newcomers keenly but without expression  the lady may sit he said  he spoke almost in an undertone as though anxious to avoid the fatigue of words the guardian of the door placed a chair into which the duchesse subsided sirdeller held his right hand towards his doctor who felt his pulse all the time sirdeller watched him his lips a little parted a world of hungry excitement in his eyes the doctor closed his watch with a snap and whispered something in sirdellers ear apparently reassuring  i will hear this story sirdeller announced in two minutes every one must leave if it takes longer it must remain unfinished  peter spoke up briskly  the story is this he began you have promised to assist the prince of marsine to transform spain into a republic providing the salvage operations on the maine prove that that ship was destroyed from outside the salvage operations have been conducted at your expense and finished it has been proved that the maine was destroyed by a mine or torpedo from the outside therefore on the assumption that it was the treacherous deed of a spaniard or cuban imagining himself to be a patriot you are prepared to carry out your undertaking and supply the prince of marsine with means to overthrow the kingdom of spain  peter paused the figure on the chair remained motionless no flicker of intelligence or interest disturbed the calm of his features it was a silence almost unnatural i have brought the duchesse here peter continued to tell you the truth as to the maine disaster  not even then was there the slightest alteration in those ashen gray features the duchesse looked up she had the air of one only too eager to speak and finish  in those days she said i was the wife of a rich cuban gentleman whose name i withhold the american officers on board the maine used to visit at our house my husband was jealous perhaps he had cause  the duchesse paused even though the light of tragedy and romance side by side seemed suddenly to creep into the room sirdeller listened as one come back from a dead world  one night the duchesse went on my husbands suspicions were changed into knowledge he came home unexpectedly the americanthe officeri loved himhe was there on the balcony with me my husband said nothing the officer returned to the ship that night my husband came into my room he bent over my bed it is not you he whispered whom i shall destroy for the pain of death is short anguish of mind may live tonight six hundred ghosts may hang about your pillow  her voice broke there was something grim and unnatural in that curious stillness even the secretary was at last breathing a little faster the watchman at the door was leaning forward sirdeller simply moved his hand to the doctor who held up his finger while he felt the pulse the beat of his watch seemed to sound through the unnatural silence in a minute he spoke  the lady may proceed he announced  my husband the duchesse continued was an officer in charge of the mines and ordnance department he went out that night in a small boat after a visit to the strong house no soul has ever seen or heard of him since or his boat it is only i who know  her voice died away sirdeller stretched out his hand and very deliberately drank a tablespoonful or two of his milk  i believe the ladys story he declared the marsine affair is finished let no one be admitted to have speech with me again upon this subject  he had half turned towards his secretary the young man bowed the doctor pointed towards the door the duchesse peter and sogrange filed slowly out in the bright sunlight the duchesse burst into a peal of hysterical laughter even peter felt for a moment unnerved suddenly he too laughed  i think he said that you and i had better get out of the way sogrange when the count von hern meets us at new york    chapter x the affair or an alien society   sogrange and peter baron de grost standing upon the threshold of their hotel gazed out upon new york and liked the look of it they had landed from the steamer a few hours before had already enjoyed the luxury of a bath a visit to an american barbers and a genuine cocktail  i see no reason sogrange declared why we should not take a weeks holiday  peter glancing up into the blue sky and down into the faces of the welldressed and beautiful women who were streaming up fifth avenue was wholly of the same mind  if we return by this afternoons steamer he remarked we shall have bernadine for a fellow passenger bernadine is annoyed with us just now i must confess that i should feel more at my ease with a few thousand miles of the atlantic between us  let it be so sogrange assented we will explore this marvelous city never he added taking his companions arm did i expect to see such women save in my own the mistress of all cities so chic my dear baron and such a carriage we will lunch at one of the fashionable restaurants and drive in the park afterwards first of all however we must take a stroll along this wonderful fifth avenue  the two men spent a morning after their own hearts they lunched astonishingly well at sherrys and drove afterwards in central park when they returned to the hotel sogrange was in excellent spirits  i feel my friend he announced that we are going to have a very pleasant and in some respects a unique week to meet friends and acquaintances everywhere as one must do in every capital in europe is of course pleasant but there is a monotony about it from which one is glad sometimes to escape we lunch here and we promenade in the places frequented by those of a similar station to our own and behold we know no one we are lookers on perhaps for a long time it might gall for a brief period there is a restfulness about it which pleases me  i should have liked peter murmured an introduction to the lady in the blue hat  you are a gregarious animal sogrange declared you do not understand the pleasures of a little comparative isolation with an intellectual companion such as myself what the devil is the meaning of this  they had reached their sittingroom and upon a small round table stood a great collection of cards and notes sogrange took them up helplessly one after the other reading the names aloud and letting them fall through his fingers some were known to him some were not he began to open the notes in effect they were all the samewhat evening would the marquis de sogrange and his distinguished friend care to dine lunch yacht golf shoot go to the opera join a theatre party of what clubs would they care to become members what kind of hospitality would be most acceptable  sogrange sank into a chair  my friend he exclaimed they all have to be answeredthat collection there the visits have to be returned it is magnificent this hospitality but what can one do  peter looked at the pile of correspondence upon which sogranges inroad indeed seemed to have had but little effect  one could engage a secretary of course he suggested doubtfully but the visits our weeks holiday is gone  not at all sogrange replied i have an idea  the telephone bell rang peter took up the receiver and listened for a moment he turned to sogrange still holding it in his hand  you will be pleased also to hear he announced that there are half a dozen reporters downstairs waiting to interview transcribers note word missing  sogrange received the information with interest  have them sent up at once he directed every one of them  what all at the same time peter asked  all at the same time it must be sogrange answered give them to understand that it is an affair of five minutes only  they came trooping in sogrange welcomed them cordially  my friend the baron de grost he explained indicating peter i am the marquis de sogrange let us know what we can do to serve you  one of the men stepped forward  very glad to meet you marquis and you baron he said i wont bother you with any introductions but i and the company here represent the press of new york we should like some information for our papers as to the object of your visit here and the probable length of your stay  sogrange extended his hands  my dear friend he exclaimed the object of our visit was i thought already well known we are on our way to mexico we leave tonight my friend the baron is as you know a financier i too have a little money to invest we are going out to meet some business acquaintances with a view to inspecting some mining properties that is absolutely all i can tell you you can understand of course that fuller information would be impossible  why thats quite natural marquis the spokesman of the reporters replied we dont like the idea of your hustling out of new york like this though  sogrange glanced at the clock  it is unavoidable he declared we are relying upon you gentlemen to publish the fact because you will see he added pointing to the table that we have been the recipients of a great many civilities which it is impossible for us to acknowledge properly if it will give you any pleasure to see us upon our return you will be very welcome in the meantime you will understand our haste  there were a few more civilities and the representatives of the press took their departure peter looked at his companion doubtfully as sogrange returned from showing them out  i suppose this means that we have to catch todays steamer after all he remarked  not necessarily sogrange answered i have a plan we will leave for the southern depot wherever it may be afterwards you shall use that wonderful skill of yours of which i have heard so much to effect some slight change in our appearance we will then go to another hotel in another quarter of new york and take our weeks holiday incognito what do you think of that for an idea  not much peter replied it isnt so easy to dodge the newspapers and the press in this country besides although i could manage myself very well you would be an exceedingly awkward subject your tall and elegant figure your aquiline nose the shapeliness of your hands and feet give you a distinction which i should find it hard to conceal  sogrange smiled  you are a remarkably observant fellow baron i quite appreciate your difficulty still with a club foot eh and spectacles instead of my eyeglass  oh no doubt something could be managed peter interrupted youre really in earnest about this are you  absolutely sogrange declared come here  he drew peter to the window they were on the twelfth story and to a european there was something magnificent in that tangled mass of buildings threaded by the elevated railway with its screaming trains the clearness of the atmosphere and in the white streets below like polished belts through which the swarms of people streamed like insects  imagine it all lit up sogrange exclaimed the skysigns all ablaze the flashing of fire from those cable wires the lights glittering from those tall buildings this is a wonderful place baron we must see it ring for the bill order one of those magnificent omnibuses press the button too for the personage whom they call the valet perhaps with a little gentle persuasion he could be induced to pack our clothes  with his finger upon the hell peter hesitated he too loved adventures but the gloom of a presentiment had momentarily depressed him  we are marked men remember sogrange he said an escapade of this sort means a certain amount of risk even in new york  sogrange laughed  bernadine caught the midday steamer we have no enemies here that i know of  peter pressed the button an hour or so later the marquis de sogrange and peter baron de grost took their leave of new york  they chose a hotel on broadway within a stones throw of rectors peter with whitened hair goldrimmed spectacles a slouch hat and a fur coat passed easily enough for an english maker of electrical instruments while sogrange shabbier and in readymade american clothes was transformed into a canadian having some connection with the theatrical business they plunged into the heart of new york life and found the whole thing like a tonic the intense vitality of the people the pandemonium of broadway at midnight with its flaming illuminations its eager crowd its inimitable restlessness fascinated them both sogrange indeed remembering the decadent languor of the crowds of pleasure seekers thronging his own boulevards was never weary of watching these men and women they passed from the streets to the restaurants from the restaurants to the theatre out into the streets again back to the restaurants and once more into the streets sogrange was like a glutton the mention of bed was hateful to him for three days they existed without a moments boredom  on the fourth evening peter found sogrange deep in conversation with the head porter in a few minutes he led peter away to one of the bars where they usually took their cocktail  my friend he announced tonight i have a treat for you so far we have looked on at the external night life of new york wonderful and thrilling it has been too but there is the underneath also why not there is a vast polyglot population here full of energy said life a criminal class exists as a matter of course tonight we make our bow to it  and by what means peter inquired  our friend the hallporter sogrange continued has given me the card of an exdetective who will be our escort he calls for us tonight or rather tomorrow morning at one oclock then behold the wand is waved the land of adventures opens before us  peter grunted  i dont want to damp your enthusiasm my canadian friend he said but the sort of adventures you may meet with tonight are scarcely likely to fire your romantic nature i know a little about what they call this underneath world in new york it will probably resolve itself into a visit to chinatown where we shall find the usual dummies taking opium and quite prepared to talk about it for the usual tip after that we shall visit a few low dancing halls be shown the scene of several murders and the thing is done  you are a cynic sogrange declared you would throw cold water upon any enterprise anyway our detective is coming we must make use of him for i have engaged to pay him twentyfive dollars  well go where you like peter assented so long as we dine on a roof garden this beastly fur coat keeps me in a state of chronic perspiration  never mind sogrange said consolingly its most effective a roof garden by all means  and recollect peter insisted i bar chinatown weve both of us seen the real thing and theres nothing real about what they show you here  chinatown is erased from our program sogrange agreed we go now to dine remind me baron that i inquire for those strange dishes of which one hears terrapin canvasbacked duck green corn strawberry shortcake  peter smiled grimly  how like a frenchman he exclaimed to take no account of seasons never mind marquis you shall give your order and i will sketch the waiters face by the bye if youre in earnest about this expedition tonight put your revolver into your pocket  but we re going with an exdetective sogrange replied  one never knows peter said carelessly  they dined close to the stone palisading of one of new yorks most famous roof gardens sogrange ordered an immense dinner but spent most of his time gazing downwards they were higher up than at the hotel and they could see across the tangled maze of lights even to the river across which the great ferryboats were speeding all the whilehuge creatures of streaming fire and whistling sirens the air where they sat was pure and crisp there was no fog no smoke to cloud the almost crystalline clearness of the night  baron sogrange declared if i had lived in this city i should have been a different man no wonder the people are all conquering  too much electricity in the air for me peter answered i like a little repose i cant think where these people find it  one hopes sogrange murmured that before they progress any further in utilitarianism they will find some artist one of themselves to express all this  in the meantime peter interrupted the waiter would like to know what we are going to drink ive eaten such a confounded jumble of things of your ordering that i should like some champagne  who shall say that i am not generous sogrange replied taking up the wine carte champagne it shall be we need something to nerve us for our adventures  peter leaned across the table  sogrange he whispered for the last twentyfour hours i have had some doubts as to the success of our little enterprise it has occurred to me more than once that we are being shadowed  sogrange frowned  i sometimes wonder he remarked how a man of your suspicious nature ever acquired the reputation you undoubtedly enjoy  perhaps it is because of my suspicious nature peter said there is a man staying in our hotel whom we are beginning to see quite a great deal of he was talking to the head porter a few minutes before you this afternoon he supped at the same restaurant last night he is dining now three places behind you to the right with a young lady who has been making flagrant attempts at flirtation with me notwithstanding my gray hairs  your reputation my dear peter sogrange murmured  as a decoy peter interrupted the young ladys methods are too vigorous she pretends to be terribly afraid of her companion but it is entirely obvious that she is acting on his instructions of course this may be a ruse of the reporters on the other hand i think it would be wise to abandon our little expedition tonight  sogrange shook his head  so far as i am concerned he said i am committed to it  in which case peter replied i am certainly committed to being your companion the only question is whether one shall fall to the decoy and suffer oneself to be led in the direction her companion desires or whether we shall go blundering into trouble on our own account with your friend the exdetective  sogrange glanced over his shoulder leaned back in his chair for a moment as though to look at the stars and finally lit a cigarette  there is a lack of subtlety about that young person baron he declared which stifles ones suspicions i suspect her to be merely one more victim to your undoubted charms in the interests of madame your wife i shall take you away the decoy shall weave her spells in vain  they paid their bill and departed a few minutes later the man and the girl were also in the act of leaving the former seemed to be having some dispute about the bill the girl standing with her back to him scribbled a line upon a piece of paper and as peter went by pushed it into his hand with a little warning gesture in the lift he opened it the few penciled words contained nothing but an address number 15 100th street east  lucky man sogrange sighed  peter made no remark but he was thoughtful for the next hour or so  the exdetective proved to be an individual of fairly obvious appearance whose complexion and thirst indicated a very possible reason for his life of leisure he heard with surprise that his patrons were not inclined to visit chinatown but he showed a laudable desire to fall in with their schemes provided always that they included a reasonable number of visits to places where refreshment could be obtained from first to last the expedition was a disappointment they visited various smokehung dancing halls decorated for the most part with oleographs and cracked mirrors in which sicklylooking young men of unwholesome aspect were dancing with their feminine counterparts the attitude of their guide was alone amusing  say you want to be careful in here he would declare in an awed tone on entering one of these tawdry palaces guess this is one of the toughest spots in new york city you stick close to me and ill make things all right  his method of making things all right was the same in every case he would form a circle of disreputablelooking youths for whose drinks sogrange was called upon to pay the attitude of these young men was more dejected than positively vicious they showed not the slightest signs of any desire to make themselves unpleasant only once when sogrange incautiously displayed a gold watch did the eyes of one or two of their number glisten the exdetective changed his place and whispered hoarsely in his patrons ear  say dont you flash anything of that sort about here that young cove right opposite to you is one of the best known sneakthieves in the city youre asking for trouble that way  if he or any other of them want my watch sogrange answered calmly let them come and fetch it however he added buttoning up his coat no doubt you are right is there anywhere else to take us  the man hesitated  there aint much that you havent seen he remarked  sogrange laughed softly as he rose to his feet  a sell my dear friend he said to peter this terrible city keeps its real criminal class somewhere else rather than in the show places  a man who had been standing in the doorway looking in for several moments strolled up to them peter recognized him at once and touched sogrange on the arm the newcomer accosted them pleasantly  say youll excuse my butting in he began but i can see youre kind of disappointed these suckersindicating the exdetectivetalk a lot about what theyre going to show you and when they get you round it all amounts to nothing this is the sort of thing they bring you to as representing the wickedness of new york thats so rastall isnt it  the exdetective looked a little sheepish  yes there aint much more to be seen he admitted perhaps youll take the job on if you think there is  well id show the gentlemen something of a sight more interesting that this the newcomer continued they dont want to sit down and drink with the scum of the earth  perhaps sogrange suggested this gentleman has something in his mind which he thinks would appeal to us we have a motor car outside and we are out for adventures  what sort of adventures the newcomer asked bluntly  sogrange shrugged his shoulders lightly  we are lookerson merely he explained my friend and i have traveled a good deal we have seen something of criminal life in paris and london vienna and budapest i shall not break any confidence if i tell you that my friend is a writer and material such as this is useful  the newcomer smiled  well he exclaimed in a way its fortunate for you that i happened along you come right with me and ill show you something that very few other people in this city know of guess youd better pay this fellow off he added indicating the exdetective hes no more use to you  sogrange and peter exchanged questioning glances  it is very kind of you sir peter decided but for my part i have had enough for one evening  just as you like of course the other remarked with studied unconcern  what sort of place would it be sogrange asked  the newcomer drew them on one side although as a matter of fact every one else had already melted away  have you ever heard of the secret societies of new york he inquired well i guess you havent any waynot to know anything about them well then listen theres a society meets within a few steps of here which has more to do with regulating the criminal classes of the city than any police establishment therell be a man there within an hour or so who to my knowledge has committed seven murders the police cant get him they never will hes under our protection  may we visit such a place as you describe without danger peter asked calmly  no the man answered theres danger in going anywhere it seems to me if its worth while so long as you keep a still tongue in your head and dont look about you too much theres nothing will happen to you if you get gassing a lot you might tumble in for almost anything dont come unless you like its a chance for your friend as hes a writer but youd best keep out of it if youre in any way nervous  you said it was quite close sogrange inquired  within a yard or two the man replied its right this way  they left the hall with their new escort when they looked for their motor car they found it had gone  it dont do to keep them things waiting about round here their new friend remarked carelessly i guess ill send you back to your hotel all right step this way  by the bye what street is this we are in peter asked  100th street the man answered  peter shook his head  im a little superstitious about that number he declared is that an elevated railway there i think weve had enough sogrange  sogrange hesitated they were standing now in front of a tall gloomy house unkempt with broken gatea large but miserablelooking abode the passersby in the street were few the whole character of the surroundings was squalid the man pushed open the broken gate  you cross the street right there to the elevated he directed if you aint coming ill bid you goodnight  once more they hesitated peter perhaps saw more than his companion he saw the dark shapes lurking under the railway arch he knew instinctively that they were in some sort of danger and yet the love of adventure was on fire in his blood his belief in himself was immense he whispered to sogrange  i do not trust our guide he said if you care to risk it i am with you  mind the broken pavement the man called out this aint exactly an abode of luxury  they climbed some broken steps their guide opened a door with a yale key the door swung to after them and they found themselves in darkness there had been no light in the windows there was no light apparently in the house their companion produced an electric torch from his pocket  you had best follow me he advised our quarters face out the other way we keep this end looking a little deserted  they passed through a swing door and everything was at once changed a multitude of lamps hung from the ceiling the floor was carpeted the walls clean  we dont go in for electric light their guide explained as we try not to give the place away we manage to keep it fairly comfortable though  he pushed open the door and entered a somewhat gorgeously furnished salon there were signs here of feminine occupation an open piano and the smell of cigarettes once more peter hesitated  your friends seem to be in hiding he remarked personally i am losing my curiosity  guess you wont have to wait very long the man replied with meaning  the room was suddenly invaded on all sides four doors which were quite hidden by the pattern of the wall had opened almost simultaneously and at least a dozen men had entered this time both sogrange and peter knew that they were face to face with the real thing these were men who came silently in no cigarettestunted youths two of them were in evening dress three or four had the appearance of prize fighters in their countenances was one expression common to allan air of quiet and conscious strength  a fairheaded man in dinner jacket and black tie became at once their spokesman he was possessed of a very slight american accent and he beamed at them through a pair of goldrimmed spectacles  gentlemen he said i am glad to meet you both  very kind of you im sure sogrange answered our friend here he added indicating their guide found us trying to gain a little insight into the more interesting part of new york life he was kind enough to express a wish to introduce us to you  the man smiled he looked very much like some studious clerk except that his voice seemed to ring with some latent power  i am afraid he said that your friends interest in you was not entirely unselfish for three days he has carried in his pocket an order instructing him to produce you here  i knew it peter whispered under his breath  you interest me sogrange replied may i know whom i have the honor of addressing  you can call me burr the man announced philip burr your names it is not our wish to know  i am afraid i do not quite understand sogrange said  it was scarcely to be expected that you should mr philip burr admitted all i can tell you is that in cases like yours i really prefer not to know with whom i have to deal  you speak as though you had business with us peter remarked  without doubt i have the other replied grimly it is my business to see that you do not leave these premises alive  sogrange drew up a chair against which he had been leaning and sat down  really he said that would be most inconvenient peter too shook his head sitting upon the end of a sofa and folding his arms something told him that the moment for fighting was not yet  inconvenient or not mr philip burr continued i have orders to carry out which i can assure you have never yet been disobeyed since the formation of our society from what i can see of you you appear to be very amiable gentlemen and if it would interest you to choose the methodsay of your releasewhy i can assure you well do all we can to meet your views  i am beginning sogrange remarked to feel quite at home  you see weve been through this sort of thing before peter added blandly  mr philip burr took a cigar from his case and lit it at a motion of his hand one of the company passed the box to his two guests  youre not counting upon a visit from the police or anything of that sort i hope mr philip burr asked  sogrange shook his head  certainly not he replied i may say that much of the earlier portion of my life was spent in frustrating the wellmeant but impossible schemes of that body of men  if only we had a little more time mr burr declared it seems to me i should like to make the acquaintance of you two gentlemen  the matter is entirely in your own hands peter reminded him we are in no hurry  mr burr smiled genially  you make me think better of humanity he confessed a month ago we had a man heregot him along somehow or anotherand i had to tell him that he was up against it like you two are my the fuss he made kind of saddened me to think a man should be such a coward  some people like that sogrange remarked by the bye mr burr youll pardon my curiosity whom have we to thank for our introduction here tonight  i dont know as theres any particular harm in telling you mr burr replied  nor any particular good a man who was standing by his side interrupted say phil you drag these things out too much are there any questions youve got to ask em or any property to collect  nothing of the sort mr burr admitted  then let the gang get to work the other declared  the two men were suddenly conscious that they were being surrounded peters hand stole on to the butt of his revolver sogrange rose slowly to his feet his hands were thrust out in front of him with the thumbs turned down the four fingers of each hand flashed for a minute through the air mr philip burr lost all his selfcontrol  say where the devil did you learn that trick he cried  sogrange laughed scornfully  trick he exclaimed philip burr you are unworthy of your position i am the marquis de sogrange and my friend here is the baron de grost  mr philip burr had no words his cigar had dropped on to the carpet he was simply staring  if you need proof sogrange continued further than any i have given you i have in my pocket at the present moment a letter signed by you yourself pleading for formal reinstatement this is how you would qualify for it you make use of your power to run a common decoy house to do away with men for money what fool gave you our names pray  mr philip burr was only the wreck of a man he could not even control his voice  it was some german or belgian nobleman he faltered he brought us excellent letters and he made a large contribution it was the count von hern  the anger of sogrange seemed suddenly to fade away he threw himself into a chair by the side of his companion  my dear baron he exclaimed bernadine has scored indeed your friend has a sense of humor which overwhelms me imagine it he has delivered the two heads of our great society into the hands of one of its castoff branches bernadine is a genius indeed  mr philip burr began slowly to recover himself he waved his hand nine out of the twelve men left the room  marquis he said for ten years there has been no one whom i have desired to meet so much as you i came to europe but you declined to receive me i know very well we cant keep our end up like you over there because we havent politics and that sort of things to play with but weve done our best weve encouraged only criminology of the highest order weve tried all we can to keep the profession select the jailbird pure and simple we have cast out the men who have suffered at our hands have been men who have met with their deserts  what about us peter demanded it seems to me that you had most unpleasant plans for our future  philip burr held up his hands  as i live he declared this is the first time that any money consideration has induced me to break away from our principles that count von hern he had powerful friends who were our friends and he gave me the word straight that you two had an appointment down below which was considerably overdue i dont know even now why i consented i guess it isnt much use apologizing  sogrange rose to his feet  well he said i am not inclined to bear malice but you must understand this from me philip burr as a society i dissolve you i deprive you of your title and of your signs call yourself what you will but never again mention the name of the doublefour with us in europe another era has dawned we are on the side of law and order we protect only criminals of a certain class in whose operations we have faith there is no future for such a society in this country therefore as i say i dissolve it now if you are ready perhaps you will be so good as to provide us with the means of reaching our hotel  philip burr led them into a back street where his own handsome automobile was placed at their service  this kind of breaks me all up he declared as he gave the instructions to the chauffeur if there were two men on the face of this earth whom id have been proud to meet in a friendly sort of way its you two  we bear no malice mr burr sogrange assured him you can if you will do us the honor lunch with us tomorrow at one oclock at rectors my friend here is quite interested in the count von hern and he would probably like to hear exactly how this affair was arranged  ill be there sure philip burr promised with a farewell wave of the hand  sogrange and peter drove back towards their hotel in silence it was only when they emerged into the civilized part of the city that sogrange began to laugh softly  my friend he murmured you bluffed fairly well but you were afraid oh how i smiled to see your fingers close round the butt of that revolver  what about you peter asked gruffly you dont suppose you took me in do you  sogrange smiled  i had two reasons for coming to new york he said one we accomplished upon the steamer the other was  well  to reply personally to this letter of mr philip burr sogrange replied which letter by the bye was dated from 15 100th street new york an ordinary visit there would have been useless to me something of this sort was necessary  then you knew peter gasped notwithstanding all your bravado you knew  i had a very fair idea sogrange admitted dont be annoyed with me my friend you have had a little experience it is all useful it isnt the first time youve looked death in the face adventures come to some men unasked you i think were born with the habit of them  peter smiled they had reached the hotel courtyard and he raised himself stiffly  theres a little fable about the pitcher that went once too often to the well he remarked i have had my share of luckmore than my share the end must come sometime you know  is this superstition sogrange asked  superstition pure and simple peter confessed taking his key from the office it doesnt alter anything i am fatalist enough to shrug my shoulders and move on but i tell you sogrange he added after a moments pause i wouldnt admit it to any one else in the world but i am afraid of bernadine i have had the best of it so often it cant last in all weve had twelve encounters the next will be the thirteenth  sogrange shrugged his shoulders slightly as he rang for the lift  id propose you for the thirteen club only theres some uncomfortable clause about yearly suicides which might not suit you he remarked goodnight and dont dream of bernadine and your thirteenth encounter  i only hope peter murmured that i may be in a position to dream after it    chapter xi the thirteenth encounter   the marquis de sogrange arrived in berkeley square with the gray dawn of an october morning showing in his appearance and dress few enough signs of his night journey yet he had traveled without stopping from paris by fast motor car and the mail boat  they telephoned me from charing cross peter said that you could not possibly arrive until midday the clerk assured me that no train had yet reached calais  they had reason in what they told you sogrange remarked as he leaned back in a chair and sipped the coffee which had been waiting for him in the baron de grosts study the train itself never got more than a mile away from the gare du nord the enginedriver was shot through the head and the metals were torn from the way paris is within a year now of a second and more terrible revolution  you really believe this peter asked gravely  it is a certainty sogrange replied not i alone but many others can see this clearly everywhere the socialists have wormed themselves into places of trust they are to be met with in every rank of life under every form of disguise the postoffice strike has already shown us what deplorable disasters even a skirmish can bring about today the railway strike has paralyzed france today our country lies absolutely at the mercy of any invader as it happens none is for the moment prepared who can tell how it may be next time  this is had news peter declared if this is really the position of affairs the matter is much more serious than the newspapers would have us believe  the newspapers sogrange muttered ignore what lies behind some of them i think are paid to do it as for the rest our press had always an ostrichlike tendency the frenchman of the cafe does not buy his journal to be made sad  you believe then peter asked that these strikes have some definite tendency  sogrange set down his cup and smiled bitterly in the early sunlight still a little cold and unloving peter could see that there was a change in the man he was no longer the debonair aristocrat of the racecourses and the boulevards the shadows under his eyes were deeper his cheeks more sunken he had lost something of the sprightliness of his bearing his attitude indeed was almost dejected he was like a man who sees into the future and finds there strange and gruesome things  i do more than believe that he declared i know it it has fallen to my lot to make a very definite discovery concerning them listen my friend for more than six months the government has been trying to discover the source of this stream of vile socialistic literature which has contaminated the french working classes the pamphlets have been distributed with devilish ingenuity among all national operatives the army and the navy the government has failed the doublefour has succeeded  you have really discovered their source peter exclaimed  without a doubt sogrange assented the government appealed to us first some months ago when i was in america for a time we had no success then a clue and the rest was easy the navy the army the postoffice employees the telegraph and telephone operators and the railway men have been the chief recipients of this incessant stream of foul literature today one cannot tell how much mischief has been actually done the strikes which have already occurred are only the mutterings of the coming storm but mark you wherever those pamphlets have gone trouble has followed what men may do the government is doing but all the time the poison is at work the seed has been sown two millions of money have been spent to corrupt that very class which should be the backbone of france through the fingers of one man has come this shower of gold one man alone has stood at the head of the great organization which has disseminated this loathsome disease behind himwell we know  the man  it is fitting that you should ask that question sogrange replied the name of that man is bernadine count von hern  peter remained speechless there was something almost terrible in the slow preciseness with which sogrange had uttered the name of his enemy something unspeakably threatening in the cold glitter of his angry eyes  up to the present sogrange continued i have watchedsympathetically of course but with a certain amount of amusementthe duel between you and bernadine it has been against your country and your countrys welfare that most of his efforts have been directed which perhaps accounts for the equanimity with which i have been contented to remain a lookeron it is apparent my dear baron that in most of your encounters the honors have remained with you yet as it has chanced never once has bernadine been struck a real and crushing blow the time has come when this and more must happen it is no longer a matter of polite exchanges it is a duel a outrance  you mean peter began  i mean that bernadine must die sogrange declared  there was a brief silence outside the early morning street noises were increasing in volume as the great army of workers streaming towards the heart of the city from a hundred suburbs passed on to their tasks a streak of sunshine had found its way into the room lay across the carpet and touched sogranges still waxen features peter glanced half fearfully at his friend and visitor he himself was no coward no shrinker from the great issues he too had dealt in life and death yet there was something in the deliberate preciseness of sogranges words as he sat there only a few feet away unspeakably thrilling it was like a death sentence pronounced in all solemnity upon some shivering criminal there was something inevitable and tragical about the whole affair a pronouncement had been made from which there was no appealbernadine was to die  isnt this a little exceeding the usual exercise of our powers peter asked slowly  no such occasion as this has ever yet arisen sogrange reminded him bernadine has fled to this country with barely an hour to spare his offense is extraditable by a law of the last century which has never been repealed he is guilty of treason against the republic of france yet they do not want him back they do not want a trial i have papers upon my person which if i took them into an english court would procure for me a warrant for bernadines arrest it is not this we desire bernadine must die no fate could be too terrible for a man who has striven to corrupt the soul of a nation it is not war this it is not honest conspiracy is it war i ask you to seek to poison the drinking water of an enemy to send stalking into their midst some loathsome disease such things belong to the ages of barbarity bernadine has striven to revive them and bernadine shall die  it is justice peter admitted  the question remains sogrange continued by whose handyours or mine  peter started uneasily  is that necessary he asked  i fear that it is sogrange replied we had a brief meeting of the executive council last night and it was decided for certain reasons to entrust this task into no other hands you will smile when i tell you that these accursed pamphlets have found their way into the possession of many of the rank and file of our own order there is a marked disinclination on the part of those who have been our slaves to accept orders from any one espionage we can still commandthe best perhaps in europebecause here we use a different class of material but of those underneath we are for the moment doubtful paris is all in a ferment under its outward seemliness a million throats are ready to take up the brazen cry of revolution one trusts nobody one fears all the time  you or i peter repeated slowly it will not be sufficient then that we find bernadine and deliver him over to your countrys laws  it will not be sufficient sogrange answered sternly from those he may escape for him there must be no escape  sogrange peter said speaking in a low tone i have never yet killed a human being  nor i sogrange admitted nor have i yet set my heel upon its head and stamped the life from a rat upon the pavement but one lives and one moves on bernadine is the enemy of your country and mine he makes war after the fashion of vermin no ordinary cutthroat would succeed against him it must be you or i  how shall we decide peter asked  the spin of a coin sogrange replied it is best that way it is best too done quickly  peter produced a sovereign from his pocket and balanced it on the palm of his hand  let it be understood sogrange continued that this is a dual undertaking we toss only for the final honorfor the last stroke if the choice falls upon me i shall count upon you to help me to the end if it falls upon you i shall be at your right hand even when you strike the blow  it is agreed peter said see it is for you to call  he threw the coin high into the air  i call heads sogrange decided  it fell upon the table peter covered it with his hand and then slowly withdrew the fingers a little shiver ran through his veins the harmless head that looked up at him was like the figure of death it was for him to strike the blow  where is bernadine now he asked  get me a morning paper and i will tell you sogrange declared rising he was in the train which was stopped outside the gare du nord on his way to england what became of the passengers i have not heard i knew what was likely to happen and i left an hour before in a 100 h p charron  peter rang the bell and ordered the servant who answered it to procure the daily telegraph as soon as it arrived he spread it open upon the table and sogrange looked over his shoulder these are the headings which they saw in large black characters                       renewed riots in paris                    the gare du nord in flames           terrible accident to the calaisdouvres express                           many deaths   peters forefinger traveled down the page swiftly it paused at the following paragraph  the 855 train from the gare du nord carrying many passengers for london after being detained within a mile of paris for over an hour owing to the murder of the enginedriver made an attempt last night to proceed with terrible results near chantilly whilst travelling at over fifty miles an hour the switches were tampered with and the express dashed into a goods train laden with minerals very few particulars are yet to hand but the express was completely wrecked and many lives have been lost  among the dead are the following  one by one peter read out the names then he stopped short a little exclamation broke from sogranges lips the thirteenth name upon that list of dead was that of bernadine count von hern  bernadine peter faltered bernadine is dead  killed by the strikers sogrange echoed it is a just thing this  the two men looked down at the paper and then up at one another a strange silence seemed to have found its way into the room the shadow of death lay between them peter touched his forehead and found it wet  it is a just thing indeed he repeated but justice and death are alike terrible  late in the afternoon of the same day a motor car splashed with mud drew up before the door of the house in berkeley square sogrange who was standing talking to peter before the library window suddenly broke off in the middle of a sentence he stepped back into the room and gripped his friends shoulder  it is the baroness he exclaimed quickly what does she want here  the baroness who peter demanded  the baroness von ratten you must have heard of hershe is the friend of bernadine  the two men had been out to lunch at the ritz with violet and had walked across the park home sogrange had been drawing on his gloves in the act of starting out for a call at the embassy  does your wife know this woman he asked peter shook his head  i think not he replied  then she has come to see you sogrange continued what does it mean i wonder  peter shrugged his shoulders  we shall know in a minute  there was a knock at the door and his servant entered bearing a card  this lady would like to see you sir on important business he said  you can show her in here peter directed  there was a very short delay the two men had no time to exchange a word they heard the rustling of a womans gown and immediately afterwards the perfume of violets seemed to fill the room  the baroness von ratten the butler announced  the door was closed behind her the servant had disappeared peter advanced to meet his guest she was a little above medium height very slim with extraordinarily fair hair colorless face and strange eyes she was not strictly beautiful and yet there was no man upon whom her presence was without its effect her voice was like her movements slow and with a grace of its own  you do not mind that i have come to see you she asked raising her eyes to peters i believe before i go that you will think terrible things of me but you must not begin before i have told you my errand it has been a great struggle with me before i made up my mind to come here  wont you sit down baroness peter invited  she saw sogrange and hesitated  you are not alone she said softly i wish to speak with you alone  permit me to present to you the marquis de sogrange peter begged he is my oldest friend baroness i think that whatever you might have to say to me you might very well say before him  it isof a private nature she murmured  the marquis and i have no secrets peter declared either political or private  she sat down and motioned peter to take a place by her side upon the sofa  you will forgive me if i am a little incoherent she implored today i have had a shock you too have read the news you must know that the count von hern is deadkilled in the railway accident last night  we read it in the daily telegraph peter replied  it is in all the papers she continued you know that he was a very dear friend of mine  i have heard so peter admitted  yet there was one subject she insisted earnestly upon which we never agreed he hated england i have always loved it england was kind to me when my own country drove me out i have always felt grateful it has been a sorrow to me that in so many of his schemes in so much of his work bernadine should consider his own country at the expense of yours  sogrange drew a little nearer it began to be interesting this  i heard the news early this morning by telegram she went on for a long time i was prostrated then early this afternoon i began to thinkone must always think bernadine was a dear friend but things between us lately have been different a little strained was it his fault or minewho can say does one tire with the years i wonder i wonder  her eyes were lifted to his and peter was conscious of the fact that she wished him to know that they were beautiful she looked slowly away again  this afternoon as i sat alone she proceeded i remembered that in my keeping were many boxes of papers and many letters which have recently arrived all belonging to bernadine i reflected that there were certainly some who were in his confidence and that very soon they would come from his country and take them all away and then i remembered what i owed to england and how opposed i always was to bernadines schemes and i thought that the best thing i could do to show my gratitude would be to place his papers all in the hands of some englishman so that they might do no more harm to the country which has been kind to me so i came to you  again her eyes were lifted to his and peter was very sure indeed that they were wonderfully beautiful he began to realize the fascination of this woman of whom he had heard so much her very absence of coloring was a charm  you mean that you have brought me these papers he asked  she shook her head slowly  no she said i could not do that there were too many of themthey are too heavy and there are piles of pamphletsrevolutionary pamphlets i am afraidall in french which i do not understand no i could not bring them to you but i ordered my motor car and i drove up here to tell you that if you like to come down to the house in the country where i have been living to which bernadine was to have come tonightyes and bring your friend too if you willyou shall look through them before any one else can arrive  you are very kind peter murmured tell me where it is that you live  it is beyond hitchin she told him up the great north road i tell you at once it is a horrible house in a horrible lonely spot within a day or two i shall leave it myself forever i hate itit gets on my nerves i dream of all the terrible things which perhaps have taken place there who can tell it was bernadines long before i came to england  when are we to come peter asked  you must come back with me now at once the baroness insisted i cannot tell how soon some one in his confidence may arrive  i will order my car peter declared  she laid her hand upon his arm  do you mind coming in mine she begged it is of no consequence if you object but every servant in bernadines house is a german and a spy there are no women except my own maid your car is likely enough known to them and there might be trouble if you will come with me now you and your friend if you like i will send you to the station tonight in time to catch the train home i feel that i must have this thing off my mind you will come yes  peter rang the bell and ordered his coat  without a doubt he answered may we not offer you some tea first  she shook her head  today i cannot think of eating or drinking she replied bernadine and i were no longer what we had been but the shock of his death seems none the less terrible i feel like a traitor to him for coming here yet i believe that i am doing what is right she added softly  if you will excuse me for one moment peter said while i take leave of my wife i will rejoin you presently  peter was absent for only a few minutes sogrange and the baroness exchanged the merest commonplaces as they all passed down the hall sogrange lingered behind  if you will take the baroness out to the car he suggested i will telephone to the embassy and tell them not to expect me  peter offered his arm to his companion she seemed indeed to need support her fingers clutched at his coatsleeve as they passed on to the pavement  i am so glad to be no longer quite alone she whispered almost i wish that your friend were not coming i know that bernadine and you were enemies but then you were enemies not personally but politically after all it is you who stand for the things which have become so dear to me  it is true that bernadine and i were bitter antagonists peter admitted gravely death however ends all that i wish him no further harm  she sighed  as for me she said i am growing used to being friendless i was friendless before bernadine came and latterly we have been nothing to one another now i suppose i shall know what it is to be an outcast once more did you ever hear my history i wonder  peter shook his head  never baroness he replied i understood i believe that your marriage  my husband divorced me she confessed simply he was quite within his rights he was impossible i was very young and very sentimental they say that englishwomen are cold she added perhaps that is so people think that i look cold do you  sogrange suddenly opened the door of the car in which they were already seated she leaned back and half closed her eyes  it is rather a long ride she said and i am worn out i hope you will not mind but for myself i cannot talk when motoring smoke if it pleases you  might one inquire as to our exact destination sogrange asked  we go beyond hitchin up the great north road she told him again the house is called the high house it stands in the middle of a heath and i think it is the loneliest and most miserable place that was ever built i hate it and i am frightened in it for some reason or other it suited bernadine but that is all over now  the little party of three relapsed into silence the car driven carefully enough through the busy streets gradually increased its pace as they drew clear of the suburbs peter leaned back in his place thinking bernadine was dead nothing else would have convinced him so utterly of the fact as that simple sentence in the daily telegraph which had been followed up by a confirmation and a brief obituary notice in all the evening papers curiously enough the fact seemed to have drawn a certain spice out of even this adventure to point indeed to a certain monotony in the future their present enterprise important though it might turn out to be was nothing to be proud of a woman greedy for gold was selling her lovers secrets before the breath was out of his body peter turned in his cushioned seat to look at her without doubt she was beautiful to one who understood beautiful in a strange colorless feline fashion the beauty of soft limbs soft movements a caressing voice with always the promise beyond of more than the actual words her eyes now were closed her face was a little weary did she really rest peter wondered he watched the rising and falling of her bosom the quivering now and then of her eyelids she had indeed the appearance of a woman who had suffered  the car rushed on into the darkness behind them lay that restless phantasmagoria of lights streaming to the sky in front blank space peter through halfclosed eyes watched the woman by his side from the moment of her entrance into his library he had summed her up in his mind with a single word she was beyond a doubt an adventuress no woman could have proposed the things which she had proposed who was not of that ilk yet for that reason it behooved them to have a care in their dealings with her at her instigation they had set out upon this adventure which might well turn out according to any fashion that she chose yet without bernadine what could she do she was not the woman to carry on the work which he had left behind for the love of him her words had been frank her action shameful but natural bernadine was dead and she had realized quickly enough the best market for his secrets in a few days time his friends would have come and she would have received nothing he told himself that he was foolish to doubt her there was not a flaw in the sequence of events no possible reason for the suspicions which yet lingered at the back of his brain intrigue it was certain was to her as the breath of her body he was perfectly willing to believe that the death of bernadine would have affected her little more than the sweeping aside of a fly his very common sense bade him accept her story  by degrees he became drowsy suddenly he was startled into a very wideawake state through halfclosed eyes he had seen sogrange draw a sheet of paper from his pocket a gold pencil from his chain and commence to write in the middle of a sentence his eyes were abruptly lifted he was looking at the baroness peter too turned his head he also looked at the baroness without a doubt she had been watching both of them sogranges pencil continued its task only he traced no more characters instead he seemed to be sketching a face which presently he tore carefully up into small pieces and destroyed he did not even glance towards peter but peter understood very well what had happened he had been about to send him a message but had found the baroness watching peter was fully awake now his faint sense of suspicion had deepened into a positive foreboding he had a reckless desire to stop the car to descend upon the road and let the secrets of bernadine go where they would then his natural love of adventure blazed up once more his moment of weakness had passed the thrill was in his blood his nerves were tightened he was ready for what might come seemingly still half asleep yet indeed with every sense of intuition and observation keenly alert  sogrange leaned over from his place  it is a lonely country this into which we are coming madame he remarked  she shrugged her shoulders  indeed it is not so lonely here as you will think it when we arrive at our destination she replied there are houses here but they are hidden by the trees there are no houses near us  she rubbed the pane with her hand  we are i believe very nearly there she said this is the nearest village afterwards we just climb a hill and about half a mile along the top of it is the high house  and the name of the village sogrange inquired  st marys she told him in the summer people call it beautiful around here to me it is the most melancholy spot i ever saw there is so much rain and one hears the drip drip in the trees all the day long alone i could not bear it tomorrow or the next day i shall pack up my belongings and come to london i am unfortunately she added with a little sigh very very poor but it is my hope that you may find the papers of which i have spoken to you valuable  sogrange smiled faintly peter and he could scarcely forbear to exchange a single glance the womans candor was almost brutal she read their thoughts  we ascend the hill she continued we draw now very near to the end of our journey there is still one thing i would say to you do not think too badly of me for what i am about to do to bernadine while he lived i was faithful many a time i could have told you of his plans and demanded a great sum of money and you would have given it me willingly but my lips were sealed because in a way i loved him while he lived i gave him what i owed today he is dead and whatever i do it cannot concern him any more today i am a free woman and i take the side i choose  dear madame he replied what you have proposed to us is after all quite natural and very gracious if one has a fear at all about the matter it is as to the importance of these documents you speak of bernadine i know has dealt in great affairs but he was a diplomat by instinct experienced and calculating one does not keep incriminating papers  she leaned a little forward the car had swung round a corner now and was making its way up an avenue as dark as pitch  the wisest of us monsieur le marquis she whispered reckon sometimes without that one element of sudden death what should you say i wonder to a list of agents in france pledged to circulate in certain places literature of an infamous sort what should you say monsieur to a copy of a secret report of your late maneuvers franked with the name of one of your own staff officers what should you say she went on to a list of socialist deputies with amounts against their name amounts paid in hard cash are these of no importance to you  madame sogrange answered simply for such information if it were genuine it would be hard to mention a price which we should not be prepared to pay  the car came to a sudden standstill the first impression of the two men was that the baroness had exaggerated the loneliness and desolation of the place there was nothing mysterious or forbidding about the plain brownstone house before which they had stopped the windows were streaming with light the hall door already thrown open disclosed a very comfortable hall brilliantly illuminated a manservant assisted his mistress to alight another ushered them in in the background were other servants the baroness glanced at the clock  about dinner carl she asked  it waits for madame the man answered  she nodded  take care of these gentlemen till i descend she ordered you will not mind she added turning pleadingly to sogrange today i have eaten nothing i am faint with hunger afterwards it will be a matter but of half an hour you can be in london again by ten oclock  as you will madame sogrange replied we are greatly indebted to you for your hospitality but for costume you understand that we are as we are  it is perfectly understood she assured him for myself i rejoin you in ten minutes a loose gown that is all  sogrange and peter were shown into a modern bathroom by a servant who was so anxious to wait upon them that they had difficulty in sending him away as soon as he was gone and the door closed behind him peter put his foot against it and turned the key  you were going to write something to me in the car  sogrange nodded  there was a moment he admitted when i had a suspicion it has passed this woman is no roman she sells the secrets of bernadine as she would sell herself nevertheless it is well always to be prepared there were probably others beside bernadine who had the entree here  the only suspicious circumstance which i have noticed peter remarked is the number of menservants i have seen five already  it is only fair to remember sogrange reminded him that the baroness herself told us that there were no other save menservants here and that they were all spies without a master i cannot see that they are dangerous one needs however to watch all the time  if you see anything suspicious peter said tap the table with your forefinger personally i will admit that i have had my doubts of the baroness but on the whole i have come to the conclusion that they were groundless she is not the sort of woman to take up a vendetta especially an unprofitable one  she is an exceedingly dangerous person for an impressionable man like myself sogrange remarked arranging his tie  the butler fetched them in a very few moments and showed them into a pleasantlyfurnished library where he mixed cocktails for them from a collection of bottles upon the sideboard he was quite friendly and inclined to be loquacious although he spoke with a slight foreign accent the house belonged to an english gentleman from whom the honored count had taken it furnished they were two miles from a station and a mile from the village it was a lonely part but there were always people coming or going with ones work one scarcely noticed it he was gratified that the gentlemen found his cocktails so excellent perhaps he might be permitted the high honor of mixing them another it was a day this of deep sadness and gloom one needed to drink something indeed to forget the terrible thing which had happened the count had been a good master a little impatient sometimes but kindhearted the news had been a shock to them all   then before they had expected her the baroness reappeared she wore a wonderful gray gown which seemed to be made in a single piece a gown which fitted her tightly and yet gave her the curious appearance of a woman walking without the burden of clothes sogrange parisian to the fingertips watched her with admiring approval she laid her fingers upon his arm although it was towards peter that her eyes traveled  will you take me in marquis she begged it is the only formality we will allow ourselves  they entered a long low diningroom paneled with oak and with the family portraits of the owner of the house still left upon the wall dinner was served upon a round table and was laid for four there was a profusion of silver very beautiful glass and a wonderful cluster of orchids the marquis as he handed his hostess to her chair glanced towards the vacant place  it is for my companion an austrian lady she explained tonight however i think that she will not come she was a distant connection of bernadines and she is much upset we leave her place and see you will sit on my other side baron  the fingers which touched peters arm brushed his hand and were withdrawn as though with reluctance she sank into her chair with a little sigh  it is charming of you two this she declared softly you help me through this night of solitude and sadness what i should do if i were alone i cannot tell you must drink with me a toast if you will will you make it to our better acquaintance  no soup had been offered and champagne was served with the hors doeuvre peter raised his glass and looked into the eyes of the woman who was leaning so closely towards him that her soft breath fell upon his cheek she whispered something in his ear for a moment perhaps he was carried away but for a moment only then sogranges voice and the beat of his forefinger upon the table stiffened him into sudden alertness they heard a motor car draw up outside  who can it be the baroness exclaimed setting her glass down abruptly  it is perhaps our fourth guest who arrives sogrange remarked  they all three listened peter and sogrange with their glasses still suspended in the air  our fourth guest the baroness repeated madame von estenier is upstairs lying down i cannot tell who this may be  her lips were parted the lines of her forehead had suddenly appeared her eyes were turned toward the door hard and bright then the glass which she had nervously picked up again and was holding between her fingers fell on to the tablecloth with a little crash and the yellow wine ran bubbling on to her plate her scream echoed to the roof and rang through the room it was bernadine who stood there in the doorway bernadine in a long traveling ulster and the air of one newly arrived from a journey they all three looked at him but there was not one who spoke the baroness after her one wild cry was dumb  i am indeed fortunate bernadine said you have as yet i see scarcely commenced you probably expected me i am charmed to find so agreeable a party awaiting my arrival  he divested himself of his ulster and threw it across the arm of the butler who stood behind him  come he continued for a man who has just been killed in a railway accident i find myself with an appetite a glass of wine carl i do not know what that toast was the drinking of which my coming interrupted but let us all drink it together aimee my love to you dear let me congratulate you upon the fortitude and courage with which you ignored those lying reports of my death i had fears that i might find you alone in a darkened room with tearstained eyes and sal volatile by your side this is infinitely better gentlemen you are welcome  sogrange lifted his glass and bowed courteously peter followed suit  really sogrange murmured the press nowadays becomes more unreliable every day it is apparent my dear von hern that this account of your death was to say the least of it exaggerated  peter said nothing his eyes were fixed upon the baroness she sat in her chair quite motionless but her face had become like the face of some graven image she looked at bernadine but her eyes said nothing every glint of expression seemed to have left her features since that one wild shriek she had remained voiceless encompassed by danger though he knew they now must be peter found himself possessed by one thought only was this a trap into which they had fallen or was the woman too deceived  you bring later news from paris than i myself sogrange proceeded helping himself to one of the dishes which a footman was passing round how did you reach the coast the evening papers stated distinctly that since the accident no attempt had been made to run trains  by motor car from chantilly bernadine replied i had the misfortune to lose my servant who was wearing my coat and who i gather from the newspaper reports was mistaken for me i myself was unhurt i hired a motor car and drove to boulognenot the best of journeys let me tell you for we broke down three times there was no steamer there but i hired a fishing boat which brought me across the channel in something under eight hours from the coast i motored direct here i was so anxious he added raising his eyes to see how my dear friendmy dear aimeewas bearing the terrible news  she fluttered for a moment like a bird in a trap peter drew a little sigh of relief his selfrespect was reinstated he had decided that she was innocent upon them at least would not fall the ignominy of having been led into the simplest of traps by this whitefaced delilah the butler had brought her another glass which she raised to her lips she drained its contents but the ghastliness of her appearance remained unchanged peter watching her knew the signs she was sick with terror  the conditions throughout france are indeed awful sogrange remarked they say too that this railway strike is only the beginning of worse things  bernadine smiled  your country dear marquis he said is on its last legs no one knows better than i that it is at the present moment honeycombed with sedition and anarchical impulses the people are rotten for years the whole tone of france has been decadent its fall must even now be close at hand  you take a gloomy view of my countrys future sogrange declared  why should one refuse to face facts bernadine replied one does not often talk so frankly but we three are met together this evening under somewhat peculiar circumstances the days of the glory of france are past england has laid out her neck for the yoke of the conqueror both are doomed to fall both are ripe for the great humiliation you two gentlemen whom i have the honor to receive as my guests he concluded filling his glass and bowing towards them in your present unfortunate predicament represent precisely the position of your two countries  ave caesar peter muttered grimly raising his glass to his lips  bernadine accepted the challenge  it is not i alas who may call myself caesar he replied although it is certainly you who are about to die  sogrange turned to the man who stood behind his chair  if i might trouble you for a little dry toast he inquired a modern but very uncomfortable ailment he added with a sigh ones digestion must march with the years i suppose  bernadine smiled  your toast you shall have with pleasure marquis he said but as for your indigestion do not let that trouble you any longer i think that i can promise you immunity from that annoying complaint for the rest of your life  you are doing your best peter declared leaning back in his chair to take away my appetite  bernadine looked searchingly from one to the other of his two guests  yes he admitted you are brave men i do not know why i should ever have doubted it your pose is excellent i have no wish however to see you buoyed up by a baseless optimism a somewhat remarkable chance has delivered you into my hands you are my prisoners you peter baron de grost i have hated all my days you have stood between me and the achievement of some of my most dearlycherished tasks always i have said to myself that the day of reckoning must come it has arrived as for you marquis de sogrange if my personal feelings towards you are less violent you still represent the things absolutely inimical to me and my interests the departure of you two men was the one thing necessary for the successful completion of certain tasks which i have in hand at the present moment  peter pushed away his plate  you have succeeded in destroying my appetite count he declared now that you have gone so far in expounding your amiable resolutions towards us perhaps you will go a little further and explain exactly how in this eminently respectable house situated i understand in an eminently respectable neighborhood with a police station within a mile and a dozen or so witnesses as to our present whereabouts you intend to expedite our removal  bernadine pointed toward the woman who sat facing him  ask the baroness how these things are arranged  they turned towards her she fell back in her chair with a little gasp she had fainted bernadine shrugged his shoulders the butler and one of the footmen who during the whole of the conversation had stolidly proceeded with their duties in obedience to a gesture from their master took her up in their arms and carried her from the room  the fear has come to her too bernadine murmured softly it may come to you my brave friends before morning  it is possible peter answered his hand stealing around to his hip pocket but in the meantime what is to prevent  the hip pocket was empty peters sentence ended abruptly bernadine mocked him  to prevent your shooting me in cold blood i suppose he remarked nothing except that my servants are too clever no one save myself is allowed to remain under this roof with arms in their possession your pocket was probably picked before you had been in the place five minutes no my dear baron let me assure you that escape will not be so easy you were always just a little inclined to be led away by the fair sex the best men in the world you know have shared that failing and the baroness alone and unprotected had her attractions eh  then something happened to peter which had happened to him barely a dozen times in his life he lost his temper and lost it rather badly without an instants hesitation he caught up the decanter which stood by his side and flung it in his hosts face bernadine only partly avoided it by thrusting out his arms the neck caught his forehead and the blood came streaming over his tie and collar peter had followed the decanter with a sudden spring his fingers were upon bernadines throat and he thrust his head back sogrange sprang to the door to lock it but he was too late the room seemed full of menservants peter was dragged away still struggling fiercely  tie them up bernadine gasped swaying in his chair tie them up do you hear carl give me brandy  he swallowed half a wineglassful of the raw spirit his eyes were red with fury  take them to the gun room he ordered three of you to each of them mind ill shoot the man who lets either escape  but peter and sogrange were both of them too wise to expend any more of their strength in a useless struggle they suffered themselves to be conducted without resistance across the white stone hall down a long passage and into a room at the end the window and fireplace of which were both blocked up the floor was of red flags and the walls whitewashed the only furniture was a couple of kitchen chairs and a long table the door was of stout oak and fitted with a double lock the sole outlet so far as they could see was a small round hole at the top of the roof the door was locked behind them they were alone  the odd trick to bernadine peter exclaimed hoarsely wiping a spot of blood from his forehead my dear marquis i scarcely know how to apologize it is not often that i lose my temper so completely  the matter seems to be of very little consequence sogrange answered this was probably our intended destination in any case seems to be rather an unfortunate expedition of ours i am afraid  one cannot reckon upon men coming back from the dead peter declared it isnt often that you find every morning and every evening paper mistaken as for the woman i believe in her she honestly meant to sell us those papers of bernadines i believe that she too will have to face a day of reckoning  sogrange strolled around the room subjecting it everywhere to a close scrutiny the result was hopeless there was no method of escape save through the door  there is certainly something strange about this apartment peter remarked it is to say the least of it unusual to have windows in the roof and a door of such proportions all the same i think that those threats of bernadines were a little strained one cannot get rid of ones enemies nowadays in the oldfashioned melodramatic way bernadine must know quite well that you and i are not the sort of men to walk into a trap of any ones setting just as i am quite sure that he is not the man to risk even a scandal by breaking the law openly  you interest me sogrange said i begin to suspect that you too have made some plans  but naturally peter replied once before bernadine set a trap for me and he nearly had a chance of sending me for a swim in the thames since then one takes precautions as a matter of course we were followed down here and by this time i should imagine that the alarm is given if all was well i was to have telephoned an hour ago  you are really sogrange declared quite an agreeable companion my dear baron you think of everything  the door was suddenly opened bernadine stood upon the threshold and behind him several of the servants  you will oblige me by stepping back into the study my friends he ordered  with great pleasure sogrange answered with alacrity we have no fancy for this room i can assure you  once more they crossed the stone hall and entered the room into which they had first been shown on the threshold peter stopped short and listened it seemed to him that from somewhere upstairs he could hear the sound of a womans sobs he turned to bernadine  the baroness is not unwell i trust he asked  the baroness is as well as she is likely to be for some time bernadine replied grimly  they were all in the study now upon a table stood a telephone instrument bernadine drew a small revolver from his pocket  baron de grost he said i find that you are not quite such a fool as i thought you some one is ringing up for you on the telephone you will reply that you are well and safe and that you will be home as soon as your business here is finished your wife is at the other end if you breathe a single word to her of your approaching end she shall hear through the telephone the sound of the revolver shot that sends you to hell  dear me peter protested i find this most unpleasant if you will excuse me i dont think ill answer the call at all  you will answer it as i have directed bernadine insisted only remember thisif you speak a single illadvised word the end will be as i have said  peter picked up the receiver and held it to his ear  who is there he asked  it was violet whose voice he heard he listened for a moment to her anxious flood of questions  there is not the slightest cause to be alarmed dear he said yes i am down at the high house near st marys bernadine is here it seems that those reports of his death were absolutely unfounded danger unprotected why my dear violet you know how careful i always am simply because bernadine used once to live here and because the baroness was his friend i spoke to sir john dory over the telephone before we left and an escort of halfadozen police followed us they are about the place now i have no doubt but their presence is quite unnecessary i shall be home before long dear yes perhaps it would be as well to send the car down any one will direct him to the housethe high house st marys remember goodby  peter replaced the receiver and turned slowly round bernadine was smiling  you did well to reassure your wife even though it was a pack of lies you told her he remarked  peter shrugged his shoulders contemptuously  my dear bernadine he said up till now i have tried to take you seriously you are really passing the limit i must positively ask you to reflect a little do men who live the life that you and i live trust any one am iis the marquis de sogrange hereafter a lifetime of experience likely to leave the safety of our homes in company with a lady of whom we knew nothing except that she was your companion without precautions i do you the justice to believe you a person of commonsense i know that we are as safe in this house as we should be in our own war cannot be made in this fashion in an overpoliced country like england  do not be too sure bernadine replied there are secrets about this house which have not yet been disclosed to you there are means my dear baron of transporting you into a world where you are likely to do much less harm than here means ready at hand and which would leave no more trace behind than those crumbling ashes can tell of the coal mine from which they came  peter preserved his attitude of bland incredulity  listen he said drawing a whistle from his pocket it is just possible that you are in earnest i will bet you then if you like a hundred pounds that if i blow this whistle you will either have to open your door within five minutes or find your house invaded by the police  no one spoke for several moments the veins were standing out upon bernadines forehead  we have had enough of this folly he cried if you refuse to realize your position so much the worse for you blow your whistle if you will i am content  peter waited for no second bidding he raised the whistle to his lips and blew it loudly and persistently again there was silence bernadine mocked him  try once more dear baron he advised your friends are perhaps a little hard of hearing try once more and when you have finished you and i and the marquis de sogrange will find our way once more to the gun room and conclude that trifling matter of business which brought you here  again peter blew his whistle and again the silence was broken only by bernadines laugh suddenly however that laugh was checked every one had turned toward the door listening a bell was ringing throughout the house  it is the front door one of the servants exclaimed  no one moved as though to put the matter beyond doubt there was a steady knocking to be heard from the same direction  it is a telegram or some late caller bernadine declared hoarsely answer it carl if any one would speak with the baroness she is indisposed and unable to receive if any one desires me i am here  the man left the room they heard him withdraw the chain from the door bernadine wiped the sweat from his forehead as he listened he still gripped the revolver in his hand peter had changed his position a little and was standing now behind a highbacked chair they heard the door creak open a voice outside and presently the tramp of heavy footsteps peter nodded understandingly  it is exactly as i told you he said you were wise not to bet my friend  again the tramp of feet in the hall there was something unmistakable about the sound something final and terrifying bernadine saw his triumph slipping away once more this man who had defied him so persistently was to taste the sweets of victory with a roar of fury he sprang across the room he fired his revolver twice before sogrange with a terrible blow knocked his arm upwards and sent the weapon spinning to the ceiling peter struck his assailant in the mouth but the blow seemed scarcely to check him they rolled on the floor together their arms around one anothers necks it was an affair that but of a moment peter as lithe as a cat was on his feet again almost at once with a torn collar and an ugly mark on his face there were strangers in the room now and the servants had mostly slipped away during the confusion it was sir john dory himself who locked the door bernadine struggled slowly to his feet he was face to face with half a dozen police constables in plain clothes  you have a charge against this man baron the police commissioner asked  peter shook his head  the quarrel between us he replied is not for the police courts although i will confess sir john that your intervention was opportune  i on the other hand sogrange put in demand the arrest of the count von hern and the seizure of all papers in this house i am the bearer of an autograph letter from the president of france in connection with this matter the count von hern has committed extraditable offenses against my country i am prepared to swear an information to that effect  the police commissioner turned to peter  your friends name he demanded  the marquis de sogrange peter told him  he is a person of authority  to my certain knowledge peter replied he has the implicit confidence of the french government  sir john dory made a sign in another moment bernadine would have been arrested it seemed indeed as though nothing could save him now from this crowning humiliation he himself white and furious was at a loss how to deal with an unexpected situation suddenly a thing happened stranger than any one of them there had ever dreamed of so strange that even men such as peter sogrange and dory whose nerves were of iron faced one another doubting and amazed the floor beneath them rocked and billowed like the waves of a canvas sea the windows were filled with flashes of red light a great fissure parted the wall the pictures and bookcases came crashing down beneath a shower of masonry it was the affair of a second above them shone the stars and around them a noise like thunder bernadine who alone understood was the first to recover himself he stood in the midst of them his hands above his head laughing as he looked around at the strange storm laughing like a madman  the wonderful carl he cried oh matchless servant arrest me now if you will you dogs of the police rout out my secrets dear baron de grost tuck them under your arm and hurry to downing street this is the hospitality of the high house my friends it loves you so well that only your ashes shall leave it  his mouth was open for another sentence when he was struck a whole pillar of marble from one of the rooms above came crashing through and buried him underneath a falling shower of masonry peter escaped by a few inches those who were left unhurt sprang through the yawning wall out into the garden sir john sogrange and peter three of the menone limping badly came to a standstill in the middle of the lawn before them the house was crumbling like a pack of cards and louder even than the thunder of the falling structure was the roar of the red flames  the baroness peter cried and took one leap forward  i am here she sobbed running to them from out of the shadows i have lost everythingmy jewels my clothes all except what i have on they gave me but a moments warning  is there any one else in the house peter demanded  no one but you who were in that room she answered  your companion  she shook her head  there was no companion she faltered i thought it sounded better to speak of her i had her place laid at table but she never even existed  peter tore off his coat  there are the others in the room he exclaimed we must go back  sogrange caught him by the shoulder and pointed to a shadowy group some distance away  we are all out but bernadine he said for him were is no hope quick  they sprang back only just in time the outside wall of the house fell with a terrible crash the room which they had quitted was blotted now out of existence from right and left in all directions along the country road came the flashing of lights and little knots of hurrying people  it is the end peter muttered yesterday i should have regretted the passing of a brave enemy today i hail with joy the death of a brute  the baroness who had been sitting upon a garden seat sobbing came softly up to them she laid her fingers upon peters arm imploringly  you will not leave me friendless she begged the papers i promised you are destroyed but many of his secrets are here  she tapped her forehead  madame peter answered i have no wish to know them years ago i swore that the passing of bernadine should mark my own retirement from the world in which we both lived i shall keep my word tonight bernadine is dead tonight sogrange my work is finished the baroness began to sob again  and i thought that you were a man she moaned so gallant so honorable  madame sogrange intervened i shall commend you to the pension list of the doublefour  she dried her eyes  it is not money only i want she whispered her eyes following peter  sogrange shook his head  you have never seen the baroness de grost he asked her  but no  ah sogrange murmured our escort madame is at your serviceas far as london
