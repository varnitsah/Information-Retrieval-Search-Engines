67624118	the yellow god  an idol of africa   by h rider haggard    chapter i  sahara limited  sir robert aylward bart mp sat in his office in the city of london it was a very magnificent office quite one of the finest that could be found within half a mile of the mansion house its exterior was built of aberdeen granite a material calculated to impress the prospective investor with a comfortable sense of security other stucco or even brickbuilt offices might crumble and fall in an actual or a financial sense but this rocklike edifice of granite surmounted by a lifesized statue of justice with her scales admired from either corner by pleasing effigies of commerce and of industry would surely endure any shock earthquake could scarcely shake its strong foundations panic and disaster would as soon affect the bank of england that at least was the impression which it had been designed to convey and not without success  there is so much in externals mr champershaswell sir roberts partner would say in his cheerful voice we are all of us influenced by them however unconsciously impress the public my dear aylward let solemnity without suggest opulence within and the bread or rather the granite which you throw upon the waters will come back to you after many days  mr aylward for this conversation occurred before his merits or the depth of his purse had been rewarded by a baronetcy looked at his partner in the impassive fashion for which he was famous and answered  you mix your metaphors haswell but if you mean that the public are fools who must be caught by advertisement i agree with you only this particular advertisement is expensive and i do not want to wait many days for my reward however Â£20000 one way or the other is a small matter so tell that architect to do the thing in granite  sir robert aylward sat in his own quiet room at the back of this enduring building a very splendid room that any secretary of state might have envied but arranged in excellent taste its walls were panelled with figured teak a rich carpet made the footfall noiseless an antique venus stood upon a marble pedestal in the corner and over the mantelpiece hung a fine portrait by gainsborough that of a certain miss aylward a famous beauty in her day with whom be it added its present owner could boast no connection whatsoever  sir robert was seated at his ebony desk playing with a pencil and the light from a cheerful fire fell upon his face  in its own way it was a remarkable face as he appeared then in his fourth and fortieth year very pale but with a natural pallor very well cut and on the whole impressive his eyes were dark matching his black hair and pointed beard and his nose was straight and rather prominent perhaps the mouth was his weakest feature for there was a certain shiftiness about it also the lips were thick and slightly sensuous sir robert knew this and therefore he grew a moustache to veil them somewhat to a careful observer the general impression given by this face was such as is left by the sudden sight of a waxen mask how strong how lifelike he would have said but of course it isnt real there may be a man behind or there may be wood but thats only a mask many people of perception had felt like this about sir robert aylward namely that under the mask of his pale countenance dwelt a different being whom they did not know or appreciate  if these had seen him at this moment of the opening of our story they might have held that wisdom was justified of her children for now in the solitude of his splendid office of a sudden sir roberts mask seemed to fall from him his face broke up like ice beneath a thaw he rose from his table and began to walk up and down the room he talked to himself aloud  great heavens he muttered what a game to have played and it will go through i believe that it will go through  he stopped at the table switched on an electric light and made a rapid calculation on the back of a letter with a blue pencil  yes he said thats my share a million and seventeen thousand pounds in cash and two million in ordinary shares which can be worked off at a discountlet us say another seven hundred and fifty thousand plus what i have got alreadyput that at only two hundred and fifty thousand net two millions in all which of course may or may not be added to probably not unless the ordinaries boom for i dont mean to speculate any more thats the end of twenty years work robert aylward and to think of it eighteen months ago although i seemed so rich i was on the verge of bankruptcythe very verge not worth five thousand pounds now what did the trick i wonder what did the trick  he walked down the room and stopped opposite the ancient marble staring at it  not venus i think he said with a laugh venus never made any man rich he turned and retraced his steps to the other end of the room which was veiled in shadow here upon a second marble pedestal stood an object that gleamed dimly through the gloom it was about ten inches or a foot high but in that place nothing more could be seen of it except that it was yellow and had the general appearance of a toad for some reason it seemed to attract sir robert aylward for he halted to stare at it then stretched out his hand and switched on another lamp in the hard brilliance of which the thing upon the pedestal suddenly declared itself leaping out of the darkness into light it was a terrible object a monstrosity of indeterminate sex and nature but surmounted by a womans head and face of extraordinary if devilish loveliness sunk back between high but grotesquely small shoulders like to those of a lizard so that it glared upwards the workmanship of the thing was rude yet strangely powerful whatever there is cruel whatever there is devilish whatever there is inhuman in the dark places of the world shone out of the jewelled eyes which were set in that yellow female face yellow because its substance was of gold a face which seemed not to belong to the embryonic legs beneath for body there was none but to float above them a hollow lifesized mask with two tiny froglike legs that was the fashion of it  you are an ugly brute muttered sir robert contemplating this effigy but although i believe in nothing in heaven above or earth below except the abysmal folly of the british public i am bothered if i dont believe in you at any rate from the day when vernon brought you into my office my luck turned and to judge from the smile on your sweet countenance i dont think it is done with yet i wonder what those stones are in your eyes opals i suppose from the way they change colour they shine uncommonly today i never remember them so bright i  at this moment a knock came on the door sir robert turned off the lamp and walked back to the fireplace  come in he said and as he spoke once more his pale face grew impassive and expressionless  the door opened and a clerk entered an imposinglooking clerk with irongrey hair who wore an irreproachable frock coat and patent leather boots advancing to his master he stood respectfully silent waiting to be addressed for quite a long while sir robert looked over his head as though he did not see him it was a way of his then his eyes rested on the man dreamily and he remarked in his cold clear voice  i dont think i rang jeffreys  no sir robert answered the clerk bowing as though he spoke to royalty but there is a little matter about that article in the cynic  press business said sir robert lifting his eyebrows you should know by this time that i do not attend to such details see mr champershaswell or major vernon  they are both out at the moment sir robert  go on then jeffreys replied the head of the firm with a resigned sigh only be brief i am thinking  the clerk bowed again  the cynic people have just telephoned through about that article we sent them i think you saw it sir and you may remember it begins and he read from a typewritten copy in his hand which was headed sahara limited  we are now privileged to announce that this mighty scheme which will turn a desert into a rolling sea bearing the commerce of nations and cause the waste places of the earth to teem with population and to blossom like the rose has been completed in its necessary if dull financial details and will within a few days be submitted to investors among whom it has already caused so much excitement these details we will deal with fully in succeeding articles and therefore now need only pause to say that the basis of capitalization strikes us as wonderfully advantageous to the fortunate public who are asked to participate in its vast prospective prosperity our present object is to speak of its national and imperial aspects  sir robert lifted his eyes in remonstrance  how much more of that exceedingly dull and commonplace puff do you propose to read jeffreys he asked  no more sir robert we are paying the cynic thirty guineas to insert this article and the point is that they say that if they have to put in the national and imperial business they must have twenty more  indeed jeffreys why  because sir roberti will tell you as you always like to hear the truththeir advertisementeditor is of opinion that sahara limited is a national and imperial swindle he says that he wont drag the nation and the empire into it in an editorial under fifty guineas  a faint smile flickered on sir roberts face  does he indeed he asked i wonder at his moderation had i been in his place i should have asked more for really the style is a little flamboyant well we dont want to quarrel with them just nowfeed the sharks but surely jeffreys you didnt come to disturb me about such a trifle  not altogether sir robert there is something more important the daily judge not only declines to put any article whatsoever but refuses our advertisement and states that it means to criticize the prospectus trenchantly  ah said his master after a moments thought that is rather serious since people believe in the judge even when it is wrong offer them the advertisement at treble rates  it has been done sir and they still refuse  sir robert walked to the corner of the room where the yellow object squatted on its pedestal and contemplated it a while as a man often studies one thing when he is thinking of another it seemed to give him an idea for he looked over his shoulder and said  that will do jeffreys when major vernon comes in give him my compliments and say that i should be obliged by a word or two with him  the clerk bowed and went as noiselessly as he had entered  lets see added sir robert to himself old jackson the editor of the judge was a great friend of vernons father the late sir william vernon gcb i believe that he was engaged to be married to his sister years ago only she died or something so the major ought to be able to get round him if anybody can only the worst of it is i dont altogether trust that young gentleman it suited us to give him a share in the business because he is an engineer who knows the country and this sahara scheme was his notion a very good one in a way and for other reasons now he shows signs of kicking over the traces wants to know too much is developing a conscience and so forth as though the promoters of speculative companies had any business with consciences ah here he comes  sir robert seated himself at his desk and resumed his calculations upon a halfsheet of notepaper and that moment a clear hearty voice was heard speaking to the clerks in the outer office then came the sound of a strong firm footstep the door opened and major alan vernon appeared  he was still quite a young man not more than thirtytwo or three years of age though he lacked the ultra robust and rubicund appearance which is typical of so many englishmen of his class at this period of life a heavy bout of blackwater fever acquired on service in west africa which would have killed anyone of weaker constitution had robbed his face of its bloom and left it much sallower if more interesting than once it had been for in a way there was interest about the face also a certain charm it was a good and honest face with a rather eager rather puzzled look that of a man who has imagination and ideas and who searches for the truth but fails to find it as for the charm it lay for the most part in the pleasant open smile and in the frank but rather round brown eyes overhung by a somewhat massive forehead which projected a little or perhaps the severe illness already alluded to had caused the rest of the face to sink though thin the man was bigly built with broad shoulders and welldeveloped limbs measuring a trifle under six feet in height  such was the outward appearance of alan vernon as for his mind it was able enough in certain fashions for instance those of engineering and the soldierlike faculties to which it had been trained frank and kindly also but in other respects not quick perhaps from its unsuspiciousness alan vernon was a man slow to discover ill and slower still to believe in it even when it seemed to be discovered a weakness that may have gone far to account for his presence in the office of those eminent and brilliant financiers messrs aylward  champershaswell just now he looked a little worried like a fish out of water or rather a fish which has begun to suspect the quality of the water something in its smell or taste  jeffreys tells me that you want to see me sir robert he said in his low and pleasant voice looking at the baronet rather anxiously  yes my dear vernon i wish to ask you to do something if you kindly will although it is not quite in your line old jackson the editor of the judge is a friend of yours isnt he  he was a friend of my fathers and i used to know him slightly  well thats near enough as i daresay you have heard he is an unreasonable old beggar and has taken a dislike to our sahara scheme someone has set him against it and he refuses to receive advertisements threatens criticisms etc now the opposition of the judge or any other paper wont kill us and if necessary we can fight but at the same time it is always wise to agree with your enemy while he is in the way and in shortwould you mind going down and explaining his mistake to him  before answering major vernon walked to the window leisurely and looked out  i dont like asking favours from family friends he replied at length and as you said i think it isnt quite my line though of course if it has anything to do with the engineering possibilities i shall be most happy to see him he added brightening  i dont know what it has to do with that is what i shall be obliged if you will find out answered sir robert with some asperity one cant divide a matter of this sort into watertight compartments it is true that in so important a concern each of us has charge of his own division but the fact remains that we are jointly and severally responsible for the whole i am not sure that you bear this sufficiently in mind my dear vernon he added with slow emphasis  his partner moved quickly it might almost have been said that he shivered though whether the movement or the shiver was produced by the argument of joint and several liability or by the familiarity of the my dear vernon remains uncertain perhaps it was the latter since although the elder man was a baronet and the younger only a retired major of engineers the gulf between them as any one of discernment could see was wide they were born lived and moved in different spheres unbridged by any common element or impulse  i think that i do bear it in mind especially of late sir robert answered alan vernon slowly  his partner threw a searching glance on him for he felt that there was meaning in the words but only said  thats all right my motor is outside and will take you to fleet street in no time meanwhile you might tell them to telephone that you are coming and perhaps you will just look in when you get back i havent got to go to the house tonight so shall be here till dinner time and so i think will your cousin haswell muzzle that old bulldog jackson somehow no doubt he has his price like the rest of them in meal or malt and you neednt stick at the figure we dont want him hanging on our throat for the next week or two  ten minutes later the splendid twothousand guinea motor brougham drew up at the offices of the judge and the obsequious motorfootman bowed major vernon through its rather grimy doorway within a small boy in a kind of box asked his business and when he heard his name said that the guvnor had sent down word that he was go up at oncethird floor first to the right and second to the left so up he went and when he reached the indicated locality was taken possession of by a worriedlooking clerk who had evidently been waiting for him and almost thrust through a door to find himself in a big worn untidy room at a huge desk in this room sat an elderly man also big worn and untidylooking who waved a long slip of galleyproof in his hand and was engaged in scolding a subeditor  who is that he said wheeling round im busy cant see anyone  i beg your pardon answered the major with humility your people told me to come up my name is alan vernon  oh i remember sit down for a moment will you andmr thomas oblige me by taking away this rot and rewriting it entirely in the sense i have outlined  mr thomas snatched his rejected copy and vanished through another door whereon his chief remarked in an audible voice  that man is a perfect fool lucky i thought to look at his stuff well he is no worse than the rest in this weary world and he burst into a hearty laugh and swung his chair round adding now then alan what is it i have a quarter of an hour at your service why bless me i was forgetting that its more than a dozen years since we met you were still a boy then and now you have left the army with a dso and gratuity and turned financier which i think wouldnt have pleased your old father come sit down here and let us talk  i didnt leave the army mr jackson answered his visitor it left me i was invalided out they said i should never get my health back after that last go of fever but i did  ah bad luck very bad luck just at the beginning of what should have been a big career for i know they thought highly of you at the war office that is if they can think well you have grown into a finelooking fellow like your father very and someone else too and he sighed running his fingers through his grizzled hair but you dont remember her she was before your time now let us get to business theres no time for reminiscences in this office what is it alan for like other people i suppose that you want something  it is about that sahara flotation mr jackson he began rather doubtfully  the old editors face darkened the sahara flotation that accursed and he ceased abruptly what have you of all people in the world got to do with it oh i remember someone told me that you had gone into partnership with aylward the company promoter and that little beast champershaswell who really is the clever one well set it out set it out  it seems mr jackson that the judge has refused not only our article but also the advertisement of the company i dont know much about this side of the affair myself but sir robert asked me if i would come round and see if things couldnt be arranged  you mean that the man sent you to try and work on me because he knew that i used to be intimate with your family well it is a poor errand and will have a poor end you cantno one on earth can while i sit in this chair not even my proprietors  there was silence broken at last by alan who remarked awkwardly  if that is so i must not take up your time any longer  i said that i would give you a quarter of an hour and you have only been here four minutes now alan vernon tell me as your fathers old friend why you have gone to herd with these gilded swine  there was something so earnest about the mans question that it did not even occur to his visitor to resent its roughness  of course it is not original he answered but i had this idea about flooding the desert i spent a furlough up there a few years ago and employed my time in making some rough surveys then i was obliged to leave the service and went down to yarleys after my fathers deathits mine now you know but worth nothing except a shooting rent which just pays for the repairs there i met champershaswell who lives near and is a kind of distant cousin of minemy mother was a champersand happened to mention the thing to him he took it up at once and introduced me to aylward and the end of it was that they offered me a partnership with a small share in the business because they said i was just the man they wanted  just the man they wanted repeated the editor after him yes the last of the vernons an engineer with an old name in his county a clean record and plenty of ability yes you would be just the man they wanted and you accepted  yes i was on my beam ends with nothing to do i wanted to make some money you see yarleys has been in the family for over five hundred years and it seemed hard to have to sell it alsoalso and he paused  ever meet barbara champers asked mr jackson inconsequently i did once wonderfully nice girl and very goodlooking too but of course you know her and she is her uncles ward and their place isnt far off yarleys you say must be a connection of yours also  major vernon started a little at the name and his face seemed to redden  yes he said i have met her and she is a connection  will be a big heiress one day i think went on mr jackson unless old haswell makes off with her money i think aylward knows that at any rate he was hanging about when i saw her  vernon started again this time very perceptibly  very naturalyour going into the business i mean under all the circumstances went on mr jackson but now if you will take my advice youll go out of it as soon as you can  why  because alan vernon i am sure you dont want to see your name dragged in the dirt any more than i do he fumbled in a drawer and produced a typewritten document take that he said and study it at your leisure its a sketch of the financial career of messrs aylward and champershaswell also of the companies which they have promoted and been connected with and what has happened to them and to those who invested in them a man got it out for me yesterday and im going to use it as regards this sahara business you think it all right and so it may be from an engineering point of view but you will never live to sail upon that sea which the british public is going to be asked to find so many millions to make look here we have only three minutes more so i will come to the point at once its turkish territory isnt it and putting aside everything else the security for the whole thing is a firman from the sultan  yes sir robert aylward and haswell procured it in constantinople i have seen the document  indeed and are you well acquainted with the sultans signature i know when they were there last autumn that potentate was very ill  you mean said major vernon looking up  i mean alan that i like not the security i wont say any more as there is a law of libel in this land but the judge has certain sources of information it may be that no protest will be made at once for baksheesh can stop it for a while but sooner or later the protest or repudiation will come and perhaps some international bother also much scandal as to the scheme itself it is shamelessly overcapitalized for the benefit of the promotersof whom remember alan you will appear as one now times up perhaps you will take my advice and perhaps you wont but there it is for what its worth as that of a man of the world and an old friend of your family as for your puff article and your prospectus i wouldnt put them in the judge if you paid me a thousand pounds which i daresay your friend aylward would be quite ready to do goodbye come and see me again sometime and tell me what has happenedand i saythis last was shouted through the closing doorgive my kind regards to miss barbara for wherever she happens to live she is an honest woman    chapter ii  the yellow god  alan vernon walked thoughtfully down the leadcovered stairs hustled by eager gentlemen hurrying up to see the great editor whose bell was already ringing furiously and was duly ushered by the obsequious assistantchauffeur back into the luxurious motor there was an electric lamp in this motor and by the light of it his mind being perplexed he began to read the typewritten document given to him by mr jackson which he still held in his hand  as it chanced they were blocked for a quarter of an hour near the mansion house so that he found time if not to master it at least to gather enough of its contents to make him open his brown eyes very wide before the motor pulled up at the granite doorway of his office alan descended from the machine which departed silently and stood for a moment wondering what he should do his impulse was to jump into a bus and go straight to his rooms or his club to which sir robert did not belong but being no coward he dismissed it from his mind  his fate hung in the balance of that he was well aware either he must disregard mr jacksons warning confirmed as it was by many secret fears and instincts of his own and say nothing except that he had failed in his mission or he must take the bull by the horns and break with the firm to do the latter meant not only a good deal of moral courage but practical ruin whereas if he chose the former course probably within a fortnight he would find himself a rich man whatever jackson and a few others might say in its depreciation he was certain that the sahara flotation would go through for it was underwritten of course upon terms by responsible people moreover the unissued preferred shares had already been dealt in at a heavy premium now to say nothing of the allotment to which he was entitled upon his holding in the parent syndicate the proportion of cash due to him as a partner would amount to quite a hundred thousand pounds in other words he who had so many reasons for desiring money would be wealthy after working so hard and undergoing so much that he felt to be humiliating and even degrading why should he not take his reward and clear out afterwards  this he remembered he could do since probably by some oversight of aylwards who left such matters to his lawyers his deed of partnership did not bind him to a fixed term it could be broken at any moment to this argument there was only one possible answer that of his conscience if once he were convinced that things were not right it would be dishonest to participate in their profits and he was convinced mr jacksons arguments and his damning document had thrown a flood of light upon many matters which he had suspected but never quite understood he was the partner of well adventurers and the money which he received would in fact be filched from the pockets of unsuspecting persons he would vouch for that of which he was doubtful and receive the price of sharp practice in other words he alan vernon who had never uttered a wilful untruth or taken a halfpenny that was not his own would before the tribunal of his own mind stand convicted as a liar and a thief the thing was not to be borne at whatever cost it must be ended if he were fated to be a beggar at least he would be an honest beggar  with a firm step and a high head he walked straight into sir roberts room without even going through the formality of knocking to find mr champershaswell seated at the ebony desk by his partners side examining some document through a readingglass which on his appearance was folded over and presently thrust away into a drawer it seemed alan noticed to be of an unusual shape and written in some strange character  mr haswell a stout joviallooking little man with a florid complexion and white hair rose at once to greet him  how do you do alan he said in a cheerful voice for as a cousin by marriage he called him by his christian name i am just this minute back from paris and you will be glad to learn that they are going to support us very well there in fact i may say that the government has taken up the scheme of course under the rose you know the french have possessions all along that coast and they wont be sorry to find an opportunity of stretching out their hand a little further our difficulties as to capital are at an end for a full third of it is guaranteed in paris and i expect that small investors and speculators for the rise will gobble a lot more we shall plant Â£10000000 worth of sahara scrip in sunny france my boy and foggy england has underwritten the rest it will be a case of letters of allotment and regret and regret alan financially the most successful issue of the last dozen years what do you say to that and in his elation the little man puffed out his chest and pursing up his lips blew through them making a sound like that of wind among wires  i dont know mr haswell if we are all alive i would prefer to answer the question twelve months hence or later when we see whether the company is going to be a practical success as well or not  again mr haswell made the sound of wind among wires only this time there was a shriller note in it its mellowness was gone it was as though the air had suddenly been filled with frost  a practical success he repeated after him that is scarcely our affair is it promoters should not bother themselves with long views alan these may be left to the investing public the speculative parson and the maiden lady who likes a flutterthose props of modern enterprise but what do you mean you originated this idea and always said that the profits should be great  yes mr haswell on a moderate capitalization and provided that we are sure of the cooperation of the porte  mr haswell looked at him very searchingly and sir robert who had been listening said in his cold voice  i think that we thrashed out these points long ago and to tell you the truth i am rather tired of them especially as it is too late to change anything how did you get on with jackson vernon  i did not get on at all sir robert he will not touch the thing on any terms and indeed means to oppose it tooth and nail  then he will find himself in a minority when the articles come out tomorrow of course it is a bore but we are strong enough to snap our fingers at him you see they dont read the judge in france and no one has ever heard of it in constantinople therefore we have nothing to fearso long as we stick together he added meaningly  alan felt that the crisis had come he must speak now or for ever hold his peace indeed aylward was already looking round for his hat  sir robert and mr haswell he broke in rather nervously i have something to say to you something unpleasant and he paused  then please say it at once vernon i want to dress for dinner i am going to the theatre tonight and must dine early replied aylward in a voice of the utmost unconcern  it is sir robert went on alan with a rush that i do not like the lines upon which this business is being worked and i wish to give up my interest in it and retire from the firm as i have a right to do under our deed of partnership  have you said aylward really i forget but my dear fellow do not think that we should wish to keep you for one moment against your will only might i ask has that old puritan jackson hypnotized you or is it a case of sudden madness after influenza  neither answered alan sternly for although he might be diffident on matters that he did not thoroughly understand he was not a man to brook trifling or impertinence it is what i have said no more nor less i am not satisfied either as to the capitalization or as to the guarantee that the enterprise can be really carried out furtherand he pausedfurther i should like what i have never yet been able to obtain more information as to that firman under which the concession is granted  for one moment a sort of tremor passed over sir roberts impassive countenance while mr haswell uttered his windy whistle this time in a tone of plaintive remonstrance  as you have formally resigned your membership of the firm i do not see that any useful purpose can be served by discussing such matters the fullest explanations of course we should have been willing to give  my dear alan broke in mr champershaswell who was quite upset i do implore you to reflect for one moment for your own sake in a single week you would have been a wealthy man do you really mean to throw away everything for a whim  perhaps vernon remembers that he holds over 1700 of the syndicate shares which we have worked up to Â£18 and thinks it wiser to capture the profit in sight generally speaking a very sound principle interrupted aylward sarcastically  you are mistaken sir robert replied alan flushing the way that those shares have been artificially put up is one of the things to which i most object i shall only ask for mine the face value which i paid for them  now notwithstanding their experience both of the senior partners did for a moment look rather scared such folly or such honesty was absolutely incredible to them they felt that there must be much behind sir robert however recovered instantly  very well he said it is not for us to dictate to you you must make your own bed and lie on it to argue or remonstrate would only be rude he put out his hand and pushed the button of an electric bell adding as he did so of course we understand one thing vernon namely that as a gentleman and a man of honour you will make no public use of the information which you have acquired during your stay in this office either to our detriment personal or financial or to your own advantage  certainly you may understand that replied vernon unless my character is attacked and it becomes necessary for me to defend myself my lips are sealed  that will never happenwhy should it said sir robert with a polite bow  the door opened and the head clerk jeffreys appeared  mr jeffreys said sir robert please find us the deed of partnership between major vernon and ourselves and bring it here one moment please make out also a transfer of major vernons parcel of sahara syndicate shares to mr champershaswell and myself at par value and fill in a cheque for the amount please remove also major vernons name wherever it appears in the proof prospectus andyesone thing more telephone to spectonthe right honourable the earl of specton i mean and say that after all i have been able to arrange that he shall have a seat on the board and a block of shares at a very moderate figure and that if he will wire his assent his name shall be put into the prospectus you approve dont you haswellyesthen that is all i think jeffreys only please be as quick as you can for i want to get away  jeffreys the immaculate and the impassive bowed and casting one swift glance at vernon out of the corner of his eye departed  what is called an awkward pause ensued in fact it was a very awkward pause the die was cast the matter ended and what were the principals to do until the ratifications had been exchanged or a better simile perhaps the decree nisi pronounced absolute mr champershaswell remarked that the weather was very cold for april and alan agreed with him while sir robert found his hat and brushed it with his sleeve then mr haswell in desperation for in minor matters he was a kindly sort of man who disliked scenes and unpleasantness muttered something as to seeing himalanat his house the court in hertfordshire from saturday to monday  that was the arrangement answered alan bluntly but possibly after what has happened you will not wish that it should be kept  oh why not why not said mr haswell sunday is a day of rest when we make it a rule not to talk business and if we did perhaps we might all change our minds about these matters sir robert is coming and i am sure that your cousin barbara will be very disappointed if you do not turn up for she understands nothing about these city things which are greek to her  at the mention of the name of barbara sir robert aylward looked up from the papers which he affected to be tidying and alan thought that there was a kind of challenge in his eyes a moment before he had made up his mind that no power on earth would induce him to spend a sunday with his late partners at the court now acting upon some instinct or impulse he reversed his opinion  thanks he said if that is understood i shall be happy to come i will drive over from yarleys in time for dinner tomorrow perhaps you will say so to barbara  she will be glad i am sure answered mr haswell for she told me the other day that she wants to consult you about some outdoor theatricals that she means to get up in july  in july answered alan with a little laugh i wonder where i shall be in july  then came another pause which seemed to affect even sir roberts nerves for abandoning the papers he walked down the room till he came to the golden object that has been described and for the second time that day stood there contemplating it  this thing is yours vernon he said and now that our relations are at an end i suppose that you will want to take it away what is its history you never told me  oh thats a long story answered alan in an absent voice my uncle who was a missionary brought it from west africa i rather forget the facts but jeekie my negro servant knows them all for as a lad my uncle saved him from sacrifice or something in a place where they worship these things and he has been with us ever since it is a fetish with magical powers and all the rest of it i believe they call it the swimming head and other names if you look at it you will see that it seems to swim between the shoulders doesnt it  yes said sir robert and i admire the beautiful beast she is cruel and artistic likelike finance look here vernon we have quarrelled and of course henceforth are enemies for it is no use mincing matters only fools do that but in a way you are being hardly treated you could get Â£10 apiece today for those shares of yours in a block on the market and i am paying you Â£1 i understand your scruples but there is no reason why we should not square things this fetish of yours has brought me luck so lets do a deal leave it here and instead of a check for Â£1700 i will make you one out for Â£17000  thats a very liberal offer said vernon give me a moment to think it over  then he also walked into the corner of the room and contemplated the golden mask that seemed to float between the froglike shoulders the shimmering eyes drew his eyes though what he saw in them does not matter indeed he could never remember only when he straightened himself again there was left on his mind a determination that not for seventeen or for seventy thousand pounds would he part with his ownership in this very unique fetish  no thank you he said presently i dont think i will sell the yellow god as jeekie calls it perhaps you will kindly keep her here for a week or so until i make up my mind where to stow her  again mr champershaswell uttered his windy whistle that a man should refuse Â£17000 for a bit of african gold worth Â£100 or so struck him as miraculous but sir robert did not seem in the least surprised only very disappointed  i quite understand your dislike to selling he said thank you for leaving it here for the present to see us through the flotation and he laughed  at that moment jeffreys entered the room with the documents sir robert handed the deed of partnership to alan and when he had identified it took it from him again and threw it on the fire saying that of course the formal letter of release would be posted and the dissolution notified in the gazette then the transfer was signed and the cheque delivered  well goodbye till saturday said alan when he had received the latter and nodding to them both he turned and left the room  the passage ran past the little room in which mr jeffreys the head clerk sat alone catching sight of him through the open door alan entered shutting it behind him finding his key ring he removed from it the keys of his desk and of the office strongroom and handed them to the clerk who methodical in everything proceeded to write a formal receipt  you are leaving us major vernon he said interrogatively as he signed the paper  yes jeffreys answered alan then prompted by some impulse added are you sorry  mr jeffreys looked up and there were traces of unwonted emotion upon his hard regulated face  for myself yes majorfor you on the whole no  what do you mean jeffreys i do not quite understand  i mean major that i am sorry because you have never tried to shuffle off any shady business on to my back and leave me to bear the brunt of it also because you have always treated me as a gentleman should not as a machine to be used until a better can be found and kicked aside when it goes out of order  it is very kind of you to say so jeffreys but i cant remember having done anything particular  no major you cant remember what comes natural to you but i and the others remember and thats why i am sorry but for yourself i am glad since although aylward and haswell have put a big thing through and are going to make a pot of money this is no place for the likes of you and now that you are going i will make bold to tell you that i always wondered what you were doing here by and by major the row will come as it has come more than once in the past before your time  and then said alan for he was anxious to get to the bottom of this mans mind which hitherto he had always found so secret  and then major it wont matter much to messrs aylward and champershaswell who are used to that kind of thing and will probably dissolve partnership and lie quiet for a bit and still less to folk like myself who are only servants but if you were still here it would have mattered a great deal to you for it would blacken your name and break your heart and then whats the good of the money i tell you major the clerk went on with quiet intensity though i am nobody and nothing if i could afford it i would follow your example but i cant for i have a sick wife and a family of delicate children who have to live half the year on the south coast to say nothing of my old mother andi was fool enough to be taken in and back sir roberts last little venture which cost me all i had saved so you see i must make a bit before the machine is scrapped major but i tell you this that if i can get Â£5000 together as i hope to do out of saharas before i am a month older for they had to give me a lookin as i knew too much i am off to the country where i was born to take a farm there no more of messrs aylward and haswell for thomas jeffreys thats my bell goodbye major ill take the liberty to write you a line sometimes for i know you wont give me away goodbye and god bless you as i am sure he will in the long run and stretching out his hand he took that of the astonished alan and wrung it warmly  when he was gone alan went also noticing that the clerks whom some rumour of these events seemed to have reached eyed him curiously through the glass screens behind which they sat at their desks as he thought not without regret and a kind of admiration even the magnificent bemedalled porter at the door emerged from the carved teak box where he dwelt and touching his cap asked if he should call a cab  no thank you sergeant answered alan i will take a bus and sergeant i think i forgot to give you a present last xmas will you accept thisi wish i could make it more and he presented him with ten shillings  the sergeant drew himself up and saluted  thank you kindly major he said id rather take that from you than Â£10 from the other gentlemen but major i wish we were out on the west coast again together its a stinking barbarous hole but not so bad as this ere city  for once these two had served as comrades and it was through alan that the sergeant obtained his present lucrative but somewhat uncongenial post  he was outside at last the massive granite portal vanished behind him in the evening mists much as a nightmare vanishes he alan vernon who for a year or more had been in bondage was a free man again all his dreams of wealth had departed indeed if anything save in experience he was poorer than when first the shadow of yonder doorway fell upon him but at least he was safe safe the deed of partnership which had been as a chain about his neck was now white ashes his name was erased from that fearful prospectus of sahara limited wherein millions which someone would provide were spoken of like silver in the days of solomon as things of no account the bitterest critic could not say that he had made a halfpenny out of the venture in fact if trouble came his voluntary abandonment of the profits due to him must go to his credit he had plunged into the icy waters of renunciation and come up clean if naked never since he was a boy could alan remember feeling so utterly lighthearted and free from anxiety not for a million pounds would he have returned to gather gold in that mausoleum of reputations as for the future he did not in the least care what happened there was no one dependent on him and in this way or in that he could always earn a crust a nice honest crust  he ran down the street and danced for joy like a child yes and presented a crossingsweeper against whom he butted with a whole sixpence in compensation thus he reached the mansion house not unsuspected of inebriety by the police and clambered to the top of a bus crowded with weary and anxiouslooking city clerks returning home after a long days labour at starvation wage in that cold company and a chilling atmosphere some of his enthusiasm evaporated he remembered that this step of his meant that sooner or later within a year or two at most yarleys where his family had dwelt for centuries must go to the hammer why had he not accepted aylwards offer and sold that old fetish to him for Â£17000 there was no question of sharedealing there and if a very wealthy man chose to give a fancy price for a curiosity he could take it without doubt or shame at least it would have sufficed to save yarleys which after all was only mortgaged for Â£20000 for the life of him he could not tell he had acted on impulse a very curious impulse and there was an end of it perhaps it might be because his uncle had told him as a boy that the thing was unique or perhaps because old jeekie his negro servant venerated it so much and swore that it was lucky at any rate he had declined and there was an end  but another and a graver matter remained he had desired wealth to save yarleys but he desired it still more for a different purpose above everything on earth he loved barbara his distant cousin and the niece of mr champershaswell who until an hour ago had been his partner now she was a great heiress and without fortune he could not marry her even if she would marry him which remained in doubt for one thing her uncle and guardian haswell under her fathers will had absolute discretion in this matter until she reached the age of twentyfive and for another he was too proud therefore it would seem that in abandoning his business he had abandoned his chance of barbara also which was a truly dreadful thought  well it was in order that he might see her that he had agreed to visit the court on the morrow even though it meant a meeting with his late partners who were the last people with whom he desired to foregather again so soon then and there he made up his mind that before he bade barbara farewell he would tell her the whole story so that she might not misjudge him after that he would go off somewhereto africa perhaps meanwhile he was quite tired out as tired as though he had lain a week in the grip of fever he must eat some food and get to bed sufficient unto the day was the evil thereof yet on the whole he blessed the name of jackson editor of the judge and his fathers old friend    when alan had left the office sir robert turned to mr champershaswell and asked him abruptly what the devil does this mean  mr haswell looked up at the ceiling and whistled in his own peculiar fashion then answered  i cannot say for certain but our young friends strange conduct seems to suggest that he has smelt a rat possibly even that jackson the old beast has shown him a ratof a large turkish breed  sir robert nodded  vernon is a fellow who doesnt like rats they seem to haunt his sleep he said but do you think that having seen it he will keep it in the bag  oh certainly certainly answered mr haswell with cheerfulness the man is the soul of honour he will never give us away look how he behaved about those shares still i think that perhaps we are well rid of him too much honour like too much zeal is a very dangerous quality in any business  i dont know that i agree with you answered sir robert i am not sure that in the long run we should not do better for a little more of the article for my part although it will not hurt us publicly for the thing will never be noticed i am sorry that we have lost vernon very sorry indeed i dont think him a fool and awkward as they may be i respect his qualities  so do i so do i answered mr haswell and of course we have acted against his advice throughout which must have been annoying to him the scheme as he suggested it was a fair business proposition that might have paid ten per cent on a small capital but what is the good of ten per cent to you and me we want millions and we are going to get them well he is coming to the court tomorrow and perhaps after all we shall be able to arrange matters ill give barbara a hint she has great influence with him and you might do the same aylward  miss champers has great influence with everyone who is fortunate enough to know her answered sir robert courteously but even if she chooses to use it i doubt if it will avail in this case vernon has been making up his mind for a long while i have watched him and am sure of that tonight he determined to take the plunge and i do not think that we shall see any more of him in this office haswell he added with sudden energy i tell you that of late our luck has been too good to last the boom the real boom came in with vernon and with vernon i think that it will go  at any rate it must leave something pretty substantial behind it this time aylward my friend whatever happens within a week we shall be rich really rich for life  for life haswell yes for life but what is life a bubble that any pin may prick oh i know that you do not like the subject but it is as well to look it in the face sometimes im no churchgoer but if i remember right we were taught to pray the good lord to deliver us especially in all times of our wealth which is followed by something about tribulation and sudden death for when they wrote that prayer the wheel of human fortune went round just as it does today there lets get out of this before i grow superstitious as men who believe in nothing sometimes do because after all they must believe in something i suppose got your hat and coat so have i come on and he switched off the light so that the room was left in darkness except for the faint glimmering of the fire  his partner grumbled audibly for in turning he had knocked his hand against the desk  leave me my only economy haswell he answered with a hard little laugh electricity is strength and i hate to see strength burning to waste why do you mind he went on as he stepped towards the door is it the contrast in all times of our wealth in all times of our tribulation from sickness and from sudden death  good lord deliver us chimed in mr haswell in a shaking voice behind him what the devils that  sir robert looked round and saw or thought that he saw something very strange from the pillar on which it stood the golden fetish with a womans face appeared to have floated the firelight showed it gliding towards them across but a few inches above the floor of the great room it came very slowly but it came now it reached them and paused and now it rose into the air until it attained the height of mr champershaswell and stayed there staring into his face and not a hands breadth away just as though it were a real woman glaring at him  he uttered a sound half whistle and half groan and fell back as it chanced on to a moroccocovered seat behind him for a moment or two the gleaming golden mask floated in the air then it turned very deliberately rose a little way and moving sidelong to where sir robert stood hung in front of his face  presently aylward staggered to the mantelpiece and began to fumble for the switch in the silence his nails scratching at the panelling made a sound like to that of a gnawing mouse he found it at last and next instant the office broke into a blaze of light showing mr haswell his rubicund face quite pale his hat and umbrella on the floor gasping like a dying man upon the couch and sir robert himself clinging to the mantelshelf as a person might do who had received a mortal wound while the golden fetish reposed calmly on its pillar to all appearance as immovable and undisturbed as the antique venus which matched it at the other end of the room for a while there was silence then sir robert recovering himself asked  did you notice anything unusual just now haswell  yes whispered his partner i thought that hideous african thing which vernon brought here came sliding across the floor and stared into my face with its glittering eyes and in the eyes  well what was in the eyes  i cant remember it was a kind of picture and the meaning of it was sudden deathoh lord sudden death tell me it was a fancy bred of that illomened talk of yours  i cant tell you anything of the sort answered aylward in a hollow voice for i saw something also  what asked his partner  death that wasnt sudden and other things  again the silence fell till it was broken by aylward  come he said we have been overworkingtoo much strain and now the reaction keep this rubbish to yourself or they will lock you up in an asylum  certainly aylward certainly but cant you get rid of that beastly image  not on any account haswell even if it haunts us all day here it shall stop until the saharas are floated on monday if i have to lock it in the strongroom and throw the keys into the thames afterwards vernon can take it as he has a right to do and i am sure that with it will go our luck  then the sooner our luck goes the better replied haswell with a mere ghost of his former whistle life is better than luck andaylward that yellow god you are so fond of means to murder us we are being fatted for the sacrifice that is all i remember now that was one of the things i saw written in its eyes    chapter iii  jeekie tells a tale  the court mr champershaswells place was a very fine house indeed of a sort that is it contained twentynine bedrooms each of them with a bathroom attached a large number of sittingrooms ample garages stables and offices the whole surrounded by several acres of newlyplanted gardens incidentally it may be mentioned that it was built in the most atrocious taste and looked like a suburban villa seen through a magnifying glass  it was in this matter of taste that it differed from sir robert aylwards home old hall a few miles away not that this was old either for the original house had fallen down or been burnt a hundred years before but sir robert being gifted with artistic perception had reared up in place of it a smaller but really beautiful dwelling of soft grey stone long and low and built in the tudor style with many gables  this house charming as it was could not of course compare with yarleys the ancient seat of the vernons in the same neighbourhood yarleys was pure elizabethan although it contained an oakroofed hall which was said to date back to the time of king john a remnant of a former house there was no electric light or other modern convenience at yarleys yet it was a place that everyone went to see because of its exceeding beauty and its historical associations the moat by which it was surrounded the grass court within for it was built on three sides of a square the mullioned windows the towered gateway of red brick the lowpanelled rooms hung with the portraits of departed vernons the sloping park and the splendid oaks that stood about singly or in groups were all of them perfect in their way it was one of the most lovely of english homes and oddly enough its neglected gardens and the air of decay that pervaded it added to rather than decreased its charm  but it is with the court that we have to do at present not with yarleys mr champershaswell had a weekend party there were ten guests all men and with the exception of alan who it will be remembered was one of them all rich and in business they included two french bankers and three jews everyone a prop of the original sahara syndicate and deeply interested in the forthcoming flotation to describe them is unnecessary for they have no part in our story being only financiers of a certain class remarkable for the riches they had acquired by means that for the most part would not bear examination the riches were evident enough ever since the morning the owners of this wealth had arrived by ones or twos in their costly motorcars attended by smart chauffeurs and valets their fur coats their jewelled studs and rings something in their very faces suggested money which indeed was the bond that brought and held them together  alan did not come until it was time to dress for dinner for he knew that barbara would not appear before that meal and it was her society he sought not that of his host or fellow guests accompanied by his negro servant jeekie for in a house like this it was necessary to have someone to wait upon him he drove over from yarleys a distance of ten miles arriving about eight oclock  mr haswell as gone up to dress major and so have the other gentlemen said the head butler mr smith but miss champers told me to give you this note and to say that dinner is at halfpast eight  alan took the note and asked to be shown to his room once there although he had only five and twenty minutes he opened it eagerly while jeekie unpacked his bag  dear alan it ran dont be late for dinner or i may not be able to keep a place next to me of course sir robert takes me in they are a worse lot than usual this time odiousodiousand i cant stand one on the left hand as well as on the right yours  b   ps what have you been doing our distinguished guests to say nothing of my uncle seem to be in a great fuss about you i overheard them talking when i was pretending to arrange some flowers one of them called you a sanctimonious prig and an obstinate donkey and another answeredi think it was sir robert no doubt but obstinate donkeys can kick and have been known to upset other peoples applecarts ere now is the sahara syndicate the applecart if so ill forgive you  pps remember that we will walk to church together tomorrow but come down to breakfast in knickerbockers or something to put them off and ill do the samei mean ill dress as if i were going to golf we can turn into christians later if we dontdress like that i meantheyll guess and all want to come to church except the jews which would bring the judgment of heaven on us  ppps dont be careless and leave this note lying about for the underfootman who waits upon you reads all the letters he steams them over a kettle smith the butler is the only respectable man in this house  alan laughed outright as he finished this peculiar and outspoken epistle which somehow revived his spirits that since the previous day had been low enough it refreshed him it was like a breath of frosty air from an open window blowing clean and cold into a scented overheated room he would have liked to keep it but remembering barbaras injunctions and the underfootman threw it onto the fire and watched it burn jeekie coughed to intimate that it was time for his master to dress and alan turned and looked at him in an absentminded fashion  he was worth looking at was jeekie let the reader imagine a very tall and powerfullybuilt negro with a skin as black as a wellpolished boot woolly hair as white as snow a little tufted beard also white a hand like a leg of mutton but with long delicate fingers and pink filbertshaped nails an immovable countenance but set in it beneath a massive brow two extraordinary humorous and eloquent black eyes which expressed every emotion passing through the brain behind them that is when their owner chose to allow them to do so such was jeekie  shall i unlace your boots major he said in his full melodious voice and speaking the most perfect english i expect that the gong will sound in nine and a half minutes  then let it sound and be hanged to it answered alan no i forgoti must hurry jeekie put that fire out and open all the windows as soon as i go down this room is like a hothouse  yes major the fire shall be extinguished and the sleepingchamber ventilated the other boot if you please major  jeekie said alan who is stopping in this place have you heard  i collected some names on my way upstairs major three of the gentlemen you have never met before but he added suddenly breaking away from his highflown booklearned english as was his custom when in earnest jeekie think they just black niggers like the rest thief people there aint a white man in this house except you and miss barbara and me major jeekie learnt all that in servants hall palaver no not now other time everyone tell everything to jeekie poor old african fool and he look up an answer o law you dont say so but keep his eyes and ears open all the same  ill be bound you do jeekie replied alan laughing again well go on keeping them open and give me those trousers  yes major answered jeekie reassuming his grand manner i shall continue to collect information which may prove to your advantage but personally i wish that you were clear of the whole caboodle except miss barbara  hear hear ejaculated alan there goes the gong mind you come in and help to wait and hurrying into his coat he departed downstairs  the guests were gathered in the hall drinking sherry and bitters a proceeding that to alans mind set a stamp upon the house his host mr champershaswell came forward and greeted him with much affectionate enthusiasm and alan noticed that he looked very pale also that his thoughts seemed to be wandering for he introduced a french banker to him as a noted jew and the noted jew as the french banker although the distinction between them was obvious and the gentlemen concerned evidently resented the mistake sir robert aylward catching sight of him came across the hall in his usual direct fashion and shook him by the hand  glad to see you vernon he said fixing his piercing eyes upon alan as though he were trying to read his thoughts pleasant change this from the city and all that eternal business isnt it ah you are thinking that one is not quite clear of business after all and he glanced round at the company thats one of your cousin haswells faults he can never shake himself free of the thing never get any real recreation id bet you a sovereign that he has a stenographer waiting by a telephone in the next room just in case any opportunity should arise in the course of conversation that is magnificent but it is not wise his heart cant stand it it will wear him out before his time listen they are all talking about the sahara i wish i were there it must be quiet at any rate the sands beneath the eternal stars above yes i wish i were there he repeated with a sigh and alan noted that although his face could not be more pallid than its natural colour it looked quite worn and old  so do i he answered with enthusiasm  then a french gentleman on his left having discovered that he was the engineer who had formulated the great flooding scheme began to address him as cher maitre speaking so rapidly his own language that alan whose french was none of the best struggled after him in vain whilst he was trying to answer a question which he did not understand the door at the end of the hall opened and through it appeared barbara champers  it was a large hall and she was a long way off which caused her to look small who indeed was only of middle height yet even at that distance it was impossible to mistake the dignity of her appearance a slim woman with brown hair cheerful brown eyes a wellmodelled face a rounded figure and an excellent complexion such was barbara ten thousand young ladies could be found as good or even better looking yet something about her differentiated her from the majority of her sex there was determination in her step and overflowing health and vigour in her every movement her eyes had a trick of looking straight into any other eyes they met not boldly but with a kind of virginal fearlessness and enterprise that people often found embarrassing indeed she was extremely virginal and devoid of the usual fringe of feminine airs and graces a nymph of the woods and waters who although she was three and twenty as yet recked little of men save as companions whom she liked or disliked according to her instincts for the rest she was sweetly dressed in a white robe with silver on it and wore no ornaments save a row of small pearls about her throat and some lilies of the valley at her breast  barbara came straight onwards looking neither to the right or to the left till she reached her uncle to whom she nodded then she walked to alan and offering him her hand said  how do you do why did you not come over at lunch time i wanted to play a round of golf with you this afternoon  alan answered something about being busy at yarleys  yarleys she replied i thought that you lived in the city now making money out of speculations like everyone else that i know  why miss champers broke in sir robert reproachfully i asked you to play a round of golf before tea and you would not  no she answered because i was waiting for my cousin we are better matched sir robert  there was something in her voice usually so soft and pleasant as she spoke these words something of steeliness and defiance that caused alan to feel at once happy and uncomfortable apparently also it caused aylward to feel angry for he flashed a glance at alan over her head of which the purport could not be mistaken though his pale face remained as immovable as ever we are enemies i hate you said that glance probably barbara saw it at any rate before either of them could speak again she said  thank goodness there is dinner at last sir robert will you take me in and alan will you sit on the other side of me my uncle will show the rest their places  the meal was long and magnificent the price of each dish of it would have kept a poor family for a month and on the cost of the exquisite wines they might have lived for a year or two also the last were well patronized by everyone except barbara who drank water and alan who since his severe fever took nothing but weak whiskey and soda and a little claret even aylward a temperate person absorbed a good deal of champagne as a consequence the conversation grew animated and under cover of it while sir robert was arguing with his neighbour on the left barbara asked in a low voice  what is the row alan tell me i cant wait any longer  i have quarrelled with them he answered staring at his mutton as though he were criticizing it i mean i have left the firm and have nothing more to do with the business  barbaras eyes lit up as she whispered back  glad of it best news i have heard for many a day but then may i ask why you are here  i came to see you he replied humblythought perhaps you wouldnt mind and in his confusion he let his knife fall into the mutton whence it rebounded staining his shirt front  barbara laughed that happy delightful little laugh of hers presumably at the accident with the knife whether or no she minded did not appear only she handed her handkerchief a costly lastfringed trifle to alan to wipe the gravy off his shirt which he took thinking it was a napkin and as she did so touched his hand with a little caressing movement of her fingers whether this was done by chance or on purpose did not appear either at least it made alan feel extremely happy also when he discovered what it was he kept that gravystained handkerchief nor did she ever ask for it back again only once in after days when she happened to come across it stuffed away in the corner of a despatchbox she blushed all over and said that she had no idea that any man could be so foolish out of a book  now that you are really clear of it i am going for them she said presently when the wiping process was finished i have only restrained myself for your sake and leaning back in her chair she stared at the ceiling lost in meditation  presently there came one of those silences which will fall upon dinnerparties at times however excellent and plentiful the champagne  sir robert aylward said barbara in that clear carrying voice of hers will you as an expert instruct a very ignorant person i want a little information  miss champers he answered am i not always at your service and all listened to hear upon what point their hostess desired to be enlightened  sir robert she went on calmly everyone here is i believe what is called a financier that is except myself and major vernon who only tries to be and will i am sure fail since nature made him something else a soldier andwhat else did nature make you alan  as he vouchsafed no answer to question although sir robert muttered an uncomplimentary one between his lips which barbara heard or read she continued  and you are all very rich and successful are you not and are going to be much richer and much more successfulnext week now what i want to ask you ishow is it done  accepting the premises for the sake of argument miss champers replied sir robert who felt that he could not refuse the challenge the answer is that it is done by finance  i am still in the dark she said finance as i have heard of it means floating companies and companies are floated to earn money for those who invest in them now this afternoon as i was dull i got hold of a book called the directory of directors and looked up all your names in it except those of the gentlemen from paris and the companies that you directi found out about those in another book well i could not make out that any of these companies have ever earned any money a dividend dont you call it therefore how do you all grow so rich and why do people invest in them  now sir robert frowned alan coloured two or three of the company laughed outright and one of the french gentlemen who understood english and had already drunk as much as was good for him remarked loudly to his neighbour ah she is charming she do touch the spot like that ointment you give me today how do we grow rich and why do the people invest mon dieu why do they invest that is the great mystery i say that cette belle demoiselle votre niÃ¨ce est ravissante elle a desprit mon ami haswell  apparently her uncle did not share these sentiments for he turned as red as any turkeycock and said across the great round table  my dear barbara i wish that you would leave matters which you do not understand alone we are here to dine not to talk about finance  certainly uncle she answered sweetly i stand or rather sit reproved i suppose that i have put my foot into it as usual and the worst of it is she added turning to sir robert that i am just as ignorant as i was before  if you want to master these matters miss champers said aylward with a rather forced laugh you must go into training and worship at the shrine ofhe meant to say mammon then thinking that the word sounded unpleasant substitutedthe yellow god as we do  at these words alan who had been studying his plate looked up quickly and her uncles face turned from red to white but the irrepressible barbara seized upon them  the yellow god she repeated do you mean money or that fetish thing of major vernons with the terrible womans face that i saw at the office in the city well to change the subject tell us alan what is that yellow god of yours and where did it come from  my uncle austin who was my mothers brother and a missionary brought it from west africa a great many years ago he was the first to visit the tribe who worship it in fact i do not think that anyone has ever visited them since but really i do not know all the story jeekie can tell you about it if you want to know for he is one of that people and escaped with my uncle  now jeekie having left the room some of the guests wished to send for him but mr champershaswell objected the end of it was that a compromise was effected alan undertaking to produce his retainer afterwards when they went to play billiards or cards    dinner was over at length and the diners who had dined well were gathered in the billiard room to smoke and amuse themselves as they wished it was a very large room sixty feet long indeed with a wide space in the centre between the two tables which was furnished as a lounge when the gentlemen entered it they found barbara standing by the great fireplace in this central space a little shape of white and silver in its emptiness  forgive me for intruding on you she said and please do not stop smoking for i like the smell i have sat up expressly to hear jeekies story of the yellow god alan produce jeekie or i shall go to bed at once  her uncle made a movement as though to interfere but sir robert said something to him which appeared to cause him to change his mind while the rest in some way or another signified an enthusiastic assent all of them were anxious to see this jeekie and hear his tale if he had one to tell so jeekie was sent for and presently arrived clad in the dress clothes which are common to all classes in england and america there he stood before them whiteheaded ebonyfaced gigantic imperturbable there is no doubt that his appearance produced an effect for it was unusual and indeed striking  you sent for me major he said addressing his master to whom he gave a military salute for he had been alans servant when he was in the army  yes jeekie miss barbara here and these gentlemen wish you to tell them all that you know about the yellow god  the negro started and rolled his round eyes upwards till the whites of them showed then began in his schoolbook english  that is a private subject major upon which i should prefer not to discourse before this very public company  a chorus of remonstrance arose and one of the jewish gentlemen approaching jeekie slipped a couple of sovereigns into his great hand which he promptly transferred to his pocket without seeming to notice them  jeekie said barbara dont disappoint me  very well miss i fall in with your wishes the yellow god that all these gentlemen worship quite another god to that of which you desire that i should tell you you know all about him my god is of female sex  at this statement his audience burst into laughter while jeekie rolled his eyes again and waited till they had finished my god he went on presently i mean gentlemen the god i used to pray to for i am a good christian now has so much gold that she does not care for any more and he paused  then what does she care for asked someone  blood answered jeekie she is god of death her name is little bonsa or small swimming head she is wife of big bonsa or great swimming head  again there was laughter though less generalfor instance neither sir robert nor mr champershaswell laughed this merriment seemed to excite jeekie at any rate it caused him to cease his stilted talk and relapse into the strange vernacular that is common to all negroes tinctured with a racy slang that was all his own  you want to hear yellow god palaver he said rapidly very well i tell you you cocksure white men who think you know everything but know nothing at all my people people of the asiki that mean people of spirits what you call ghosts and say you no believe in but always look for behind door they worship yellow god bonsa big and bonsa little worship both and call them one only little bonsa on trip to this country just now and sit and think in city office yellow god live long way up a great river then turn to the left and walk six days through big forest where dwarf people shoot you with poisoned arrow then turn to the right walk up stream where many wild beasts then turn to the left again and go in canoe through swamp where you die of fever and across lake then walk over grassland and mountains then in kloof of the mountains where big black trees make a roof and river fall like thunder find asiki and gold house of the yellow god all that mountain gold full of gold and beneath gold house yellow god afloat in water she what you call queen priestess live there also always there very beautiful woman called asika with face like yellow god cruel cruel she take a husband every year and every year he die because she always hunt for right man but never find him  does she kill him then asked barbara  oh no she no kill him miss he kill himself at end of year glad to get away from asika and go to spirits while he live he have a very good time plenty to eat plenty wives fine house much gold as he like only nothing to spend it on pretty necklace nice paint for face but asika little bit by little bit she eat up his spirit he see too many ghosts the house where he sleep with dead men who once have his billet full of ghosts and every night there come more and sit with him sit all round him look at him with great eyes just like you look at me till at last when asika finish eating up his spirit he go crazy he howl like man in hell he throw away all the gold they give him and then sometimes after one week sometimes after one month sometimes after one year if he be strong but never more he run out at night and jump into canal where yellow god float and god get him while asika sit on the bank and laugh cause she hungry for new man to eat up his spirit too  jeekies big voice died away to a whisper and ceased there was a silence in the room for even in the shine of the electric light and through the fumes of champagne in more than one imagination there rose a vision of that haunted water in which floated the great yellow god and of some mad being casting himself to his death beneath the moon while his beautiful witch wife who was hungry for more spirits sat upon its edge and laughed although his language was now commonplace enough even ludicrous at times the negro had undoubtedly the art of narration his auditors felt that he spoke of what he knew or had seen that the very recollection of it frightened him therefore he frightened them  again barbara broke the silence which she felt to be awkward  why do more ghosts come very night to sit with the queens husband jeekie she asked where do they come from  out of the dead miss dead husbands of asika from beginning of the world what they call munganas also always they make sacrifice to yellow god from far far away them poor niggers send people to be sacrifice that their house or tribe get luck sometimes they send kings sometimes great men sometimes doctors sometimes women what have twin babies also the asiki bring people what is witches or have drunk poison stuff which blacks call muavi and have not been sick or perhaps son they love best to take curse off their roof all these come to yellow god then asiki doctor they have deathpalaver on night of full moon they beat drum and drum go wow wow wow and doctors pick out those to die that month once they pick out jeekie oh good lord they pick out me and as he said the words he gasped and with his great hand wiped off the sweat that started from his brow but yellow god no take jeekie that time no want him and i escape  how asked sir robert  with my master majors uncle reverend austin he who come try to make asiki christian he snap his fingers put on small mask of yellow god which he prig little bonsa herself that same face which sit in your office now and he pointed to sir robert like one toad upon a stone priests think that god make herself into man want holiday take me out into forest to kill me and eat my life so they let us go by and we go just as though devil kick usfast fast and never see the asiki any more but little bonsa i bring with me for luck tell truth i no dare leave her behind she not stand that and now she sit in your office and think and think and make magic there that why you grow rich because she know you worship her  thats a nice way for a baptized christian to talk said barbara adding but jeekie what do you mean when you say that the god did not take you  i mean this miss when victim offered to big yellow god priestmen bring him to edge of canal where the great god float then if yellow god want him it turn and swim across water  swim across water i thought you said it was only a mask of gold  i dont know miss perhaps man inside the mask perhaps spirit i say it swim across water in the night always in the night and lift itself up and look in victims face then priest take him and kill him sometimes one waysometimes another or if he escape and they not kill him all same for that johnnie he die in about one year always die no one ever live long if yellow god swim to him in dark and rise up and smile in his face no matter if it big bonsa or little bonsa for they man and wife joined in holy matrimony and either do trick  as these words left jeekies lips alan became aware of some unusual movement on his left and looking round saw that mr champershaswell who stood by him had dropped the cigar which he held and white as a sheet was swaying to and fro indeed in another instant he would have fallen had not alan caught him in his arms and supported him till others came to his assistance when between them they carried him to a sofa on their way they passed a table where spirits and soda water were set out and to his astonishment alan noticed that sir robert aylward looking little if at all better than his partner had helped himself to half a tumbler of cognac which he was swallowing in great gulps then there was confusion and someone went to telephone the doctor while the deep voice of jeekie was heard exclaiming  that yellow god at workoh yes little bonsa on the job jeekie christian man but no doubt she very powerful fetish and can do anything she like to them that worship her and you see she sit in office of these gentlemen spect she make reverend austin and me bring her to england because she got eye on firm of messrs aylward  haswell london ec oh shouldnt wonder at all for bonsa know everything  oh confound you and your fetish be off you old donkey almost shouted alan  major replied the offended jeekie assuming his grand manner and language it was not i who wished to narrate this history of bloodstained superstitions of poor african mustnt blame old jeekie if they make christian gents sick as channel steamer  be off repeated alan stamping his foot  so jeekie went but outside the door as it chanced he encountered one of the jew gentlemen who also appeared to be a little sick an idea striking him he touched his white hair with his finger and said  you like jeekies pretty story sir well jeekie think that if you make little present to him like your brother in there it please yellow god very much and bring you plenty luck  then acting upon some unaccustomed impulse that jew became exceedingly generous in his pocket was a handful of sovereigns which he had been prepared to stake at bridge he grasped them all and thrust them into jeekies outstretched palm where they seemed to melt  thank you sir said jeekie now i sure you have plenty luck just like your grandpa jacob in book when he do his brudder in eye    chapter iv  alan and barbara  there was no bridge or billiards at the court that night where ordinarily the play ran high enough after mr haswell had been carried to his room some of the guests among them sir robert aylward went to bed remarking that they could do no good by sitting up while others more concerned waited to hear the verdict of the doctor who must drive from six miles away he came and half an hour later barbara entered the billiard room and told alan who was sitting there smoking that her uncle had recovered from his faint and that the doctor who was to stay all night said that he was in no danger only suffering from a heart attack brought on apparently by overwork or excitement  when alan woke next morning the first thing that he heard through his open window was the sound of the doctors departing dogcart then jeekie appeared and told him that mr haswell was all right again but that all night he had shaken like one jelly alan asked what had been the matter with him but jeekie only shrugged his shoulders and said that he did not knowperhaps yellow god touch him up  at breakfast as in her note she had said she would barbara appeared wearing a short skirt sir robert who was there also looked extremely pale even for him and with black rims round his eyes asked her if she were going to golf to which she answered that she would think it over it was a somewhat melancholy meal and as though by common consent no mention was made of jeekies tale of the yellow god and beyond the usual polite inquiries very little of their hosts seizure  as barbara went out she whispered to alan who opened the door for her meet me at halfpast ten in the kitchen garden  accordingly having changed his clothes surreptitiously alan avoiding the others made his way by a circuitous route to this kitchen garden which after the fashion of modern places was hidden behind a belt of trees nearly a quarter of a mile from the house here he wandered about till presently he heard barbaras pleasant voice behind him saying  dont dawdle so we shall be late for church  so they started somewhat furtively like runaway children as they went alan asked how her uncle was  all right now she answered but he has had a bad shake it was that yellow god story which did it i know for i was there when he was coming to with sir robert he kept talking about it in a confused manner saying that it was swimming to him across the floor till at last sir robert bent over him and told him to be quiet quite sternly do you know alan i believe that your pet fetish has been manifesting itself in some unpleasant fashion up there in the office  indeed if so it must be since i left for i never heard of anything of the sort nor are aylward and your uncle likely people to see ghosts in fact sir robert wished to give me about Â£17000 for the thing only the day before yesterday which doesnt look as though it had been frightening him  well he wont repeat the offer alan for i heard him promise my uncle only this morning that it should be sent back to yarleys at once but why did he want to buy it for such a lot of money tell me quickly alan i am dying to hear the whole story  so he began and told her omitting nothing while she listened eagerly to every word hardly interrupting him at all as he finished his tale they reached the door of the quaint old village church just as the clock was striking eleven  come in alan she said gently and thank heaven for all its mercies for you should be a grateful man today  then without giving him time to answer she entered the church and they took their places in the great square pew that for generations had been occupied by the owners of the ancient house which mr haswell pulled down when he built the court there were their monuments upon the wall and their gravestones in the chancel floor but now no one except barbara ever sat in their pew even the benches set aside for the servants were empty for those who frequented the court were not churchgoers and like master like man indeed the gentlefaced old clergyman looked quite pleased and surprised when he saw two inhabitants of that palatial residence amongst his congregation although it is true that barbara was his friend and helper  the simple service went on the first lesson was read it cried woe upon them that joined house to house and field to field that draw iniquity with cords of vanity and sin as it were with a cart rope that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that justify the wicked for reward that feast full but regard not the work of the lord neither consider the operation of his hand for of such it prophesied that their houses great and fair should be without inhabitant and desolate  it was very well read and alan listening thought that the denunciations of the old seer of thousands of years ago were not inappropriate to the dwellers in some houses great and fair of his own day who whatever they did or left undone regarded not the work of the lord neither considered the operation of his hand perhaps barbara thought so too at any rate a rather sad little smile appeared once or twice upon her sweet firm face as the immortal poem echoed down the aisle  the peace that passeth understanding was invoked upon their heads and rising with the rest of the scanty congregation they went away  shall we walk home by the woods alan asked barbara it is three miles round but we dont lunch till two  he nodded and presently they were alone in those woods the beautiful woods through which the breath of spring was breathing treading upon carpets of bluebells violet and primrose quite alone unaccompanied save by the wild things that stole across their path undisturbed save by the sound of the singing birds and of the wind among the trees  what did you mean barbara when you said that i should be a grateful man today asked alan presently  barbara looked him in the eyes in that open virginal fashion of hers and answered in the words of the lesson woe unto them that draw iniquity with the cords of vanity and sin as it were with a cartrope that lay house to house and through an opening in the woods she pointed to the roof of the court standing on one hill and to the roof of old hall standing upon anotherand field to field and with a sweep of her hand she indicated all the country round for many houses great and fair that have music in their feasts shall be left desolate then turning she said  do you understand now alan  i think so he answered you mean that i have been in bad company  very bad alan one of them is my own uncle but the truth remains the truth alan they are no better than thieves all this wealth is stolen and i thank god that you have found it out in time before you became one of them in heart as well as in name  if you refer to the sahara syndicate he said the idea is sound enough indeed i am responsible for it the thing can be done great benefits would result too long to go into  yes yes alan but you know that they never mean to do it they only mean to get the millions from the public i have lived with my uncle for ten years ever since my poor father died and i know the backstairs of the business there have been half a dozen schemes like this and although they have had their bad times very bad times he and sir robert have grown richer and richer but what has happened to those who have invested in them oh let us drop the subject it is unpleasant for myself it doesnt matter because although it isnt under my control i have money of my own you know we are a plebeian lot on the male side my grandfather was a draper in a large way of business my father was a coalmerchant who made a great fortune his brother my uncle in whom my father always believed implicitly took to what is called finance and when my father died he left me his only child in his guardianship until i am five and twenty i cannot even marry or touch a halfpenny without his consent in fact if i should marry against his will the most of my money goes to him  i expect that he has got it already said alan  no i think not i found out that although it is not mine it is not his he cant draw it without my signature and i steadily refuse to sign anything again and again they have brought me documents and i have always said that i would consider them at five and twenty when i came of age under my fathers will i went on the sly to a lawyer in kingswell and paid him a guinea for his advice and he put me up to that sign nothing he said and i have signed nothing so except by forgery nothing can have gone still for all that it may have gone for anything i know i am not worth more than the clothes i stand in although my father was a very rich man  if so we are about in the same boat barbara alan answered with a laugh for my present possessions are yarleys which brings in about Â£100 a year less than the interest on its mortgages and cost of upkeep and the Â£1700 that aylward paid me back on friday for my shares if i had stuck to them i understand that in a week or two i should have been worth Â£100000 and now you see here i am over thirty years of age without a profession invalided out of the army and having failed in finance a mere bit of driftwood without hope and without a trade  barbaras brown eyes grew soft with sympathy or was it tears  you are a curious creature alan she said why didnt you take the Â£17000 for that fetish of yours it would have been a fair deal and have set you on your legs  i dont know he answered dejectedly it went against the grain so what is the use of talking about it i think my old uncle austin told me it wasnt to be parted withno perhaps it was jeekie bother the yellow god it is always cropping up  yes replied barbara the yellow god is always cropping up especially in this neighbourhood  they walked on a while in silence till suddenly barbara sat down upon a bole of felled oak and began to cry  what is the matter with you asked alan  i dont know she answered everything goes wrong i live in a kind of gilded hell i dont like my uncle and i loath the men he brings about the place i have no friends i scarcely know a woman intimately i have troubles i cant tell you andi am wretched you are the only creature i have left to talk to and i suppose that after this row you must go away too to make your living  alan looked at her there weeping on the log and his heart swelled within him for he had loved this girl for years  barbara he gasped please dont cry it upsets me you know you are a great heiress  that remains to be proved she answered but anyway what has it to do with the case  it has everything to do with it at least so far as i am concerned if it hadnt been for that i should have asked you to marry me a long while ago because i love you as i would now but of course it is impossible  barbara ceased her weeping wiped her eyes with the back of her hand and looked up at him  alan she said i think that you are the biggest fool i ever knewnot but that a fool is rather refreshing when one lives among knaves  i know i am a fool he answered if i wasnt i should not have mentioned my misfortune to you but sometimes things are too much for one forget it and forgive me  oh yes she said i forgive you a woman can generally forgive a man for being fond of her whatever she may be she is ready to take a lenient view of his human weakness but as to forgetting that is a different matter i dont exactly see why i should be so anxious to forget who havent many people to care about me and she looked at him in quite a new fashion one indeed which gave him something of a shock for he had not thought the nymphlike barbara capable of such a look as that she and any sort of passion had always seemed so far apart  now after all alan was very much a man if a modest one with all a mans instincts and therefore there are appearances of the female face which even such as he could not entirely misinterpret  youdontmean he said doubtfully you dont really mean and he stood hesitating before her  if you would put your question a little more clearly alan i might be able to give you an answer she replied that quaint little smile of hers creeping to the corners of her mouth like sunshine through a mist of rain  you dont really mean he went on that you care anything about me like like i have cared for you for years  oh alan she said laughing outright why in the name of goodness shouldnt i care about you i didnt say that i do mind but why shouldnt i what is the gulf between us  the old one he answered that between dives and lazarusthat between the rich and the poor  alan said barbara looking down i dont know what has come over me but for some unexplained and inexplicable reason i am inclined to give lazarus a leadacross that gulf the first one i mean not the second  like the glance which preceded it this was a saying that even alan could not misunderstand he sat himself on the log beside her while she still looking down watched him out of the corners of her eyes he went red he went white his heart beat very violently then he stretched out his big brown hand and took her small white one and as this familiarity produced no remonstrance let it fall and passing his arm about her drew her to him and embraced her not once but often with such vigour that a squirrel which had been watching these proceedings from a neighbouring tree bolted round it scandalized and was seen no more  i love you i love you he said huskily  so i gather she answered in a feeble voice  do you care for me he asked  it would seem that i must alan otherwise i should scarcelyoh you foolish alan and heedless of her sunday hat which never recovered from this encounter but was kept as a holy relic she let her head fall upon his shoulder and began to cry again this time for very happiness  he kissed her tears away then as he could think of nothing else to say asked her if she would marry him  it is the general sequel to this kind of thing i believe she answered or at any rate it ought to be but if you want a direct answeryes i will if my uncle will let me which he wont as you have quarrelled with him or at any rate two years hence when i am five and twenty and my own mistress that is if we have anything to marry on for one must eat at present our worldly possessions seem to consist chiefly of a large store of mutual affection a good stock of clothes and one yellow god which after what happened last night i do not think you will get another chance of turning into cash  i must make money somehow he said  yes alan but i am afraid it is not easy to dohonestly nobody wants people without capital whose only stock in trade is a brief but distinguished military career and a large experience of african fever  alan groaned at this veracious but discouraging remark and she went on quickly  i mean to spend another guinea upon my friend the lawyer at kingswell perhaps he can raise the wind by a postobit or something she added vaguely i mean a postuncleobit  if he does barbara i cant live on your money alone it isnt right  oh dont you trouble about that alan if once i can get hold of those dim thousands you will soon be able to make more for unto him that hath shall be given but at present they are very dim and for all i know may be represented by stock in deceased companies in short the financial position is extraordinarily depressed as they say in the market intelligence in the times but thats no reason why we should be depressed also  no barbara for at any rate we have got each other  yes she answered springing up we have got each other dear until death do us part and somehow i dont think hell do that yet awhile it comes into my heart that he wont do that alan that you and i are going to live out our days so what does the rest matter in two years i shall be a free woman in fact if the worst comes to the worst ill defy them all and she set her little mouth like a rock and marry you straight away as being over age i can do even if it costs me every halfpenny that ive got  no no he said it would be wrong wrong to yourself and wrong to your descendants  very well alan then we will wait or perhaps luck will come our waywhy shouldnt it at any rate for my part i never felt so happy in my life for dear alan we have found what we were born to find found it once and for always and the rest is mere etceteras what would be the use of all the gold of the asiki people that jeekie was talking about last night to either of us if we had not each other we can get on without the wealth but we couldnt get on apart or at least i couldnt and i dont mind saying so  no my darling no he answered turning white at the very thought we couldnt get on apartnow in fact i dont know how i have done so so long already except that i was always hoping that a time would come when we shouldnt be apart that is why i went into that infernal business to make enough money to be able to ask you to marry me and now i have gone out of the business and asked you just when i shouldnt  yes so you see you might as well have done it a year or two ago when perhaps things would have been simpler well it is a fine example of the vanity of human plans and alan we must be going home to lunch if we dont sir robert will be organizing a search party to look for us in fact i shouldnt wonder if he is doing that already in the wrong direction  the mention of sir robert aylwards name fell on them both like a blast of cold wind in summer and for a while they walked in silence  you are afraid of that man barbara said alan presently guessing her thoughts  a little she answered so far as i can be afraid of anything any more and you  a little also i think that he will give us trouble he can be very malevolent and resourceful  resourceful alan well so can i ill back my wits against his any day he shant separate us by anything short of murder which he wont go in for men like that dont like to break the law they have too much to lose but no doubt he will make things uncomfortable for you if he can for several reasons  again they walked on lost in reflections when barbara suddenly saw her lovers face brighten  what is it alan she asked  something that is rare enough with me barbaraan idea you remember speaking about that asiki gold just now well why shouldnt i go and get it  she stared at him  it sounds a little speculative she said something like one of my uncles companies  not half so speculative as you think i have no doubt it is there and jeekie knows the way also i seem to remember that there is a map and an account of the whole thing in uncle austins diaries though to tell you the truth the old fellow wrote such a fearful hand that i have never taken the trouble to read it you see he went on with enthusiasm it is the kind of business that i can do i am thoroughly salted to fever i know the west coast where i spent three years on that boundary commission i have studied the natives and can talk several of their dialects of course there would be a risk but there are risks in everything and like you i am not afraid about that for i believe that we have got our lives before us  read up those diaries alan and we will talk the thing over again ill pump jeekie who will tell me anything by coaxing and try to get at the truth meanwhile what are you going to do about my uncle  speak to him of course and have the row over  yes she answered that is the best and the most honest of course he can turn you out but he cant prevent my seeing you if he does go home to yarleys and ill come over and call here we are let us go in by the back door and she pointed to her crushed hat and laughed    chapter v  barbara makes a speech  while alan and barbara on the most momentous occasion of their lives were seated upon the fallen oak in the woods that thrilled with the breath of spring another interview was taking place in mr champershaswells private suite at the court the decorations of which as he was wont to inform his visitors had cost nearly Â£2000 sir robert whose taste at any rate was good thought them so appalling that while waiting for his host and partner whom he had come to see he took a seat in the bow window of the sittingroom and studied the view that nobody had been able to spoil presently mr haswell emerged from his bedroom wrapped in a dressing gown and looking very pale and shaky  delighted to see you all right again said sir robert as he wheeled up a chair into which mr haswell sank  i am not all right aylward he answered i am not all right at all never had such an upset in my life thought i was going to die when that accursed savage told his beastly tale aylward you are a man of the world tell me what is the meaning of the thing you remember what we thought we saw in the office and thenthat story  i dont know he answered frankly i dont know i am a man who has never believed in anything i cannot see and test one who utterly lacks faith in my leisure i have examined into the various religious systems and found them to be rubbish i am convinced that we are but highlydeveloped mammals born by chance and when our day is done departing into the black nothingness out of which we came everything else that is what is called the higher and spiritual part i attribute to the superstitions incident to the terror of the hideous position in which we find ourselves that of gods of a sort hemmed in by a few years of fearful and tormented life but you know the old arguments so why should i enter on them and now i am confronted with an experience which i cannot explain i certainly thought that in the office on friday evening i saw that gold mask to which i had taken so strange a fancy that i offered to give vernon Â£17000 for it because i thought that it brought us luck swim across the floor of our room and look first into your face and then into mine well the next night that negro tells his story what am i to make of it  cant tell you answered mr champershaswell with a groan all i know is that it nearly made a corpse of me i am not like you aylward i was brought up as an evangelical and although i havent given much thought to these matters of late yearswell we dont shake them off in a hurry i daresay there is something somewhere and when the black man was speaking that something seemed uncommonly near it got up and gripped me by the throat shaking the mortal breath out of me and upon my word aylward i have been wishing all the morning that i had led a different kind of life as my old parents and my brother john barbaras father who was a very religious kind of man did before me  it is rather late to think of all that now haswell said sir robert shrugging his shoulders one takes ones line and theres an end personally i believe that we are overstrained with the fearful and anxious work of this flotation and have been the victims of an hallucination and a coincidence although i confess that i came to look upon the thing as a kind of mascot i put no trust in any fetish how can a bit of gold move and how can it know the future well i have written to them to clear it out of the office tomorrow so it wont trouble us any more and now i have come to speak to you on another matter  not business said mr haswell with a sigh we have that all the week and there will be enough of it on monday  no he answered something more important about your niece barbara  mr haswell glanced at him with those little eyes of his which were so sharp that they seemed to bore like gimlets  barbara he said what of barbara  cant you guess haswell you are pretty good at it generally well it is no use beating about the bush i want to marry her  at this sudden announcement his partner became exceedingly interested leaning back in the chair he stared at the decorated ceiling and uttered his favourite windinthewires whistle  indeed he said i never knew that matrimony was in your line aylward any more than it has been in mine especially as you are always preaching against it well has the young lady given her consent  no i have not spoken to her i meant to do so this morning but she has slipped off somewhere with vernon i suppose  mr haswell whistled again but on a new note  pray do stop that noise said sir robert it gets upon my nerves which are shaky this morning listen it is a curious thing one less to be understood even than the coincidence of the yellow god but at my present age of fortyfour for the first time in my life i have committed the folly of what is called falling in love it is not the case of a successful middleaged man wishing to ranger himself and settle down with a desirable partie but of sheer stark infatuation i adore barbara the worse she treats me the more i adore her i had rather that the sahara flotation should fail than that she should refuse me i would rather lose threequarters of my fortune than lose her do you understand  his partner looked at him pursed up his lips to whistle then remembered and shook his head instead  no he answered barbara is a nice girl but i should not have imagined her capable of inspiring such sentiments in a man almost old enough to be her father i think that you are the victim of a kind of mania which i have heard of but never experienced venusor is it cupidhas netted you my dear aylward  oh pray leave gods and goddesses out of it we have had enough of them already he answered exasperated that is my case at any rate and what i want to know now is if i have your support in my suit remember i have something to offer haswell for instance a large fortune of which i will settle halfit is a good thing to do in our businessand a baronetcy that will be a peerage before long  a peerage have you squared that  i think so there will be a general election within the next three months and on such occasions a couple of hundred thousand in cool cash come in useful to a party that is short of ready money i think i may say that it is settled she will be the lady aylward or any other name she may fancy and one of the richest women in england now have i your support  yes my dear friend why not though barbara does not want money for she has plenty of her own in firstclass securities that i could never persuade her to vary for she is shrewd in that way and steadily refuses to sign anything also she will probably be my heiressand aylward here a sickly look of alarm spread itself over his face i dont know how long i have to live that infernal doctor examined my heart this morning and told me that it was weak weak was his word but from the tone in which he said it i believe that he meant more aylward i gather that i may die any day  nonsense haswell so may we all he replied with an affectation of cheerfulness which failed to carry conviction  presently mr haswell who had hidden his face in his hand looked up with a sigh and said  oh yes of course you have my support for after all she is my only relation and i should be glad to see her safely married also as it happens she cant marry anyone without my consent at any rate until she is five and twenty for if she does under her fathers will all her property goes away most of it to charities except a beggarly Â£200 a year you see my brother john had a great horror of imprudent marriages and a still greater belief in me which as it chances is a good thing for you  had he said sir robert and pray why is it a good thing for me  because my dear aylward unless my observation is at fault there is another richard in the field our late partner vernon of whom by the way barbara is extremely fond though it may only be in a friendly fashion at any rate she pays more attention to his wishes and opinions than to mine and yours put together  at the mention of alans name aylward started violently  i feared it he said and he is more than ten years my junior and a soldier not a man of business also there is no use disguising the truth although i am a baronet and shall be a peer and he is nothing but a beggarly country gentleman with a dso tacked on to his name he belongs to a different class to us as she does too on her mothers side well i can smash him up for you remember i took over that mortgage on yarleys and ill do it if necessary practically our friend has not a shilling that he can call his own therefore haswell unless you play me false which i dont think you will for i can be a nasty enemy he added with a threat in his voice alan vernon hasnt much chance in that direction  i dont know aylward i dont know replied haswell shaking his white head barbara is a strongwilled woman and she might choose to take the man and let the money go and thenwho can stop her also i dont like your idea of smashing vernon it isnt right and it may come back on our own heads especially yours i am sorry that he has left us as you were on friday night for somehow he was a good honest stick to lean on and we want such a stick but i am tired now i really cant talk any more the doctor warned me against excitement get the girls consent aylward and well see ah here comes my soup goodbye for the present  when sir robert came down to luncheon he found barbara looking particularly radiant and charming already presiding at that meal and conversing in her best french to the foreign gentlemen who were paying her compliments  forgive me for being late he said first of all i have been talking to your uncle and afterwards skimming through the articles in yesterdays papers on our little venture which comes out tomorrow a cheerful occupation on the whole for with one or two exceptions they are all favourable  mon dieu said the french gentlemen on the right seeing what they did cost that is not strange your english papers they are so expensive in paris we have done it for half the money  barbara and some of the guests laughed outright finding this frankness charming  but where have you been miss champers i thought that we were going to have a round of golf together the caddies were there i was there the greens had been specially rolled this morning but there was no you  no she answered because major vernon and i walked to church and heard a very good sermon upon the observance of the sabbath  you are severe he said do you think it wrong for men who work hard all the week to play a harmless game on sunday  not at all sir robert then she looked at him and coming to a sudden decision added if you like i will play you nine holes this afternoon and give you a stroke a hole or would you prefer a foursome  no let us fight alone and let the best player win  very well sir robert but you mustnt forget that i am handicapped  dont look angry she whispered to alan as they strolled out into the garden after lunch i must clear things up and know what we have to face ill be back by teatime and we will have it out with my uncle    the nine holes had been played and by a single stroke barbara had won the match which pleased her very much for she had done her best and with such heavy odds in his favour sir robert who had also done his best was no mean opponent even for a player of her skill indeed the fight had been quite earnest for each party knew that it was but a prelude to another and more serious fight and looked upon the result as in some sense an omen  i am conquered he said in a voice in which vexation struggled with a laugh and by a woman over whom i had an advantage it is humiliating for i confess i do not like being beaten  dont you think that women generally win if they mean to asked barbara i believe that when they fail which is often enough it is because they dont care or cant make up their minds a woman in earnest is a dangerous antagonist  yes he answered or the best of allies then he gave the clubs and halfacrown to the caddies and when they were out of hearing added miss champers i have been wondering for some time whether it is possible that you would become such an ally to me  i know nothing of business sir robert my tastes do not lie that way  you know well that i was not speaking of business miss champers i was speaking of another kind of partnership that which nature has ordained between men and womenmarriage will you accept me as a husband  she opened her lips to speak but he lifted his hand and went on listen before you give that ready answer which it is so hard to recall or smooth away i know all my disadvantages my years which to you may seem many my modest origin my trade which not altogether without reason you despise and dislike well the first two cannot be changed except for the worse the second can be and already is buried beneath the gold and ermine of wealth and titles what does it matter if i am the son of a city clerk who never earned more than Â£2 a week and was born in a tenement at battersea when i am one of the rich men of this rich land and shall die a peer in a palace leaving millions and honours to my children as for the third my occupation i am prepared to give it up it has served my turn and after next week i shall have earned the amount that years ago i determined to earn thenceforth set above the accidents of fortune i propose to devote myself to higher aims those of legitimate ambition so far as my time would allow i have already taken some share in politics as a worker i intend to continue in them as a ruler which i still have the health and ability to do i mean to be one of the first men in this empire to ride to power over the heads of all the nonentities whose only claim upon the confidence of their countrymen is that they were born in a certain class with money in their pockets and without the need to spend the best of their manhood in work with you at my side i can do all these things and more and such is the future that i have to offer you  again she would have broken in upon his speech and again he stopped her reading the unspoken answer on her lips  listen i have not told you all perhaps i have put first what should have come last i have not told you that i love you earnestly and sincerely with the settled unalterable love that sometimes comes to men in middleage who have never turned their thought that way before i will not attempt the rhapsodies of passion which at my time of life might sound foolish or out of place yet it is true that i am filled with this passion which has descended on me and taken possession of me i who often have laughed at such things in other men adore you you are a joy to my eyes if you are not in the room for me it is empty i admire the uprightness of your character and even your prejudices and to your standard i desire to approximate my own i think that no man can ever love you quite so well as i do barbara champers now speak i am ready to meet the best or the worst  after her fashion barbara looked him straight in the face with her steady eyes and answered gently enough for the mans method of presenting his case elaborate and prepared though it evidently was had touched her  i fear it is the worst sir robert there are hundreds of women superior to myself in every way who would be glad to give you the help and companionship you ask with their hearts thrown in choose one of them for i cannot do so  he heard and for the first time his face broke as it were all this while it had remained masklike and immovable even when he spoke of his love but now it broke as ice breaks at the pressure of a sudden flood beneath and she saw the depths and eddies of his nature and understood their strength not that he revealed them in speech angry or pleading for that remained calm and measured enough she did not hear she saw and even then it was marvellous to her that a mere change in a mans expression could explain so much  those are very cruel words he said are they unalterable  quite i do not play in such matters it would be wicked  may i ask you one question for if the answer is in the negative i shall still continue to hope do you care for any other man  again she looked at him with her fearless eyes and answered  yes i am engaged to another man  to alan vernon  she nodded  when did that happen some years ago  no this morning  great heavens he muttered in a hoarse voice turning his head away this morning then last night it might not have been too late and last night i should have spoken to you i had arranged it all yes if it had not been for the story of that accursed fetish and your uncles illness i should have spoken to you and perhaps succeeded  i think not she said  he turned upon her and notwithstanding the tears in his eyes they burned like fire  you thinkyou think he gasped but i know of course after this morning it was impossible but barbara i say that i will win you yet i have never failed in any object that i set before myself and do not suppose that i shall fail in this although in a way i liked and respected him i have always felt that vernon was my enemy one destined to bring grief and loss upon me even if he did not intend to do so now i understand why and he shall learn that i am stronger than he god help him i say  i think he will barbara answered calmly you are speaking wildly and i understand the reason and hope that you will forget your words but whether you forget or remember do not suppose that you frighten me you men who have made money she went on with swelling indignation who have made money somehow and have bought honours with the moneys somehow think yourselves great and in your little day your little little day that will end with three lines in small type in the times you are great in this vulgar land you can buy what you want and people creep round you and ask you for doles and favours and railway porters call you my lord at every other step but you forget your limitations in this world and that which lives above you you say you will do this and that you should study a book which few of you ever read where it tells you that you do not know what you will be on the morrow that your life is even as a vapour appearing for a little time and then vanishing away you think that you can crush the man to whom i have given my heart because he is honest and you are dishonest because you are rich and he is poor and because he chances to have succeeded where you have not well for myself and for him i defy you do your worst and fail and when you have failed in the hour of your extremity remember my words today if i have given you pain by refusing you it is not my fault and i am sorry but when you threaten the man who has honoured me with his love and whom i honour above every creature upon the earth then i threaten back and may the power that made us all judge between you and me as judge it will and bursting into tears she turned and left him  sir robert watched her go  what a woman he said meditatively what a womanto have lost well she has set the stakes and we will play out the game the cards all seem to be in my hands but it would not in the least surprise me if she won the rubber for the element that i call chance and she would call something else may come in still i never refused a challenge yet and we will play the game out without pity to the loser    that night the first trick was played when he got back to the court sir robert ordered his motorcar and departed on urgent business either to his own place old hall or to london saying only that he had been summoned away by telegram as the 70horsepower mercedes glided out of the gates a pencilled note was put into mr haswells hand  it ran i have tried and failedfor the present by illluck av had been before me only this morning if i had not missed my chance last night owing to your illness it would have been different i do not however in the least abandon my plan in which of course i rely on and expect your support keep v in the office or let him go as you like perhaps it would be better if you could prevail upon him to stop there until after the flotation but whatever you say at the moment i trust to you to absolutely veto any engagement between him and your niece and to that end to use all your powers and authority as her guardian burn this note  ra    chapter vi  mr haswell loses his temper  alan and barbara sat in mr champershaswells private sittingroom with the awful decorations and before them by the fire mr champershaswell reclined upon his couch alan in a few brief soldierlike words had just informed him of his engagement to barbara during the recital of this interesting fact barbara said nothing but mr haswell had whistled several times now at length he spoke in that tone of forced geniality which he generally adopted towards his cousin  you are asking for the hand of a considerable heiress alan my boy he said but you have neglected to inform me of your own position  where is the use of telling you what you know already mr haswell i have left the firm therefore i have practically nothing  you have practically nothing and yetwell in my young days men were more delicate they did not like being called fortunehunters but of course times have changed  alan bit his lip and barbara sat up quite straight in her chair observing which indications mr haswell went on hurriedly  now if you had stopped in the firm and earned the very handsome competence in a small way which would have become due to you this week instead of throwing us over at the last moment for some quixotic reasons of your own it might have been a different matter i do not say it would have been i say it might have been and you may remember a proverb about winks and nods and blind horses so i ask you whether you are inclined to withdraw that resignation of yours and bring up this question again let us say next sunday  alan thought a while before he answered as he understood mr haswell practically was promising to assent to the engagement upon these terms the temptation was enormously great the fiercest that he had ever been called upon to face he looked at barbara she had closed her eyes and made absolutely no sign for some reason of her own she had elected that he should determine this vital point without the slightest assistance from her and it must be determined at once procrastination was impossible for a moment he hesitated on the one side was barbara on the other his conscience after long doubts he had come to a certain conclusion which he quite understood to be inconvenient to his partners should he throw it over now should he even try to make a sure and certain bargain as the price of his surrender probably he would not suffer if he did the flotation was underwritten and bound to go through the scandal would come afterwards months or years hence long before which he might get out as most of the others meant to do no he could not his conscience was too much for him  i do not see any use in reconsidering that question mr haswell he said quietly we settled it on friday night  barbara reopened her brown eyes and stared amiably at the painted ceiling and mr haswell whistled  then i am afraid he said that i do not see any use in discussing your kind proposal for my nieces hand listeni will be quite open with you i have other views for barbara and as it happens i have the power to enforce them or at any rate to prevent their frustration by you if barbara marries against my will before she is five and twenty that is within the next two years her entire fortune with the exception of a pittance goes elsewhere this i am sure is a fact that will influence you who have nothing and even if it did not i presume that you are scarcely so selfish as to wish to beggar her  no answered alan you need not fear that for it would be wrong i understand that you absolutely refuse to sanction my suit on the ground of my poverty which under the circumstances is perhaps not wonderful well the only thing to do is to wait for two years a long time but not endless and meanwhile i can try to better my position  do what you will alan said mr haswell harshly for now all his faux bonhomme manner had gone leaving him revealed in his true character of an unscrupulous tradesman with dark ends of his own to serve do what you will but understand that i forbid all communication between you and my niece and that the sooner you cease to trespass upon a hospitality which you have abused the better i shall be pleased  i will go at once said alan rising before my temper gets the better of me and i tell you some truths that i might regret for after all you are barbaras uncle but on your part i ask you to understand that i refuse to cut off from my cousin who is of full age and has promised to be my wife and he turned to go  stop a minute alan said barbara who all this while had sat silent i have something to say which i wish you to hear you told us just now uncle that you have other views for me by which you meant that you wish me to marry sir robert aylward whom as you are probably aware i refused definitely this afternoon now i wish to make it clear at once that no earthly power will induce me to take as a husband a man whom i dislike and whose wealth of which you think so much has in my opinion been dishonestly acquired  what are you saying broke in her uncle furiously he has been my partner for years you are reflecting upon me  i am sorry uncle but i withdraw nothing even if alan here were dead i would not marry that man and perhaps you will make him understand this she added with emphasis indeed i had sooner die myself you told us also that if i marry against your will you can take away all the property that my father left to me uncle i shall not give you that satisfaction i shall wait until i am twentyfive and do what i please with myself and my fortune lastly you said that you forbade us to see each other or to correspond i answer that i shall both write to and see alan as often as i like if you attempt to prevent me from doing so i shall go to the court of chancery lay all the facts before it as i have been advised that i can donot by alanplease remember all the facts and ask for its protection and for a separate maintenance out of my estate until i am twentyfive i am sure that the court would grant me this and would declare that considering his distinguished family and record alan is a perfectly proper person to be my affianced husband i think that is all i have to say  all you have to say gasped mr haswell all you have to say you impertinent and ungrateful minx then he fell into a furious fit of rage and in language that need not be repeated poured a stream of threats and abuse upon alan and herself barbara waited until he ceased from exhaustion  uncle she said you should remember that your heart is weak and you must not overexcite yourself also when you are calmer that if you speak to me like that again i shall go to the court at once for i will not be sworn at by you or by any other man i apologize to you alan i am afraid i have brought you into strange company come my dear we will go and order your dogcart and putting her arm affectionately through his she went with him from the room  i wonder who put her up to all this gasped haswell as the door closed behind them some infernal lawyer ill be bound well she has got the whip hand of me and i cant face an investigation in chancery especially as the only thing against vernon is that the value of his land has fallen but i swear that she shall never marry him while i live he ended in a kind of shout and the domed and painted ceiling echoed back his wordswhile i live after which the room was silent save for the heavy thumping of his heart    when alan reached home that night after his tenmile drive he sent jeekie to tell the housekeeper to find him some food in his mysterious african fashion the negro had already collected much intelligence as to the events of the day mostly in the servants hall and more particularly from the two golfcaddies sons of one of the gardeners who it seemed instead of retiring with the clubs had taken shelter in some tall whins and thence followed the interview between barbara and sir robert with the intensest interest reflecting that this was not the time to satisfy his burning curiosity jeekie went and in due course returned with some cold mutton and a bottle of claret then came his chance for alan could scarcely touch the mutton and demanded toast and butter  very inferior chopthat was his west african word for foodfor a gentleman major he said shaking his white head sympathetically and pointing to the muttonspecially when he has unexpectedly departed from magnificent eating of the court why did you not wait till after dinner major before retiring  alan laughed at the mans inflated english and answered in a more nervous and colloquial style  because i was kicked out jeekie  ah i gathered that kicking was in the wind major sir robert aylward bart he also was kicked out but by smaller toe  again alan laughed and as it was a relief to talk even to jeekie asked him  how do you know that  i gathered it out of atmosphere major from sir roberts gentleman from two youths who watch sir robert and miss barbara talking upon golf green no 9 from the machine driver of sir robert whose eyes he damn in public and last but not least from his own noble countenance  i see that you are observant jeekie  observation major it is art of life i see miss barbaras eyes red like morning sky and i deduct i see you shot out and gloomy like evening cloud and i deduct i listen at door of mr haswells room i hear him curse and swear like holy saint in book and you and miss barbara answer him not like saint though what you speak i cannot hear and i deduct jeekie deduct thisthat you make love to miss barbara in proper gentlemanlike nogamous christian fashion such as your late reverend uncle approve and miss barbara she make love to you with ten per cent compound interest but old gent with whistle he not approve he say where corresponding cash he say noble sir robert have much cash and interested in identical business i prefer sir robert get out you cashless often i see this same thing when boy in west africa very common wherever sun shine i note all these matters and i deductthat jeekies way and jeekie seldom wrong  alan laughed for the third time until the tears ran down his face indeed  jeekie he said you are a great rascal  yes yes interrupted jeekie great rascal best thing to be in this world major honourable sir robert bart mp and mr champershaswell dl jp they find that out long ago and sit on top of tree of opulent renown jeekie great rascal and therefore have savings bank accountgo on major  well jeekie because if you are a rascal you are kindhearted and because i believe that you care for me  oh major broke in jeekie again that most utterably true honour bright i love you major better than anyone on earth except my late old woman now happily dead gone and forgotten in best oak coffin Â£4 10 without fittings but polished and perhaps your holy uncle reverend mr austin also coffined and departed who saved me from early extinction in a dark place major i no like graves i see too much of them and cant tell what lie on other side though everyone say they know jeekie not quite sure may be all light and crowns of glory may be damp black hole and no way out but this at least true that i love you better yes better than miss barbara for love of woman very poor uncertain thing quick come quick go jeekie find that outoften yes if need be though death most nasty if need be i say i die for you which great unpleasant sacrifice and jeekie in the genuine enthusiasm of his warm heart throwing himself upon his knees after the african fashion seized his masters hand and kissed it  thanks jeekie said alan very kind of you i am sure but we havent come to that yet though no one knows what may happen later on now sit upon that chair and take a little whiskynot too muchfor i am going to ask your advice  major said jeekie i obey and seizing the whisky bottle in a casual manner he poured out half a tumbler full for jeekie was fond of whisky indeed before now this taste had brought him into conflict with the local magistrates  put back three parts of that said alan and jeekie did so now he went on listen this is the case miss barbara and i are and he hesitated  oh i know like me and mrs jeekie once said jeekie gulping down some of the neat whisky go on major  and sir robert aylward is  same thing major continue  and mr haswell has  those facts all ascertained major said jeekie contemplating his glass with a mournful eye now come to the point major  well the point is jeekie that i am what you called just now cashless and therefore  therefore interrupted jeekie again stick fast in honourable intention towards miss barbara owing to obstinate opposition of mr haswell legal uncle with control of property fomented by noble sir robert who desire same girl  quite right jeekie but if you would talk a little less and let me talk a little more we might get on better  i henceforth silent major and lifting his empty tumbler jeekie looked through it as if it were a telescope a hint that alan ignored  jeekie you infernal old fool i want money  yes major i understand major forgive me for breaking conspiracy of silence but if Â£500 in savings bank any use very much at your service major also Â£20 more extracted last night from terror of wealthy jew who fear fetish  jeekie you old donkey i dont want your Â£500 i want a great deal more Â£50000 or Â£500000 tell me how to get it  city best place major but you chuck city too much honest man great mistake to be honest in this terrestrial sphere often notice that in west africa  perhaps jeekie but i have done with the city as you would say for me it is wipe out finish  yes major too much pickpocket too much dirt bottom always drop out of bucket shop at last i understand end in police court and severe magistrate or perhaps even gentlemen of jury etcetera  well jeekie then what remains now last night when you told us that amazing yarn of yours you said something about a mountain full of gold and houses full of gold among your people jeekie do you think and he paused looking at him  jeekie rolled his black eyes round the room and in a fit of absentmindedness helped himself to some more whisky  do i think major that this useless lucre could be converted into coin of gracious king edward not at all major by no one major by no one whatsoever except possibly by major alan vernon dso and by one jeekie christian surname smith  proceed jeekie said alan removing the whisky bottle proceed and explain  major thus the asiki tribe care nothing about all that gold it no good to them dead people who live long long ago no one know when dig it up and store it there and make the great fetish which they call bonsa to keep away enemy who want to steal also old custom when any one in country round find big nugget or pretty stone like ladies wear on bosom to bring it as offering to bonsa so that there now great plenty of all this stuff but no one use it for anything except to set on walls of house of asiki or to make basin stool table and pot to cook with once arab come there and i see the priests give him weight in gold for iron hoe though afterwards they murder him not for the gold but lest he go away and tell their secret  one might trade with them then jeekie  he shook his white head doubtfully  yes perhaps if you can find anything they want buy and can carry it there but i think there only one thing they want and you got that major  i jeekie what have i got  the negro leant forward and tapped his master on the knee saying in a portentous whisper  you got little bonsa which much more holy than anything even than big bonsa her husband i mean greater more powerful devil that little bonsa sit in front room asikas house and when she want see things she put it in big basin of gold but i no tell you what it float in also once or twice every year they take out little bonsa asika wear it on head as mask and whoever they meet they kill as offering to little bonsa so that spirit come back to world to be priest of bonsa i tell you major that yellow god see many thousand of people die  indeed said alan a pleasing fetish truly i should think that the asiki must be glad it is gone  no not glad very sorry no luck for them when little bonsa go away but plenty luck for those who got her that why firm aylward  haswell make so much money when you join them and bring her to office she drop green in eye of public so they no smell rat that why you so lucky not die of blackwater fever when you should get safe out of den of thieves in city with good name win love of sweet maiden miss barbara little bonsa do all those things for you and by and by do plenty more as little bonsa bring my old master your holy uncle safe out of that country because all the asiki run away when they see him wear her on head for they think she come sacrifice them after she eat up my life  i dont wonder that they ran said alan laughing for the vision of a missionary with little bonsa on his head caught his fancy but come to the point you old heathen what do you mean that i should do  jeekie not heathen now major but plenty other things true in this world besides christian religion i no want you do anything but i say thisyou go back to asiki wearing little bonsa on head and dressed like reverend uncle whom you very like for he just your age then thirty years ago and they give you all the gold you want if you give them back little bonsa whom they love and worship for ever and ever for little bonsa very very old  alan sat up in his chair and stared at jeekie while jeekie nodded his head at him  there is something in it he said slowly speaking more to himself than to the negro and perhaps that is why i would not sell the fetish for as you say there are plenty of true things in the world besides those which we believe but jeekie how should i find the way  no trouble major little bonsa find way want to get back home very hungry by now much need sacrifice think it good thing kill pig to little bonsaor even lamb she know you do your best since human being not to be come at in christian land and say thank you for life of pig  stop that rubbish said alan i want a guide if i go will you come with me  at this suggestion the negro looked exceedingly uncomfortable  not like to not like to at all he said rolling his eyes asikiland very funny place for nativeborn but he added sadly if you go jeekie must for i servant of little bonsa and if i stay behind she angry and kill me because i not attend her where she walk but perhaps if i go and take her to gold house again she pleased and let me off also i able help you there yes if you and little bonsa go think i go too  after this announcement jeekie rose and walked down the room carrying the cold mutton in his hand then he returned replaced it on the table and standing in front of alan said earnestly  major i tell you all truth just this once jeekie believe he got go with you to asikiland jeekie have plenty bad dream lately little bonsa come in middle of the night and sit on his stomach and scratch his face with her gold leg and say jeekie jeekie you son of bonsa you get up quick and take me back bonsa town for i darned tired of city fog and finished all i come here to do now i want jolly good sacrifice and got plenty business attend to there at home things you not understand just yet you take me back sharp or i make you sit up jeekie my boy and he paused  indeed said alan and did she tell you anything else in her midnight visitations  yes major she say you take that white master of yours along also for i want come back asikiland on his head and someone wish see him there old pal what he forget but what not forget him you tell him little bonsa got score she wants settle with that party and wish use him to square account you tell him too that she pay him well for trip he lose nothing if he play her game cause she got no score against him but if he not go that another matter then he look out for little bonsa very nasty customer if she riled as his late partners find out one day  oh shut up jeekie whats the use of wasting time telling me your nightmares  very well major just as you like major but i got other reasons why i willing go jeekie want see his ma  your ma i never heard you had a ma besides she must be dead long ago  no major cause she turn up in dream too very much alive swear at me cause i bag her blanket also she tough old woman take lot kill her  perhaps you have a pa too suggested alan  think not major my ma always say she forget him what she mean she not like talk about him he such a swell why jeekie so strong so clever and with such beautiful face no doubt because he is son of very great man all this true reason why he want to go with you major still praps poor old jeekie make mistake praps he dream cause he eat too much supper praps his ma dead after all if so praps better stay at homenot know  no answered alan not know what between little bonsa and one thing and another my head is swimminglike little bonsa in the water  big bonsa swim in water interrupted jeekie little bonsa swim in gold tub  well big bonsa or little bonsa i dont care which im going to bed and you had better clear away these things and do the same but jeekie if you say a word of our talk to anyone i shall be very angry do you understand  yes major i understand i understand that if i tell secrets of little bonsa to anyone except you with whom she live in strange land far away from home little bonsa come at me like one lion and cut my throat no fear jeekie split on little bonsa oh no fear at all and still shaking his head solemnly for the second time he seized the cold mutton and vanished from the room  a farrago of superstitious nonsense thought alan to himself when he had gone but still there may be something to be made out of it evidently there is lots of gold in this asiki country if only one can persuade the people to deal  then weary of jeekie and his tribal gods alan lit his pipe and sat a while thinking of barbara and all the events of that tumultuous day notwithstanding his rebuff at the hands of mr haswell and the difficulties and dangers which threatened he felt even then that it had been a happy and a fortunate day for had he not discovered that barbara loved him with all her heart and soul as he loved barbara and as this was so he did not care alittle bonsa about anything else the future must look to itself sufficient to the day was the abiding joy thereof  so he went to bed and for a while to sleep but he did not sleep very long for presently he fell to dreaming something about big bonsa and little bonsa which sat or rather floated on either side of his couch and held an interminable conversation over him while jeekie and sir robert aylward perched respectively at its head and its foot like the symbols of the good and evil genii on a mahommedan tomb acted as a kind of insane chorus he struck his repeater it was only one oclock so he tried to go to sleep again but failed utterly never had he been more painfully awake  for an hour or more alan persevered then at last in despair he jumped out of bed wondering what he could do to occupy his mind suddenly he remembered the diary of his uncle the rev mr austin which he had inherited with the yellow god and a few other possessions but never examined they had been put away in a box in the library about fifteen years before just at the time he entered the army and there doubtless they remained well as he could not sleep why should he not examine them now and thus get through some of this weary night  he lit a candle and went down to the library an ancient and beautiful apartment with black oak panelling between the bookcases set there in the time of elizabeth in this panelling there were cupboards and in one of the cupboards was the box he sought made of teak wood on its lid was painted the reverend henry austin passenger to acra showing that it had once been his uncles cabin box the key hung from the handle and having lit more candles alan drew it out and unlocked it to be greeted by a smell of musty documents done up in great bundles one by one he placed them on the floor it was a dreary occupation alone there in that great silent room at the dead of night one indeed with which he was soon satisfied for somehow it reminded him of rifling coffins in a vault before him so carefully put away lay the records of a good if not a distinguished life and until this moment he had never found the energy even to look through them  at length he came to the end of the bundles and saw that beneath lay a number of manuscript books packed closely with their backs upwards markedjournaland with the year and sometimes the place of the authors residence as he glanced at them in dismay for they were many his eye caught the title of one inscribedas were several otherswest africa and written in brackets beneaththis vol contains all that is left of the notes of my escape with jeekie from the asiki devilworshippers  alan drew it out and having refilled and closed the box bore it off to his room where he proceeded to read it in bed as a matter of fact he found that there was not very much to read for the reason that most of the closelywritten volume had been so damaged by water that the pencilled writing had run and become utterly illegible the centre pages however not having been soaked could still be deciphered at any rate in part also there was a large manuscript map executed in ink apparently at a later date on the back of which was written i purpose dv to rewrite at some convenient time all the history of my visit to the unknown asiki people as my original notes were practically destroyed when the canoe overset in the rapids and most of our few possessions were lost except this book and the gold fetish mask which is called little bonsa or small swimming head this i think i can do with the aid of jeekie from memory but as the matter has only a personal and no religious interest seeing that i was not able even to preach the word among those benighted and bloodthirsty savages in whose country as i verily believe the devil has one of his principal habitations it must stand over till a convenient season such as the time of old age or sickness ha  ps i ought to add with gratitude that even out of this hell fire i was enabled to snatch one brand from the burning namely the negro lad jeekie to whose extraordinary resource and faithfulness i owe my escape after a long hesitation i have been able to baptize him although i fear that the taint of heathenism still clings to him thus not six months ago i caught him sacrificing a white cock to the image little bonsa in gratitude as to my horror he explained for my having been appointed an honorary canon of the cathedral i have told him to take that ugly mask which has been so often soaked in human blood and melt it down over the kitchen stove after picking out the gems in the eyes that the proceeds may be given to the poor note i had better see to this myself as where little bonsa is concerned jeekie is not to be trusted he says with some excuse that it has magic and that if he melts it down he will melt down too and so shall i how dark and ridiculous are the superstitions of the heathen perhaps however instead of destroying the thing which is certainly unique i might sell it to a museum and thus spare the feelings of that weak vessel jeekie who otherwise would very likely take it into his head to waste away and die as these africans do when their nerves are affected by terror of their fetish    chapter vii  the diary  reflecting that time evidently had made little change in jeekie alan studied this route map with care and found that it started from old calabar in the bight of biafra on the west coast of africa whence it ran up to the great qua river which it followed for a long way then it struck across country marked dense forest northwards and came to a river called katsena along the banks of which the route went eastwards thence it turned northward again through swamps and ended in mountains called shaku in the middle of these mountains was written asiki people live here on raaba river  the map was roughly drawn to scale and alan who was an engineer accustomed to such things easily calculated that the distance of this raaba river from old calabar was about 350 miles as the crow flies though probably the actual route to be travelled was nearer five hundred miles  having mastered the map he opened the watersoaked diary turning page after page only here and there could he make out a sentence such as so i defied that beautiful but terrific woman i a christian minister the husband of a heathen priestess perish the thought sooner would i be sacrificed to bonsa  then came more illegible pages and again a paragraph that could be readthey gave me the bean in a gold cup and knowing its deadly nature i prepared myself for death but happily for me my stomach always delicate rejected it at once though i felt queer for days afterwards whereon they clapped their hands and said i was evidently innocent and a great medicine man  and again further onnever did i see so much gold whether in dust nuggets or worked articles i imagine it must be worth millions but at that time gold was the last thing with which i wished to trouble myself  after this entry many pages were utterly effaced  the last legible passage ran as followsso guided by the lad jeekie and wearing the gold mask little bonsa on my head i ran through them all holding him by the hand as though i were dragging him away a strange spectacle i must have been with my old black clergymans coat buttoned about me my naked legs and the gold mask as pretending to be a devil such as they worship i rushed through them in the moonlight blowing the whistle in the mask and bellowing like a bull    such was the beginning of my dreadful six months journey to the coast setting aside the mercy of providence that preserved me for its own purposes i could never have lived to reach it had it not been for little bonsa since curiously enough i found this fetish known and dreaded for hundreds of miles and that by people who had never seen it yes even by the wild cannibals whenever it was produced food bearers canoes or whatever else i might want were forthcoming as though by magic great is the fame of big and little bonsa in all that part of west africa although strange as it may seem the outlying tribes seldom mention them by name if they must speak of either of these images which are supposed to be man and wife they call it the yellowgodwholivesyonder  not another word of all this strange history could alan decipher so with aching eyes he shut up the stained and tattered volume and at last just as the day was breaking fell asleep  at eleven oclock on that same morning for he had slept late alan rose from his breakfast and went to smoke his pipe at the open door of the beautiful old hall in yarleys that was clad with brown elizabethan oak for which any dealer would have given hundreds of pounds it was a charming morning one of those that comes to us sometimes in an english april when the air is soft like that of italy and the smell of the earth rises like that of incense and little clouds float idly across a sky of tender blue standing thus he looked out upon the park where the elms already showed a tinge of green and the ashbuds were coal black only the walnuts and the great oaks some of them pollards of a thousand years of age remained stark and stern in their winter dress  alan was in a reflective mood and involuntarily began to wonder how many of his forefathers had stood in that same spot upon such april mornings and looked out upon those identical trees wakening in the breath of spring only the trees and the landscape knew those trees which had seen every one of them borne to baptism to bridal and to burial the men and women themselves were forgotten their portraits each in the garb of his or her generation hung here and there upon the walls of the ancient house which once they had owned or inhabited but who remembered anything of them today in many cases their names even were lost for believing that they so important in their time could never sink into oblivion they had not thought it necessary to record them upon their pictures  and now the thing was coming to an end unless in this way or in that he could save it what remained of the old place for the outlying lands had long since been sold must go to the hammer and become the property of some pushing and successful person who desired to found a family and perhaps in days to be would claim these very pictures that hung upon the walls as those of his own ancestors declaring that he had brought in the estate because he was a relative of the ancient and ruined race  well it was the way of the world and perhaps it must be so but the thought of it made alan vernon sad if he could have continued that business it might have been otherwise by this hour his late partners sir robert aylward and mr champershaswell were doubtless sitting in their granite office in the city probably in consultation with lord specton who had taken his place upon the board of the great company which was being subscribed that day no doubt applications for shares were pouring in by the early posts and by telegram and from time to time mr jeffreys respectfully reported their number and amount while sir robert looked unconcerned and mr haswell rubbed his hands and whistled cheerfully almost he could envy them these men who were realizing great fortunes amidst the bustle and excitement of that fierce financial life whilst he stood penniless and stared at the trees and the ewes which wandered among them with their lambs he who after all his work was but a failure with a sigh he turned away to fetch his cap and go out walkingthere was a tenant whom he must see a shifty newfangled kind of man who was always clamouring for fresh buildings and reductions in his rent how was he to pay for more buildings he must put him off or let him go  just then a sharp sound caught his ear that of an electric bell it came from the telephone which since he had been a member of a city firm he had caused to be put into yarleys at considerable expense in order that he might be able to communicate with the office in london were they calling him up from force of habit he wondered he went to the instrument which was fixed in a little room he used as a study and took down the receiver  who is it he asked i am yarleys alan vernon  and i am barbara came the answer how are you dear did you sleep well  no very badly  nervesalan you have got nerves now although i had a worse day than you did i went to bed at nine and protected by a perfect conscience slumbered till nine this morning exactly twelve hours isnt it clever of me to think of this telephone which is more than you would ever have done my uncle has departed to london vowing that no letter from you shall enter this house but he forgot that there is a telephone in every room and in fact at this moment i am speaking round by his office within a yard or two of his head however he cant hear so that doesnt matter my blessing be on the man who invented telephones which hitherto i have always thought an awful nuisance are you feeling cheerful alan  very much the reverse he answered never was more gloomy in my life not even when i thought i had to die within six hours of blackwater fever also i have lots that i want to talk to you about and i cant do it at the end of this confounded wire that your uncle may be tapping  i thought it might be so answered barbara so i just rang you up to wish you goodmorning and to say that i am coming over in the motor to lunch with my maid snell as chaperone all right dont remonstrate i am coming over to lunchi cant hear younever mind what people will say i am coming over to lunch at one oclock mind you are in goodbye i dont want much to eat but have something for snell and the chauffeur goodbye  then the wire went dead nor could all alans hellos and are you theres extract another syllable  having ordered the best luncheon that his old housekeeper could provide alan went off for his walk in much better spirits which were further improved by his success in persuading the tenant to do without the new buildings for another year in a year he reflected anything might happen then he returned by the wood where a number of newfelled oaks lay ready for barking this was not a cheerful sight it seemed so cruel to kill the great trees just as they were pushing their buds for another summer of life but he consoled himself by recalling that they had been too crowded and that the timber was really needed on the estate as he reached the house again carrying a bunch of white violets which he had plucked in a sheltered place for barbara he perceived a motor travelling at much more than the legal speed up the walnut avenue which was the pride of the place in it sat that young lady herself and her maid snell a middleaged woman with whom as it chanced he was on very good terms as once at some trouble to himself he had been able to do her a kindness  the motor pulled up at the front door and out of it sprang barbara laughing pleasantly and looking fresh and charming as the spring itself  there will be a row over this dear said alan shaking his head doubtfully when at last they were alone together in the hall  of course therell be a row she answered i mean that there should be a row i mean to have a row every day if necessary until they leave me alone to follow my own road and if they wont as i said to go to the court of chancery for protection oh by the way i have brought you a copy of the judge theres a most awful article in it about that sahara flotation and among other things it announces that you have left the firm and congratulates you upon having done so  theyll think i have put it in groaned alan as he glanced at the head lines which were almost libellous in their vigour and the summaries of the financial careers of sir robert aylward and mr champershaswell it will make them hate me more than ever and i say barbara we cant live in an atmosphere of perpetual warfare for the next two years  i can if need be answered that determined young woman but i admit that it would be trying for you if you stay here  thats just the point barbara i must not stay here i must go away the further the better until you are your own mistress  where to alan  to west africa i think  to west africa repeated barbara her voice trembling a little after that treasure alan  yes barbara but first come and have your lunch then we will talk i have got lots to tell and show you  so they lunched speaking of indifferent things for the servant was there waiting on them just as they were finishing their meal jeekie entered the room carrying a box and a large envelope addressed to his master which he said had been sent by special messenger from the office in london  whats in the box asked alan looking somewhat nervously at the envelope which was addressed in a writing that he knew  dont know for certain major answered jeekie but think little bonsa think i smell her through wood  well look and see replied alan while he broke the seal of the envelope and drew out its contents they proved to be sundry documents sent by the firms lawyers among which were a notice of the formal dissolution of partnership to be approved by him before it appeared in the gazette a second notice calling in a mortgage for fifteen thousand and odd pounds on yarleys which as a matter of business had been taken over by the firm while he was a partner a cash account showing a small balance against him and finally a receipt for him to sign acknowledging the return of the gold image that was his property  you see said alan with a sigh pushing over the papers to barbara who read them carefully one by one  i see she answered presently it is war to the knife alan i hate the idea of it but perhaps you had better go away while you are here they will harass the life out of you  meanwhile with the aid of a big jackknife and the diningroom poker jeekie had prized off the lid of the box chancing to look round barbara saw him on his knees muttering something in a strange tongue and bowing his white head until it touched an object that lay within the box  what are you doing jeekie she asked  make bow to little bonsa miss barbara tell her how glad i am see her come back from town she like feel welcome now you come bow too little bonsa take that as compliment  i wont bow but i will look jeekie for although i have heard so much about it i have never really examined this yellow god  very good you come look miss and jeekie propped up the case upon the end of the diningroom table as from its height and position she could not see its contents very well whilst standing above it barbara knelt down to get a better view of it  my goodness she exclaimed what a terrible face beautiful too in its way  hardly had the words left her lips when for some reason unexplained that probably had to do with the shifting of the centre of gravity little bonsa appeared to glide or fall out of her box with a startling suddenness and project herself straight at barbara who with a faint scream fearing lest the precious thing should be injured caught it in her arms and for a moment hugged it to her breast  saved she exclaimed recovering herself and placing it on the table whereon jeekie to their astonishment began to execute a kind of war dance  oh yes he said saved very much saved all saved most magnificent omen lady kneel to little bonsa and little bonsa nip out of box make bow and jump in ladys arms that splendid firstclass luck for miss and everybody when little bonsa do that need fear nothing no more all come right as rain  nonsense said barbara laughing then from a cautious distance she continued her examination of the fetish  see said jeekie pointing to the misshapen little gold legs which were yet so designed that it could be stood up upon them when anyone wear little bonsa tie her on head behind by these legs look here same old leather string now i put her on for she like to be worn again and with a quick movement he clapped the mask on to his face manipulated the greasy black leather thongs and made them fast thus adorned the great negro looked no less than terrific  i see you miss he said turning the fixed eyes of opallike stone bloodshot with little rubites upon barbara i see you though you no see me for these eyes made very cunning but listen you hear me and suddenly from the mask produced by some contrivance set within it there proceeded an awful howling sound that made her shiver  take that thing off jeekie said alan we dont want any banshees here  banshees not know him he poor english fetish praps said jeekie as he removed the mask this real african god howl banshee and all that sort into middle of next week this little bonsa and no mistake ten thousand years old and more eat up lives so many that no one can count them and go on eating for ever yes unto the third and fourth generation as ten commandments lay it down for benefit of christian man like me look at her again miss barbara  miss barbara took the hateful ancient thing in her hands and studied it no one could doubt its antiquity for the gold plate of which it was made was literally worn away wherever it had touched the foreheads of the high priests or priestesses who donned it upon festive occasions or days of sacrifice showing that hundreds and hundreds of them must have used it thus in succession so was the vocal apparatus within the mouth and so were the little toadlike feet upon which it was stood up also the substance of the gold itself as here and there pitted as though with acid or salts though what those salts were she did not inquire and yet so consummate was the art with which it had originally been fashioned that the battered beautiful face of little bonsa still peered at them with the same devilish smile that it had worn when it left the hands of its maker perhaps before mohammed preached his holy war or even earlier  what is all that writing on the back of it asked barbara pointing to the long lines of runelike characters which were inscribed within it  not know miss think they dead tongue cut in the beginning when black men could write but asiki priests swear they remember every one of them and that why no one can copy little bonsa for they look inside and see if marks all right they say they names of those who died for little bonsa and when they all done little bonsa begin again for little bonsa never die but praps priests lie  i daresay said barbara but take little bonsa away for however lucky she may be she makes me feel sick  where i put her major asked jeekie of alan in box in library where she used to live or in platesafe with spoons or under your bed where she always keep eye on you  oh put her with the spoons said alan angrily and jeekie departed with his treasure  i think dear remarked barbara as the door closed behind him that if i come to lunch here any more i shall bring my own christening present with me for i cant eat off silver that has been shut up with that thing now let us get to businessshow me the diary and the map  dearest alan wrote barbara from the court two days later i have been thinking everything over and since you are so set upon it i suppose that you had better go to me the whole adventure seems perfectly mad but at the same time i believe in our luck or rather in the providence which watches over us and i dont believe that you or i either will come to any harm if you stop here you will only eat your heart out and communication between us must become increasingly difficult my uncle is furious with you and since he discovered that we were talking over the telephone to his own great inconvenience he has had the wires cut outside the house that horrid letter of his to you saying that you had compromised me in pursuance of a mercenary scheme is all part and parcel of the same thing how are you to stop here and submit to such insults i went to see my friend the lawyer and he tells me that of course we can marry if we like but in that case my fathers will which he has consulted at somerset house is absolutely definite and if i do so in opposition to my uncles wishes i must lose everything except Â£200 a year now i am no moneygrubber but i will not give my uncle the satisfaction of robbing me of my fortune which may be useful to both of us by and by the lawyer says also that he does not think that the court of chancery would interfere having no power to do so as far as the will is concerned and not being able to make a ward of a person like myself who is over age and has the protection of the common law of the country so it seems to me that the only thing to do is to be patient and wait until time unties the knot  meanwhile if you can make some money in africa so much the better so go alan go as soon as you like for i do not wish to prolong this agony or to see you exposed daily to all you have to bear whenever you return you will find me waiting for you and if you do not return still i shall wait as you in like circumstances will wait for me but i think you will return  then followed much that need not be written and at the end a postscript which ran  i am glad to hear that you have succeeded in shifting the mortgage on yarleys although the interest is so high write to me whenever you get a chance to the care of the lawyer for then the letters will reach me but never to this house or they may be stopped i will do the same to you to the address you give goodbye dearest alan my true and only lover i wonder where and when we shall meet again god be with us both and enable us to bear our trial  pps i hear that the sahara flotation was really a success notwithstanding the judge attacks sir robert and my uncle have made millions i wonder how long they will keep them  a week after he received this letter alan was on the seas heading for the shores of western africa    chapter viii  the dwarf folk  it was dawn at last all night it had rained as it can rain in west africa falling on the wide river with a hissing splash sullen and continuous now towards morning the rain had ceased and everywhere rose a soft and pearly mist that clung to the face of the waters and seemed to entangle itself like strands of wool among the branches of the bordering trees on the bank of the river at a spot that had been cleared of bush stood a tent and out of this tent emerged a white man wearing a sun helmet and grey flannel shirt and trousers it was alan vernon who in these surroundings looked larger and more commanding than he had done at the london office or even in his own house of yarleys perhaps the moustache and short brown beard which he had grown or his skin already altered and tanned by the tropics had changed his appearance for the better at any rate it was changed so were his manner and bearing whereof all the diffidence had gone now they were those of a man accustomed to command who found himself in his right place  jeekie he called wake up those fellows and come and light the oilstove i want my coffee  thereon a deep voice was heard speaking in some native tongue and saying  cease your snoring you black dogs and arouse yourselves for your lord calls you an invocation that was followed by the sound of kicks thumps and muttered curses  a minute or two later jeekie himself appeared and he also was much changed in appearance for now instead of his smart european clothes he wore a white robe and sandals that gave him an air at once dignified and patriarchal  goodmorning major he said cheerfully i hope you sleep well major in this lowlying and accursed situation which is more than we do in boat that half full of water to say nothing of smell of black man and prevalent mosquito but the rain it over and gone and presently the sun shine out so might be much worse no cause at all complain  i dont know answered alan with a shiver i believe that i am fever proof but otherwise i should have caught it last night andjust give me the quinine i will take five grains for luck  yes yes for luck answered jeekie as he opened the medicine chest and found the quinine at the same time glancing anxiously out of the corner of his eye at his masters face for he knew that the spot where they had slept was deadly to white men at this season of the year you not catch fever little bonsa here he dropped his voice and looked down at the box which had served alan for a pillow see to that but quinine give you appetite for breakfast very good chop this morning which you like best cold venson or fish or one of them ducks you shoot yesterday  oh some of the cold meat i think give the ducks to the boatmen i dont fancy them in this hot place by the way jeekie we leave the qua river here dont we  yes yes major just here i member spot well for your uncle he pray on it one whole hour i pretend pray too but in heart give thanks to little bonsa for heathen in those days quite different now this morning we begin walk through forest where it rather dark and cool and comfortable that is if we no see dwarf people from whom good lord deliver us and he bowed towards the box containing little bonsa  will those four porters come with us through the forest jeekie as they promised  yes yes they come last night they say they not come too much afraid of dwarf but i settle their hash i tell them i save up bits of their hair and toe nails when they no thinking and i mix it with medicine and if they not come they die every one before they get home they think me great doctor and they believe perhaps they die if they go on if so i tell them that because they want show white feather and they think me greater doctor still oh they come they come no fear or else jeekie know reason why now here coffee major drink him hot before you go take tub but keep in shallow water because crocodile he very early riser  alan laughed and departed to take tub notwithstanding the mosquitoes that buzzed round him in clouds the water was cool and pleasant by comparison with the hot sticky air and the feel of it seemed to rid him of the languor resulting from his disturbed night  a month had passed since he had left old calabar and owing to the incessant rains the journeying had been hard indeed the white men there thought that he was mad to attempt to go up the river at this season of course he had said nothing to them of the objects of his expedition hinting only that he wished to explore and shoot and perhaps prospect for mines but knowing as they did that he was an engineer officer with a good record and much african experience they soon made up their minds that he had been sent by government upon some secret mission that for reasons of his own he preferred to keep to himself this conclusion which jeekie zealously fostered behind his back in fact did alan a good turn since owing to it he obtained boatmen and servants at a season when had he been supposed to be but a private person these would scarcely have been forthcoming at any price hitherto his journey had been one long record of mud mosquitoes and misery but otherwise devoid of incident except the eating of one of his boatmen by a crocodile which was a particularly early riser for it had pulled the poor fellow out of the canoe in which he lay asleep at night now however the real dangers were about to begin since at this spot he left the great river and started forward through the forest on foot with jeekie and the four bearers whom he had paid highly to accompany him  he could not conceal from himself that the undertaking seemed somewhat desperate but of this he said nothing in the long letter he had written to barbara on the previous night sighing as he sealed it at the thought that it might well be the last which would ever reach her from him even if the boatmen got safely back to calabar and remembered to put it in the post the enterprise had been begun and must be carried through until it ended in successor death  an hour later they started first walked alan as leader of the expedition carrying a doublebarrelled gun that could be used either for ball or shot about fifty cartridges with brass cases to protect them from the damp a revolver a huntingknife a cloth mackintosh and lastly strapped upon his back like a knapsack a tin box containing the fetish little bonsa which was too precious to be trusted to anyone else it was quite a sufficient load for any white man in that climate but being very wiry alan did not feel its weight at any rate at first  after him in single file came the four porters laden with a small tent some tinned provisions and brandy ammunition a box containing beads watches etc for presents blankets spare clothing and so forth these were stalwart fellows enough who knew the forest but their dejected air showed that now they had come face to face with its dangers they heartily wished themselves anywhere else indeed notwithstanding their terror of jeekies medicine at the last moment they threw down their loads intending to make a wild rush for the departing boat only to be met by jeekie himself who anticipating some such move was waiting for them on the bank with a shotgun here he remained until the canoe was too far out in the stream for them to reach it by swimming then he asked them if they wished to sit and starve there with the devils he would leave them for company of if they would carry out their bargain like honest men  the end of it was they took up their loads again and marched while behind them walked the terrible and gigantic jeekie the barrels of the shotgun which he carried at full cock and occasionally used to prod them pointing directly at their backs a strange object he looked truly for in addition to the weapons with which he bristled several cookingpots were slung about him to say nothing of a cork mattress and a mackintosh sheet tied in a flat bundle to his shoulders a box containing medicines and food which he carried on his head and fastened to the top of it with string like a helmet on a coffin an enormous solartope stuffed full of mosquito netting of which the ends fell about him like a green veil when alan remonstrated with him as to the cork mattress suggesting that it should be thrown away as too hot to wear jeekie replied that he had been cold for thirty years and wished to get warm again guessing that his real reason for declining to part with the article was that his master should have something to lie on other than the damp ground alan said no more at the time which as will be seen was fortunate enough for jeekie  for a mile or more their road ran through fantasticlooking mangrove trees rooted in the mud that in the mist resembled alan thought manylegged arboreal octopi feeling for their food and tall reeds on the tops of which sat crowds of chattering finches then just as the sun broke out strongly cheering them with its warmth and sucking up the vapours they entered sparse bush with palms and great cotton trees growing here and there and so at length came to the borders of the mighty forest  oh dark dark was that forest he who entered it from the cheerful sunshine felt as though suddenly and without preparation he had wandered out of the light we know into some dim hades such as the old greek fancy painted where strengthless ghosts flit aimlessly mourning the lost light everywhere the giant boles of trees shooting the height of a church tower into the air without a branch great ribrooted trees and beneath them a fierce and hungry growth of creepers where a tree had fallen within the last century or so these creepers ramped upwards in luxuriance their stems thick as the body of a man drinking the shaft of light that pierced downwards drinking it with eagerness ere the boughs above met again and starved them where no tree had fallen the creepers were thin and weak from year to year they lived on feebly biding their time but still they lived knowing that some day it would come and always it was coming to those expectant parasites since from minute to minute somewhere in the vast depths miles and miles away perhaps a great crash echoed in the stillness the crash of a tree that sown when the saxons ruled in england or perhaps before cleopatra bewitched anthony came to its end at last  on the second day of their march in the forest alan chanced to see such a tree fall and the sight was one that he never could forget as it happened owing to the vast spread of its branches which had killed out all rivals beneath for in its day it had been a very successful tree embued with an excellent constitution by its parent it stood somewhat alone so that from several hundred yards away as these six human beings crept towards it like ants towards a sapling in a cornfield its mighty girth and bulk set upon a little mound and the luxuriant greenness of its farreaching boughs made a kind of landmark then in the hot noon when no breath of wind stirred suddenly the end came suddenly that mighty bole seemed to crumble suddenly those farreaching arms were thrown together as their support failed gripping at each other like living things flogging the air screaming in their last agony and with an awful wailing groan sinking a tumbled ruin to the earth  silence again and in the midst of the silence jeekies cheerful voice  old tree go flop glad he no flop on us thanks be to little bonsa get on you lazy nigger dog who pay you stand there and snivel get on or i blow out your stupid skull and he brought the muzzle of the fullcocked doublebarrelled gun into sharp contact with that part of the terrified porters anatomy  such was the forest of their march through it for the first four days there is nothing to tell its depths seemed to be devoid of life although occasionally they heard the screaming of parrots in the treetops a couple of hundred feet above or caught sight of the dim shapes of monkeys swinging themselves from bough to bough that was in the daytime when although they could not see it they knew that the sun was shining somewhere but at night they heard nothing since beasts of prey do not come where there is no food what puzzled alan was that all through these impenetrable recesses there ran a distinct road which they followed to the right and left rose a wall of creepers but between them ran this road an ancient road for nothing grew on it and it only turned aside to avoid the biggest of the trees which must have stood there from time immemorial such a tree as that which he had seen fall indeed it was one of those round which the road ran  he asked jeekie who made the road  people who come out noahs ark answered jeekie i think they run up here to get out of way of water and sent them two elephants ahead to make path or perhaps dwarf people make it or perhaps those who go up to asikiland to do sacrifice like old jews  you mean you dont know said alan  no of course dont know who know about forest path made before beginning of world you ask question major i answer more lively answer than to shake head and roll eyes like them silly fool porters  it was on the fourth night that the trouble began as usual they had lit a huge fire made of the fallen boughs and rotting tree trunks that lay about in plenty there was no reason why the fire should be so large since they had little to cook and the air was hot but they made it so for the same reason that jeekie answered questions for the sake of cheerfulness at least it gave light in the darkness leaping up in red tongues of flame twenty or thirty feet high and its roar and crackle were welcome in the primeval silence  alan lay upon the cork mattress in the open for here there was no need to pitch the tent if any rain fell above the canopy of leaves absorbed it he was amusing himself while he smoked his pipe with watching the reflection of the firelight against a patch of darkness caused probably by some bush about twenty yards away and by picturing in his own mind the face of barbara that strong pleasant english face as it might appear on such a background suddenly there on the identical spot he did see a face though one of a very different character it was round and small and hideous resembling in its general outline that of a bloated child at this distance he could not distinguish the features except the lips which were large and pendulous and between them the flash of white teeth  look here he whispered to jeekie in english and jeekie looked then without saying a word lifted the shotgun that lay at his side and fired straight at the bush instantly there arose a squeaking noise such as might be made by a wounded animal and the four porters sprang up in alarm  sit down said jeekie to them in their own tongue a leopard was stalking us and i fired to frighten it away dont go near the place as it may be wounded and angry but drag up some boughs and make a fence round the fire for fear of others  the men who dreaded leopards looking on these animals indeed with superstitious reverence obeyed readily enough and as there was plenty of wood lying within a few yards soon constructed a boma fence that rough as it was would serve for protection  jeekie said alan presently as they laboured at the fence that was not a leopard it was a man  no no major not man little dwarf devil him that have poisoned arrow i shoot at once to make him sit up think he no come back tonight too much afraid of shot fetish but tomorrow cant say not tell those fellows anything and he nodded towards the porters or perhaps they bolt  i think you would have done better to leave the dwarf alone said alan and they might have left us alone now they will have a blood feud against us  not agree major only chance for us put him in blue funk if i not shoot presently he shoot and he made a sound that resembled the whistling of an arrow then added now you go sleep i not tired i watch my eyes see in dark better than yours only two more days of this damn forest then open land with tree here and there where dwarf no come because he afraid of lion and cannibal man who like eat him  as there was nothing else to be done alan took jeekies advice and in time fell fast asleep nor did he wake again till the faint light which for the want of a better name they called dawn was filtering down to them through the canopy of boughs  been to look said jeekie as he handed him his coffee hit that dwarf man see his blood but think others carry him away jeekie very good shot stone spear arrow or gun all same to him now get off as quick as we can before porters smell a rat you eat chop major i pack  presently they started on their trudge through those endless trees with fear for a companion even the porters who had been told nothing seemed more afraid than usual though whether this was because they smell rat as jeekie called it or owing to the progressive breakdown of their nervous systems alan did not know about midday they stopped to eat because the men were too tired to walk further without rest for an hour or more they had been looking for a comparatively open place but as it chanced could find none so were obliged to halt in dense forest just as they had finished their meal and were preparing to proceed that which they had feared happened since from somewhere behind the tree boles came a volley of reed arrows one struck a porter in the neck one fixed itself in alans helmet without touching him and no less than three hit jeekie on the back and stuck there providentially enough in the substance of the cork mattress that he still carried on his shoulders which the feeble shafts had not the strength to pierce  everybody sprang up and with a curious fascination instead of attempting to do anything watched the porter who had been hit in the neck somewhere in the region of the jugular vein the poor man rose to his feet with great deliberation reminding alan in some grotesque way of a speaker who has suddenly been called on to address a meeting and seeks to gain time for the gathering of his thoughts then he turned towards that vast audience of the trees stretched out his hand with a declamatory gesture said something in a composed voice and fell upon his face stone dead the swift poison had reached his heart and done its work  his three companions looked at him for a moment and the next with a yell of terror rushed off into the forest hurling down their loads as they ran what became of them alan never learned for he saw them no more and the dwarf people keep their secrets at the time indeed he scarcely noticed their departure for he was otherwise engaged  one of their hideous little assailants made bold by success ventured to run across an open space between two trees showing himself for a moment alan had a gun in his hand and mad with rage at what had happened he raised it and swung on him as he would upon a rabbit he was a quick and practised shot and his skill did not fail him now for just as the dwarf was vanishing behind a tree the bullet caught him and next instant he was seen rolling over and over upon its further side  that very nice said jeekie reflectively very nice indeed but i think we best move out of this  arent you hurt gasped alan your back is full of arrows  dont feel nothing major he answered best cork mattress 253 at stores very good for poisoned arrow but leave him behind now because perhaps points work through as i run one scratch do trick and as he spoke jeekie untied a string or several strings letting the little mattress fall to the ground  great pity leave all those goods said jeekie surveying the loads that the porters had cast away but what says book life more than raiment also take no thought for morrow dwarf people do that for us come major make tracks and dashing at a bag of cartridges which he cast about his neck a trifling addition to his other impedimenta and a small case of potted meats that he hitched under his arm he poked his master in the back with the muzzle of his fullcocked gun as a signal that it was time to start  keep that cursed thing off me said alan furiously how often have i told you never to carry firearms at full cock  about one thousand times major answered jeekie imperturbably but on such occasion forget discreetness my ma just same it run in family but story too long tell you now cut major cut like hell them dwarfs be back soon but he puffed i think i think little bonsa come square with them one day  so alan cut and the huge jeekie blundered along after him the paraphernalia with which he was hung about rattling like the hoofs of a galloping giraffe nor for all his load did he ever turn a hair whether it were fear within or a desire to save his master or a belief in the virtues of little bonsa or that his foot was as it were once more upon his native heath the fact remained that notwithstanding the fifty years almost that had whitened his wool jeekie was absolutely inexhaustible at least at the end of that fearful chase which lasted all the day and through the night also for they dared not camp he appeared to be nearly as fresh as when he started from old calabar nor did his spirits fail him for one moment  when the light came on the following morning however they perceived by many signs and tokens that the dwarf people were all about them some arrows were shot even but these fell short  pooh said jeekie all right now they much afraid still no time for coffee we best get on  so they got on as they could till towards midday the forest began to thin out now as the light grew stronger they could see the dwarfs of whom there appeared to be several hundred keeping a parallel course to their own on either side of them at what they thought to be a safe distance  try one shot i think said jeekie kneeling down and letting fly at a clump of the little men which scattered like a covey of partridges leaving one of its number kicking on the ground ah my boy shouted jeekie in derision how you like bullet in tummy you not know paradox guaranteed flat trajectory 250 yard you remember that next time sonny then off they went again up a long rise  river other side of that rise said jeekie think those treemonkeys no follow us there  but the monkeys appeared to be angry and determined they would not come any more within the range of the paradox but they still marched on either side of the two fugitives knowing well that at last their strength must fail and they would be able to creep up and murder them so the chase went on till alan began to wonder whether it would not be better to face the end at once  no no if say die cant change mind tomorrow morning gasped jeekie in a hoarse voice here top rise much nearer than i thought oh my aunt who those and he pointed to a large number of big men armed with spears who were marching up the further side of the hill from the river that ran below  at the same moment these savages who were not more than two hundred yards away caught sight of them and of their pursuers who just then appeared on the ridge to the right and left the dwarfs on perceiving these strangers uttered a shrill yell of terror and wheeled about to fly to their fastnesses in the forest which evidently they regretted ever having left it was too late with an answering shout the spearsmen who were extended in a long line apparently hunting for game charged after them at full speed they were fresh and their legs were long therefore very soon they overtook the dwarfs and even got in front of them heading them off from the forest the end may be guessedsave a few whom they reserved alive they killed them mercilessly and almost without loss to themselves since the little forest folk were too terrified and exhausted to shoot at them with their poisoned arrows and they had no other weapons  in fact as alan discovered afterwards for generations there had been war between them since all the other tribes hate the dwarfs whom they look upon as dangerous human monkeys and never before had the big men found such a chance of squaring their account  when jeekie saw this fearfullooking company for the first time his spirits seemed to fail him  ogula he exclaimed with a groan and sat himself upon a flat rock pulling alan down beside him ogula know them by hair and spears he repeated up gum tree now say goodnight  why who are they gasped alan  great cannibal major eat man eat us tonight or perhaps tomorrow morning when we nice and cool say prayers major quick no time waste  i think i will shoot an ogula or two first said alan grimly as he stood up and lifted his gun  no not shoot no good pretend not be afraid best chance let jeekie think let jeekie think and he slapped his forehead with his large hand  apparently the action brought inspiration for next instant he grabbed his master by the arm and dragged him back behind the shelter of a big boulder which they had just passed then with really marvellous swiftness he cut the straps of the tin box that alan wore upon his back and since there was no time to find the key and unlock it seized the little padlock with which it was fastened between his finger and thumb and putting out his great strength with a single wrench twisted it off  what are you began alan  hold tongue he answered savagely make you god i priest ogula know little bonsa quick quick  in a minute it was done the golden mask was clapped on to alans head and the leather thongs were fastened moreover jeekie himself was arrayed in the solartope to which all this while he had clung allowing streams of green mosquito netting to hang down over his white robe  come out now major he said and play god you whistle i do palaver  then hand in hand they walked from behind the rock by this time the particular company of the cannibals that was opposite to them which happened to include their chief had climbed the steep slope of the hill and arrived within a distance of twenty yards having seen the two men and guessed that they had taken refuge behind the rock their spears were lifted to kill them since when he beholds anything strange the first impulse of a savage is to bring it to its death they looked they saw of a sudden down went the raised spears  some of those who held them fell upon their faces while others turned to fly appalled by the vision of this strangely clad man with the head of gold only their chief a great yellowtoothed fellow who wore a necklace of baboon claws remained erect staring at them with open mouth  alan blew the whistle that was set between the lips of the mask and they shivered then jeekie spoke to them in some tongue which they understood saying  do you o ogula dare to offer violence to little bonsa and her priests say now why should we not strike you dead with the magic of the god which she has borrowed from the white man and he tapped the gun he held  this is witchcraft answered the chief we saw two men running hunted by the dwarfs not three minutes ago and now we seewhat we see and he put his hand before his eyes then after a pause went onas for little bonsa she left this country in my fathers day he gave her passage upon the head of a white man and the asiki wizards have mourned her ever since or so i hear  fool answered jeekie as she went so she returns on the head of a white man yonder i see an elder with grey hair who doubtless knew of little bonsa in his youth let him come up and look and say whether or no this is the god  yes yes exclaimed the chief go up old man go up and he jabbed at him with his spear until unwillingly enough he went  the elder arrived making obeisance and when he was near alan blew the whistle in his face whereon he fell to his knees  it is little bonsa he said in a trembling voice little bonsa without a doubt i should know as my father and my elder brother were sacrificed to her and i only escaped because she rejected me down on your face chief and do honour to the yellow god before she slay you  instantly every man within hearing prostrated himself and lay still then jeekie strode up and down among them shouting out  little bonsa has come back and brought to you maneaters a fat offering an offering of the dwarfpeople whom you hate of the treacherous dwarfpeople who when you walk the ancient forest path murder you with their poisoned arrows praise little bonsa who delivers you from your foes and hearken to her bidding send on messengers to the asiki saying that little bonsa comes home again from across the black water bringing the white preacher whom she led away in the day of their fathers say to them that the asiki must send out a company that little bonsa and the magician with whom she ran away may be escorted back to her house with the state which has been hers from the beginning of time say to them also that they must prepare a great offering of pure gold out of their store as much gold as fifty strong men can carry not one handful less to be given to the white magician who brings back small swimming head for if they withhold such an offering he and little bonsa will vanish never to be seen again and curses and desolation will fall upon their land rise and obey chief of the ogula  then the man scrambled to his feet and answered  it shall be done o priest of the yellow god tomorrow at the dawn swift messengers will start for the gold house of the asiki tonight they cannot leave as we are all very hungry and must eat  what must you eat asked jeekie suspiciously  o priest answered the chief with a deprecatory gesture when first we saw you we hoped that it would be the white man and yourself for we have never tasted white man but now we fear that you will not consent to this and as you are holy and the guardian of the god we cannot eat you without your own consent therefore fat dwarf must be our food of which however there will be plenty for you as well as us  you dog exclaimed jeekie in a voice of furious indignation do you think that white men and their highborn companions such as myself were made to fill your vile stomachs i tell you that a meal of the deadly bean would agree better with you for if you dare so much as to look on us or on any of the white race with hunger agony shall seize your vitals and you and all your tribe shall die as though by poison moreover we do not touch the flesh of men nor will we see it eaten it is our orunda it is consecrate to us it must not pass our lips nor may our eyes behold it therefore we will camp apart from you further up the stream and find our own food but tomorrow at the dawn the messengers must leave as we have commanded also you shall provide strong men and a large canoe to bear little bonsa forward towards her own home until she finds her people coming out to greet her  it shall be done answered the chief humbly everything shall be done according to the will of little bonsa spoken by her priest that she may leave a blessing and not a curse upon the heads of the tribe of the ogula say where you wish to camp and men shall run to build a house of reeds for the god to dwell in    chapter ix  the dawn  jeekie looked up and down the river and saw that in the centre of it about half a mile away there was an island on which grew some trees  little bonsa will camp yonder he said go make her house ready light fire and bring canoe to paddle us across now leave us all of you for if you look too long upon the face of the yellow god she will ask a sacrifice and it is not lawful that you should see where she hides herself away  at this saying the cannibals departed as one man and at top speed some of the canoes and others to warn their fellows who were engaged in the congenial work of hunting and killing the dwarfs not to dare to approach the white man and his companion a third party ran to the bank of the river that was opposite to the island to make ready as they had been bidden so that presently alan and jeekie were left quite alone  ah said jeekie with a gasp of satisfaction that all right everything arranged quite comfortable thought little bonsa come out top somehow and score off dirty dwarf monkeys they never get home to tea anywaystay and dine with ogula  stop chattering jeekie and untie this infernal mask i am almost choked broke in alan in a hollow voice  not say infernal mask major say face of angel little bonsa woman and like it better also true if on this occasion only for she save our skins said jeekie as he unknotted the thongs and reverently replaced the fetish in its tin box my he added contemplating his masters perspiring countenance you blush like garden carrot well gold hot wear in afternoon sun beneath tropic of cancer now we walk on quietly and i tell you all i arrange for nights lodging and future progress of joint expedition  so gathering together what remained of their few possessions they started leisurely down the slope towards the island and as they went jeekie explained all that had happened since ogula was not one of the african languages with which alan was acquainted and he had only been able to understand a word here and there  look said jeekie when he had finished and turning he pointed to the cannibals who were driving the few survivors of the dwarfs before them to the spot where their canoes were beached those dwarfs done for capital business forest road quite safe to travel home by ogula best friends in world very remarkable escape from delicate situation  very remarkable indeed said alan i shall soon begin to believe in the luck of little bonsa  yes major you see she anxious to get home and make path clear but he added gloomily how she behave when she reach there cant say  nor can i jeekie but meanwhile i hope she will provide us with some dinner for i am faint for want of food and all the tinned meat is lost  food repeated jeekie yes necessity for human stomach which unhappily built that way so ogula find out and so dwarfs find out presently then he looked about him and in a kind of aimless manner lifted his gun and fired there we are he said little bonsa understand bodily needs and he pointed to a fat buck of the sort that in south africa is called duiker which his keen eyes had discovered in its form against a stone where it now lay shot through the head and dying no further trouble on score of grub for next three day he added come on to camp major i send one savage skin and bring that buck  so on they went to the river bank alan so tired now that the excitement was over that he was not sorry to lean upon jeekies arm reaching the stream they drank deep of its water and finding that it was shallow at this spot waded through it to the island without waiting for a canoe to ferry them over here they found a party of the cannibals already at work clearing reeds with their large curved knives in order to make a site for the hut another party under the command of their chief himself had gone to the top end of the island to cut the stems of a willowlike shrub to serve as uprights these people stared at alan which was not strange as they had never before seen the face of a white man and were wondering doubtless what had become of the ancient and terrible fetish that he had worn without entering into explanations jeekie in a great voice ordered two of them to fetch the buck which the white man whom he described as husband of the goddess had slain by thunder when these had departed upon their errand leaving jeekie to superintend the building operations alan sat down upon a fallen tree watching one of the savages making fire with a pointed stick and some tinder  just then from the head of the island where the willows were being cut rose the sound of loud roarings and of men crying out in affright seizing his gun alan ran towards the spot whence the noise came forcing his way through a brake of reeds he saw a curious sight the ogula in cutting the willows which grew about some tumbled rocks had disturbed a lioness that had her lair there and being fearless savages had tried to kill her with their spears the brute rendered desperate by wounds and the impossibility of escape for here the surrounding water was deep had charged them boldly and as it chanced felled to the ground their chief that yellowtoothed man to whom jeekie gave his orders now she was standing over him looking round her royally her great paw upon his breast which it seemed almost to cover while the ogula ran round and round shouting for they feared that if they tried to attack her she would kill the chief this indeed she seemed about to do for just as alan arrived she dropped her head as though to tear out the mans throat instantly he fired it was a snap shot but as it chanced a good one for the bullet struck the lioness in the back of the neck just forward of and between the shoulders severing the spine so that without a sound or any further movement she sank stone dead upon the prostrate cannibal for a while his followers stood astonished they might have heard of guns from the coast people but living as they did in the interior where white folk did not dare to travel they had never seen their terrible effects  magic they cried magic  of course exclaimed jeekie who by now had arrived upon the scene what else did you expect from the husband of little bonsa magic the greatest of magic go roll that beast away before your chief is crushed to death  they obeyed and the man sat up a fearful spectacle for he was smothered with the blood of the lion and somewhat cut by her claws though otherwise unhurt then feeling that the life was still whole in him he crept on his hands and knees to where alan stood and kissed his feet  aha said jeekie little bonsa score again cannibal tribe our slave henceforth for evermore yes till kingdom come come on major and cook supper in perfect peace  the supper was cooked and eaten with gratitude for seldom had two men needed a square meal more and never did venison taste better by the time that it was finished darkness had fallen and before they turned in to sleep in the neat reed hut that the ogula had built alan and jeekie walked up the island to see if the lioness had been skinned as they directed this they found was done even the carcase itself had been removed to serve as meat for these foulfeeding people they climbed on to the pile of rocks in which the beast had made her lair and looked down the river to where two hundred yards away the ogula were encamped from this camp there rose a sound of revelry and by the light of the great fires that burned there they perceived that the hungry savages were busy feasting for some of them sat in circles whilst others their naked forms looking at that distance like those of imps in the infernal regions flitted to and fro against the glowing background of the fires bearing strangelooking joints on prongs of wood  i suppose they are eating the lioness said alan doubtfully  no no major not lioness eat dwarf by dozenjust like oysters at seaside but for little bonsa we sit on those forks now and look uncommon small  beasts said alan in disgust they make me feel uncommon sick let us go to bed i suppose they wont murder us in our sleep will they  not they major too much afraid also we their bloodbrothers now because we bring them firstclass dinner and save chief from lions fury no blame them too much major good fellows really with gentle heart but grub like that from generation to generation every mothers son of them have many men inside that why they so big and strong ogula people cover great multitude like charity in book no doubt sent by providence to keep down extra poplation not right to think too hard of poor fellows who as i say very kind and gentle at heart and most loving in family relation except to old women whom they eat also so that they no get bored with too long life  weary and disgusted by this abominable sight though he was alan burst out laughing at his retainers apology for the sweetnatured ogula who struck him as the most repulsive blackguards that he had ever met or heard of in all his experience of african savages then wishing to see and hear no more of them that night he retreated rapidly to the hut and was soon fast asleep with his head pillowed on the box that hid the charms of little bonsa when he awoke it was broad daylight rising he went down to the river to wash and never had a bath been more welcome for during all their journey through the forest no such thing was obtainable on his return he found his garments well brushed with dry reeds and set upon a rock in the hot sun to air while jeekie in a cheerful mood was engaged cooking breakfast in the fryingpan to which he had clung through all the vicissitudes of their flight  no coffee major he said regretfully that stop in forest but never mind hot water better for nerve ogula messengers gone in little canoe to asiki at break of day travel slow till they work off dwarf but afterwards go quick i send lion skin with them as present from you to great highpriestess asika also claws for necklace no lions there and she think much of that also it make her love mighty man who can kill fierce lion like samson in book love of head woman very valuable ally among beastly savage peoples  i am sure i hope it wont said alan with earnestness but no doubt it is as well to keep on the soft side of the good lady if we can what time do we start  in one hour major i been to camp already chosen best canoe and finest men for rowers chiefhe called fannyso grateful that he come with them himself  indeed that is very kind of him but i say jeekie what are these fellows going to live on i cant stand what you call their favourite chop  no no major that all right i tell them that when they travel with little bonsa they must keep lent like pious roman catholic family that live near yarleys they catch plenty fish in river and perhaps we shoot game or rich potamus which they like cause he fat  evidently the ogula chief fahni by name not fanny as jeekie called him was a man of his word for before the hour was up he appeared at the island in command of a large canoe manned by twelve splendidlooking savages springing to land he prostrated himself before alan kissing his feet as he had done on the previous night and making a long speech  that very good spirit exclaimed jeekie like to see heathen in his darkness lick white gentlemans boot he say you his lord and great magician who save his life and know all little bonsas secrets which many and unrepeatable he say he die for you twice a day if need be and go on dying tomorrow and all next year he say he take you safe till you meet asiki and for your sake though he hungry eat no man for one whole month or perhaps longer now we start at once  so they started up the river that was called katsena alan and jeekie seated in a lordly fashion near the stern of the canoe beneath an awning made out of some sticks and a grass mat in truth after their severe toil and adventures in the forest this method of journeying proved quite luxurious except for a rapid here and there over or round which the canoe must be dragged the river was broad and the scenery on its banks parklike and beautiful moreover the country perhaps owing to the appetites of the ogula appeared to be practically uninhabited except by vast herds of every sort of game  all day they sat in the canoe which the stalwart rowers propelled in silence for the most part since they were terribly afraid of the white man and still more so of the renowned fetish which they knew he carried with him then when evening came they moored their craft to the bank and camped till the following morning nor did they lack for food since game being so plentiful it was only necessary for alan to walk a few hundred yards and shoot a fat eland or hartebeest or other buck which in its ignorance of guns would allow him to approach quite close elephants rhinoceros and buffalo were also common while great herds of giraffe might be seen wandering between the scattered trees but as they were not upon a hunting trip and their ammunition was very limited with these they did not interfere  having their daily fill of meat which their souls loved the ogula oarsmen remained in an excellent mood indeed the chief fahni informed alan that if only they had such magic tubes wherewith to slaughter game he and his tribe would gladly give up cannibalismexcept on feast days he added sadly that soon they would be obliged to do so or die since in those parts there were now few people left to eat and they hated vegetables moreover they kept no cattle it was not the custom of that tribe except a very few for milk alan advised them to increase their herds since as he pointed out to them dog should not eat dog or the human being his own kind  the chief answered that there was a great deal in what he said which on his return he would lay before his head men indeed alan to his astonishment discovered that jeekie had been quite right when he alleged that these people so terrible in their mode of life were yet kind and gentle at heart they preyed upon mankind because for centuries it had been their custom so to do but if anyone had been there to show them a better way he grew sure that they would follow it gladly at least they were brave and loyal and even after their first fear of the white man had worn off fulfilled their promises without a murmur once indeed when he chanced to have gone for a walk unarmed and to be charged by a bull elephant these ogula ran at the brute with their spears and drove it away a rescue in which one of them lost his life for the rogue caught and killed him  so the days went on while they paddled leisurely up the river alan employing the time by taking lessons in the asiki tongue from jeekie a language which he had been studying ever since he left england the task was not easy as he had no books and jeekie himself after some thirty years of absence was doubtful as to many of its details still being a linguist by nature and education and finding in the tongue similarities to other african dialects which he knew he was now able to speak it a little in a halting fashion  on the fifth day of their ascent of the river they came to a tributary that flowed into it from the north up which the ogula said they must proceed to reach asikiland the stream was narrow and sluggish widening out here and there into great swamps through which it was not easy to find a channel also the district was so unhealthy that even several of the ogula contracted fever of which alan cured them by heavy doses of quinine for fortunately his travelling medicine chest remained to him these cures were effected after their chief suggested that they should be thrown overboard or left to die in the swamp as useless with the result that the white mans magical powers were thenceforth established beyond doubt or cavil indeed the poor ogula now looked on him as a god superior even to little bonsa whose familiar he was supposed to be  the journey through that swamp was very trying since in this wet season often they could find no place on which to sleep at night but must stay in the canoe tormented by mosquitoes and in constant danger of being upset by the hippopotami that lived there moreover as no game was now available they were obliged to live on these beasts fish when they could catch them and wildfowl which sometimes they were unable to cook for lack of fuel this did not trouble the ogula who ate them raw as did jeekie when he was hungry but alan was obliged to starve until they could make a fire this it was only possible to do when they found drift or other wood since at that season the rank vegetation was in full growth also the fearful thunderstorms which broke continually and in a few minutes half filled their canoe with water made the reeds and the soil on which they grew sodden with wet as jeekie said  this time of year only fit for duck and crocodile human should remember uncontrollable forces of nature and wait till winter come in due course when quagmire bear sole of his foot  this elaborate remark he made to alan during the progress of a particularly fearful tempest the lightning blazed in the black sky and seemed to strike all about them like stabbing swords of fire the thunder crashed and bellowed as it may be supposed that it will do on that day when the great earth worn out at last shall reel and stagger to its doom the rain fell in a straight and solid sheet the tall reeds waved confusedly like millions of dim arms and while they waved uttered a vast and groaning noise the scared wildfowl in their terror with screams and the sough of wings rushed past them in flocks a thousand strong now seen and now lost in the vapours to keep their canoe afloat the poor naked ogula oarsmen shivering with cold and fear baled furiously with their hands or bowls of hollowed wood and called back to alan to save them as though he were the master of the elements even jeekie was depressed and appeared to be offering up petitions though whether these were directed to little bonsa or elsewhere it was impossible to know  as for alan the heart was out of him it is true that so far he had escaped fever or other sickness which in itself was wonderful but he was chilled through and through and practically had eaten nothing for two days and very little for a week since his stomach turned from halfcooked hippopotamus fat and wildfowl moreover they had lost the channel and seemed to be wandering aimlessly through a wilderness of reeds broken here and there by lines of deeper water  according the ogula they should have reached the confines of the great lake several days before and landed on healthful rising ground that was part of the asiki territory but this had not happened and now he doubted whether it ever would happen it was more likely that they would come to their deaths there in the marsh especially as the few ball and shot cartridges which they had saved in their flight were now exhausted not one was left nothing was left except their revolvers with some charges which of course were quite useless for the killing of game therefore they were in a fair way to die of hunger for here if fish existed they refused to be caught and nought remained for them to fill themselves with except water slugs and snails which the boatmen were already gathering and crunching up in their great teeth or perhaps the ogula forgetting friendship under the pressure of necessity would murder them as they slept andrevert to their usual diet  jeekie was right he should have remembered the uncontrollable forces of nature only a madman would have undertaken such an expedition in the rains no wonder that the asiki remained a secret and hidden people when their frontier was protected by such a marsh as this upon the one side and as he understood by impassable mountains upon the other  there came a lull in the tempest and the boatmen began to get the better of the water which now was up to their knees alan asked jeekie if he thought it was over but that worthy shook his white head mournfully causing the spray to fly as from a twirling mop and replied  cant say cats and dogs not tumble so many for present only pups and kitties left so to speak but think there plenty more up there and he nodded at the portentous firelaced cloud which seemed to be spreading over them its black edges visible even through the gloom  bad business i am afraid jeekie shouldnt have brought you here or those poor beggars either and he looked at the scared frozen ogula i begin to wonder  never wonder major broke in jeekie in alarm if wonder not live if wonder not be born too much wonder about everywhere cant understand nothing so give it up say righto and devil hindermost very good motto for biped in tight place better drown here than in city bucket shop but no drown should be dead long ago but little bonsa play the game she not want to sink in stinking swamp when so near her happy home come out all right somehow as from dwarf every cloud have silver lining major even that black chap up there oh my golly  this last exclamation was wrung from jeekies lips by a sudden development of forces of nature which astonished even him instead of a silver lining the black chap exhibited one of gold in an instant it seemed to turn to acres of flame it was as though the heavens had taken fire a flash or a thunderbolt struck the water within ten yards of their canoe causing the boatmen to throw themselves upon their faces through shock or terror then came the hurricane which fortunately was so strong that it permitted no more rain to fall the tall reeds were beaten flat beneath its breath the canoe was seized in its grip and whirled round and round then driven forward like an arrow only the weight of the men and the water in it prevented it from oversetting dense darkness fell upon them and although they could see no star they knew that it must be night on they rushed driven by that shrieking gale and all about and around them this wall of darkness no one spoke for hope was abandoned and if they had their voices could not have been heard the last thing that alan remembered was feeling jeekie dragging a grass mat over him to protect him a little if he could then his senses wavered as does a dying lamp he thought that he was back in what jeekie had rudely called city bucket shop bargaining across the telephone wire upon which came all the sounds of the infernal regions with a financial paper for an article on a little bonsa syndicate that he proposed to float he thought he was in the court woods with barbara only the birds in the trees sang so unnaturally loud that he could not hear her voice and she wore little bonsa on her head as a bonnet then she departed in flame leaving him and death alone    alan awoke above the sun shone hotly warming him back to life but in front was a thick wall of mist and rising beyond it in the distance he saw the rugged swelling forms of mountains doubtless these had been visible before but the tall reeds through which they travelled had hid the sight of them he looked behind him and there in a heap lay the ogula around their chief insensible or sleeping he counted them and found that two were gone lost in the tempest how or where no man ever learned he looked forward and saw a peculiar sight for in the prow of the drifting canoe stood jeekie clad in the remains of his white robe and wearing on his head the battered helmet and about his shoulders the torn fragments of green mosquito net while alan was wondering strangely why he had adopted this ceremonial garb from out of the mist there came a sound of singing of wild and solemn singing jeekie seemed to listen to it then he lifted up his great musical voice and sang as though in answer what he sang alan could not understand but he recognized that the language which he used was that of the asiki people  a pause and a confused murmuring and now again the wild song rose and again jeekie answered  what the deuce are you doing where are we asked alan faintly  jeekie turned and beamed upon him although his teeth were chattering and his face was hollow still he beamed  you awake major he said thought good old sun do trick feel your heart now and find it beat pulse too strong though temprature not normal well good news this morning little bonsa come out top as usual asiki priests on bank there cant see them but know their song and answer same old game as thirty years ago asiki never change which good business when you been away long while  hang the asiki said alan feebly i think all these poor beggars are dead and he pointed to the rowers  look like it major but what that matter now since you and i alive plenty more where they come from not dead though think only sleep no like cold like dormouse but never mind cannibal pig they serve our turn if they live live if they die die and god have mercy on souls if cannibal have soul ah here we are and from beneath six inches of water he dragged up the tin box containing little bonsa from which he extracted the fetish wet but uninjured  put her on now major put her on at once and come sit in prow of canoe must reach asikiland in proper style priests think it your reverend uncle come back again just as he leave make very good impression  i cant said alan feebly i am played out jeekie  oh buck up major buck up he replied imploringly one kick more and you win race mustnt spoil ship for haporth of tar you just wear fetish whistle once on land and then go to sleep for whole week if you like i do rest say it all magic and so forththat you been dead and just come out of grave or anything you like no matter if you turn up as announced on bill and god bless hurricane that blow us here when we expect die come major quick quick mist melt and soon they see you then without waiting for an answer jeekie clapped the wet mask on his masters head tied the thongs and led alan to the prow of the canoe where he set him down on a little cross bench stood behind supporting him and again began to sing in a great triumphant voice  the mist cleared away rolling up like a curtain and revealing on the shore a number of men and women clad in white robes who were martialled in ranks there chanting and staring out at the dim waters of the lagoon yonder upon the waters driven forward by the gentle breeze floated a canoe and lo in the prow of that canoe sat a white man and on his head the god which they had lost a whole generation gone on the head of a white man it had departed on the head of a white man it returned they saw and fell upon their knees  blow major blow whispered jeekie and alan blew a feeble note through the whistle in the mouth of the mask it was enough they knew it they sprang into the water and dragged the canoe to land they set alan on the shore and worshipped him they haled up a lad as though for sacrifice for a priest flourished a great knife above his head but jeekie said something that caused them to let him go alan thought it was to the effect that little bonsa had changed her habits across the black water and wanted no blood only food then he remembered no more again the darkness fell upon him    chapter x  bonsa town  when consciousness returned to alan the first thing of which he became dimly aware was the slow swaying motion of a litter he raised himself for he was lying at full length and in so doing felt that there was something over his face  that confounded little bonsa he thought am i expected to spend the rest of my life with it on my head like the man in the iron mask  then he put up his hand and felt the thing to find that it was not little bonsa but something made apparently of thin fine linen fitted to the shape of his face for there was a nose on it and eyeholes through which he could see yes and a mouth whereof the lips by some ingenious contrivance could be moved up and down  little bonsas undress uniform i expect he muttered and tried to drag it off this however proved to be impossible for it was fitted tightly to his head and laced or fastened at the back of his neck so securely that he could not undo it being still weak soon he gave up the attempt and began to look about him  he was in a litter a very fine litter hung round with beautifully woven and coloured grass mats inside of which were a kind of couch and cushions of soft wool or hair so arranged that he could either sit up or lie down he peeped between two of these mats and saw that they were travelling in a mountainous country over a wellbeaten road or trail and that his litter was borne upon the shoulders of a double line of whiterobed men while all around him marched numbers of other men they seemed to be soldiers for they were arranged in companies and carried large spears and shields also some of them wore torques and bracelets of yellow metal that might be either brass or gold turning himself about he found an eyehole in the back of the litter so contrived that its occupant could see without being seen and perceived that his escort amounted to a veritable army of splendidlooking but sombrefaced savages of a somewhat semitic cast of countenance indeed many of them had aquiline features and hair that although crisped was long and carefully arranged in something like the old egyptian fashion also he saw that about thirty yards behind and separated from him by a bodyguard was borne a second litter by means of a similar aperture in front he discovered yet more soldiers and beyond them at the head of the procession was what appeared to be a body of whiterobed men and women bearing strange emblems and banners these he took to be priests and priestesses  having examined everything that was within reach of his eye alan sank back upon his cushions and began to realize that he was very faint and hungry it was just then that the sound of a familiar voice reached his ears it was the voice of jeekie and he did not speak he chanted in english to a melody which alan at once recognized as a gregorian tone apparently from the second litter  oh major he sang have you yet awoke from refreeeshing sleep if so please answer me in same tone of voice for remember that you deeevil of a swell lord of the little bonsa and must not speak like cooommon cad  feeble as he was alan nearly burst out laughing then remembering that probably he was expected not to laugh chanted his answer as directed which having a good tenor voice he did with some effect to the evident awe and delight of all the escort within hearing  i am awake most excellent jeeeekie and feel the need of food if you have such a thing abououout you and it is lawful for the lord of little bonsa to take nutriment  instantly jeekies deep voice rose in reply  that good tidings upon the mountain tops maajor cant come out to bring you chop because too iiinfra dig for now i also biggish bug the little bird what sit upon the rose as poet saaays i tell these johnnies bring you grub which you eat without qualm for asiki al coooook  then followed loud orders issued by jeekie to his immediate entourage and some confusion  as a result presently alans litter was halted the curtains were opened and kneeling women thrust through them platters of wood upon which wrapped up in leaves were the dismembered limbs of a bird which he took to be chicken or guineafowl and a gold cup containing water pleasantly flavoured with some essence this cup interested him very much both on account of its shape and workmanship which if rude was striking in design resembling those drinking vessels that have been found in mycenian graves also it proved to him that jeekies stories of the abundance of the precious metal among the asiki had not been exaggerated if it were not very plentiful they would scarcely he thought make their travelling cups of gold evidently there was wealth in the land  after the food had been handed to him the litter went on again and seated upon his cushions he ate and drank heartily enough for now that the worst of his fatigue had passed away his hunger was great in some absurd fashion this meal reminded him of that which a traveller makes out of a luncheon basket upon a railway line in europe or america only there the cups are not of gold and among the asiki were no paper napkins no salt and mustard and no three and sixpence or dollar to pay further until he got used to it luncheon in a linen mask with a moveable mouth was not easy this difficulty he overcame at last by propping the imitation lips apart with a piece of bone after which things were easier  when he had finished he threw the platter and the remains out of the litter retaining the cup for further examination and recommenced his intoned and poetical converse with jeekie  to set it out at length would be wearisome but in the course of an hour or so he collected a good deal of information thus he learned that they were due to arrive at the asiki city which was called bonsa town by nightfall or a little after also he was informed that the mask he wore was as he had guessed a kind of undress uniform without which he must never appear since for anyone except the asika herself to look upon the naked countenance of an individual so mysteriously mixed up with little bonsa was sacrilege of the worst sort indeed jeekie assured him that the priests who had put on the headdress when he was insensible were first blindfolded  this news depressed alan very much since the prospect of living in a linen mask for an indefinite period was not cheerful recovering he chanted a query as to the fate of the ogula crew and their chief fahni  not dead intoned jeekie in reply and not gone back aall aliveo somewhere behind there fanny very sick about it for he think asiki bring them along for sacrifice pooor beggars  finally he inquired where little bonsa was and was answered that he himself as its lawful guardian was sitting on the fetish in its tin box tidings that he was able to verify by groping beneath the cushions  after this his voice gave out though jeekie continued to sing items of interesting news from time to time indeed there were other things that absorbed alans attention looking through the peepholes and cracks in the curtains he saw that at last they had reached the crest of a ridge up which they had been climbing for hours before them lay a vast and fertile valley much of which seemed to be under cultivation and down it flowed a broad and placid river opposite to him and facing west a great tongue of land ran up to a wall of mountains with stark precipices of black rock that seemed to be hundreds or even thousands of feet high and at the tip of this tongue a mighty waterfall rushed over the precipice looking at that distance like a cascade of smoke this torrent which he remembered was called raaba fell into a great pool and there divided itself into two rushing branches that enclosed an ellipse of ground surrounded on all sides by water for on its westernmost extremity the branches met again and after flowing a while as one river divided once more and wound away quietly to north and south further than the eye could reach on the island thus formed which may have been three miles long by two in breadth stood thousands of strawroofed squarebuilt huts with verandas neatly arranged in blocks and lines and having between them streets that were edged with palms  on the hither side of the pool was what looked like a park for here grew great black trees which from their flat shape alan took to be some variety of cedar and standing alone in the midst of this park where no other habitations could be discovered was a large low building with darkcoloured walls and gabled roofs that flashed like fire  the gold house said alan to himself with a gasp so it is not a dream or a lie  the details at that distance he could not discover nor did he try to do so for the general glory of the scene held him in its grip at this evening hour for a little while the level rays of the setting sun poured straight up the huge waterhollowed kloof they struck upon the face of the fall staining it and the clouds of mist that hung above to a hundred glorious hues indeed the substance of the foaming water seemed to be interlaced with rainbows whereof the arch reached their crest and the feet were lost in the sullen blackness of the pool beneath beautiful too was the valley glowing in the quiet light of evening and even the native town thus gilded and glorified looked like some happy home of peace  the sun was sinking rapidly and before the litter reached the foot of the hill and began to cross the rich valley all the glory had departed and only the cataract showed white and ghostlike through the gloom but still the light which seemed to gather to itself gleamed upon that golden roof amid the cedar trees then the moon rose and the gold was turned to silver alan lay back upon his cushions full of wonder almost of awe it was a marvellous thing that he should have lived to reach this secret place hidden in the heart of africa and defended by swamps mountains and savages to which so far as he knew only one white man had ever penetrated and to think of it that white man his own uncle had never even held it worth while to make public any account of its wonders which apparently had seemed to him of no importance or perhaps he thought that if he did he would not be believed well there they were before and about him and now the question was what would be his fate in this gold house where the great fetish dwelt with its priestess  ah that priestess somehow he shivered a little when he thought of her it was as though her influence were over him already next moment he forgot her for a while for they had come to the river brink and the litter was being carried on to a barge or ferry about which were gathered many armed men evidently the gold house was well defended both by nature and otherwise the ferry was pulled or rowed across the river he could not see which and they passed through a gateway into the town and up a broad street where hundreds of people watched his advent they did not seem to speak or if they spoke their voices were lost in the sound of the thunder of the great cataract which dominated the place with its sullen continuous roar it took alan days to become accustomed to that roar but by the inhabitants of asikiland apparently it was not noticed their ears and voices were attuned to overcome its volume which their fathers had known from the beginning  presently they were through the town and a wooden gate in an inner wall which surrounded the park where the cedars grew at this spot alan noted that everybody left them except the bearers and a few men whom he took to be priests on they stole like ghosts beneath the mighty trees from whose limbs hung long festoons of moss it was very dark there only in places where a bough was broken the moonlight lay in white gules upon the ground another wall and another gate and suddenly the litter was set down its curtains opened torches flashed women appeared clad in white robes veiled and mysterious who bowed before him then half led and half lifted him from his litter he could feel their eyes on him through their veils but he could not see their faces he could see nothing except their naked coppercoloured arms and long thin hands stretched out to assist him  alan descended from the litter as slowly as he could for somehow he shrank from the quaint carved portal which he saw before him he did not wish to pass it its aspect filled him with reluctance the women drew him on their hands pulled at his arms their shoulders pressed him from behind still he hung back looking about him till to his delight he saw the other litter arrive and out of it emerge jeekie still wearing his sunhelmet with its fringe of tattered mosquito curtain  here we are major he said in his cheerful voice turned up all right like a bad hapenny but in odd situation  very odd echoed alan could you persuade these ladies to let go of me  dont know answered jeekie spect they doubtfully your wives spect you have lots of wives here dont get white man every day so make most of him best thing you do kick out and teach them place rub nose in dirt at once and make them good that firstclass plan with female i no like interfere in such delicate matter  terrified by this information alan put out his strength and shook the women off him whereon without seeming to take any offence they drew back to a little distance and began to bow like automata then jeekie addressed them in their own language asking them what they meant by defiling this mighty lord born of the heavens with the touch of their hands whereat they went on bowing more humbly than before next he threw aside the cushions of the litter and finding the tin box containing little bonsa held it before him in both hands and bade the women lead on  the march began a bewildering march it was like a nightmare veiled women with torches before and behind jeekie stalking ahead carrying the battered tin box long passages lined with gold a vision of black water edged with a wide promenade and finally a large lamplit room whereof the roof was supported by gilded columns and in the room couches of cushions wooden stools inlaid with ivory vessels of water great basins made of some black hard wood and in the centre a block of stone that looked like an altar  jeekie set down the tin box upon the altarlike stone then he turned to the crowd of women and said bring food instantly they departed closing the door of the room behind them  now for a wash said alan unlace this confounded mask jeekie  mustnt major mustnt priests tell me that if those girls see you without mask perhaps they kill them wait till they gone after supper then take it off no one allowed see you without mask except asika herself  alan stepped to one of the wooden bowls full of water which stood under a lamp and gazed at his own reflection the mask was gilded the sham lips were painted red and round the eyeholes were black lines  why it is horrible he exclaimed starting back i look like a devil crossed with guy fawkes do you mean to tell me that i have got to live in this thing  afraid so major upon all public occasion at least they say that you holy not lawful see your sacred face  who do the asiki think i am then jeekie  they think you your reverend uncle come back after many many year you see major they not believe uncle run away with little bonsa they believe little bonsa run away with uncle just for change of air and so on and that now when she tired of strange land she bring him back again that why you so holy favourite of little bonsa who live with you all this time and keep you just same age bloom of youth  in heavens name asked alan exasperated what is little bonsa beyond an ancient and ugly gold fetish  hush said jeekie mustnt call her names here in her own house little bonsa much more than fetish little bonsa alive or so he added doubtfully these silly niggers say she wife of big bonsa you see tomorrow praps but their story this that she get dead sick of big bonsa and bolt with white medicine man who dare preach she nothing but heathen idol she want show him whether or no she only idol that the yarn priests tell it me today they always watch for her there by the edge of the lake they always sure little bonsa come back not at all surprised but as she love you once you stop holy and i holy also thank goodness because she take me too as servant therefore we sleep in peace for they not cut out throats at any rate at present though i think he added mournfully they not let us go either  alan sat down on a stool and groaned at the appalling prospect suggested by this information  cheer up major said jeekie sympathetically perhaps manage hook it somehow and meanwhile make best of bad business and have high old time you see you want to come asikiland though i tell you it rum place and he added with certitude and a circular sweep of his hand by jingo you here now and i daresay they give you all the gold you want  whats the good of gold unless one can get away with it whats the good of anything if we are prisoners among these devils  perhaps time show major hush here come dinner you sit still on stool and look holy  the door opened and through it appeared four of the women bearing dishes and cups full of drink fashioned of gold like that which had been given to alan in the litter he noticed at once that they had removed their veils and outer garments if indeed they were the same women and now like many other africans were but lightly clad in linen capes open in front that hung over their shoulders short petticoats or skirts about their middles and sandals such was their attire which scanty as it might be was yet becoming enough and extremely rich thus the cape was fastened with a brooch of worked gold so were the sandal straps while the petticoat was adorned with beads of gold that jingled as they walked and amongst them strings of other beads of various and beautiful colours that might be glass or might be precious stones moreover these women were young and handsome having splendid figures and wellcut features soft dark eyes and rather long hair worn in the formal and attractive fashion that has been described  advancing to alan two of them knelt before him holding out the trays upon which was the food so they remained while he ate like bronze statues nor would they consent to change their posture even when he told them in their language to be pleased to go away on hearing themselves addressed in the asiki language they seemed surprised for their faces changed a little but go they would not the result was that alan grew extremely nervous and ate and drank so rapidly that he scarcely noted what he was putting into his mouth then before jeekie to whom the women did not kneel had half finished his dinner alan rose and walked away whereon two of the women gathered up everything including the dishes that had been given to jeekie and in spite of his remonstrances carried them out of the room  i say major said jeekie if you gobble chop so fast you go ill inside poor nigger like me cant keep up with you and sleep hungry tonight  i am sorry jeekie said alan with a little laugh but i cant eat off living tables especially when they stare at one like that you tell them that tomorrow we will breakfast alone  oh yes i tell them major but i dont know if they listen they mean it great compliment and only think you not like those girls and send others  look here jeekie exclaimed alan turning his masked face towards the two who remained let us come to an understanding at once clear them out tell them i am so holy that little bonsa is enough for me say i cant bear the sight of females and that if they stop here i will sacrifice them say anything you like only get rid of them and lock the door  thus adjured jeekie began to reason with the women and as they treated his remarks with lofty disdain at last seized first one and then the other by the elbows and literally ran them out of the room  there he said baggage gone since you make such fuss about it though i spect they try to give me bean for this job here he spoke not in figurative english slang but of the calabar bean which is a favourite native poison well dinner gone and girls gone and we tired so best go to bed think we all private here now though in gold house never can be sure and he looked round him suspiciously adding rummy place gold house full of all sort of holes made by old fellows thousand year ago which no one know but bonsa priests still best risk it and take off your face so that you have decent wash and he began to unlace the mask on his masters head  never has a city clerk dressed up for a fancy ball in the armour of a norman knight been more glad to get rid of his costume than was alan of that hateful headdress at length it was gone with his other garments and the muchneeded wash accomplished after which he clothed himself in a kind of linen gown which apparently had been provided for him and lay down on one of the couches placing his revolver by his side  will those lamps burn all night jeekie he asked  hope so major as we havent got no match not fond of dark in gold house answered jeekie sleepily then he began to snore  alan fell asleep but was too excited and tired to rest very soundly all sorts of dreams came to him one of which he remembered on awakening perhaps because it was the last he dreamed that he heard some noise and opened his eyes to see that they were no longer alone in the room the oil lamps had burned quite low indeed some of them were out but by the light of those that remained he saw a tall figure which seemed to appear at the edge of the surrounding blackness a womans figure it walked forward to the altarlike stone upon which lay the tin box containing little bonsa and after several rather awkward attempts succeeded in opening it thereby making a noise which in his dream finally awoke alan for a while the figure gazed at the fetish then it shut the box glided to his bed and bent down as though to study him out of the corners of his eyes he peered up at it pretending all the while to be fast asleep  it was that of a woman wonderfully clad in goldspangled veillike garments with round bosses shaped to the breast covered with thin plates of gold fashioned like the scales of a fish which showed off the extraordinary elegance of her lithe form the low lamplight shone upon her face and the coronet of gold set upon her dark hair what a face it was never in all his days had he seen its like for evil loveliness the great languid oblong eyes the rich red lips bent like a bow the cruel smile of the mouth the broad forehead on which the hair grew low the delicately arched eyebrows and the long curving lashes of the heavy lids beneath them the rounded cheeks smooth as a ripe fruit the firm shapely chin the snakelike poise of the head the long bending neck and the feline smile all of these combined made such a dreamvision as he had never seen before and to tell the truth notwithstanding its beauty for that could not be doubted never wished to see again somehow he felt that if satan should happen to have a coppercoloured wife the exact picture of that lady had projected itself upon his sleeping senses  she seemed to study him very earnestly with a kind of passionate eagerness indeed moving a little now and again to let the light fall upon some part that was in shadow once even she stretched out her rounded arm and just lifted the edge of the blanket so as to expose his hand the left as it chanced on the little finger of this hand alan wore a plain gold ring which barbara had given him once it had been her grandfathers signet this ring which had a coat of arms cut upon its bezel seemed to interest her very much as she examined it for a long while then she drew off from her own finger another ring of gold fashioned of two snakes curiously intertwined and gently so gently that in his sleep he scarcely felt it slipped it on to his finger above barbaras ring  after this she seemed to vanish away and alan slept soundly until the morning when he awoke to find the light of the sun pouring into the room through the highset latticed window places    chapter xi  the hall of the dead  alan rose and stretched himself and hearing him jeekie who had a dogs faculty of instantly awaking from what seemed to be the deepest sleep sat up also  you rest well major no dream eh he asked curiously  not very answered alan and i had a dream of a woman who stood over me and vanished away as dreams do  ah said jeekie but where you find that new ring on finger major  alan stared at his hand and started for there set on it above that of barbara was the little circlet formed of twisted snakes which he had seen in his sleep  then it must have been true he said in a low and rather frightened voice but how did she come and go  funny place gold house i tell you that yesterday major people come up through hole like rat never quite sure you alone in gold house but what this lady like  alan described his visitor to the best of his ability  ah said jeekie pretty girl big eyes gold crown gold stays which fit tight in front very nice and decent sort of nightshirt with little gold stars all overby jingo i think that asika herself if sogreat compliment  confound the compliment i think it great cheek answered alan angrily what does she mean by poking about here at night and putting rings on my finger  dont know major but praps she wish make you understand that she like cut of your jib find out by and by meanwhile you wear ring for while that on finger no one do you any harm  you told me that this asika is a married woman did you not remarked alan gloomily  oh yes major always married one down other come on you see but she not always like her husband and then she make him sit up poor devil and he die double quick great honour to be asikas husband but soon all finished praps  then he checked himself and suggested that alan should have a bath while he cleaned his clothes an attention that they needed  scarcely had alan finished his toilet donned the arablooking linen robe over his own fragmentary flannels and above it the hateful mask which jeekie insisted he must wear when there came a knocking on the door motioning to alan to take his seat upon a stool jeekie undid the bars and as before women appeared with food and waited while they ate which this time having overcome his nervousness alan did more leisurely their meal done one of the women asked jeekie for to his master they did not seem to dare to speak whether the white lord did not wish to walk in the garden without waiting for an answer she led him to the end of the large room and unbarring another door that they had not noticed revealed a passage beyond which appeared trees and flowers then she and her companions went away with the fragments of the meal  come on said alan taking up the box containing little bonsa which he did not dare to leave behind and let us get into the air  so they went down the passage and at the end of it through gates of copper or gold they knew not which that had evidently been left open for them into the garden it was a large place a good many acres in extent indeed and kept with some care for there were paths in it and flowers that seemed to have been planted also here grew certain of the mighty cedar trees that they had seen from far off beneath those spreading boughs twilight reigned while beyond not more than half a mile away the splendid riverfall thundered down the precipice for the rest they could find no exit to that garden which on one side was enclosed by a sheer cliff of living rock and on the others with steep stone walls beyond which ran a torrent and by the buildings of the gold house itself  for a while they walked up and down the rough paths till at last jeekie wearying of this occupation remarked  melancholy hole this major remind me of westminster abbey in london fog where your uncle of blessed memry often take me pray and look at fusty tomb of king spose we go back gold house and see what happen anything better than stand about under cursed old cedar tree  all right said alan who through the eyeholes of his mask had been studying the walls to seek a spot in them that could be climbed if necessary and found none  so they returned to the room which had been swept and garnished in their absence no sooner had they entered it than the door opened and through it came long lines of asiki priests each of whom staggered beneath the weight of a hide bag that he bore upon his shoulder which bags they piled up about the stone altar then as though at some signal each priest opened the mouth of his bag and alan saw that they wee filled with gold gold in dust gold in nuggets gold in vessels perfect or broken more gold than alan had ever seen before  why do they bring all this stuff here he asked and jeekie translated his question  it is an offering to the lord of little bonsa answered the head priest bowing a gift from the asika the heavenborn white man sent word by his ogula messengers that he desired gold here is the gold that he desired  alan stared at the treasure which after all was what he had come to seek if only he had it safe in england he would be a rich man and his troubles ended but how could he get it to england here it was worthless as mud  i thank the asika he said i ask for porters to bear her gift back to my own country since it is too heavy for me and my servant to carry alone  at these words the priest smiled a little then said that the asika desired to see the white lord and to receive from him little bonsa in return for the gold and that he could proffer his request to her  good replied alan lead me to the asika  then they started alan bearing the box containing little bonsa and jeekie following after him they went down passages and through sundry doors till at length they came to a long and narrow hall that seemed to be lined with plates of gold at the end of this hall was a large chair of black wood and ivory placed upon a dais and sitting in this chair with the light pouring on her from some opening above was the woman of alans dream beautiful to look on in her crown and glittering garments upon a stool at the foot of the dais sat a man a handsome and melancholy man his hair was tied behind his head in a pigtail and gilded his face was painted red white and yellow he wore ropes of brightcoloured stones about his neck middle arms and ankles and held a kind of sceptre in his hand  who is that creature asked alan over his shoulder to jeekie the court fool  that husband of asika major he not fool very big gun but look a little low now because his time soon up come on major asika beckon us get on stomach and crawl that custom here he added going down on to his hands and knees as did all the priests who followed them  ill see her hanged first answered alan in english  then accompanied by the creeping jeekie and the train of prostrate priests he marched up the long hall to the edge of the dais and there stood still and bowed to the woman in the chair  greeting white man she said in a low voice when she had studied him for a while do you understand my tongue  a little he answered in asiki moreover my servant here knows it well and can translate  i am glad she said tell me then in your country do not people go on to their knees before their queen and if not how do they greet her  no answered alan with the help of jeekie they greet her by raising their headdress or kissing her hand  ah she said well you have no headdress so kiss my hand and she stretched it out towards him at the same time prodding the man whom jackie had said was her husband in the back with her foot apparently to make him get out of the way  not knowing what to do alan stepped on to the dais the painted man scowling at him as he passed then he halted and said  how can i kiss your hand through this mask asika  true she answered then considered a little and added white man you have brought back little bonsa have you not little bonsa who ran away with you a great many years ago  i have he said ignoring the rest of the question  your messengers said that you required a present of gold in return for little bonsa i have sent you one is it sufficient if not you can have more  i cannot say o asika i have not examined it but i thank you for the present and desire porters to enable me to carry it away  you desire porters she repeated meditatively we will talk of that when you have rested here a moon or two meanwhile give me little bonsa that she may be restored to her own place  alan opened the tin box and lifting out the fetish gave it to the priestess who took it and with a serpentine movement of extraordinary grace glided from her chair on to her knees holding the mask above her head in both hands then thrice covered her face with it this done she called to the priests bidding them take little bonsa to her own place and give notice throughout the land that she was back again she added that the ancient feast of little bonsa would be held on the night of the full moon within three days and that all preparations must be made for it as she had commanded  then the head medicineman raising himself upon his knees crept on to the dais took the fetish from her hands and breaking into a wild song of triumph he and his companions crawled down the hall and vanished through the door leaving them alone save for the asikas husband  when they had gone the asika looked at this man in a reflective way and alan looked at him also through the eyeholes of his mask finding him well worth studying as has been said notwithstanding his paint and grotesque decorations he was very goodlooking for a native with wellcut features of an arab type also he was tall and muscular and not more than thirty years of age what struck alan most however was none of these things nor his jewelled chains nor even his gilded pigtail but his eyes which were full of terrors seeing them alan remembered jeekies story which he had told to mr haswells guests at the court of how the husband of the asika was driven mad by ghosts  just then she spoke to the man addressing him by name and saying  leave us alone mungana i wish to speak with this white lord  he did not seem to hear her words but continued to stare at alan  hearken she exclaimed in a voice of ice do my bidding and begone or you shall sleep alone tonight in a certain chamber that you know of  then mungana rose looked at her as a dog sometimes does at a cruel master who is about to beat it yes with just that same expression put his hands before his eyes for a little while and turning left the hall by a side door which closed behind him the asika watched him go laughed musically and said  it is a very dull thing to be marriedbut how are you named white man  vernon he answered  vernoon vernoon she repeated for she could not pronounce the o as we do are you married vernoon  he shook his head  have you been married  no he answered never but i am going to be  yes she repeated you are going to be you remember that you were near to it many years ago when little bonsa got jealous and ran away with you well she wont do that again for doubtless she is tired of you now and besides she added with a flash of ferocity id melt her with fire first and set her spirit free  while jeekie was trying to explain this mysterious speech to alan the asika broke in asking  do you always want to wear that mask  he answered certainly not whereon she bade jeekie take it off which he did  understand me she said fixing her great languid eyes upon his in a fashion that made him exceedingly uncomfortable understand vernoon that if you go out anywhere it must be in your mask which you can only put off when you are alone with me  why  because vernoon i do not choose that any other woman should see your face if a woman looks upon your uncovered face remember that she diesnot nicely  alan stared at her blankly being unable to find appropriate asiki words in which to reply to this threat but the asika only leaned back in her chair and laughed at his evident confusion and dismay till a new thought struck her  your lips are free now she said kiss my hand after the fashion of your own country and she stretched it out to alan leaving him no choice but to obey her  why she went on mischievously taking his hand and in turn touching it with her red lips why are you a thief vernoon that ring was mine and you have stolen it how did you steal that ring  i dont know he answered through jeekie i found it on my finger i cannot understand how it came there i understand nothing of all this talk  well well keep it vernoon only give me that other ring of yours in exchange  i cannot he replied colouring i promised to wear it always  whom did you promise she asked with a flash of rage was it a woman nay i see it is a mans ring and that is well for otherwise i would bring a curse on her however far off she may be dwelling say no more and forgive my anger a vow is a vowkeep your ring but where is that one you used to wear in bygone days i recall that it had a cross upon it not this star and figure of an eagle  now alan remembered that his uncle owned such a ring with a cross upon it and was frightened for how did this woman know these things  jeekie he said ask the asika if i am mad or if she is how can she know what i used to wear seeing that i was never in this place till yesterday and certainly i have not met her anywhere else  she mean when you your reverend uncle said jeekie wagging his great head she think you identical man  what troubles you vernoon the asika asked softly then added anything but softly to jeekie translate you dog and be swift  so jeekie translated in a great hurry telling her what alan had said and adding on his own account that he silly white man that he was could not understand how as she was quite a young woman she could have seen him before she was born if that were so she would be old and ugly now not beautiful as she was  i never saw you before and you never saw me lady yet you talk as though we had been friends broke in alan in his halting asiki  so we were in the spirit vernoon it was she who went before me who loved that white man whose face was as your face is but her ghost lives on in me and tells me the tale there have been many asikas for thousands of years they have ruled in this land yet but one spirit belongs to them all it is the string upon which the beads of their lives are threaded white man i whom you think young know everything back to the beginning of the world back to the time when i was a monkey woman sitting in those cedar trees and if you wish i can tell it you  i should like to hear it very much indeed answered alan when he had mastered her meaning though it is strange that none of the rest of us remember such things meanwhile o asika i will tell you that i desire to return to my own land taking with me that gift of gold that you have given me when will it please you to allow me to return  not yet a while i think she said smiling at him weirdly for no other word will describe that smile my spirit remembers that it was always thus those wanderers who came hither always wished to return again to their own country like the birds in spring once there was a white man among them that was more than twenty hundred years ago he was a native of a country called roma and wore a helmet he wished to return but my mother of that day she kept him and by and by i will show him to you if you like before that there was a brown man who came from a land where a great river overflows its banks every year he was a prince of his own country who had fled from his king and the desert folk made a slave of him and so he drifted hither he wished to return also for my mother of that day or my spirit that dwelt in her showed to him that if he could but be there they would make him king in his own land but my mother of that day she would not let him go and by and by i will show him to you if you wish  bewildered amazed alan listened to her evidently the woman was mad or else she played some mystical part for reasons of her own  when will you let me go o asika he repeated  not yet a while i think she said again you are too comely and i like you and she smiled at him there was nothing coarse in the smile indeed it had a certain spiritual quality which thrilled him i like you she went on in her dreamy voice i would keep you with me until your spirit is drawn up into my spirit making it strong and rich as all the spirits that went before have done those spirits that my mothers loved from the beginning which dwell in me today  now alan grew alarmed desperate even  queen he said but just now your husband sat here is it right then that you should talk to me thus  my husband she answered laughing why that man is but a slave who plays the part of husband to satisfy an ancient law never has he so much as kissed my finger tips my womenthose who waited on you last nightare his wives not ior may be if he will soon he will die of love for me and then when he is dead though not before i may take another husband any husband that i choose and i think that no black man shall be my lord who have other purer blood in me vernoon five centuries have gone by since an asika was really wed to a foreign man who wore a green turban and called himself a son of the prophet a man with a hooked nose and flashing eyes who reviled our gods until they slew him even though he was the beloved of their priestess she who went before me also would have married that white man whose face was like your face but he fled with little bonsa or rather little bonsa fled with him so she passed away unwed and in her place i came  how did you come if she whom you call your mother was not your mother asked alan  what is that to you white man she replied haughtily i am here as my spirit has been here from the first oh i see you think i lie to you come then come and i will show you those who from the beginning have been the husbands of the asika and rising from her chair she took him by the hand  they went through doors and by long halflit passages till they came to great gates guarded by old priests armed with spears as they drew near to these priests the asika loosed a scarf that she wore over her breastplate of gold fish scales and threw the starspangled thing over alans head that even these priests should not see his face then she spoke a word to them and they opened the gates here jeekie evinced a disposition to remain remarking to his master that he thought that place into which he had never entered much too holy for poor nigger like him  the asika asked him what he had said and he explained his sense of unworthiness in her own tongue  come fellow she exclaimed to translate my words and to bear witness that no trick is played upon your lord  still jeekie lingered bashfully whereon at a sign from her one of the priests pricked him behind with his great spear and uttering a low howl he sprang forward  the asika led the way down a passage which they saw ended in a big hall lit with lamps now they were in it and alan became aware that they had entered the treasure house of the asiki since here were piled up great heaps of gold gold in ingots gold in nuggets in stone jars filled with dust in vessels plain or embossed with monstrous shapes in fetishes and in little squares and discs that looked as though they had served as coins never had he seen so much gold before  you are rich here lady he said gazing at the piles astonished  she shrugged her shoulders yes as i have heard that some people count wealth these are the offerings brought to our gods from the beginning also all the gold found in the mountains belongs to the gods and there is much of it there the gift i sent to you was taken from this heap but in truth it is but a poor gift seeing that although this stuff is bright and serves for cups and other things it has no use at all and is only offered to the gods because it is harder to come by than other metals look these are prettier than the gold and from a stone table she picked up at hazard a long necklace of large uncut stones red and white in colour and set alternatively that alan judged to be crystals and spinels  take it she said and examine it at your leisure it is very old for hundreds of years no more of these necklaces have been made and with a careless movement she threw the chain over his head so that it hung upon his shoulders  alan thanked her then remembered that the man called mungana who was the husband real or official of this priestess had been somewhat similarly adorned and shivered a little as though at a presage of advancing fate still he did not return the thing fearing lest he should give offence  at this moment his attention was taken from the treasure by the sound of a groan behind him turning round he perceived jeekie his great eyes rolling as though in an extremity of fear  oh my golly major he ejaculated pointing to the wall look there  alan looked but at first in that dim light could only discover long rows of gleaming objects which reached from the floor to the roof  come and see said the asika and taking a lamp from that table on which lay the gems she led him past the piles of gold to one side of the vault or hall then he saw and although he did not show it like jeekie he was afraid  for there each in his own niche and standing one above the other were what looked like hundreds of golden men with gleaming eyes at first until the utter stillness undeceived him he thought that they must be men then he understood that this was what they had been now they were corpses wrapped in sheets of thin gold and wearing golden masks with eyes of crystal each mask being beaten out to a hideous representation of the man in life  all these are the husbands of my spirit said the priestess waving the lamp in front of the lowest row of them munganas who were married to the asikas in the past look here is he who said that he ought to be king of that rich land where year after year the river overflows its banks and going to one of the first of the figures in the bottom row she drew out a fastening and suffered the gold mask to fall forward on a hinge exposing the face within  although it had evidently been treated with some preservative this head now was little more than a skull still covered with dark hair but set upon its brow appeared an object that alan recognized at once a simple band of plain gold and rising from it the head of an asp without doubt it was the uraeus that symbol which only the royalties of old egypt dared to wear without doubt also either this man had brought it with him from the nile or in memory of his rank and home he had fashioned it of the gold that was so plentiful in the place of his captivity so this womans story was true an ancient egyptian had once been husband to the asika of his day  meanwhile his guide had passed a long way down the line and halting in front of another goldwrapped figure opened its mask  this is that man she said who told us he came from a land called roma look the helmet still rests upon his head though time has eaten into it and that ring upon your hand was taken from his finger i have a headdress made upon the model of that helmet which i wear sometimes in memory of this man who my soul remembers was brave and pleasant and a gallant lover  indeed answered alan looking at the sunken face above which a rim of curls appeared beneath the rusting helmet well he doesnt look very gallant now does he then he peered down between the body and its gold casing and saw that in his body hand the man still held a short roman sword lifted as though in salute so she had not lied in this matter either  meanwhile the asika had glided on to the end of the hall behind the heaps of treasure  there is one more white man she said though we know little of him for he was fierce and barbarous and died without learning our tongue after killing a great number of the priests of that day because they would not let him go yes died cutting them down with a battleaxe and singing some wild song of his own country come hither slave and bend yourself so resting your hands upon the ground  jeekie obeyed and actively as a cat the priestess leaped on to his back and reaching up opened the mask of a corpse in the second row and held her lamp before its face  it was better preserved than the others so that its features remained comparatively perfect and about them hung a tangle of golden hair moreover a broad battleaxe appeared resting on the shoulder  a viking thought alan i wonder how he came here  when he had looked the asika leaped from jeekies back to the ground and waving her arm around her began to talk so rapidly that alan could understand nothing of her words and asked jeekie to translate them  she say explained jeekie between his chattering teeth that all rest these johnnies very poor crew natives and that lot except one who worship false prophet and cut throat of asika of that time because she infidel and he teach her better also eat his dinner out of little bonsa and chuck her into water very wild man that arab but priests catch him at last and fill him with hot gold before little bonsa because he no care a damn for ghosts so he die saying hip hip hurrah for houri and green field of prophet and to hell with asika and bonsa big and little now he sit up there and at night time worst ghost of all the crowd always come to finish off mungana that all she say and quite enough too come on quick she want you and no like wait  by now the asika had passed almost round the hall and was standing opposite to an empty niche beyond and above which there were perhaps a score of bodies goldplated in the usual fashion  that is your place vernoon she said gently contemplating him with her soft and heavy eyes for it was prepared for the white man with whom little bonsa fled away and since then as you see there have been many munganas some of whom belong to me indeed that one and she touched a corpse on which the gold looked very fresh only left me last year but we always knew that little bonsa would bring you back again and so you see we have kept your place empty  indeed remarked alan that is very kind of you and feeling that he would faint if he stayed longer in this horrible and haunted vault he pushed past her with little ceremony and walked out through the gates into the passage beyond    chapter xii  the gold house  how you like asikiland major asked jeekie who had followed him and was now leaning against a wall fanning himself feebly with his great hand funny place isnt it major i tell you so before you come but you no believe me  very funny answered alan so funny that i want to get out  ah major that what eel say in trap where he go after lobworm but he only get out into frying pan after cook skin him aliveo ah here come cooki mean asika she only stop shut up those stiff uns who all love lobworm one day very pretty woman asika but thank god she not set cap at me who like to be buried in open like christian man  if you dont stop it jeekie replied alan in a concentrated rage ill see that you are buried just where you are  no offence major no offence my heart full and bubble up i wonder what miss barbara say if she see you mooing and cooing with darkeyed girl in gold snake skin  just then the asika arrived and by way of excuse for his flight alan remarked to her that the treasurehall was hot  i did not notice it she answered but he who is called my husband mungana says the same the mungana is guardian of the dead she explained and when he is required so to do he sleeps in the place of the treasure and gathers wisdom from the spirits of those munganas who were before him  indeed and does he like that bedchamber  the mungana likes what i like not what he likes she replied haughtily where i send him to sleep there he sleeps but come vernoon and i will show you the holy water where big bonsa dwells also the house in which i have my home where you shall visit me when you please  who built this place asked alan as she led him through more dark and tortuous passages it is very great  my spirit does not remember when it was built vernoon so old is it but i think that the asiki were once a big and famous people who traded to the water upon the west and even to the water on the east and that was how those white men became their slaves and the munganas of their queens now they are small and live only by the might and fame of big and little bonsa not half filling the rich land which is theirs but she added reflectively and looking at him i think also that this is because in the past fools have been thrust upon my spirit as munganas what it needs is the wisdom of the white man such wisdom as yours vernoon if that were added to my magic then the asiki would grow great again seeing that they have in such plenty the gold which you have shown me the white man loves yes they would grow great and from coast to coast the people should bow at the name of bonsa and send him their sons for sacrifice perhaps you will live to see that day vernoon slave she added addressing jeekie set the mask upon your lords head for we come where women are  alan objected but she stamped her foot and said it must be so having once worn little bonsa as her people told her he had done his naked face might not be seen so alan submitted to the hideous headdress and they entered the asikas house by some back entrance  it was a place with many rooms in it but they were all remarkable for extreme simplicity with a single exception no gilding or gold was to be seen although the food vessels were made of this material here as everywhere the chambers including those in which the asika lived and slept were panelled or rather boarded with cedar wood that was almost black with age and their scanty furniture was mostly made of ebony they were very insufficiently lighted like his own room by means of barred openings set high in the wall indeed gloom and mystery were the keynotes of this place amongst the shadows of which handsome halfnaked servants or priestesses flitted to and fro at their tasks or peered at them out of dark corners the atmosphere seemed heavy with secret sin alan felt that in those rooms unnameable crimes and cruelties had been committed for hundreds or perhaps thousands of years and that the place was yet haunted by the ghosts of them at any rate it struck a chill to his healthy blood more even than had that hall of the dead and of heapedup golden treasure  does my house please you the asika asked of him  not altogether he answered i think it is dark  from the beginning my spirit has ever loved the dark vernoon i think that it was shaped in some black midnight  they passed through the chief entrance of the house which had pillars of woodwork grotesquely carved down some steps into a walled and roofedin yard where the shadows were even more dense than in the house they had left only at one spot was there light flowing down through a hole in the roof as it did apparently in that hall where alan had found the asika sitting in state the light fell on to a pedestal or column made of gold which was placed behind an object like a large saxon font also made of gold the shape of this column reminded alan of something namely of a very similar column although fashioned of a different material which stood in the granitebuilt office of messrs aylward  haswell in the city of london nor did this seem wonderful to him since on top of it squatting on its dwarf legs stood a horrid but familiar thing namely little bonsa herself come home at last there she sat smiling cruelly as she had smiled from the beginning forgetful doubtless of her wanderings in strange lands while round her stood a band of priests armed with spears  followed by the asika and jeekie alan walked up and looked her in the face and to his excited imagination she appeared to grin at him in answer then while the priests prostrated themselves he examined the golden basin or laver and saw that at the further side of it was a little platform approached by steps on the top of these golden steps were two depressions such as might have been worn out in the course of ages by persons kneeling there also the flat edge of the basin which stood about thirty inches above the level of the topmost step was scored as though by hundreds of sword cuts which had made deep lines in the pure metal the basin itself was empty  seeing that these things interested him the asika volunteered the information through jeekie that this was a diviningbowl and that if those who went before her had wished to learn the future they caused little bonsa to float in it and found out all they wanted to know by her movements she however she added had other and better methods of learning things that were predestined  where does the water come from asked alan thoughtlessly searching the bowl for some tap or inlet  out of the hearts of men she answered with a low and dreadful laugh these marks are those of swords and every one of them means a life then seeing that he looked incredulous she added stay i will show you little bonsa must be thirsty who has fasted so long also there are matters that i desire to know come hitheryou and you and she pointed at hazard to the two priests who knelt nearest to her and do you bid the executioner bring his axe she went on to a third  the dark faces of the men turned ashen but they made no effort to escape their doom one of them crept up the steps and laid his neck upon the edge of gold while the other uttering no word threw himself on his face at the foot of them waiting his turn then a door opened and there appeared a great and brutallooking fellow naked except for a loin cloth who bore in his hand a huge weapon half knife and half axe  first he looked at the asika who nodded almost imperceptibly then sprang on to a prolongation of the golden steps bowed to little bonsa on her column behind and heaved up his knife  now for the first time alan really understood what was about to happen and that what he had imagined a stage rehearsal was to become a hideous murder  stop he shouted in english being unable to remember the native word  the executioner paused with his axe poised in midair the victim turned his head and looked as though surprised the second victim and the priests their companions looked also jeekie fell on to his knees and burst into fervent prayer addressed apparently to little bonsa the asika smiled and did nothing  again the weapon was lifted and as he felt that words were no longer of any use even if he could find them alan took refuge in action springing on to the other side of the little platform he hit out with all his strength across the kneeling man catching the executioner on the point of the chin he knocked him straight backwards in such fashion that his head struck upon the floor before any other portion of his body so that he lay there either dead or stunned alan never learned which since the matter was not thought of sufficient importance to be mentioned  at this sight the asika burst into a low laugh then asked alan why he had felled the executioner he answered because he would not stand by and see two innocent men butchered  why not she said in an astonished voice if little bonsa whose priests they are needs them and i who am the mouth of the gods declare that they should die still she has been in your keeping for a long while and you may know her will so if you wish it let them live or perhaps you require other victims and she fixed her eyes upon jeekie with a glance of suggestive hope  oh my golly gasped jeekie in english tell her not for joe major tell her most improper say yellow god my dearest friend and go mad as hatter if my throat cut  alan stopped his protestations with a secret kick  i choose no victims he broke in nor will i see mans blood shedto me it is orundaunholy i may not look on human blood and if you cause me to do so asika i shall hate you because you make me break my oath  the asika reflected for a moment while jeekie behind muttered between his chattering teeth  good missionary talk that major keep up word in season major if she make christian martyr of jeekie who get you out of this confounded hole  then the asika spoke  be it as you will for i desire neither that you should hate me nor that you should look on that which is unlawful for your eyes to see the feasts and ceremonies you must attend but if i can help it no victim shall be slain in your presence not even that whimpering hound your servant she added with a contemptuous glance at jeekie who it seems fears to give his life for the glory of the god but who because he is yours is safe now and always  that very satisfactory said jeekie rising from his knees his face wreathed in smiles for he knew well that a decree of the asika could not be broken then he began to explain to the priestess that it was not fear of losing his own life that had moved him but the certainty that this occurrence would disagree morally with little bonsa whose entire confidence he possessed  taking no notice of his words with a slight reverence to the fetish she passed on beckoning to alan as he went by the two prostrate priests whose lives he had saved lifted their heads a little and looked at him with heartfelt gratitude in their eyes indeed one of them kissed the place where his foot had trodden jeekie following gave him a kick to intimate that he was taking a liberty but at the same time stooped down and asked the man his name it occurred to him that these rescued priests might some day be useful  alan followed her through a kind of swing door which opened into another of the endless halls but when he looked for her there she was nowhere to be seen a priest who was waiting beyond the door bowed and informed him that the asika had gone to her own place and would see him that evening then bowing again he led them back by various passages to the room where they had slept  jeekie said alan after their food had been brought to them this time he observed by men for it was now past midday you were born in asikiland tell me the truth of this business what does that woman mean when she talks about her spirit having been here from the beginning  she mean major that every time she die her soul go into someone else whom priests find out by marks also asika always die young they never let her become old woman but how she die and where they bury her no one know cept priests sometimes she have girl child who become asika after her but if they have boy child they kill him i think this asika daughter of her who make love to your reverend uncle all that story bout her mother not being married lies and all her story lies too she often marry  but how about the spirit coming back jeekie  spect that lie too major though she think it solemn fact priests teach her all those old things still he added doubtfully asika great medicinewoman and know a lot we dont know cant say how very awkward customer major  quite so jeekie i agree with you but to come to the point what is her game with me  oh major he answered with a grin that simple enough she tired of black man want change mean to marry you according to law that is when mungana dies and he die jolly quick now she mustnt kill him but polish him off all the same stick him to sleep with those dead uns till he go like drunk man and see things and drown himself then she marry you but till he dead you all right she only talk and make eyes cause of asiki law not cause she want to stop there  indeed jeekie and how long do you think that mungana will last  perhaps three months major and perhaps two think not more than two strong man but he look devilish dicky this morning think he begin see snakes  very well jeekie now listen to meyouve got to get us out of asikiland by this day two months if you dont that lady will do anything to oblige me and no doubt there are more executioners left  oh major dont talk like silly fool jeekie always hate fools and suffer them badlylike holy first missionary bishop you know very well this no place for ultrachristian man like jeekie who only come here to please you both in same bag major if i die you die and leave miss barbara up gum tree i get you out if i can but this stuff the trouble and he pointed to the bags of gold not want to leave all that behind after such arduous walk no no i try get you out meanwhile you play game  the game what game jeekie  what game why asikagame of course if she sigh you sigh if she look at you you look at her if she squeeze hand you squeeze hand if she kiss you kiss  i am hanged if i do jeekie  must major must or never get out of asikiland what all that matter he added confidentially miss barbara never know jeekie doesnt split also quite necessary in situation and you cant be married till that mungana dead all matter business major make time pass pleasant as well asika jolly enough if you stroke her fur right way but if you put her back upoh lor no trouble sit and smile and say oh ducky how beautiful you are that not hurt anybody  in spite of himself alan burst out laughing  but how about the mungana he asked  mungana he got take that with rest also i try make friends with that poor devil tell him it all my eye perhaps he believe menot sure if he me i no believe him mungana he added oracularly mungana take his chance what matter in two months time he nothing but gold figure no 2403 just like one mummy in museum now i try catch my ma i hear she alive somewhere they tell me she used keep lodging house for bonsa pilgrim but steal grub say it cat all that sort of thing and get run in as thief afraid my ma come down very much in world not society lady now shut up long way off in suburb still praps she useful so best send her message by pliceman say how much i love her say her dear little jeekie turn up again just to see her sweet face only dont know if she swallow that or if they let her out prison unless i pay for all she prig    chapter xiii  the feast of little bonsa  it was the night of full moon and of the great feast of the return of little bonsa alan sat in his chamber waiting to be summoned to take part in this ceremony and listening the while to that wow wow wow of the death drums whereof jeekie had once spoken in england which could be clearly heard even above the perpetual boom of the cataract tumbling down its cliff behind the town by now he had recovered from the fatigue of his journey and his health was good but the same could not be said of his spirits for never in his life had he felt more downhearted not even when he was sickening for blackwater fever or lay in bondage in the city expecting every morning to wake up and find his reputation blasted he was a prisoner in this dreadful gloomy place where he must live like a second man in the iron mask without recreation or exercise other than he could find in the walled garden where grew the black cedar trees and so far as he could see a prisoner without hope of escape  moreover he could no longer disguise from himself the truth jeekie was right the asika had fallen in love with him or at any rate made up her mind that he should be her next husband he hated the sight of the woman and her sinuous evil beauty but to be free of her was impossible and to offend her death all day long she kept him about her and from his sleep he would wake up and as on the night of his arrival distinguish her leaning over him studying his face by the light of the faintlyburning lamps as a snake studies the bird it is about to strike he dared not stir or give the slightest sign that he saw her nor indeed did he always see her for he kept his eyes closely shut but even in his heaviest slumber some warning sense told him of her presence and then above jeekies snores for on these occasions jeekie always snored his loudest he would hear a soft footfall as catlike she crept towards him or the sweep of her spangled robe or the tinkling of the scales of her golden breastplate for a long while she would stand there examining him greedily and even the few little belongings that remained to him and then with a hungry sigh glide away and vanish in the shadows how she came or how she vanished alan could not discover clearly she did not use the door and he could find no other entrance to the room indeed at times he thought he must be suffering from delusion but jeekie shook his great head and did not agree with him  she there right enough he said she walk over me as though i log and i smell stuff she put on hair but i think she come and go by magic asika do that if she please  then i wish she would teach me the secret jeekie i should soon be out of asikiland i can tell you  all that day alan had been in her company answering her endless questions about his past the lands that he had visited and especially the women that he had known he had the tact to tell her that none of these were half so beautiful as she was which was true in a sense and pleased her very much for in whatever respects she differed from them in common with the rest of her sex she loved a compliment emboldened by her good humour he had ventured to suggest that being rested and having restored little bonsa he would be glad to return with her gifts to his own country next instant he was sorry for as soon as she understood his meaning she grew almost white with rage  what she said you desire to leave me know vernoon that i will see you dead first and myself also for then we shall be born again together and can never more be separated  nor was this all for she burst into weeping threw her arms about him drew him to her kissed him on the forehead and then thrust him away saying  curses on the priests law that makes us wait so long and curses on that mungana who will not die and may not be killed well he shall pay for it and within two months vernoon oh within two months and she stretched out her arms with a gesture of infinite passion then turned and left him  my said jeekie afterwards for he had watched all this scene openmouthed my but she mean business mrs jeekie never kiss me like that nor any other female either she dead nuts on you major very great compliment spect when you mungana she keep you alive a long time four or five years perhaps if no other white man come this way pity you cant take it on a bit major he added insidiously because then she grow careless and make you chief and we get chance scoop out that gold house and bolt with bally lot miss barbara sensible woman when she see all that cash she not mind she say bravo old boy quite right spoil lady potiphar in land of bondage but jeekie must have ten per cent because he show you how do it  alan was so depressed and indeed terrified by this demonstration on the part of his fearful hostess that he could neither laugh at jeekie nor swear at him he only sat still and groaned feeling that bad as things were they were bound to become worse    above the perpetual booming of the death drums rose a sound of wild music the door burst open and through it came a number of priests their nearly naked bodies hideously painted and on their heads the most devilishlooking masks some of them clashed cymbals some blew horns and some beat little drums all to time which was given to them by a bandmaster with a golden rod in front of them with painted face and decked in his gorgeous apparel walked the mungana himself  they come to take us to bonsa worship explained jeekie cheer up major very exciting business no go to sleep there as in english church see the god all time and no sermon  alan who wore a linen robe over the remains of his european garments and whose mask was already on his head rose listlessly and bowed to the gorgeous mungana who poor man answered him with a stare of hate knowing that this wanderer was destined to fill his place then they started jeekie accompanying them and walked a long way through various halls and passages bearing first to the left and then to the right again till suddenly through some side door they emerged upon a marvellous scene the first impressions that reached alans mind were those of a long stretch of water very black and still and not more than eighty feet in width on the hither edge of this canal seated upon a raised dais in the midst of a great open space of polished rock was the asika or so he gathered from her gold breastplate and sparkling garments for her fierce and beautiful features were hid beneath an object familiar enough to him the yellow crystaleyed mask of little bonsa arranged in companies about and behind her were hundreds of people male and female clad in hideous costumes to resemble demons with masks to match some of these masks were semihuman and some of them bore a likeness to the heads of animals and had horns on them while their wearers were adorned with skins and tails to describe them in their infinite variety would be impossible indeed the recollection that alan carried away was one of a mediÃ¦val hell as it is occasionally to be found portrayed upon doom pictures in old churches  on the further side of the water the entire asiki people seemed to be gathered at least there were thousands of them seated upon a rising rocky slope as in an amphitheatre clad only in the ordinary costume of the western african native and in some instances in linen cloaks this great amphitheatre was surrounded by a high wall with gates but in the moonlight he found it difficult to discern its exact limits  jeekie nudged alan and pointed to the centre of the canal or pool he looked and saw floating there a huge and hideous golden head twenty times as large as life perhaps with great prominent eyes that glared up to the sky its appearance was quite unlike anything else in the world more loathsome more horrible man fish and animal all seemed to have their part in it human mouth and teeth fishlike eyes and snout bestial expression  big bonsa whispered jeekie just the same as when i sweet little boyhe live here for thousand of years  preceded by the mungana and followed by jeekie and the priests the band bringing up the rear alan was marched down a lane left open for him till he came to some steps leading to the dais upon which in addition to that occupied by the asika stood two empty chairs these steps the mungana motioned him to mount but when jeekie tried to follow him he turned and struck him contemptuously in the face at once the asika who was watching vernons approach through the eyeholes in the little bonsa mask said fiercely  who bade you strike the servant of my guest o mungana let him come also that he may stand behind us and interpret  her wretched husband who knew that this public slight was put upon him purposely but did not dare to protest against it bowed his head then all three of them climbed to the dais the priests and the musicians remaining below  welcome vernoon said the asika through the lips of the mask which to alan notwithstanding the dreadful cruelty of its expression looked less hateful than the lovely tigerish face it hid welcome and be seated here on my left hand since on my right you may not sitas yet  he bowed and took the chair to which she pointed while her husband placed himself in the other chair upon her right and jeekie stood behind his great shape towering above them all  this is a festival of my people vernoon she went on such a festival as has not been seen for years celebrated because little bonsa has come back to them  what is to happen he asked uneasily i have told you lady that blood is orunda to me i must not witness it  i know be not afraid she answered sacrifice there must be since it is the custom and we may not defraud the gods but you shall not see the deed judge from this vernoon how greatly i desire to please you  now alan looking about him saw that immediately beneath the dais and between them and the edge of the water were gathered his cannibal friends the ogula and fahni their chief who had rowed him to asikiland and with them the messengers whom they had sent on ahead also he saw that their arms were tied behind them and that they were guarded by men dressed like devils and armed with spears  ask fahni why he and his people are bound jeekie said alan and why have they not returned to their own country  jeekie obeyed putting the question in the ogula language whereon the poor men turned and began to implore alan to save their lives fahni adding that he had been told they were to be killed that night  why are these men to be slain asked alan of the asika  because i have learned that they attacked you in their own country vernoon she answered and would have killed you had it not been for little bonsa it is therefore right that they should die as an offering to you  i refuse the offering since afterwards they dealt well with me set them free and let them return to their own land asika  that cannot be she replied coldly here they are and here they remain still their lives are yours to take or to spare so keep them as your servants if you will and bending down she issued a command which was instantly obeyed for the men dressed like devils cut the bonds of the ogula and brought them round to the back of the dais where they stood blessing alan loudly in their own tongue  then the ceremonies began with a kind of infernal ballet on the smooth space between them and the waters edge appeared male and female bands of dancers who emerged from the shadows for the most part they were dressed up like animals and imitated the cries of the beasts that they represented although some of them wore little or no clothing to the sound of wild music of horns and drums these creatures danced a kind of insane quadrille which seemed to suggest everything that is cruel and vile upon the earth they danced and danced in the moonlight till the madness spread from them to the thousands who were gathered upon the farther side of the water for presently all of these began to dance also nor did it stop there since at length the asika rose from her chair upon the dais and joined in the performance with the mungana her husband even jeekie began to prance and shout behind so that at last alan and the ogula alone remained still and silent in the midst of a scene and a noise which might have been that of hell let loose  leaving go of her husband the asika bounded up to alan and tried to drag him from his chair thrusting her gold mask against his mask he refused to move and after a while she left him and returned to mungana louder and louder brayed the music and beat the drums wilder and wilder grew the shrieks individuals fell exhausted and were thrown into the water where they sank or floated away on the slow moving stream as part of some inexplicable play that was being enacted  then suddenly the asika stood still and threw up her arms and they fell upon their faces and lay as though they were dead a third time she threw up her arms and they rose and remained so silent that the only sound to be heard was that of their thick breathing then she spoke or rather screamed saying  little bonsa has come back again bringing with her the white man whom she led away and all the audience answered little bonsa has come back again once more we see her on the head of the asika as our fathers did give her a sacrifice give her the white man  nay she screamed back the white man is mine i name him as the next mungana  oho roared the audience oho she names him as the next mungana goodbye old mungana greeting new mungana when will be the marriage feast  tell us mungana tell us cried the asika patting her wretched husband on the cheek tell us when you mean to die as you are bound to do  on the night of the second full moon from now he answered with a terrible groan that seemed to be wrung out of his heavy heart on that night my soul will be eaten up and my day done but till then i am lord of the asika and if she forgets it death shall be her portion according to the ancient law  yes yes shouted the multitude death shall be her portion and her lover we will sacrifice die in honour mungana as all those died that went before you  thank heaven muttered alan to himself i am safe from that witch for the next two months and through the eyeholes of his mask he contemplated her with loathing and alarm  at the moment indeed she was not a pleasing spectacle for in the heat and excitement of her mad dance she had cast off her gold breastplate or stomacher leaving herself naked except for her kirtle and the thin goldspangled robe upon her shoulders over which streamed her black disordered hair contrasting strangely in the silver moonlight with her glistening coppercoloured body the mask of little bonsa on her head glared round with its fixed crystal eyes and fiendish smile as she turned her long neck from side to side seen thus she scarcely looked human and alans heart was filled with pity for the poor bedizened wretch she named her husband who had just been forced to announce the date of his own suicide  soon however he forgot it for a new act in the drama had begun two priests clad in horns and tails leapt on to the dais and at a signal unlaced the mask of little bonsa now the asika lifted it from her streaming face and held it on high then she lowered it to the level of her breast and holding it in both hands walked to the edge of the dais whereon priests disguised as fiends began to leap at it striving to reach it with their fingers and snatch it from her grasp one by one they leapt with the most desperate energy each man being allowed to make three attempts and alan noted that this novel jumping competition was watched with the deepest interest by all the audience at the time he knew not why  the first two were evidently elderly men who failed to come anywhere near the mark their failure was received with shouts of derision they sank exhausted to the ground and from the motion of his body alan could see that one of them was weeping while the other remained sullenly silent then a younger man advanced and at the third try almost grasped the fetish indeed he would have grasped it had he not met with foul play for the asika seeing that he was about to succeed lifted it an inch or two so that he also missed and with a groan joined the band of the defeated next appeared a fourth priest even more horribly arrayed than those before him but alan noticed that his mask was of the lightest and that his garments consisted chiefly of paint the main idea of his makeup being that of a skeleton he was a thin active fellow and all the watching thousands greeted him with a shout for a few seconds he stood back gazing at the mask as a wolf might at an unapproachable bone then suddenly he ran forward and sprang into the air such an amazing jump alan had never seen before so high was it indeed that his head came level with that of the fetish which he snatched with both hands tearing it from asikas grasp coming to the ground again with a thud he began to caper to and fro kissing the mask while the audience shouted  little bonsa has chosen what fate for the fallen ask her priest  the man stopped his capering and held the mouth of little bonsa to his ear nodding from time to time as though she were speaking to him and he heard what she said then he passed round the dais where alan could not see him and presently reappeared holding little bonsa in his right hand and in his left a great gold cup a silence fell upon the place he advanced to the first man who had jumped and offered him the cup he turned his head away but a thousand voices thundered drink then he took it and drank passing it to a companion in misfortune who in turn drank also and gave it to the third priest he who would have snatched the mask had not the asika lifted it out of his reach  this man drained it to the dregs and with an exclamation of rage dashed the empty vessel into the face of the chosen priest with such fury that the man rolled upon the ground and for a while lay there stunned now he who had drunk first began to spring about in a ludicrous fashion and presently was joined in his dance by the other two so absurd were their motions and tumblings and clownlike grimaces for they had dragged off their masks that roars of brutal laughter rose from the audience in which the asika joined  at first alan thought that the thing was a joke and that the men had merely been made mad drunk till catching sight of their eyes in the moonlight he perceived that they were in great pain and turned indignantly to remonstrate with the asika  be silent vernoon she said savagely blood is your orunda and i respect it therefore by decree of the god these die of poison and again she fell to laughing at the contortions of the victims  alan shut his eyes and when at length drawn by some fearful fascination he opened them once more it was to see that the three poor creatures had thrown themselves into the water where they rolled over and over like wounded porpoises till presently they sank and vanished there  this farce for so they considered it being ended and the stage so to speak cleared the audience having laughed itself hoarse set itself to watch the proceedings of the newly chosen highpriest of little bonsa who by now had recovered from the blow dealt to him by one of the murdered men with the help of some other priests he was engaged in binding the fetish on to a little raft of reeds this done he laid himself flat upon a broad plank which had been made ready for him at the edge of the water placing the mask in front of him and with a few strokes of his feet that hung over the sides of the plank paddled himself out to the centre of the canal where the god called big bonsa floated or was anchored having reached it he pushed the little raft off the plank into the water and in some way that alan could not see made it fast to big bonsa so that now the two of them floated one behind the other then while the people cheered shouting out that husband and wife had come together again at last he paddled his plank back to the waters edge sat down and waited  meanwhile at a sign from the asika all the scores of priests and priestesses who were dressed as devils had filed off to right and left and vanished presumably to cross the water by bridges or boats that were out of sight at any rate now they began to appear upon its further side and to wind their way singly among the thousands of the asiki people who were gathered upon the rocky slope beyond in order to witness this fearsome entertainment alan observed that the spectators did not appear to appreciate the arrival amongst them of these priests from whom they seemed to edge away indeed many of them rose and tried to depart altogether only to be driven back to their places by a double line of soldiers armed with spears who now for the first time became visible ringing in the audience also other soldiers and with them bodies of men who looked like executioners showed themselves upon the further brink of the water and then marched off disappearing to left and right  whats the matter now alan asked of jeekie over his shoulder  all in blue funk whispered jeekie back joke done get to business now silly fools forget that when they laugh so much both bonsas very hungry and asika want wipe out old scores presently you see  presently alan did see for at some preconcerted signal the devil priests each of them jumped with a yell at a person near to them gripping him or her by the hair whereon assistants rushed in and dragged them down to the bank of the canal here to the number of a hundred or more a wailing struggling mass they were confined in a pen like sheep then a bar was lifted and one of them allowed to escape only to find himself in a kind of gangway which ran down into shallow water being forced along this he came to an open space of water exactly opposite to the floating fetishes and there was kept a while by men armed with spears as nothing happened they lifted their spears and the man bolted up an incline and was lost among the thousands of spectators  the next one evidently a person of rank was not so fortunate jumping into the pool off the gangway he stood there like a sheep about to be washed the water reaching up to his middle then alan saw a terrifying thing for suddenly the horrid golden head of big bonsa towing little bonsa behind it began to swim with a deliberate motion across the stream until reaching the man it seemed to rear itself up and poke him with its snout in the chest as a turtle might do then it sank again into the water and slowly floated back to its station directed by some agency or power that alan could not discover  at the touch of the fetish the man screamed like a horse in pain or terror and soldiers leaping on him with a savage shout dragged him up another gangway opposite to that by which he had descended whereon to all appearances more dead than alive he departed into the shadows the horns and drums set up a bray of triumph the asika clapped her hands approvingly the spectators cheered and another victim was bundled down the gangway and submitted to the judgment of the bonsas which came at him like a hungry pike at a frog then followed more and more some being chosen and some let go till at last growing weary the priests directed the soldiers to drive the prisoners down in batches until the pen in the water was full as though with huddled sheep if the horrible golden masks swam at them and touched one of their number they were all dragged away if these remained quiescent they were let go  so the thing went on until at length alan could bear no more of it  lady he said to the asika when she paused for a moment from her handclapping i am weary i would sleep  what she exclaimed do you wish to sleep on such a glorious night when so many evil doers are coming to their just doom well well go if you will for then my promise is off me and i can hasten this business and deal with the wicked before the people according to our custom goodnight to you vernoon tomorrow we will meet and she called to some priests to lead him away and with him the ogula cannibals whom she had given to him as servants  alan went thankfully enough as he plunged into one of the passages the sound of frightful yelling reached his ears followed by loud triumphant shouts  now you gone they kill those who bonsa smell out said jeekie why you no wait and see very interesting sight  hold your tongue answered alan savagely did you think so years ago when you were put into that pen to be butchered  no major replied the unabashed jeekie not think at all then too far gone but see other people in there and know it not you quite different matter  they reached their room at the door of it fahni and his followers were led off to some quarters near by blessing alan as they went because he had saved their lives  jeekie he said when they were alone tell me what makes that hellish idol swim about in the water picking out some people and leaving others alone  major i not know no one know except top priest and asika perhaps there man underneath perhaps they pull string or perhaps fetish alive and he do what he like please dont call him names major or he remember and come after us one time and that bad job and jeekie shivered visibly  bosh answered alan but all the same he shivered also jeekie he asked again what happens to those people whom the bonsas smell out  case of goodbye major sometimes they chop off nut sometimes they spiflicate in gold tub sometimes priestman make hole in what white doctor call diagramand shake hands with heartall matter of taste major just as asika please if she like victim or they old friends chop off head if she not like himdo worse things  more than satisfied with his information alan went to bed for hour after hour that night he lay tossing and turning haunted by the recollections of the dreadful sights that he had seen and of the horrible asika horrible and halfnaked glaring at him amorously through the crystal eyes of little bonsa when at last he fell asleep it was to dream that he was alone in the water with the god which pursued him as a shark pursues a shipwrecked sailor never did he experience a nightmare that was half so awful only one thing could be more awful the reality itself    chapter xiv  the mother of jeekie  jeekie said alan next morning i tell you again that i have had enough of this place i want to get out  yes major that just what mouse say when he finish cheese in trap but missus come along call him pretty pretty and drown him all the same and he nodded in the direction of the asikas house  jeekie it has got to be donedo you hear me i had rather die trying to get away than stop here till the next two months are up if i am here on the night of the next full moon but one i shall shoot that asika and then shoot myself and you must take your chance do you understand  understand that foolish game and poor lookout for jeekie major but cant think of any plan then he rubbed his big nose reflectively and added fahni and his people your slaves now spose we have talk with him i tell priests to bring him along when they come with breakfast leave it to me major  alan did leave it to him with the result that after long argument the priests consented or obtained permission to produce fahni and his followers and a little while after the great men arrived looking very dejected and saluted alan humbly bidding the rest of them be seated he called fahni to the end of the room and asked him through jeekie if he and his men did not wish to return home  indeed we do white lord answered the old chief but how can we the asika has a grudge against our tribe and but for you would have killed every one of us last night we are snared and must stop here till we die  would not your people help you if they knew fahni  yes lord i think so but how can i tell them who doubtless believe us dead nor can i send a messenger for this place is guarded and he would be killed at once we came here for your sake because you had little bonsa a god that is known in the east and the west in the north and the south and because you saved me from the lion and here alas we must perish  jeekie said alan can you not find a messenger have you who were born of this people no friend among them at all  jeekie shook his white head and rolled his eyes then suddenly an idea struck him  yes he said i think one praps i mean my ma  your ma said alan oh i remember have you heard anything more about her  yes major very old girl now but strong on leg so they say believe she glad go anywhere because she public nuisance they tired of her in prison and there no workhouse here so they want turn her out starve which of course break my heart perhaps she take message some use that way only think she afraid go ogulaland because they nasty cannibal and eat old woman  when all this was translated to fahni he assured jeekie with earnestness that nothing would induce the ogula people to eat his mother moreover that for her sake they would never look carnivorously on another old woman fat or thin  well said jeekie i try again to get hold of old lady and we see i pray priests whom you save other day let her out of chokey as i sick to fall upon bosom which quite true only so much to think of that no time to attend to domestic relation till now  that very afternoon on returning to his room from walking in the dismal cedar garden alans ears were greeted by a sound of shrill quarrelling looking up he saw an extraordinary sight a tall gaunt withered female who might have been of any age between sixty and a hundred had got jeekies ear in one hand and with the other was slapping him in the face while she exclaimed  o thief whom by the curse of bonsa i brought into the world what have you done with my blanket was it not enough that you my only son should leave me to earn my own living must you also take my best blanket with you for which reason i have been cold ever since where is it thief where is it  worn out my mother worn out he answered trying to free himself you forget honourable mother that i grow old and you should have been dead years ago how can you expect a blanket to last so long leave go of my ear beloved mother and i will give you another i have travelled across the world to find you and i want to hear news of your husband  my husband thief which husband do you mean your father the one with the broken nose who was sacrificed because you ran away with the white man whom bonsa loved well you look out for him when you get into the world of ghosts for he said that he was going to wait for you there with the biggest stick that he could find why i havent thought of him for years but then i have had three other husbands since his time bad enough but better than he was so who would and now bonsa has got the lot and i have no children alive and they say i am to be driven out of the prison to starve next week as they wont feed me any longer i who can still work against any one of them andyouve got my blanket you ugly old rascal and collapsing beneath the weight of her recited woes the hag burst into a melancholy howl  peace my mother said jeekie patting her on the head do what i tell you and you shall have more blankets than you can wear and as you are still so handsome another husband too if you like and a garden and slaves to work for you and plenty to eat  how shall i get all these things my son asked the old woman looking up will you take me to your home and support me or will that white lord marry me they told me that the asika had named him as the mungana and she is very jealous the most jealous asika that i have ever known  no mother he would like to but he dare not and i cannot support you as i should wish as here i have no house or property you will get all this by taking a walk and holding your tongue you see this man here he is fahni king of a great tribe the ogula he wants you to carry a message for him and by and by he will marry you wont you fahni  oh yes yes said fahni i will do anything she likes no one shall be so rich and honoured in my country and for her sake we will never eat another old woman whereas if she stays here she will be driven to the mountains to starve in a week  set out the matter said the mother of jeekie who was by no means so foolish as she seemed  so they told her what she must do namely travel down to the ogula and tell them of the plight of their chief bidding them muster all their fighting men and when the swamps were dry enough advance as near as they dared to the asiki country and if they could not attack it wait till they had further news  the end of it was that the mother of jeekie who knew her case to be desperate at home where she was in no good repute promised to attempt the journey in consideration of advantages to be received since she was to be turned adrift to meet her fate with as much food as she could carry this she could do without exciting any suspicion for who would trouble about the movements of a useless old thief meanwhile jeekie gave her one of the robes which the asika had provided for alan also various articles which she desired and having learned fahnis message by heart and announced that she considered herself his affianced bride the gaunt old creature departed happy enough after exchanging embraces with her long lost son  she will tell somebody all about it and we shall only get our throats cut said alan wearily for the whole thing seemed to him a foolish farce  no no major i make her swear not split on ghosts of all her husbands and by big bonsa hisself she sit tight as wax because she think they haunt her if she dont and i too by and by when i dead praps she get to ogula country and praps not if she dont cant help it and no harm done break my heart but only one old woman less anyhow she hold tongue that main point and i really very glad find my ma who never hoped to see again heaven very kind to jeekie give him back to family bosom he added unctuously  that day there were no excitements and to alans intense relief he saw nothing of the asika after its orgy of witchcraft and bloodshed on the previous night weariness and silence seemed to have fallen upon the town at any rate no sound came from it that could be heard above the low constant thunder of the great waterfall rushing down its precipice and in the cedarshadowed garden where alan walked till he was weary attended by jeekie and the ogula savages not a soul was to be seen  on the following morning when he was sitting moodily in his room two priests came to conduct him to the asika having no choice followed by jeekie he accompanied them to her house masked as usual for without this hateful disguise he was not allowed to stir he found her lying upon a pile of cushions in a small room that he had never seen before which was better lighted than most in that melancholy abode and seemed to serve as her private chamber in front of her lay the skin of the lion that he had sent as a present and about her throat hung a necklace made of its claws heavily set in gold with which she was playing idly  at the opening of the door she looked up with a swift smile that turned to a frown when she saw that he was followed by jeekie  say vernoon she asked in her languorous voice can you not stir a yard without that ugly black dog at your heels do you bring him to protect your back if so what is the need have i not sworn that you are safe in my land  alan made jeekie interpret this speech then answered that the reason was that he knew but little of her tongue  can i not teach it to you alone then without this low fellow hearing all my words well it will not be for long and she looked at jeekie in a way that made him feel very uncomfortable get behind us dog and you vernoon come sit on these cushions at my side nay not there i said upon the cushionsso now i will take off that ugly mask of yours for i would look into your eyes i find them pleasant vernoon and without waiting for his permission she sat up and did so ah she went on we shall be happy when we are married shall we not do not be afraid vernoon i will not eat out your heart as i have those of the men that went before you we will live together until we are old and die together at last and together be born again and so on and on till the end which even i cannot foresee why do you not smile vernoon and say that you are pleased and that you will be happy with me who loved you from the moment that my eyes fell upon you in sleep speak vernoon lest i should grow angry with you  i dont know what to say answered alan despairingly through jeekie the honour is too great for me who am but a wandering trader who came here to barter little bonsa against the gold i needto support my wife and family he was about to add then remembering that this statement might not be well received substituted to support my old parents and eight brothers and sisters who are dependent upon me and remain hungry until i return to them  then i think they will remain hungry a long time vernoon for while i live you shall never return much as i love you i would kill you first and her eyes glittered as she said the words still she added noting the fall in his face if it is gold that they need you shall send it them yes my people shall take all that i gave you down to the coast and there it can be put in a big canoe and carried across the water see to the packing of the stuff you black dog she said to jeekie over her shoulder and when it is ready i will send it hence  alan began to thank her though he thought it more than probable that even if she kept her word this bullion would never get to old calabar and much less to england but she waived the matter aside as one in which she was not interested  tell me she asked would you have me other than i am first do you think me beautiful  yes answered alan honestly very beautiful when you are quiet as now not when you are dancing as you did the other night without your robes  when she understood what he meant the asika actually blushed a little  i am sorry she answered in a voice that for her was quite humble i forget that it might seem strange in your eyes it has always been the custom for the asika to do as i did at feasts and sacrifices but perhaps that is not the fashion among your women perhaps they always remain veiled as i have heard the worshippers of the prophet do and therefore you thought me immodest i am very very sorry vernoon i pray you to forgive me who am ignorant and only do what i have been taught  yes they always remain veiled stammered alan though he was not referring to their faces and as the words passed his lips he wondered what the asika would think if she could see a ballet at a london musichall  is there anything else wrong she went on gently if so tell me that i may set it right  i do not like cruelty or sacrifices o asika i have told you that bloodshed is orunda to me and at the feast those men were poisoned and you mocked them in their pain also many others were taken away to be killed for no crime  she opened her beautiful eyes and stared at him answering  but vernoon all this is not my fault they were sacrifices to the gods and if i did not sacrifice i should be sacrificed by the priests and wizards who live to sacrifice yes myself i should be made to drink the poison and be mocked at while i died like a snake with a broken back or even if i escaped the vengeance of the people the gods themselves would kill me and raise up another in my place do they not sacrifice in your country vernoon  no asika they fight if necessary and kill those who commit murder but they have no fetish that asks for blood and the law they have from heaven is a law of mercy  she stared at him again  all this is strange to me she said i was taught otherwise gods are devils and must be appeased lest they bring misfortune on us men must be ruled by terror or they would rebel and pull down the great house doctors must learn magic or how could they avert spells wizards must be killed or the people would perish in their net may not we who live in a hell strive to beat back its flame with the wisdom our forefathers have handed on to us tell me vernoon for i would know  you make your own hell answered alan when with the help of jeekie he understood her talk  she pondered over his words for a while then said  i must think the thing is big i wander in blackness i will speak with you again say now what else is wrong with me  now alan thought that he saw opportunity for a word in season and made a great mistake  i think that you treat your husband that man whom you call mungana very badly why should you drive him to his death  at these words the asika leapt up in a rage and seeking something to vent her temper on violently boxed jeekies ears and kicked him with her sandalled foot  the mungana she exclaimed that beast what have i to do with him i hate him as i hated the others the priests thrust him on me he has had his day let him go in your country do they make women live with men whom they loathe i love you bonsa himself knows why perhaps because you have a white skin and white thoughts but i hate that man what is the use of being asika if i cannot take what i love and reject what i hate go away vernoon go away you have angered me and if it were not for what you have said about that new law of mercy i think that i would cut your throat and again she boxed jeekies ears and kicked him in the shins  alan rose and bowed himself towards the door while she stood with her back towards him sobbing as he was about to pass it she wheeled round wiping the tears from her eyes with her hand and said  i forgot i sent for you to thank you for your presents that and she pointed to the lion skin which they tell me you killed with some kind of thunder to save the life of that old cannibal and this and she pulled off the necklace of claws then added as i am too bad to wear it you had better take it back again and she threw it with all her strength straight into jeekies face  fearing worse things the much maltreated jeekie uttered a howl and bolted through the door while alan picking up the necklace returned it to her with a bow she took it  stop she said you are leaving the room without your mask and my women are outside come here and she tied the thing upon his head setting it all awry then pushed him from the place  very poor joke major very poor indeed said jeekie when they had reached their own apartment lady make love to you you play prig and lecture lady about holy customs of her country and she box my ear till head sing also kick me all over and throw sharp claws in face please you do it no more the next time who knows she stick knife in my gizzard then kiss you afterward and say she so sorry and hope she no hurt you but how that help poor departed jeekie who get all kicks while you have hapence  oh be quiet said alan you are welcome to the halfpence if you would only leave me the kicks the question is how am i to get out of this mess while she was a beautiful savage devil one could deal with the thing but if she is going to become human it is another matter  jeekie looked at him with pity in his eyes  always thought white man mad at bottom he said shaking his big head to benighted black nigger thing so very simple all you got to do make love and cut when you get chance then she pleased as punch everything go smooth and jeekie get no more kicks christian religion business very good but wont wash in asikiland your reverend uncle find out that  not wishing to pursue the argument alan changed the subject by asking his indignant retainer if he thought that the asika had meant what she said when she offered to send the gold down to the coast  why not major that good lady always mean what she say and what she do too and he dabbed wrathfully at the scratches made by the lions claws on his face then added she know her own mind not like shillyshally seesaw white woman who get up one thing and go to bed another if she love she love if she hate she hate if she say she send gold she send it though pity to part with all that cash because spect someone bag it  alan reflected a while  dont you see jeekie that here is a chance if a very small one of getting a message to the coast also it is quite clear that if we are ever able to escape it will be impossible for us to carry this heavy stuff whereas if we send it on ahead perhaps some of it might get through we will pack it up jeekie at any rate it will be something to do go now and send a message to the asika and ask her to let us have some carpenters and a lot of wellseasoned wood  the message was sent and an hour later a dozen of the native craftsmen arrived with their rude tools and a supply of planks cut from a kind of ironwood or ebony tree they prostrated themselves to alan then the master of them rising instantly began to measure jeekie with a marked reed that worthy sprang back and asked what in the name of bonsa big and little they were doing whereon the man explained with humility that the asika had said that she thought the white lord wanted the wood to make a box to bury his servant in as he the said servant had offended her that morning and doubtless the white lord wished to kill him on that account or perhaps to put him away under ground alive  oh my golly said jeekie shaking till his great knees knocked together oh my golly here pretty go she think you want bury me all alive that mean she want to be rid of jeekie because he got sit there and play gooseberry when she wish talk alone with you oh yes i see her little game  well jeekie said alan bursting into such a roar of laughter that he nearly shook off his mask you had better be careful for you just told me that the asika is not like a seesaw white woman and never changes her mind say to this man that he must tell the asika there is a mistake and that however much i should like to oblige her i cant bury you because it has been prophesied to me that on the day you are buried i shall be buried also and that therefore you must be kept alive  capital notion that major said jeekie much relieved she not want bury you just at present next year perhaps but not now i tell him and he did with much vigour  this slight misconception having been disposed of they explained to the carpenters what was wanted first all the gold was emptied out of the sacks in which it remained as the priests had brought it and divided into heaps each of which weighed about forty pounds a weight that with its box alan considered would be a good load for a porter of these heaps there proved to be fiftythree their total value alan reckoned amounting to about Â£100000 sterling then the carpenters were set to work to make a model box which they did quickly enough and with great ingenuity cutting the wood with their native saws dovetailing it as a civilized craftsman would do and finally securing it everywhere with ebony pegs driven into holes which they bored with a hot iron the result was a box that would stand any amount of rough usage and when finally pegged down one that could only be opened with a hammer and a cold chisel  this boxmaking went on for two whole days as each of them was filled and pegged down the gold within being packed in sawdust to keep it from rattling alan amused himself in adding an address with a feather brush and a supply of red paint such as the asiki priests used to decorate their bodies at first he was puzzled to know what address to put but finally decided upon the following  major a vernon care of miss champers the court near kingswell england adding in the corner from a v asiki land africa  it was all childish enough he knew yet when it was done he regarded his handiwork with a sort of satisfaction for reflected alan if but one of those boxes should chance to get through to england it would tell barbara a great deal and if it were addressed to himself her uncle could scarcely dare to take possession of it  then he bethought him of sending a letter but was obliged to abandon the idea as he had neither pen pencil ink nor paper left to him whatever arts remained to them that of any form of writing was now totally unknown to the asiki although marks that might be writing it will be remembered did appear on the inner side of the little bonsa mask an evidence of its great antiquity even in the days when they had wrapped up the egyptian the roman and other early munganas in sheets of gold and set them in their treasurehouse apparently they had no knowledge of it for not even an hieroglyph or a rune appeared upon the imperishable metal shrouds since that time they had evidently decreased not advanced in learning till at the present day except for these relics and some dim and meaningless survival of rites that once had been religious and were still offered to the same ancient idols there was little to distinguish them from other tribes of central african savages still alan did something for obtaining a piece of white wood which he smoothed as well as he was able with a knife he painted on it this message  messrs aston old calabar please forward accompanying fiftythree packages or as many as arrive and cable as follows all costs will be remitted miss champers kingswell england prisoner among asiki no present prospect of escape but hope for best jeekie and i well allowed send this but perhaps no future message possible goodbye alan  as it happened just as alan was finishing this scrawl with a sad heart he heard a movement and glancing up perceived standing at his side the asika of whom he had seen nothing since the interview when she had beaten jeekie  what are those marks that you make upon the board vernoon she asked suspiciously  with the assistance of jeekie who kept at a respectful distance he informed her that they were a message in writing to tell the white men at the coast to forward the gold to his starving family  oh she said i never heard of writing you shall teach it me it will serve to pass the time till we are married though it will not be of much use afterwards as we shall never be separated any more and words are better than marks upon a board but she added cheerfully i can send away this black dog of yours and she looked at jeekie and he can write to us no i cannot for an accident might happen to him and they tell me you say that if he dies you die also so he must stop here always what have you in those little boxes  the gold you gave me asika packed in loads  a small gift enough she answered contemptuously would you not like more since you value that stuff well another time you shall send all you want meanwhile the porters are waiting fifty men and three as you sent me word and ten spare ones to take the place of any who die but how they will find their way i know not since none of them have ever been to the coast  an idea occurred to alan who had small faith in jeekies ma as a messenger  the ogula prisoners could show them he said at any rate as far as the forest and after that they could find out may they not go asika  if you will she answered carelessly let them be ready to start tomorrow at the dawn all except their chief fahni who must stop here as a hostage i do not trust those ogula who more than once have threatened to make war upon us she added then turned and bade the priests bring in the bearers to receive their instructions  presently they came picked men all of them under the command of an asiki captain and with them the ogula whom she summoned also  go where the white lord sends you she said in an indifferent voice carrying with you these packages i do not know where it is but these maneaters will show you some of the way and if you fail in the business but live to come back again you shall be sacrificed to bonsa at the next feast if you run away then your wives and children will be sacrificed food shall be given you for your journey and gold to buy more when it is gone now vernoon tell them what they have to do  so alan or rather jeekie told them and these directions were so long and minute that before they were finished the asika grew tired of listening and went away saying as she passed the captain of the company  remember my words man succeed or die but of your land and its secrets say nothing  i hear answered the captain prostrating himself  that night alan summoned the ogula and spoke to them through jeekie in their own language at first they declared that they would not leave their chief preferring to stay and die with him  not so said fahni go my children that i may live go and gather the tribe all the thousands of them who are men and can fight and bring them up to attack asikiland to rescue me if i still live or to avenge me if i am dead as for these bearers do them no harm but send them on to the coast with the white mans goods  so in the end the ogula said that they would go and when alan woke up on the following morning he was informed that they and the asiki porters had already departed upon their journey then he dismissed the matter from his mind for to tell the truth he never expected to hear of them any more    chapter xv  alan falls ill  after the departure of the messengers a deep melancholy fell upon alan who was sure that he had now no further hope of communicating with the outside world bitterly did he reproach himself for his folly in having ever journeyed to this hateful place in order to securewhat about Â£100000 worth of gold which of course he never could secure as it would certainly vanish or be stolen on its way to the coast for this gold he had become involved in a dreadful complication which must cost him much misery and sooner or later life itself since he could not marry that beautiful savage asika and if he refused her she would certainly kill him in her outraged pride and fury  day by day she sent for him and when he came assumed a new character that of a woman humbled by a sense of her own ignorance which she was anxious to amend so he must play the role of tutor to her telling her of civilized peoples their laws customs and religions and instructing her how to write and read she listened and learned submissively enough but all the while alan felt as one might who is called upon to teach tricks to a drugged panther the drug in this case was her passion for him which appeared to be very genuine but when it passed off or when he was obliged to refuse her what he wondered would happen then  anxiety and confinement told on him far more than all the hardships of his journey his health ran down he began to fall ill then as bad luck would have it walking in that damp unwholesome cedar garden out of which he might not stray he contracted the germ of some kind of fever which in autumn was very common in this poisonous climate three days later he became delirious and for a week after that hung between life and death well was it for him that his medicinechest still remained intact and that recognizing his own symptoms before his head gave way he was able to instruct jeekie what drugs to give him at the different stages of the disease  for the rest his memories of that dreadful illness always remained very vague he had visions of jeekie and of a robed woman whom he knew to be the asika bending over him continually also it seemed to him that from time to time he was talking with barbara which even then he knew must be absurd for how could they talk across thousands of miles of land and sea  at length his mind cleared suddenly and he awoke as from a nightmare to find himself lying in the hall or room where he had always been feeling quite cool and without pain but so weak that it was an effort to him to lift his hand he stared about him and was astonished to see the white head of jeekie rolling uneasily to and fro upon the cushions of another bed near by  jeekie he said are you ill too jeekie  at the sound of that voice his retainer started up violently  what major you awake he said thanks be to all gods white and black yes and yellow too for i thought your goose cooked no no major i not ill only asika say so you go to bed so she make me go to bed you get worse she treat me cruel you seem better she stuff me with food till i burst all because you tell her that you and i die same day oh lord poor jeekie think his end very near just now for he know quite well that she not let him breathe ten minutes after you peg out jeekie never pray so hard for anyone before as he pray this week for you and by jingo i think he do the trick he and that medicine stuff which make him feel very bad in stomach and he groaned under the weight of his many miseries  weak as he was alan began to laugh and that laugh seemed to do him more good than anything that he could remember for after it he was sure that he would recover  just then an agonized whisper reached him from jeekie  look out it said here come asika go sleep and seem better major please or i catch it hot  so alan almost shut his eyes and lay still in another moment she was standing over him and he noticed that her hair was dishevelled and her eyes were red as though with weeping she scanned him intently for a little while then passed round to where jeekie lay and appeared to pinch his ear so hard that he wriggled and uttered a stifled groan  how is your lord dog she whispered  better o asika i think that last medicine do us good though it make me very sick inside just now he spoke to me and said that he hoped that your heart was not sad because of him and that all this time in his dreams he had seen and thought of nobody but you o asika  did he asked that lady becoming intensely interested then tell me dog why is he ever calling upon one barbara surely that is a womans name  yes o asika that is the name of his mother also of one of his sisters whom after you he loves best of anyone in the whole world when you are here he talks of them but when you are not here he talks of no one but you although he is so sick he remembers white mans custom which tells him that it is very wrong to say sweet things to ladys face till he is quite married to her after that they say them always  she looked at him suspiciously and muttering here it is otherwise for your own sake man i trust that you do not lie left him and drawing a stool up beside alans bed sat herself down and examined him carefully touching his face and hands with her long thin fingers then noting how white and wasted he was of a sudden she began to weep saying between her sobs  oh if you should die vernoon i will die also and be born again not as asika as i have been for so many generations but as a white woman that i may be with you only first she added setting her teeth i will sacrifice every wizard in this land for they have brought the sickness on you by their magic and i will burn bonsatown and cast its gods to melt in the flames and the mungana with them and then amid their ashes i will let out my life and again she began to weep very piteously and to call him by endearing names and pray him that he would not die  now alan thought it time to wake up he opened his eyes stared at her vacantly and asked if it were raining which indeed it might have been for her big tears were falling on his face she uttered a gasp of joy  no no she answered the weather is very fine it is ii who have rained because i thought you die she wiped his forehead with the soft linen of her robe then went on but you will not die say that you will live say that you will live for me vernoon  he looked at her and feeble though he was the awfulness of the situation sank into his soul  i hope that i shall live he answered i am hungry please give me some food  next instant there was a tumult near by and when alan looked up again it was to see jeekie very lightly clad flying through the door  it will be here presently she said oh if you knew what i have suffered if you only knew now you will recover whom i thought dead for this fever passes quickly and there shall be such a sacrificeno i forgot you hate sacrificesthere shall be no sacrifice there shall be a thanksgiving and every woman in the land shall break her bonds to husband or to lover and take him whom she desires without reproach or loss i will do as i would be done by that is the law you taught me is it not  this novel interpretation of a sacred doctrine worthy of jeekie himself so paralyzed alans enfeebled brain that he could make no answer nor do anything except wonder what would happen in asikiland when the decree of its priestess took effect then jeekie arrived with something to drink which he swallowed with the eagerness of the convalescent and almost immediately went to sleep in good earnest  alans recovery was rapid since as the asika had told him if a patient lives through it the kind of fever that he had taken did not last long enough to exhaust his vital forces when she asked him if he needed anything to make him well he answered  yes air and exercise  she replied that he should have both and next morning his hated mask was put upon his face and he was supported by priests to a door where a litter or rather litters were waiting one for himself and another for jeekie who although in robust health was still supposed to be officially ill and not allowed to walk upon his own legs they entered these litters and were borne off till presently they met a third litter of particularly gorgeous design carried by masked bearers wherein was the asika herself wearing her coronet and a splendid robe  into this litter which was fitted with a second seat alan was transferred the mungana for whom it was designed being placed in that vacated by alan which either by accident or otherwise was no more seen that day they went up the mountain side and to the edge of the great fall and watched the waters thunder down though the crest of them they could not reach next they wandered off into the huge forests that clothed the slopes of the hills and there halted and ate then as the sun sank they returned to the gloomy bonsatown beneath them  for alan notwithstanding his weakness and anxieties it was a heavenly day the asika was passive some new mood being on her and scarcely troubled him at all except to call his attention to a tree a flower or a prospect of the scenery here on the mountain side too the air was sweet and for the restwell he who had been so near to death was escaped for an hour from that gloomy home of bloodshed and superstition and saw gods sky again  this journey was the first of many every day the litters were waiting and they visited some new place although into the town itself they never went moreover if they passed through outlying villages though alan was forced to wear his mask their inhabitants had been warned to absent themselves so that they saw no one the crops were left untended and the cattle and sheep lowed hungrily in their kraals on certain days at alans request they were taken to the spots where the gold was found in the gravel bed of an almost dry stream that during the rains was a torrent  he descended from the litter and with the help of the asika and jeekie dug a little in this gravel not without reward for in it they found several nuggets above too where they went afterwards was a huge quartz reef denuded by water which evidently had been worked in past ages and was still so rich that in it they saw plenty of visible gold looking at it alan bethought him of his city days and of the hundreds of thousands of pounds capital with which this unique proposition might have been floated afterwards they were carried to the places where the gems were found stuck about in the clay like plums in a pudding though none ever sought them now but all these things interested the asika not at all  what is the good of gold she asked of alan except to make things of or the bright stones except to play with what is the good of anything except food to eat and power and wisdom that can open the secret doors of knowledge of things seen and things unseen and love that brings the lover joy and forgetfulness of self and takes away the awful loneliness of the soul if only for a little while  not wishing to drift into discussion on the matter of love alan asked the priestess to define her soul whence it came and whither she believed it to be going  my soul is i vernoon she answered and already very very old thus it has ruled amongst this people for thousands of years  how is that he asked seeing that the asika dies  oh no vernoon she does not die she only changes the old body dies the spirit enters into another body which is waiting thus until i was fourteen i was but a common girl the daughter of a headman of that village yonder at least so they tell me for of this time i have no memory then the asika died and as i had the secret marks and the beauty that is hers the priests burnt her body before big bonsa and suffocated me the child in the smoke of the burning but i awoke again and when i awoke the past was gone and the soul of the asika filled me bringing with it its awful memories its gathered wisdom its passion of love and hate and its power to look backward and before  do you ever do these things asked alan  backward yes before very little since you came not at all because my heart is a coward and i fear what i might see oh vernoon vernoon i know you and your thoughts you think me a beautiful beast who loves like a beast who loves you because you are white and different from our men well what there is of the beast in me the gods of my people gave for they are devils and i am their servant but there is more than that there is good also which i have won for myself i knew you would come even before i had seen your face i knew you would come she went on passionately and that is why i was yours already but what would befall after you came that i neither knew nor know because i will not seek who could learn it all  he looked at her and she saw the doubt in his eyes  you do not believe me vernoon very well this night you shall see you and that black dog of yours that you may know i do not trick you and he shall tell me what you see for he being but a lowborn pig will speak the truth not minding if it hurts me whereas you are gentle and might spare and myself i have sworn not to search the future by an oath that i may not break  what of the past asked alan  we will not waste time on it for i know it all vernoon have you no memories of asikiland do you think you never visited it before  never said alan it was my uncle who came and ran away with little bonsa on his head  that is news indeed she replied mockingly did you then think that i believed it to be you though it is true that she who went before or my spirit that was in her fell into error for an hour and thought that fooluncle of yours was the man when she found her mistake she let him go and bade the god go with him that it might bring back the appointed man as it has done yes that little bonsa who knew him of old might search him out from among all the millions of men born or unborn and bring him back to me therefore also she chose a young black dog who would live for many years and bade the god to take him with her and told him of the wealth of our people that it might be a bait upon the hook do you see vernoon that yellow dirt was the bait that ii am the hook well you have felt it before so it should not gall you overmuch  now alan was more frightened than he had been since he set foot in asikiland for of a sudden this woman became terrible to him he felt that she knew things which were hidden from him for the first time he believed in her believed that she was more than a mere passionate savage set by chance to rule over a bloodthirsty tribe that she was one who had a part in his destiny  felt the hook he muttered i do not understand  you are very forgetful she answered vernoon we have lived and loved before who were twin souls from the first that man now whom i told you lived once on the great river called the nile have you no memory of him well well let it be i will tell you afterwards here we are at the gold house again tonight when i am ready i will send for you and this i promise you shall leave me wiser than you were  when they were alone in their room alan told jeekie of the expected entertainment of crystal gazing or whatever it might be and the part that he was to play in it  you say that again major said jeekie  alan repeated the information giving every detail that he could remember  oh said jeekie i see asika show us things cause she afraid to look at them herself or take oath or cant or something she no ask you tell her what she see because you too kind hurt her feeling if happen to be something beastly but jeekie just tell her because he so truthful and not care curse about her feeling well that all right jeekie tell her sure enough only major dont you interrupt quite possible these magic things i see one show you see another so dont you go say jeekie that a lie and give me away to asika just because you think you see different cause if so you put me into dirty hole and of course i catch it afterwards you promise major  oh yes i promise but jeekie do you really think we are going to see anything  cant say major and he shook his head gloomily praps all put up job but lots of rum things in world major specially among beastly african savage who very curious and always ready pay blood to bad spirit hope asika not get this into her head because no one know what happen praps we see too much and scared all our lives but praps all tommy rot  thats ittommy rot answered alan who was not superstitious well i suppose that we must go through with it but oh jeekie i wish you would tell me how to get out of this  dont know major praps never get out praps learn how tonight have to do something soon if want to go munganas time nearly up and thenoh my eye    it was night about ten oclock indeed the hour at which alan generally went to bed no message had come and he began to hope that the asika had forgotten or changed her mind and was just going to say so to jeekie when a light coming from behind him attracted his attention and he turned to see her standing in a corner of the great room holding a lamp in her hand and looking towards him her gold breastplate and crown were gone with every other ornament and she was clad or rather muffled in robes of pure white fitted with a kind of nuns hood which lay back upon her shoulders also on her arm she carried a shawl or veil standing thus all undecked with her long hair fastened in a simple knot she still looked very beautiful more so than she had ever been thought alan for the cruelty of her face had faded and was replaced by a mystery very strange to see she did not seem quite like a natural woman and that was the reason perhaps that alan for the first time felt attracted by her hitherto she had always repelled him but this night it was otherwise  how did you come here he asked in a more gentle voice than he generally used towards her  noting the change in his tone she smiled shyly and even coloured a little then answered  this house has many secrets vernoon when you are lord of it you shall learn them all till then i may not tell them to you but come there are other secrets which i hope you shall see tonight and jeekie come you also for you shall be the mouth of your lord so that you may tell me what perhaps he would hide  i will tell you everything everything o asika answered jeekie stretching out his hands and bowing almost to the ground  then they started and following many long passages as before although whether they were the same or others alan could not tell came at last to a door which he recognized that of the treasure house as they approached this door it opened and through it like a hunted thing ran the bedizened mungana husband of the asika terror or madness shining in his eyes catching sight of his wife who bore the lamp he threw himself upon his knees and snatching at her robe addressed some petition to her speaking so rapidly that alan could not follow his words  for a moment she listened then dragged her dress from his hand and spurned him with her foot there was something so cruel in the gesture and the action so full of deadly hate and loathing that alan who witnessed it experienced a new revulsion of feeling towards the asika what kind of a woman must she be he wondered who could treat a discarded lover thus in the presence of his successor  with a groan or a sob it was difficult to say which the poor man rose and perceived alan whose face he now beheld for the first time since the asika had told him not to mask himself as they would meet no one the sight of it seemed to fill him with jealous fury at any rate he leapt at his rival intending apparently to catch him by the throat alan who was watching him stepped aside so that he came into violent contact with the wall of the passage and halfstunned by the shock reeled onwards into the darkness  the hog said the asika or rather she hissed it the hog who dared to touch me and to strike at you well his time is shortwould that i could make it shorter did you hear what he sought of me  alan who wished for no confidences replied by asking what the mungana was doing in the treasure house to which she answered that the spirits who dwelt there were eating up his soul and when they had devoured it all he would go quite mad and kill himself  does this happen to all munganas inquired alan  yes vernoon if the asika hates them but if she loves them it is otherwise come let us forget the wretch who would kill you if he could and she led the way into the hall and up it passing between the heaps of gold  on the table where lay the necklaces of gems she set down her lamp whereof the light all there was in that great place flickered feebly upon the mask of little bonsa which had been moved here apparently for some ceremonial purpose and still more feebly upon the hideous golden countenances and winding sheets of the ancient yellow dead who stood around in scores placed one above the other each in his appointed niche it was an awesome scene and one that oppressed jeekie very much for he murmured to alan  oh my major family vault childs play to this hole just like here his comparison came to an end for the asika cut it short with a single glance  sit here in front of me she said to alan and you jeekie sit at your lords side and be silent till i bid you speak  then she crouched down in a heap behind them threw the cloth or veil she carried over her head and in some way that they did not see suddenly extinguished the lamp  now they were in deep darkness the darkness of death and in utter silence the silence of the dead no glimmer of light and yet to alan it seemed as though he could feel the flash of the crystal eyes of little bonsa and of all the other eyes set in the masks of those departed men who once had been the husbands of the bloodstained priestess of the asiki till one by one as she wearied of them they were bewitched to madness and to doom in that utter quiet he thought even that he could hear them stir within their winding sheets or it may have been that the asika had risen and moved among them on some errand of her own far away something fell to the floor a very light object such as flake of rock or a scale of gold yet the noise of it struck his nerves loud as a clap of thunder and those of jeekie also for he felt him start at his side and heard the sudden hammerlike beat of his heart  what was the woman doing in this dreadful place he wondered well it was easy to guess doubtless she had brought them here to scare and impress them presently a voice that of some hidden priest would speak to them and they would be asked to believe it a message from the spirit world or a spirit itself might be arrangedwhat could be easier in their mood and these surroundings  now the asika was speaking behind them in a muffled voice from the tone of it she appeared to be engaged in argument or supplication in some strange tongue at any rate alan could not understand a word of what she said the argument or prayer went on for a long while with pauses as though for answers then suddenly it ceased and once more they were plunged into that unfathomable silence    chapter xvi  what the asika showed alan  it seemed to alan that he went to sleep and dreamed  he dreamed that it was late autumn in england leaves drifted down from the trees beneath the breath of a strong damp wind and ran or floated along the road till they vanished into a ditch or caught against a pile of stones that had been laid ready for its repair he knew the road well enough he even knew the elm tree beneath which he seemed to stand on the crest of a hill it was that which ran from mr champershaswells splendid house the court to the church he could see them both the house to the right the church to the left and his eyesight seemed to have improved since he was able to observe that at either place there was bustle and preparation as though for some big ceremony  now the big gates of the court opened and through them came a funeral it advanced toward him with unnatural swiftness as though it floated upon air the whole melancholy procession of it in a few seconds it had come and gone and yet during those seconds he suffered agony for there arose in his mind a horrible terror that this was barbaras burying he could not have endured it for another moment he would have cried out or died only now the mourners passed him following the coffin and in the first carriage he saw barbara seated looking sad and somewhat troubled but well a little further down the line came another carriage and in it was sir robert aylward staring before him with cold impassive face  in his dream alan thought to himself that he must have borrowed this carriage which would not be strange as he generally used motors for there was a peers coronet upon the panels and the silvermounted harness  the funeral passed and suddenly vanished into the churchyard gates leaving alan wondering why his cousin haswell was not seated at barbaras side then it occurred to him that it might be because he was in the coffin and at that moment in his dream he heard the asika asking jeekie what he saw heard jeekie answering also a burying in the country called england  of whom jeekie then after some hesitation the answer  of a lady whom my lord loves very much they bury her  what was her name jeekie  her name was barbara  barbara why that you told me was the name of his mother and his sister which of them is buried  neither o asika it was another lady who loved him very much and wanted to marry him and that was why he ran away to africa but now she is dead and buried  are all women in england called barbara jeekie  yes o asika barbara means woman  if your lord loved this barbara why then did he run away from her well it matters not since she is dead and buried for whatever their spirits may feel no man cares for a woman that is dead until she clothes herself in flesh again that was a good vision and i will reward you for it  i have earned nothing o asika answered jeekie modestly who only tell you what i see as i must yet o asika he added with a note of anxiety in his voice why do you not read these magic writings for yourself  because i dare not or rather because i can not she answered fiercely be silent slave for now the power of the good broods upon my soul  the dream went on a great forest appeared such a forest as they had passed before they met the cannibals and set beneath one of the trees a tent and in that tent barbara barbara weeping someone began to lift the flap of the tent she sprang up snatching at a pistol that lay beside her turning its muzzle towards her breast a man entered the tent alan saw his face it was his own barbara let fall the pistol and fell backwards as though a bullet from it had pierced her heart he leapt towards her but before he came to where she lay everything had vanished and he heard jeekie droning out his lies to the asika telling her that the vision he had seen was one of her and his master seated with their arms about each other in a chamber of the golden house  a third time the dream descended on alan like a cloud it seemed to him that he was borne beyond the flaming borders of the world everything around was new and unfamiliar vast changing lovely terrible he stood alone upon a pearly plain and the sky above him was lit with red moons many and many of them that hung there like lamps spirits began to pass him he could catch something of their splendour as they sped by with incredible swiftness he could hear the music of their laughter one rose up at his side it was the asika only a thousand times more splendid clothed in all the glory of hell majestically she bent towards him her glowing eyes held his the deadly perfume of her breath beat upon his brow and made him drunken  she spoke to him and her voice sounded like distant bells  through many a life through many a life she said bought with much blood paid for with a million tears but mine at last the soul that i have won to comfort my soul in the eternal day come to the place i have made ready for you the hell that shall turn to heaven at your step come you by whom i am redeemed and drive away those gods that torture me because i was their servant that i might win you  so she spoke and though all his soul revolted yet the fearful strength that was in her seemed to draw him onward whither she would go then a light shone and that light was the face of barbara and with a suddenness that was almost awful the wild dream came to an end    alan was in his own room again though how he got there he did not recollect  jeekie he said what has happened i seem to have had a very curious dream there in the treasureplace and to have heard you telling the asika a string of incredible falsehoods  oh no major jeekie cant lie too good christian he tell her what he see or what he think she see if she look cause though praps he see nothing she never believe that and he added with a burst of confidence what the dickens it matter what he tell her so long as she swallow same and keep quiet nasty things always make women like asika quite outrageous give them sweet to suck say jeekie and if they ill afterwards that no fault of his they had sweet  quite so jeekie quite so only i should advise you not to play too many tricks upon the asika lest she should happen to find you out how did i get back here  like man that walk in his sleep major she go first you follow just as little lamb after mary in hymn  jeekie did you really see anything at all  no major nothing particlar except ghost of mrs jeekie and of your reverend uncle both of them very angry that magic all stuff major asika put something in your grub make you drunk so that you think her very wise dont think of it no more major or you go off your chump if jeekie see nothing depend on it there nothing to see  perhaps so jeekie but i wish i could be sure you had seen nothing listen to me we must get out of this place somehow or as you say i shall go off my chump its haunted jeekie its haunted and i think that asika is a devil not a woman  that what priests say major very old devilpart of bonsa he answered looking at his master anxiously well dont you fret jeekie not afraid of devils jeekie get you out in good time go to bed and leave it all to jeekie    fifteen more days had gone by and it was the eve of the night of the second full moon when alan was destined to become the husband of the asika she had sent for him that morning and he found her radiant with happiness whether or no she believed jeekies interpretation of the visions she had called up it seemed quite certain that her mind was void of fears and doubts she was sure that alan was about to become her husband and had summoned all the people of the asiki to be present at the ceremony of their marriage and incidentally of the death of the mungana who poor wretch was to be forced to kill himself upon that occasion  before they parted she had spoken to alan sweetly enough  vernoon she said i know that you do not love me as i love you but the love will come since for your sake i will change myself i will grow gentle i will shed no more blood that of the mungana shall be the last and even him i would spare if i could only while he lives i may not marry you it is the one law that is stronger than i am and if i broke it i and you would die at once you shall even teach me your faith if you will for what is good to you is henceforth good to me ask what you wish of me and as an earnest i will do it if i can  now alan looked at her there was one thing that he wished above all othersthat she would let him go but this he did not dare to ask moreover it would have been utterly useless after all if the asikas love was terrible what would be the appearance of her outraged hate what could he ask more gold he hated the very name of the stuff for it had brought him here he remembered the old cannibal chief fahni who like himself languished a prisoner daily expecting death only that morning he had implored him to obtain his liberty  i thank you asika he said now if your words are true set fahni free and let him return to his own country for if he stays here he will die  surely vernoon that is a small thing she answered smiling though it is true that when he gets there he will probably make war upon us well let him let him then she clapped her hands and summoned priests whom she bade go at once and conduct fahni out of bonsatown also she bade them loose certain slaves who were of the ogula tribe that they might accompany him laden with provisions and send on orders to the outposts that fahni and his party should pass unmolested from the land  this done she began to talk to alan about many matters however little he might answer her indeed it seemed almost as though she feared to let him leave her side as though some presentiment of loss oppressed her  at length to alans great relief the time came when they must part since it was necessary for her to attend a secret ceremony of preparation or purification that was called puttingoffthepast although she had been thrice summoned still she would not let him go  they call you asika said alan  yes yes they call me she replied springing up leave me vernoon till we meet tomorrow to part no more oh why is my heart so heavy in me that black dog of yours read the visions that i summoned but might not look on and they were good visions they showed that the woman who loved you is dead they showed us wedded and other deeper things surely he would not dare to lie to me knowing that if he did i would flay him living and throw him to the vultures why then is my heart so heavy in me would you escape me vernoon nay you are not so cruel nor could you do it except by death moreover man know that even in death you cannot escape me for there be sure i shall follow you and claim you to whose side my spirit has toiled for ages and what is there so strong that it can snatch you from my hand  she looked at him a moment and seizing his hand burst into a flood of tears and seizing his hand threw herself upon her knees and kissed it again and again  go now she said go and let my love go with you through lives and deaths and all the dreams beyond oh let my love go with you as it shall vernoon  so he went leaving her weeping on her knees    during the dark hours that followed alan and madness were not far apart what could he do escape was utterly impossible for weeks he and jeekie had considered it in vain even if they could win out of the gold house fortress what hope had they of making their way through the crowded tortuous town where after the african fashion peopled walked about all night every one of whom would recognize the white man whether he were masked or no besides beyond the town were the river and the guarded walls and gates and beyond them open country where they would be cut off or run down no to attempt escape was suicide suicide that gave him an idea why should he not kill himself it would be easy enough for he still had his revolver and a few cartridges and surely it was better than to enter on such a life as awaited him as the plaything of a priestess of a tribe of fetishworshipping savages  but if he killed himself how about barbara and how about poor old jeekie who would certainly be killed also besides it was not the right thing to do and while there is life there is always hope  alan paused in his walk up and down the room and looked at jeekie who sat upon the floor with his back resting against the stone altar reflectively pulling down his thick underlip and letting it fly back negrofashion  jeekie he said times up what am i to do  do major he replied with affected cheerfulness oh that quite simple jeekie arrange everything you marry asika and by and by when you master here and tired of her you give her slip very interesting experience no white man ever have such luck before asika not half bad if she fond of you she like little girl in song when she good she very very good at any rate nothing else to do marry asika or spiflicate which mean major that jeekie spiflicate too and he added shaking his white head sadly he no like that one or two little things on his mind that no get time to square up yet darent pray like christian here cause afraid of bonsas and bonsas come even with him by and by cause he been christian so poor jeekie fall down bump between two stools postles kick him out of heaven and bonsas kick him out of hell and where jeekie go to then  dont know i am sure answered alan smiling a little in spite of his sorrow but i think the bonsas might find a corner for you somewhere look here jeekie you old scamp i am sorry for you for you have been a good friend to me and we are fond of each other but just understand this i am not going to marry that woman if i can help it its against my principles so i shall wait till tomorrow and then i shall walk out of this place if the guards try to stop me i shall shoot them while i have any cartridges then i shall go on until they kill me  oh but major they not kill younever they chuck blanket over your head and take you back to asika it jeekie they kill skin him aliveo and all the rest of it  hope not jeekie because they think we shall die the same day but if so i cant help it tomorrow morning i shall walk out and now thats settled i am tired and going to sleep and he threw himself down upon the bed and being worn out with weariness and anxiety soon fell fast asleep  but jeekie did not sleep although he too lay down upon his bed on the contrary he remained wide awake and reflected more deeply perhaps than he had ever done before being sure the superstition as to the dependence of alans life upon his own was now worn very thin and that his hour was at hand he thought of making alans wild attempt to depart impossible by the simple method of warning the asika but notwithstanding his native selfishness was too loyal to let that idea take root in his mind no there was nothing to be done if the major wished to start the major must start and he jeekie must pay the price well he deserved it who had been fool enough to listen to the secret promptings of little bonsa and conduct him to asikiland  thus he passed several hours for the most part in melancholy speculations as to the exact fashion of his end until at length weariness overcame him also and shutting his eyes jeekie began to doze suddenly he grew aware of the presence of some other person in the room but thinking that it was only the asika prowling about in her uncanny fashion or perhaps her spirit for how her body entered the place he could not guess he did not stir but lay breathing heavily and watching out of the corner of his eye  presently a figure emerged from the shadows into the faint light thrown by the single lamp that burned above and though it was wrapped in a dark cloak jeekie knew at once that it was not the asika very stealthily the figure crept towards him as a leopard might creep and bent down to examine him the movement caused the cloak to slip a little and for an instant jeekie caught sight of the wasted halfcrazed face of the mungana and of a long curved knife that glittered in his hand paralyzed with fear he lay quite still knowing that should he show the slightest sign of consciousness that knife would pierce his heart  the mungana watched him a while then satisfied that he slept turned round and bending himself almost double glided with infinite precautions towards alans bed which stood some twelve or fourteen feet away silently as a snake that uncoils itself jeekie slipped from between his blankets and crept after him his naked feet making no noise upon the matstrewn floor so intent was the mungana upon the deed which he had come to do that he never looked back and thus it happened that the two of them reached the bed one immediately behind the other  alan was lying on his back with his throat exposed a very easy victim for a moment the mungana stared then he erected himself like a snake about to strike and lifted the great curved knife taking aim at alans naked breast jeekie erected himself also and even as the knife began to fall with one hand he caught the arm that drove it and with the other the murderers throat the mungana fought like a wildcat but jeekie was too strong for him his fingers held the mans windpipe like a vise he choked and weakened the knife fell from his hand he sank to the ground and lay there helpless whereon jeekie knelt upon his chest and possessing himself of the knife held it within an inch of his heart  it was at this juncture that alan woke up and asked sleepily what was the matter  nothing major answered jeekie in low and cheerful tones snake just going to bite you and i catch him that all and he gave an extra squeeze to the munganas throat who turned black in the face and rolled his eyes  be careful jeekie or you will kill the man exclaimed alan recognizing the mungana and taking in the situation  why not major he want kill you and me too afterwards good riddance of bad rubbish as book say  i am not so sure jeekie give him air and let me think tell him that if he makes any noise he dies  jeekie obeyed and the munganas darkening eyes grew bright again as he drew his breath in great sobs  now friend said alan in asiki why did you wish to stab me  because i hate you answered the man who tomorrow will take my place and the wife i love  as a year or two ago you took someone elses place eh well suppose now that i dont want either your place or your wife  what would that matter even it if were true white man since she wants you  i am thinking friend that there is someone else she will want when she hears of this how do you suppose that you will die tomorrow not so easily as you hope perhaps  the munganas eyes seemed to sink into his head and his face to sicken with terror that shaft had gone home  suppose i make a bargain with you went on alan slowly supposing i say mungana show me the way out of this place as you can now at once or if you prefer it refuse and be given up to the asika come you are not too mad to understand answerand quickly  would you kill me afterwards he asked  not i why should i wish to kill you you can come with us and go where you will or you can stay here and die as the asika directs  i cannot believe you white man it is not possible that you should wish to run away from so much love and glory or to spare one who would have slain you also it would be difficult to get you out of bonsatown  jeekie said alan this fellow is mad after all i think you had better go to the door and shout for the priests  no no lord begged the wretched creature i will trust you i will try though it is you who must be mad  very good stand over him jeekie while i put on my things and yes give me that mask if he stirs kill him at once  so alan made himself ready then he mounted guard over the mungana as did jeekie although he shook his head over their prospect of escape  no go he muttered no go if we get past priests asika catch us with her magic when i bolt with your reverend uncle last time little bonsa arrange business because she go abroad fetch you now likely as not she bowl you out and then goodbye jeekie  alan sternly bade him be quiet and stop behind if he did not wish to come  no no major he answered i come all right asika very prejudiced beggar and if she find me here aloneoh my better die double after all twos company major now all ready march and he gave the unfortunate mungana a fearful kick as a hint to proceed  so utterly crushed was the poor wretch that even this insult did not stir him to resentment  follow me white man he said and if you desire to live be silent throw your cloaks about your heads  they did so and holding their revolvers in their right hands glided after the mungana in the corner of the big room they came to a little stair how it opened in that place where no stair had been they could not see or even guess for it was too dark only now they knew the means by which the asika had been able to visit them at night  the mungana went first down the stair jeekie followed grasping him by the arm with one hand while in the other he kept his own knife ready to stab him at the first sign of treachery alan brought up the rear keeping hold of jeekies cloak they passed down twelve steps of stair then turned to the right along a tunnel then to the left then to the right again in the pitch darkness it was an awful journey since they knew not whither they were being led and expected that every moment would be their last at length quite of a sudden they emerged into moonlight  alan looked about him and knew the place it was where the feast had been held two months before when the priests were poisoned and the bonsas chose the victims for sacrifice already it was prepared for the great festival of tomorrow when the mungana should drown himself and alan be married to the asika there on the dais were the gold chairs in which they were to sit and green branches of trees mixed with curious flags decked the vast amphitheatre beyond moreover there was the broad canal and floating in the midst of it the hideous gold fetish big bonsa the moon shone on its glaring deathly eyes its fishlike snout and its huge pale teeth alan looked at it and shivered for the thing was horrid and uncanny and the utter loneliness in which it lay staring up at the moon seemed to accentuate the horror  the mungana noticed his fear and whispered  we must swim the water if you have a god white man pray him to protect you from bonsa  lead on answered alan i do not dread a foul fetish only the look of it but is there no way round  the mungana shook his head and began to enter the canal jeekie whose teeth were chattering hung back but alan pushed him from behind so sharply that he stumbled and made a splash then alan followed and as the cold black water rose to his chest looked again at big bonsa  it seemed to him that the thing had turned round and was staring at them surely a few seconds ago its snout pointed the other way no that must be fancy he was swimming now they were all swimming alan and jeekie holding their pistols and little stock of cartridges above their heads to keep them dry the gold head of big bonsa appeared to be lifting itself up in the water as a reptile might in order to get a better view of these proceedings but doubtless it was the ripples that they caused which gave it this appearance only why did the ripples make it come towards them quite gently like an investigating fish  it was about ten yards off and they were in the middle of the canal the mungana had passed it it was in a line with alans head oh heavens a sudden smother of foam a rush like that of a torpedo and set low down between two curving waves a flash of gold then a gurgling inhuman laugh and a weight upon his back down went alan down and down    chapter xvii  the end of the mungana  the moonlight above vanished alan was alone in the depths with this devil or whatever it might be he could feel hands and feet gripping and treading on him but they did not seem to be human for there were too many of them also they were very cold he gave himself up for dead and thought of barbara  then something flashed into his mind in his hand he still held the revolver he pressed it upwards against the thing that was smothering him and pulled the trigger again he pulled it and again for it was a selfcocking weapon and even there deep down in the water he heard the thud of the explosion of the dampproof copper cartridges his lungs were bursting his senses reeled only enough of them remained to tell him that he was free of that strangling grip and floating upwards his head rose above the surface and through the mouth of his mask he drew in the sweet air with quick gasps down below him in the clear water he saw the yellow head of big bonsa rocking and quivering like a great reflected moon saw too that it was beginning to rise yet he could not swim away from it the fetish seemed to have hypnotized him he heard jeekie calling to him from the shallow water near the further bank but still he floated there like a log and stared down at big bonsa wallowing beneath  jeekie plunged back into the canal and with a few strong strokes reached him gripped him by the arm and began to tow him to the shore before they came there big bonsa rose like a huge fish and tried to follow them but could not or so it seemed at any rate it only whirled round and round upon the surface while from it poured a white fluid that turned the black water to the hue of milk then it began to scream making a thin and dreadful sound more like that of an infant in pain than anything they had ever heard a very sickening sound that alan never could forget he staggered to the bank and stood staring at it where it bled rolled and shrieked but because of the milky foam could make nothing out in that light  what is it jeekie he said with an idiotic laugh what is it  oh dont know devil and all perhaps come on major before it catch us  i dont think it will catch anyone just at present devil or not hollownosed bullets dont agree with it shall i give it another jeekie and he lifted the pistol  no no major dont play tomfool and jeekie grabbed him by the arm and dragged him away  a few paces further on stood the mungana like a man transfixed and even then alan noticed that he regarded him with something akin to awe  stronger than the god he muttered stronger than the god and bounded forward  following the path that ran beside the canal they plunged into a tunnel holding each other as before in a few minutes they were through it and in a place full of cedar trees outside the wall of the gold house under which evidently the tunnel passed for there it rose behind them beneath these cedar trees they flitted like ghosts now in the moonlight and now in the shadow  the great fall to the back of the town was on their left and in front of them lay one of the arms of the river at this spot a raging torrent not much more than a hundred feet in width spanned by a narrow suspension bridge which seemed to be supported by two fibre ropes on the hither side of this bridge stood a guard hut and to their dismay out of this hut ran three men armed with spears evidently to cut them off one of these men sped across the bridge and took his stand at the further end while the other two posted themselves in their path at the entrance to it  the mungana slacked his speed and said one wordfinished and jeekie also hesitated then turned and pointed behind them  alan looked back and flitting in and out between the cedar trees saw the white robes of the priests of bonsa then despair seized them all and they rushed at the bridge jeekie reached it first and dodging beneath the spears of the two guards plunged his knife into the breast of one of them and butted the other with his great head so that he fell over the side of the bridge on to the rocks below  cut major cut he said to alan who pushed past him all right now  they were on the narrow swaying bridgeit was but a single plankalan first then the mungana then jeekie when they were half way across alan looked before him and saw a sight he could never forget  the third guard at the further side was sawing through one of the fibre ropes with his spear there they were on the middle of the bridge with the torrent raving fifty feet beneath them and the man had nearly severed the rope to get over before it parted was impossible behind were the priests beneath the roaring river all three of them stopped as though paralyzed for all three had seen something struck against alans leg it was his pistol that still remained fastened to his wrist by its leather thong he cocked and lifted it took aim and fired the shot missed which was not wonderful considering the light and the platform on which the shooter stood it missed but the man astonished for he had never seen or heard such a thing before stopped his sawing for a moment and stared at them then as he began again alan fired once more and this time by good fortune the bullet struck the man somewhere in the body he fell and as he fell grasped the nearly separated rope and hung to it  get hold of the other rope and come on yelled alan and once more they bounded forward  my god its going he yelled again hold fast jeekie hold fast  next instant the rope parted and the man vanished the bridge tipped over and supported by the remaining rope hung edgeways up to this rope the three of them clung desperately resting their feet upon the edge of the swaying plank for a few seconds they remained thus afraid to stir then jeekie called out  climb on major climb on like one monkey look bad but quite safe really  as there was nothing else to be done alan began to climb shifting his feet along the plank edge and his hands along the rope which creaked and stretched beneath their threefold weight  it was a horrible journey and in his imagination took at least an hour yet they accomplished it for at last they found themselves huddled together but safe upon the further bank the sweat pouring down from his head almost blinded alan a deadly nausea worked within him sickly tremors shot up and down his spine his brain swam yet he could hear jeekie in whom excitement always took the form of speech saying loudly  think that man no liar what say our great papas was monkeys never look down on monkey no more wake up major those priests monkeymen too for we all brothers you know wait a bit i stop their little game and springing up with three or four cuts of the big curved knife he severed the remaining rope just as their pursuers reached the further side of the chasm  they shouted with rage as the long bridge swung back against the rock the cut end of it falling into the torrent and waved their spears threateningly to this demonstration jeekie replied with gestures of contempt such as are known to street arabs then he looked at the mungana who lay upon the ground a melancholy and dilapidated spectacle for the perspiration had washed lines of paint off his face and patches of dye from his hair also his gorgeous robes were waterstained and his gem necklaces broken having studied him a while jeekie kicked him meditatively till he got up then asked him to set out the exact situation the mungana answered that they were safe for a while since that torrent could only be crossed by the broken bridge and was too rapid to swim the asiki he added must go a long journey round through the city in order to come at them though doubtless they would hunt them down in time  here jeekie cut him short since he knew all that country well and only wished to learn whether any more bridges had been built across the torrent since he was a boy  now major he said you get up and follow me for i know every inch of ground also by and by good short cut over mountains you see jeekie very clever boy and when he herd sheep and goat he made note of everything and never forget nothing he pull you out of this hole never fear  glad to hear it i am sure answered alan as he rose but whats to become of the mungana  dont know and dont care said jeekie no more good to us can go and see how big bonsa feel if he like and stretching out his big hand as though in a moment of abstraction he removed the costly necklaces from their guides neck and thrust them into the pouch he wore also he picked up the gilded linen mask which alan had removed from his head and placed it in the same receptacle remarking that he always taught that it wicked to waste anything when so many poor in the world  then they started the mungana following them jeekie paused and waved him off but the poor wretch still came on whereon jeekie produced the big crooked knife munganas own knife  what are you going to do said alan awaking to the situation  cut off head of that cocktail man major and so save him lot of trouble also we got no grub and if we find any he want eat a lot chop what do for two praps make very short commons for three also he might play dirty trick so much best dead  nonsense said alan sternly let the poor devil come along if he likes one good turn deserves another  just so major that helloswello want cut our throats so i want cut hisone good turn deserve another as wise king say in book when he give half baby to woman what wouldnt have it well so be major specially as it no matter for he not stop with us long  you mean that he will run away jeekie  oh no he not run away he in too blue funk for that but something run away with him because he ought die tomorrow night oh yes you see you see and jeekie hope that something not run away with you too major because you ought be married at same time  hope not i am sure answered alan and bethinking him of big bonsa wallowing and screaming on the water and bleeding out white blood he shivered a little  by this time advancing at a trot the mungana running after them like a dog they had entered the bush pierced with a few wandering paths along these paths they sped for hour after hour jeekie leading them without a moments hesitation they met no man and heard nothing except occasional weird sounds which alan put down to wild beasts but jeekie and the mungana said were produced by ghosts indeed it appeared that all this jungle was supposed to be haunted and no asiki would enter it at night or unless he were very bold and protected by many charms by day either therefore it was an excellent place for fugitives who sorely needed a good start  at length the day began to dawn just as they reached the main road where it crossed the hills whence on his journey thither alan had his first view of bonsa town peering from the edge of the bush they perceived a fire burning near the road and round it five or six men who seemed to be asleep their first thought was to avoid them but the mungana creeping up to alan for jeekie he would not approach whispered  not asiki ogula chief and slaves who left bonsa town yesterday  they crept nearer the fire and saw that this was so then rejoicing exceedingly they awoke the old chief fahni who at first thought they must be spirits but when he recognized alan he flung himself on his knees and kissed his hand because to him he owed his liberty  no time for all that fahni said alan give us food  now of this as it chanced there was plenty since by the asikas orders the slaves had been laden with as much as they could carry they ate of it ravenously and while they ate told fahni something of the story of their escape the old chief listened amazed but like jeekie asked alan why he had not killed the mungana who would have killed him  alan who was in no mood for long explanations answered that he had kept him with them because he might be useful  yes yes friend i see exclaimed the old cannibal although he is so thin he will always make a meal or two at a pinch truly white men are wise and provident like the ants you take thought for the morrow  as soon as they had swallowed their food they started all together for although alan pointed out to fahni that he might be safer apart the old chief who had a real affection for him would not be persuaded to leave him  let us live or die together he said  now jeekie abandoning the main road led them up a stream walking in the water so that their footsteps might leave no trace and thus away into the barren mountains which rose between them and the great swamp on the crest of these mountains alan turned and looked back towards bonsa town there far across the fertile valley was the hateful riverencircled place there fell the great cataract in the roar of which he had lived for so many weeks there were the black cedars and there gleamed the roofs of the gold house his prison where dwelt the asika and the dreadful fetishes of which she was the priestess to him it was like the vision of a nightmare he could scarcely think it real and yet by this time doubtless they sought him far and wide what mood he wondered would the asika be in when she learned of his escape and the fashion of it and how would she greet him if he were recaptured and taken back to her well he would not be recaptured he had still some cartridges and he would fight till they killed him or failing that save the last of them for himself never never could he endure to be dragged back to bonsa town there to live and die  they went on across the mountains till in the afternoon once more they saw the road running beneath them like a ribbon and at the end of it the lagoon now they rested a while and held a consultation while they ate across that lagoon they could not escape without a canoe  lord said the mungana presently yesterday when these cannibals were let go a swift runner was sent forward commanding that a good boat should be provisioned and made ready for them and by now doubtless this has been done let them descend to the road walk on to the bay and ask for the boat look yonder far away a tongue of land covered with trees juts out into the lake we will make our way thither and after nightfall this chief can row back to it and take us into the canoe  alan said that the plan was good but jeekie shook his head asking what would happen if fahni finding himself safe upon the water thought it wisest not to come to fetch them  alan translated his words to the old chief whereon fahni wanted to fight jeekie because of the slur that he had cast upon his honour this challenge jeekie resolutely declined saying that already there were plenty of ways to die in asikiland without adding another to them then fahni swore by his tribal god and by the spirit of every man he had ever eaten that he would come to that promontory after dark if he were still alive  so they separated fahni and his men slipping down to the road which they did without being seen by anyone while alan jeekie and the mungana bore away to the right towards the promontory the road was long and rough and though by good fortune they met no one since the few who dwelt in these wild parts had gone up to bonsa town to be present at the great feast the sun was sinking before ever they reached the place moreover this promontory proved to be covered with dense thorn scrub through which they must force a way in the gathering darkness not without hurt and difficulty still they accomplished it and at length quite exhausted crept to the very point where they hid themselves between some stones at the waters edge  here they waited for three long hours but no boat came  all up a gumtree now major said jeekie old blackguard fanny bolt and leave us here and tomorrow morning asika nobble us better have gone down to bay steal his boat and leave him behind because asika no want him  alan made no answer he was too tired and although he trusted fahni it seemed likely enough that jeekie was right or perhaps the cannibals had not been able to get the boat well he had done his best and if fate overtook them it was no fault of his he began to doze for even their imminent peril could not keep his eyes open then presently awoke with a start for in his sleep he thought he heard the sounds of paddles beating the quiet water yes there dimly seen through the mist was a canoe and seated in the stern of it fahni so that danger had gone by also  he woke his companions who slept at his side and very silently they rose stepping from rock to rock till they reached the canoe and entered it it was not a large craft barely big enough to hold them all indeed but they found room and then at a sign from fahni the oarsmen gave way so heartily that within half an hour they had lost sight of the accursed shores of asikiland although presently its mountains showed up clearly beneath the moon  meanwhile fahni had told his tale it appeared that when he reached the bay he found the asiki headman who dwelt there and those under him in a state of considerable excitement  rumours had reached them that someone had escaped from bonsa town they thought it was the mungana fahni asked who had brought the rumour whereon the headman answered that it came in a dream and would say no more then he demanded the canoe which had been promised to him and his people and the headman admitted that it was ready in accordance with orders received from the asika but demurred to letting him have it a long argument followed in the midst of which fahni and his men got into the canoe the headman apparently not daring to use force to prevent him just as they were pushing off a messenger arrived from bonsa town reeling with exhaustion and his tongue hanging from his jaws who called out that it was the white man who had escaped with his servant and the mungana and that although they were believed to be still hidden in the holy woods near bonsa town none were to be allowed to leave the bay so the headman shouted to fahni to return but he pretended not to hear and rowed away nor did anyone attempt to follow him still it was only after nightfall that he dared to put the boat about and return to the headland to pick up alan and the others as he had promised that was all he had to say  alan thanked him heartily for his faithfulness and they paddled on steadily putting mile after mile of water between them and asikiland he wondered whether he had seen the last of that country and its inhabitants something within him answered no he was sure that the asika would not allow him to depart in peace without making some desperate effort to recapture him far as he was away it seemed to him that he could feel her fury hanging over him like a cloud a cloud that would burst in a rain of blood doubtless it would have burst already had it not been for the accident that he and his companions were still supposed to be hiding in the woods but that error must be discovered and then would come the pursuit  he looked at the full moon shining upon him and reflected that at this very hour he should have been seated upon the chair of state wedding or rather being wedded by the asika in the presence of big and little bonsa and all the people his eye fell upon the mungana who had also been destined to play a prominent part in that ceremony at once he saw that there was something wrong with the man a curious change had come over his emaciated face it was working like that of a maniac foam appeared upon his dyed lips his haunted eyes rolled his thin hands gripped the side of the canoe and he began to sing or rather howl like a dog baying at the stars jeekie hit him on the head and bade him be silent but he took no notice even when he hit him again more heavily presently came the climax the man sprang up in the canoe causing it to rock from side to side he pointed to the full moon above and howled more loudly than before he pointed to something that he seemed to see in the air near by and gibbered as though in terror then his eyes fixed themselves upon the water at which he stared  harder and harder he stared his head sinking lower every moment till at length without another sound very quietly and unexpectedly he went over the side of the boat for a few seconds they saw his brightcoloured garments sinking to the depths then he vanished  they waited a while expecting that he would rise again but he never rose a shotweighted corpse could not have disappeared more finally and completely the thing was very awful and for a while there was silence which as usual was broken by jeekie  that gay dog gone he said in a reflective voice all those old ghosts come to fetch him at proper time no good run away from ghosts they travel too quick one jump and pop up where you no expect well more place for jeekie now and he spread himself out comfortably in the empty seat adding like helloswellos room much better than company he go in scentbath every day and stink too much all that water never wash him clean  thus died the mungana and such was the poor wretchs requiem with a shiver alan reflected that had it not been for him and his insane jealousy he too might have been expected to go into that same scentbath and have his face painted like a chorus girl only would he escape the spell that had destroyed his predecessor in the affections of the priestess of the bonsas or would some dim power such as had drawn mungana to the death drag him back to the arms of the asika or to the torture pit of great swimming head he remembered his dream in the treasure hall and shuddered at the very thought of it for all he had undergone and seen made him superstitious then bade the men paddle faster ever faster  all that night they rowed on taking turns to rest except alan and jeekie who slept a good deal and as a consequence awoke at dawn much refreshed when the sun rose they found themselves across the lagoon over thirty miles from the borders of asikiland almost at the spot where the river up which they had travelled some months before flowed out of the lake whether by chance or skill fahni had steered a wonderfully straight course now however they were face to face with a new trouble for scarcely had they begun to descend the river when they discovered that at this dry season of the year it was in many places too shallow to allow the canoe to pass over the sand and mud banks evidently there was but one thing to be doneabandon it and walk  so they landed ate from their store of food and began a terrible and toilsome journey on either side of the river lay dessicated swamp covered with dead reeds ten or twelve feet high doubtless beyond the swamp there was high land but in order to reach this if it existed they would be obliged to force a path through miles of reeds therefore they thought it safer to follow the river bank their progress was very slow since continually they must make detours to avoid a quicksand or a creek also the stones and scrubby growth delayed them so that fifteen or at most twenty miles was a good days march  still they went on steadily seeing no man and when their food was exhausted living on the fish which they caught in plenty in the shallows and on young flapper ducks that haunted the reeds so at length they came to the main river into which this tributary flowed and camped there thankfully believing that if any pursuit of them had been undertaken it was abandoned at least alan and the rest believed this but jeekie did not  on the following morning shortly after dawn jeekie awoke his master  come here major he said in a solemn voice i got something pretty show you and he led him to the foot of an old willow tree adding now up you go major and look  so alan went up and from the topmost fork of that tree saw a sight at which his blood turned cold for there not five miles behind them on either side of the river bank the light gleaming on their spears marched two endless columns of men who from their headdresses he took to be asiki for a minute he looked then descended the tree and approaching the others asked what was to be done  hook scoot bolt leg it exclaimed jeekie emphatically then he licked his finger held it up to the wind and added but first fire reeds and make it hot for bonsa crowd  this was a good suggestion and one on which they acted without delay taking red embers they blew them into a flame and lit torches which they applied to the reeds over a width of several hundred yards the strong northward wind soon did the rest indeed with a quarter of an hour a vast sheet of flame twenty or thirty feet in height was rushing towards the asiki columns then they began their advance along the river bank running at a steady trot for here the ground was open  all that day they ran pausing at intervals to get their breath and at night rested because they must when the light came upon the following morning they looked back from a little hill and saw the outposts of the asiki advancing not a mile behind doubtless some of the army had been burned but the rest guessing their route had forced a way through the reeds and cut across country so they began to run again harder than before and kept their lead during the morning but when afternoon came the asika gained on them now they were breasting a long rise the river running in the cleft beneath and jeekie who seemed to be absolutely untiring held alan by the hand fahni following close behind two of their men had fallen down and been abandoned and the rest straggled  no go jeekie gasped alan they will catch us at the top of the hill  never say die major never say die puffed jeekie they get blown too and who know what other side of hill  somehow they struggled to the crest and behold there beneath them was a great army of men  ogula yelled jeekie ogula just what i tell you major who know what other side of any hill    chapter xviii  a meeting in the forest  in five minutes more alan and jeekie were among the ogula who having recognized their chief while he was yet some way off greeted him with rapturous cheers and the clapping of hands then as there was no time for explanation they retreated across a little stream which ran down the valley four thousand or more of them and prepared for battle that evening however there was no fighting for when the first of the asiki reached the top of the rise and saw that the fugitives had escaped to the enemy who were in strength they halted and finally retired  now alan and fahni also hoped that the pursuit was abandoned but again jeekie shook his big head saying  not at all major i know asiki and their little ways while one of them alive not dare go back to asika without you major  perhaps she is with them herself suggested alan and we might treat with her  no major asika never leave bonsa town that against law and if she do so priests make another asika and kill her when they catch her  after this a council of war was held and it was decided to camp there that night since the position was good to meet an attack if one should be made and the ogula were afraid of being caught on the march with their backs towards the enemy alan was glad enough to hear this decision for he was quite worn out and ready to take any risk for a few hours rest at this council he learned also that the asiki bearers carrying his gold with their ogula guides had arrived safely among the ogula who had mustered in answer to their chiefs call and were advancing towards asikiland though the business was one that did not please them as for these asiki bearers it seemed that they had gone on into the forest with the gold and nothing more had been heard of them  as they were leaving the council alan asked jeekie if he had any tidings of his mother who had been their first messenger  no major he answered gloomily cant learn nothing of my ma dont know where she is ogula camp no place for old girl if they short of chop and hungry but praps she never get there i nose round and find out  apparently jeekie did nose round to some purpose for just as alan was dropping off to sleep in his bough shelter a most fearful din arose without through which he recognized the vociferations of jeekie running out of the shelter he discovered his retainer and a great ogula whom he knew again as the headman who had been imprisoned with him and freed by the asika to guide the bearers rolling over and over on the ground watched by a curious crowd just as he arrived jeekie who notwithstanding his years was a man of enormous strength got the better of the ogula and kneeling on his stomach was proceeding to throttle him rushing at him alan dragged him off and asked what was the matter  matter major yelled the indignant jeekie my ma inside this black villain that the matter dirty cannibal got digestion of one ostrich and eat her up with all his mates all except one who not like her taste and tell me they catch poor old lady asleep by road so stop and lunch at once when asiki bearers not looking let me get at him major let me get at him if i cant bury my ma as all good son ought to do i bury him which next best thing  jeekie jeekie said alan exercise a christian spirit and let bygones be bygones if you dont you will make a quarrel between us and the ogula and they will give us up to the asiki perhaps the man did not eat your mother i understand that he denies it and when you remember what she was like it seems incredible at any rate he has a right to a trial and i will speak to fahni about it tomorrow  so they were separated but as it chanced that case never came on for next morning this ogula was killed in the fighting together with two of his companions while the others involved in the charge kept themselves out of sight whether jeekies ma was or was not eaten by the ogula no one ever learned for certain at least she was never heard of any more  alan was sleeping heavily when a sound of rushing feet and of strange thrilling battlecries awoke him he sprang up snatching at a spear and shield which jeekie had provided for him and ran out to find from the position of the moon that dawn was near  come on major said jeekie asiki make night attack they always like do everything at night who love darkness because their eye evil come on quick major and he began to drag him off toward the rear  but thats the wrong way said alan presently they are attacking over there  do you think jeekie fool major that he dont know that he take you where they not attacking plenty ogula to be killed but not many white men like you and in all world only one jeekie  you coldblooded old scoundrel ejaculated alan as he turned and bolted back towards the noise of fighting followed by his reluctant servant  by the time that he reached the first ranks which were some way off the worst of the attack was over it had been short and sharp for the asiki had hoped to find the ogula unprepared and to take their camp with a rush but the ogula who knew their habits were waiting for them so that presently they withdrew carrying off their wounded and leaving about fifty dead upon the ground as soon as he was quite sure that the enemy were all gone jeekie armed with a large battleaxe went off to inspect these fallen soldiers alan who was helping the ogula wounded wondered why he took so much interest in them half an hour later his curiosity was satisfied for jeekie returned with over twenty heavy gold rings torques and bracelets slung over his shoulder  where did you get those jeekie he asked  off poor chaps that peg out just now major remember asiki soldiers nearly always wear these things and that they no more use to them but if ever he get out of this jeekie want spend his old age in respectable peace so he fetch them hard work though for rings all in one bit and asiki very tough to chop dont look cross major you remember what postle say that he who no provide for his own self worse than cannibal  just then fahni came up and announced that the asiki general had sent a messenger into the camp proposing terms of peace  what terms asked alan  these white man that we should surrender you and your servant and go our way unharmed  indeed fahni and what did you answer  white man i refused but i tell you he added warningly that my captains wished to accept they said that i had come back to them safe and that they fear the asiki who are devils not men and who will bring the curse of bonsa on us if we go on fighting with them still i refused saying that if they gave you up i would go with you who saved my life from the lion and afterwards from the priests of bonsa so the messenger went back and white man we march at once and i pray you always to keep close to me that i may watch over you  then began that long tramp down the river which alan always thought afterwards tried him more than any of the terrible events of his escape for although there was but little fighting only rearguard actions indeed every day the asiki sent messengers renewing their offers of peace on the sole condition of the surrender of himself and jeekie at last one evening they came to that place where alan first met the ogula and once more he camped upon the island on which he had shot the lion at nightfall after he had eaten fahni visited him here and alan boded evil from his face  white man he said i can protect you no longer the asiki messengers have been with us again and they say that unless we give you up tomorrow at the dawn their army will push on ahead of us and destroy my town which is two days march down the river and all the women and children in it and that afterwards they will fight a great battle with us therefore my people say that i must give you up or that if i do not they will elect another chief and do so themselves  then you will give up a dead man fahni  friend said the old chief in a low voice the night is dark and the forest not so far away moreover i have set no guards on that side of the river and jeekie here does not forget a road that he has travelled lastly i have heard it said that there are some other white people with soldiers camped in the edge of the forest now if you were not here in the morning how could i give you up  i understand fahni you have done your best for me and now goodnight jeekie and i are going to take a walk sometimes you will think of the months we spent together in bonsatown will you not  yes and of you also white man for so long as i shall live walk fast and far for the asiki are clever at following a spoor goodnight friend and to you jeekie the cunning goodnight also i go to tell my captains that i will surrender you at dawn and without more words he vanished out of their sight and out of their lives  meanwhile jeekie foreseeing the issue of this talk was already engaged in doing up their few belongings including the gold rings some food and a native cooking pot in a bundle surrounded by a couple of bark blankets  come on major he said handing alan one spear and taking another himself old cannibal quite right very nice night for a walk come on major river shallow just here i think this happen and try it before dark you just follow jeekie that all you got to do  so leaving the fire burning in front of their bough shelter they waded the stream and started up the opposing slope meeting no man dark as it was jeekie seemed to have no difficulty in finding the way for as fahni said a native does not forget the path he has once travelled all night long they walked rapidly and when dawn broke found themselves at the edge of the forest  jeekie said alan what did fahni mean by that tale about white people  dont know major think perhaps he lie to let you down easy my golly what that  as he spoke a distant echo reached their ears the echo of a rifle shot think fanny not lie after all went on jeekie that white mans gun sharp crack smokeless powder but wonder how he come in this place well we soon find out come on major  tired as they were they broke into a run the prospect of seeing a white face again was too much for them half a mile or so further on they caught sight of a figure evidently engaged in stalking game among the trees or so they judged from his cautious movements  white man said jeekie and alan nodded  they crept forward silently and with care for who knew what this white man might be after keeping a great tree between them and the man till at length passing round its bole they found themselves face to face with him and not five yards away notwithstanding his unaccustomed tropical dress and his face burnt copper colour by the sun alan knew the man at once  aylward he gasped aylward you here  he started he stared at alan then his countenance changed its habitual calm broke up as it was wont to do in moments of deep emotion it became very evil as though some demon of hate and jealousy were at work behind it the thin lips quivered the eyes glared and without spoken word or warning he lifted the rifle and fired straight at alan the bullet missed him for the aim was high passing over alans head it cut a neat groove through the hair of the taller jeekie who was immediately behind him  next instant with a spring like that of a tiger jeekie was on aylward the weight of his charge knocked him backwards to the ground and there he lay pinned fast  what for you do that exclaimed the indignant jeekie what for you shoot through wool of respectable nigger sir robert aylward bart now i throttle you you dirty hogswine no magistrates court here in dwarf forest and he began to suit the action to the word  let him go jeekie take his rifle and let him go exclaimed alan who all this while had stood amazed there must be some mistake he cannot have meant to murder me  dont know what he mean but know his bullet go through my hair major and give me new parting grumbled jeekie as he obeyed  of course it was a mistake vernon for i suppose it is vernon said aylward as he rose i do not wonder that your servant is angry but the truth is that your sudden appearance frightened me out of my wits and i fired automatically we have been living in some danger here and my nerves are not as strong as they used to be  indeed answered alan no jeekie will carry the rifle for you yes and i think that pistol also every ounce makes a difference walking in a hot climate and i remember that you always were dangerous with firearms there you will be more comfortable so and now who do you mean by we  i mean barbara and myself he answered slowly  alans jaw dropped he shook upon his feet  barbara and yourself he said do i understand  dont you understand nothing major broke in jeekie dont you believe one word what this pig dog say if miss barbara marry him he no want shoot you he ask you to tea to see the missus and how much she love him ducky we just go on and call on miss barbara and hear the news walk up sir robert aylward bart and show us which way  i do not choose to receive you and your impertinent servant at my camp said aylward grinding his teeth  we quite understand that sir robert aylward  lord aylward if you please major vernon  i beg your pardonlord aylward i was aware of the contemplated purchase of that title i did not know that it had been completed i was about to add that all the same we mean to go to that camp and that if any violence towards us is attempted as we approach it you will remember that you are in our hands  yes my lord added jeekie bowing and that monkeys dont tell no tales my lord and that here there aint no twelve goodtrues to sit on noble corpse unhappily deceased my lord and to bring in crowners verdict of done to death lawful or unlawful according as evidence may show when got my lord so march on for we no breakfast yet no not that way round here to left where i think i hear kettle sing  so having no choice aylward came marching between the other two and saying nothing when they had gone a couple of hundred yards alan also heard something and to him it sounded like a man crying out in pain then suddenly they passed round some great trees and reached a glade in the forest where there was a spring of water which alan remembered in this glade the camp had been built surrounded by a boma or palisade of rough wood within which stood two tents and some native shelters made of tall grass and boughs outside of this camp a curious and unpleasant scene was in progress  to a small tree that grew there was tied a man whom from the fashion of his hair alan knew to belong to the coast negroes while two great fellows evidently of another tribe flogged him unmercifully with hide whips  ah exclaimed jeekie that the kettle i hear sing think you better taken him off the fire my lord or he boil over also his brothers no seem to like that music and he pointed to a number of other men who were standing round watching the scene with sullen dissatisfaction  a matter of camp discipline muttered aylward this man has disobeyed orders  by now jeekie was shouting something to the natives in an unknown tongue which they seemed to understand well enough at any rate the flogging ceased the two fellows who were inflicting it slunk away and the other men ran towards them shouting back as they came  all right major you please stop here one minute with my lord late bart of bloody hand some of these chaps friends of mine i meet them old calabar while we get ready to march last rains now i have little talk with them and find out thing or two  aylward began to bluster about interference with his servants and so forth jeekie turned on him with a very ugly grin and showing his white teeth as was his fashion when he grew fierce  beg pardon right honourable lord he said or rather snarled you do what i tell you just to please jeekie jeekie no one in england but jeekie damn big lord too out here great medicine man pal of little bonsa you remember little bonsa eh these chaps think it great honour to meet jeekie so major if he stir please shoot him through head jeekie sponsible not you or if you not like do it i come back and see to job myself and dont think those fellows cry very much  there was something about jeekies manner that frightened aylward who understood for the first time that beneath all the negros grotesque talk lay some dreadful iron purpose as courage lay under his affected cowardice and under his veneer of selfishness fidelity at any rate he halted with alan who stood beside him the revolver of which aylward had been relieved by jeekie in his hand meanwhile jeekie who held the rifle which he had reloaded went on and met the natives about twenty yards away  we always disliked each other vernon but i must say that i never thought a day would come when you proposed to murder me in my own camp said aylward  odd thing answered alan but a very similar idea was in my mind i never thought lord aylward that however unscrupulous you might befinanciallya day would come when you would attempt to shoot down an unarmed man in an african forest oh dont waste breath in lying i saw you recognize me aim and fire after which jeekie would have had the other barrel and who then would have remained to tell the story lord aylward  aylward made no answer but alan felt that if wishes could kill him he would not live long his eye fell upon a long unmistakable mound of fresh earth beneath a tree he calculated its length and with a thrill of terror noticed that it was too small for a negro  who is buried there he asked  find out for yourself was the sneering answer  dont be afraid lord aylward i shall find out everything in time  the conversation between jeekie and the natives proceeded their heads were close together it grew animated they seemed to be coming to some decision presently one of them ran and cut the lashings of the man who had been bound to the tree and he staggered towards them and joined in the talk pointing to his wounds then the two fellows who had been engaged in flogging him accompanied by eight companions of the same typethey appeared to be soldiers for they carried gunsswaggered towards the group who were being addressed by jeekie of whom alan counted twentythree as they approached jeekie made some suggestion which after one hesitating moment the others seemed to accept for they nodded their heads and separated out a little  jeekie stepped forward and asked a question of the guards to which they replied with a derisive shout then without a word of warning he lifted aylwards express rifle which he carried and fired first one barrel and then the other shooting the two leading soldiers dead their companions halted amazed but before they could lift their guns jeekie and those with him rushed at them and began stabbing them with spears and striking them with sticks in three minutes it was over without another shot being fired most of them were despatched and the others throwing down their guns had fled wounded into the forest  now shouting in jubilation some of the men began to drag away the dead bodies while others collected the rifles and the remainder headed by jeekie advanced towards alan and aylward waving their red spears alan stood staring for he did not in the least understand the meaning of what had happened but aylward who had turned very pale addressed jeekie saying  i suppose that you have come to murder me also you black villain  no no my lord answered jeekie politely not at present also that wrong word execute not murder just what you do to some of these poor devils and he pointed to the mob of porters besides mustnt kill holy white man poor black chap dont matter plenty more where he come from think we all go see miss barbara now you come too my lord bart but praps best tie your hands behind you first if you want scratch head i do it for you that only fair you scratch mine this morning  then at a word from jeekie some of the natives sprang on aylward and tied his hands behind his back  is miss barbara alive said alan to jeekie in an agonized whisper at the same time nodding towards the grave that was so ominously short  hope so think so these cards say so but god he know alone answered jeekie go and look that best way to find out  so they advanced into the camp through a narrow gateway made of a vshaped piece of wood to where the two tents were placed in its inner division of these tents the first was open whereas the second was closed as the open tent was obviously empty they went to the second whereof jeekie began to loosen the lashings of the flap it was a long business for they seemed to have been carefully knotted inside indeed at last growing impatient jeekie cut the cord using the curved knife with which the mungana had tried to kill alan  meanwhile alan was suffering torments being convinced that barbara was dead and buried in that newmade grave beneath the trees he could not speak he could scarcely stand and yet a picture began to form in his numb mind he saw himself seated in the dark in the treasurehouse at bonsatown he saw a vision in the air before him  lo the tent door opened and that vision reappeared  there was the pale barbara seated weeping there again as he entered she sprang up and snatching the pistol that lay beside her turned it to her breast then she perceived him and the pistol sank downwards till from her relaxed hand it dropped to the ground she threw up her arms and without a sound fell backwards or would have fallen had he not caught her    chapter xix  the last of the asiki  barbara had recovered she sat upon her bed in the tent and by her sat alan holding her hand while before them stood aylward like a prisoner in the dock and behind him the armed jeekie  tell me the story barbara said alan and tell it briefly for i cannot bear much more of this  she looked at him and began in a slow even voice  after you had gone dear things went on as usual for a month or two then came the great sahara company trouble first there were rumours and the shares began to go down my uncle bought them in by tens and hundreds of thousands to hold up the market because he was being threatened but of course he did not know then that lord aylwardfor i forgot to tell you he had become a lord somehowwas secretly one of the principal sellers let him deny it if he can at last the ottoman government through the english ambassador published its repudiation of the concession which it seems was a forgery actually executed or obtained in constantinople by my uncle well there was a fearful smash writs were taken out against my uncle but before they could be served he died suddenly of heart disease i was with him at the time and he kept saying he saw that gold mask which jeekie calls bonsa the thing you took back to africa he had a fine funeral for what he had done was not publicly known and when his will was opened i found that he had left me his fortune but made lord aylward there my trustee until i came to the full age of twentyfive under my fathers will alan dont force me to tell you what sort of a guardian he was to me also there was no fortune it had all gone also i had very very little left for almost all my own money had gone too in his despair he had forged papers to get it in order to support those sahara syndicate shares still i managed to borrow about Â£2000 from that little lawyer out of the Â£5000 that remain to me an independent sum which he was unable to touch and alan with it i came to find you  alan lord aylward followed me although everybody else was ruined he remained rich very very rich they say and his fancy was to marry me also i think it was not comfortable for him in england it is a long tale but i got up here with about fiveandtwenty servants and snell my maid whom you remember then we were both taken ill with some dreadful fever and had it not been for those good black people i should have died for i have been very sick alan but they nursed me and i recovered it was poor snell who died they buried her a few days ago i thought that she would live but she had a relapse next lord aylward appeared with twelve soldiers and some porters who i believe have run away nowoh you can guess you can guess he wanted my people to carry me away somewhere to the coast i suppose but they were faithful to me and would not then he set his soldiers on to maltreat them they shot several of them and flogged them on every opportunity they were flogging one of them just now i heard them well the poor men made me understand that they could bear it no longer and must do what he told them  and so alan as i was quite hopeless and helpless i made up my mind to kill myself hoping that god would forgive me and that i should find you somewhere perhaps after sleeping a while for it was better to die than to be given into the powerof that man i thought that he was coming for me just now and i was about to do it but it was you instead alan you and only just in time that is all the story and i hope you will not think that i have acted very foolishly but i did it for the best if you only knew what i have suffered alan what i have gone through in one way and another i am sure that you would not judge me harshly also i kept dreaming that you were in trouble and wanted me to come to you and of course i knew where you were gone and had that map send him away alan for i am still so weak and i cannot bear the sight of his face if you knew everything you would understand  alan turned on aylward and in a cold quiet voice asked him what he had to say to this story  i have to say major vernon that it is a clever mixture of truth and falsehood it is true that your cousin champershaswell has been proved guilty of some very shameful conduct for instance it appears that he did forge or rather cause to be forged that firman from the sultan although i knew nothing of this until it was publicly repudiated it is also true that fearing exposure he entirely lost his head and spent not only his own great fortune but that of miss champers also in trying to support sahara shares i admit also that i sold many hundreds of thousands of those shares in the ordinary way having made up my mind to retire from business when i was raised to the peerage i admit further what you knew before that i was attached to miss champers and wished to marry her why should i not especially as i had a good deal to offer to a lady who has been proved to be almost without fortune  for the rest she set out secretly on this mad journey to africa whither both my duty as her trustee and my affection prompted me to follow her i found her here recovering from an illness and since she has dwelt upon the point in selfdefence i must tell you that whatever has taken place between us has been with her full consent and encouragement of course i allude only to those affectionate amenities which are common between people who purpose to marry as soon as opportunity may offer  at this declaration poor barbara gasped and leaned back against her pillow alan stood silent though his lips turned white while jeekie thrust his big head through the tent opening and stared upwards  what are you looking at jeekie asked alan irritably  seem to want air major also look to see if clouds tumble believe partickler big lie do that sometimes please go on o good lord for jeekie want his breakfast  as regards the execution of two of miss champers bearers and the flogging of some others these punishments were inflicted for mutiny went on aylward it was obviously necessary that she should be moved back to the coast but i found out that they were trying to desert her in a body and to tamper with my own servants and so was obliged to take strong measures  sure those clouds come down now soliloquized jeekie or least something rummy happen  i have only to add major vernon that unless you make away with me first as i daresay you will as soon as we reach civilization again i shall proceed against you and this fellow for the coldblooded murder of my men in punishment of which i hope yet to live to see you hanged meanwhile i have much pleasure in releasing miss champers from her engagement to me which whatever she may have said to you in england she was glad enough to enter on here in africa a country of which i have been told the climate frequently deteriorates the moral character  hear hear ejaculated jeekie he say something true at last by accident i think like pig what find pearl in muckheap  hold your tongue jeekie said alan i do not intend to kill you lord aylward or to do you any harm  nor i neither broke in jeekie all i do to my lord just for my lords good who jeekie that he wish to hurt noble british ristocrat  but i do intend that it shall be impossible that miss champers should be forced to listen to more of your insults went on alan and to make sure that your gun does not go off again as it did this morning so lord aylward until we have settled what we are going to do i must keep you under arrest take him to his tent jeekie and put a guard over him  yes major certainly major right turn march my lord and quick please since poor common jeekie not want dirty his black finger touching you  aylward obeyed but at the door of the tent swung round and favoured alan with a very evil look  luck is with you for the moment major vernon he said but if you are wise you will remember that you never have been and never will be my match it will turn again i have no doubt and then you may look to yourself for i warn you i am a bad enemy  alan did not answer but for the first time barbara sprang to her feet and spoke  you mean that you are a bad man lord aylward and a coward too or otherwise you would not have tortured me as you have done well when it seemed impossible that i should escape from you except in one way i was saved by another way of which i never dreamed now i tell you that i do not fear you any more but i think she added slowly that you would do well to fear for yourself i dont know why but it comes into my mind that though neither alan nor i shall lift a finger against you you have a great deal of which to be afraid remember what i said to you months ago when you were angry because i would not marry you i believe it is all coming true lord aylward  then barbara turned her back upon him and that was the last time that either she or alan ever saw his face  he was gone and barbara her head upon her lovers shoulder and her sweet eyes filled with tears of joy and gratitude was beginning to tell him everything that had befallen her when suddenly they heard a loud cough outside the tent  its that confounded jeekie said alan and he called to him to come in  whats the matter now he asked crossly  breakfast major his lordship got plenty good stores borrow some from him and give him chit coming in one minutehot coffee kipper herring rasher bacon also butter best danish and bath oliver biscuit  very well said alan but jeekie did not move  very well repeated alan  no major not very well very ill thought those lies bring down clouds  what do you mean jeekie  mean major that asiki smelling about this camp porterman what go to fetch water see them also believe they catch rest of those soldier chaps and polish them for porterman hear the row  alan sprang up with an exclamation in his newfound joy he had forgotten all about the asiki  keep hair on major said jeekie cheerfully dont think they attack yet plenty of time for breakfast first when they come we make it very hot for them lots of rifle and cartridge now  cant we run away asked barbara  no missy cant run must stop here and do best camp well built open all round dont think they take it you leave everything to jeekie he see you through but praps you like come breakfast outside where you know all that go on  barbara did like but as it happened they were allowed to consume their meal in peace since no asiki appeared as soon as it was swallowed she returned to her tent while alan and jeekie set to work to strengthen the defences of the little camp as well as they were able and to make ready and serve out the arms and ammunition  about midday a man whom they had posted in a tree that grew inside the camp announced that he saw the enemy and next moment a company of them rushed towards them across the open and were greeted by a volley which killed and wounded several men at this exhibition of miraculous power for none of these soldiers had ever heard the report of firearms or seen their effect they retreated rapidly uttering shouts of dismay and carrying their dead and wounded with them  do you suppose they have gone jeekie asked alan anxiously  he shook his head  think not major think they frightened by big bullet magic and go consult priest also only a few of them here rest of army come later and try rush us tomorrow morning before dawn that asiki custom  then what shall we do jeekie run for it or stop here  think must stop here major if we bolt carrying miss barbara who cant walk much they follow on spoor and catch us best stick inside this fence and see what happen also once outside praps porters desert and leave us  so as there was nothing else to do they stayed labouring all day at the strengthening of their fortifications till at length the boma or fence of boughs supported by earth was so high and thick that while any were left to fire through the loopholes it would be very difficult to storm by men armed with spears  it was a dreadful and arduous day for alan who now had barbaras safety to think of barbara with whom as yet he had scarcely found time to exchange a word by sunset indeed he was so worn out with toil and anxiety that he could scarcely stand upon his feet jeekie who all that afternoon had been strangely quiet and reflective surveyed him critically then said  you have good drink and go sleep a bit major very good little shelter there by miss barbaras tent and you hold her hand if you like underneath the canvas which comforting and all correct jeekie never get tired he keep good lookout and let you know if anything happen and then you jump up quite fresh and fight like tomcat in corner  at first alan refused to listen but when barbara added her entreaties to those of jeekie he gave way and ten minutes later was as soundly asleep as he had ever been in his life  keep eye on him miss barbara and call me if he wake now i go give noble lord his supper and see that he quite comfortable jeekie seem very busy tonight just like when major have dinnerparty at yarleys and old cook get drunk in kitchen  if barbara could have followed jeekies movements for the next few hours she would probably have agreed that he was busy first he went to aylwards tent and as he had said he would gave him his supper and with it half a bottle of whisky from the stores which he had been carrying about with him for some time as he said to prevent the porters from getting at it aylward would drink little though as his arms were tied to the tentpole jeekie sat beside him and fed him like a baby conversing pleasantly with him all the while informing him amongst other things that he had better say big prayer because the asiki would probably cut his throat before morning  aylward who was in a state of sullen fury scarcely replied to this talk except to say that if so there was one comfort they would cut his and his masters also  yes my lord answered jeekie that quite true so drink to next meeting though i think you go different place to me and when you got tail and i wing you horn and i crown of glory of course we not talk much together and he held a mug of whisky and watera great deal of whisky and a very little waterto his prisoners mouth  aylward drained it feeling a need for stimulant  there said jeekie holding it upside down you drink every drop and not offer one to poor old jeekie well he turned teetotaller so no matter goodnight my lord i call you if asiki come  who are the asiki asked aylward drowsily  oh you want to know i tell you and he began a long rambling story  before he ever came to the end of it aylward had fallen on his side and was fast asleep  dear me said jeekie contemplating him that whisky very strong though bottle say same as they drink in house of common that whisky so strong i think i pour away rest of it and he did to the last drop even taking the trouble to wash out the bottle with water now you no tempt anyone he said addressing the said bottle with a very peculiar smile or if you tempt at least do no harmlike kiss down telephone then he laid down the bottle on its side and left the tent  outside of it three of the head porters who appeared to be friends of his were waiting for him and with these men he engaged in low and earnest conversation next after they had arrived at some agreement which they seemed to ratify by a curious oath that involved their crossing and clasping hands in an odd fashion and other symbols known to west african secret societies jeekie went the round of the camp to see that everyone was at his post then he did what most people would have thought a very curious and strange thing namely climbed the fence and vanished into the forest where presently a sound was heard as of an owl hooting  a little while later and another owl began to hoot in the distance whereat the three head porters nudged each other perhaps they had heard such owls hoot before at night and perhaps they knew that jeekie who had passed bonsa could only be harmed by the direct command of bonsa speaking through the mouth of the asika herself still they might have been interested in the nocturnal conversation of those two owls which as is common with such magical fowl in west africa had transformed themselves into human shapes the shape of jeekie and the shape of an asiki priest who was as it happened a blood relation of jeekie  very good brother said owl no 1 all you want is this white man whom the asika desires for a husband well i have done my best for him but i must think of myself and others and he goes to great happiness i have given him something to make him sleep do you come presently with eight men no more or we shall kill you to the fence of the camp and we will hand over the white man vernoon to you to take back to the asika who will give you a wonderful reward such a reward as you have never imagined now let me hear your word  then owl no 2 answered  brother i make the bargain on behalf of the army and swear to it by the double swimming head of bonsa we will come and take the white man vernoon who is to be mungana and carry him away in return we promise not to follow or molest you or any others in your camp indeed why should we who do not desire to be killed by the dreadful magic that you have a magic that makes a noise and pierces through our bodies from afar what were the words of the asika bring back vernoon or perish i care for nothing else bring back vernoon to be my husband  good said owl no 1 within the half of an hour vernoon shall be ready for you  good answered owl no 2 within half an hour eight of us will be without the east face of your camp to receive him  silently  silently my brother in bonsa if he cries out we will gag him fear not none shall know your part in this matter  good my brother in bonsa by the way how is big bonsa i fear that the white man vernoon hurt him very much and that is why i give him upbecause of his sacrilege  when i left the god was very sick and all the people mourned but doubtless he is immortal  doubtless he is immortal my brother a little hard magic in his stomachif he has onecannot hurt him farewell dear brother in bonsa i wish that i were you to get the great reward that the asika will give to you farewell farewell  then the two owls flitted apart again hooting as they went till they came to their respective camps    jeekie was in the tent performing a strange toilet upon the sleeping aylward by the light of a single candle from his pouch he produced the mask of linen painted with gold that alan used to be forced to wear and tied it securely over aylwards face murmuring  you always love gold my lord aylward and jeekie promise you see plenty of it now  then he proceeded to remove his coat his waistcoat his socks and his boots and to replace these articles of european attire by his own worn asiki sandals and his own dirty asiki robe  there he said think that do and he studied him by the light of the candle same height same colour hair same dirty clothes and as asiki never see majors face because he always wear mask in public like as two peas on shovel oh my jeekie clever chap jeekie devilish clever chap but when asika pull off that mask to give him true lover kiss oh my wonder that happen then think whole of bonsatown bust up think big waterfall run backwards think she not quite pleased think my good lord find himself in false position think jeekie glad to be on coast think he not go back to bonsatown no more oh my aunt no he stop in england and go church twice on sunday and pressing his big hands on the pit of his stomach he rocked and rolled in fierce silent laughter  then an owl hooted again immediately beneath the fence and jeekie blowing out the candle opened the flap of the tent and tapped the head porter who stood outside on the shoulder he crept in and between them they lifted the senseless aylward and bore him to the vshaped entrance of the boma which was immediately opposite to the tent and oddly enough half open here the two other porters with whom jeekie had performed some ceremony chanced to be on guard the rest of their company being stationed at a distance jeekie and the head porter went through the gap like men carrying a corpse to midnight burial and presently in the darkness without two owls began to hoot  now aylward was laid upon a litter that had been prepared and eight whiterobed asiki bearers stared at his gold mask in the faint starlight  i suppose he is not dead brother said owl no 2 doubtfully  nay brother said owl no 1 feel his heart and his pulse not dead only drunk he will wake up by daylight by which time you should be far upon your way be good and gentle to the white man vernoon who has been my master be careful too that he does not escape you brother for as you know he is very strong and cunning say to the asika that jeekie her servant makes his reverence to her and hopes that she will have many many happy years with the husband that he sends her also that she will remember him whom she called black dog in her prayers to the gods and spirits of our people  it shall be done brother but why do you not return with us  because brother i have ties across the black waterdear children almost whitewhom i love so much that i cannot leave them farewell brethren the blessings of the bonsas be on you and may you grow fat and prosper in the love and favour of our lady the asika  farewell they murmured in answer good fortune be your bedfellow  another minute and they had lifted up the litter and vanished at a swinging trot into the shadow of the trees jeekie returned to the camp and ordered the three men to restop the gateway with thorns muttering in their ears  remember brethren one word of this and you die all of you as those die who break the oath  have we not sworn they whispered as they went back to their posts  jeekie stood a while in front of the empty tent and if any had been there to note him they might have seen a shadow as of compunction creep over his powerful black face  when he wake up he wont know where he are he reflected and when he get to bonsatown hell wonder where he is and when he meet asika well he very big blackguard try to murder major whom jeekie nurse as baby the only thing that jeekie care forexceptjeekie try to make love to miss barbara against will when he catch her alone in forest which not playing game jeekie self not such big blackguard as that dirtborn noble lord jeekie never murder no onenot quite jeekie never make love to girl what not want himno need so many what do that he have to shove them off like good christian man mrs jeekie see to that while she live also better that mean white man go call on bonsas than major and missy barbara and all porters and jeekiespecially jeekieget throat cut no no jeekie nothing to be ashamed of jeekie do good days work though jeekie keep it tight as wax since white folk such silly people and when major in a rage he very nasty customer and see everything upside down now jeekie quite tired so say his prayers and have nap no think not in tent though very comfortable major might wake up poke his nose in there and if he see black face instead of white one ask ugly question which if jeekie half asleep he no able to answer nice and neat still he just arrange things a little so they look all right    chapter xx  the asikas message  dawn began to break in the forest and alan woke in his shelter and stretched himself he had slept soundly all the night so soundly that the innocent jeekie wondered much whether by any chance he also had taken a tot out of that particular whisky bottle as indeed he had recommended him to do people who drink whisky after long abstinence from spirits are apt to sleep long he reflected  alan crept out of the shelter and gazed affectionately at the tent in which barbara slumbered thank heaven she was safe so far as for some unknown reason evidently the asiki had postponed their attack just then a clamour arose in the air and he perceived jeekie striding towards him waving one arm in an excited fashion while with the other he dragged along the captain of the porters who appeared to be praying for mercy  here pretty go major he shouted devil and all to pay that my lord he gone and bolted this silly fool say that three hours ago he hear something break through fence and think it only hyÃ¦na what come to steal so take no notice well that hyÃ¦na you guess who he is you come look major you come look and then we tie this fellow up and flog him  alan ran to aylwards tent to find it empty  look said jeekie who had followed see how he do business that jolly clever hyÃ¦na and he pointed to a broken whisky bottle and some severed cords you see he manage break bottle and rub rope against cut glass till it come in two then he do hyÃ¦na dodge and hook it  alan inspected the articles nor did any shadow of doubt enter his mind  certainly he managed very well he said especially for a londonbred man but jeekie what can have been his object  oh who know major mind of man very strange and various thing praps he no bear to see you and miss barbara together praps he bolt coast get ear of local magistrate before you praps he sit up tree to shoot you praps nasty temper make him mad but he gone any way and i hope he no meet asiki poor fellow cause if so who know praps they knock him on head or if they think him you they make him prisoner and keep him quite long while before they let him go again  well said alan he has gone of his own free will so we have no responsibility in the matter and i cant pretend that i am sorry to see the last of him at any rate for the present let that poor beggar loose there seems to have been enough flogging in this place and after all he isnt much to blame  jeekie obeyed apparently with much reluctance and just then they saw one of their own people running towards the camp  fraid he going to tell us asiki come attack said jeekie shaking his head hope they give us time breakfast first  no doubt answered alan nervously for he feared the result of that attack  then the man arrived breathless and began to gasp out his news which filled alan with delight and caused a look of utter amazement to appear upon the broad face of jeekie it was to the effect that he had climbed a high tree as he had been bidden to do and from the top of that tree by the light of the first rays of the rising sun miles away on the plain beyond the forest he had seen the asiki army in full retreat  thank god exclaimed alan  yes major but that very rum story jeekie cant swallow it all at once must send out see none of them left behind praps they play trick but if they really gone spose it cause guns frightens them so much always think powder very great vention especially when enemy haint got none and quite sure of it now jeekie very very seldom wrong soon believe he added with a burst of confidence that jeekie never wrong at all he look for truth so long that at last he find it always    something more than a month had gone by and major and mrs vernon the latter fully restored to health and the most sweet and beautiful of brides stood upon the steamship benin and as the sun sank looked their last upon the coast of western africa  yes dear alan was saying to his wife from first to last it has been a very queer story but i really think that our getting that asiki gold after all was one of the queerest parts of it also uncommonly convenient as things have turned out  namely that you have got a little pauper for a wife instead of a great heiress alan but tell me again about the gold i have had so much to think of during the last few days and she blushed that i never quite took it all in  well love there isnt much to tell when that forwarding agent mr aston knew that we were in the town he came to me and said that he had about fifty cases full of something heavy as he supposed samples of ore addressed to me to your care in england which he was proposing to ship on by the benin i answered yes that was all right and did not undeceive him about their contents then i asked how they had arrived and if he had not received a letter with them he replied that one morning before the warehouse was open some natives had brought them down in a canoe and dumped them at the door telling the watchman that they had been paid to deliver them there by some other natives whom they met a long way up the river then they went away without leaving any letter or message well i thanked aston and paid his charges and theres an end of the matter those fiftythree cases are now in the hold invoiced as ore samples and as i inspected them myself and am sure that they have not been tampered with besides the value of the necklace the asika gave me weve got Â£100000 to begin our married life upon with something over for old jeekie and i daresay we shall do very well on that  yes alan very well indeed then she reflected a while for the mention of jeekies name seemed to have made her thoughtful and added alan what do you think became of lord aylward  i am sure i dont know jeekie and i and some of the porters went to see the old calabar officials and made affidavits as to the circumstances of his disappearance we couldnt do any more could we  no alan but do you think that jeekie quite understands the meaning of an oath i mean it seems so strange that we should never have found the slightest trace of him and alan i dont know if you noticed it but why did jeekie appear that morning wearing lord aylwards socks and boots  he ought to know all about oaths he has heard enough of them in magistrates courts but as regards the boots i am sure i cant say dear answered alan uneasily here he comes we will ask him and he did  sock and boot replied jeekie with a surprised air why mrs major if that good lord go mad and cut off into forest leaving them behind of course i put them on as they no more use to him and i just burn my dirty old asiki dress and sandal and got nothing to keep jigger out of toe dont you sit up here in this damp cold mrs major else you get more fever you go down and dress dinner which at halfpast six tonight i just come tell you that  so barbara went leaving the other two talking about various matters for they were alone together on the deck all the passengers of whom there were but few having gone below  the short african twilight had come a kind of soft blue haze that made the ship look mysterious and unnatural by degrees their conversation died away they lapsed into a silence which alan was the first to break  what are you thinking of jeekie he asked nervously  thinking of asika major he answered in a scared whisper seem to me that she about somewhere just as she use pop up in room in gold house seem to me i feel her all down my back likewise in head wool which stand up  its very odd jeekie replied alan but so do i  well major spect she thinking of us specially of you and just throw what she think at us like boy throw stones at bird what fly away out of cage asika do all that you know she not quite human full of plenty bonsa devil from genration to genrations amen praps she just find out something what make her mad  what could she find out after all this time jeekie  oh dont know how i know jeekie cant guess find out you marry miss barbara praps very sick that she lose you for this time praps kill herself that she keep near you praps while she wait till you come round again praps asika can do all these things if she like major  stuff and rubbish answered alan uneasily for jeekies suggestions were most uncomfortable i believe in none of your west coast superstitions  quite right major nor dont i only you member major what she show us there in treasureplacemr haswell being buried eh miss barbara in tent eh tother job what hasnt come off yet eh oh my golly major just you look behind you and say you see nothing please and the eyes of jeekie grew large as maltese oranges while with chattering teeth he pointed over the bulwark of the vessel  alan turned and saw  this was what he saw or seemed to see the figure of the asika in her robes and breastplate of gold standing upon the air just beyond the ship as though on it she might set no foot her waving black hair hung about her shoulders but the sharp wind did not seem to stir it nor did her white dress flutter and on her beautiful face was stamped a look of awful rage and agony the rage of betrayal the agony of loss in her right hand she held a knife and from a wound in her breast the red blood ran down her golden corselet she pointed to jeekie with the knife she opened her arms to alan as though in unutterable longing then slowly raised them upwards towards the fading glory of the sky aboveand was gone    jeekie sat down upon the deck mopping his brow with a red handkerchief while alan who felt faint clung to the bulwarks  tell you major that asika can do all that kind of thing never know where you find her next spect she come to live with us in england and just call in now and again when it dark tell you she very awkward customer think praps you done better stop there and marry her well she gone now thank heaven seem to drop in sea and hope she stay there  jeekie said alan recovering himself listen to me this is all infernal nonsense we have gone through a great deal and the nerves of both of us are overstrained we think we saw what we did not see and if you dare to say a single word of it to your mistress ill break your neck do you understand  yes major think so all fernal nonsense nerves strained didnt see what we see and say nothing of what did see to mrs major if either do say anything tother one break his neck that all right quite understand anything else major  yes jeekie we have had some wonderful adventures but they are past and done with and the less we talk or even think about them the better for there is a lot that would be rather difficult to explain and that if explained would scarcely be believed  yes major for instance very difficult explain mrs barbara how asika so fond of you if you only tell her go away go away all the time like old saintgentleman to pretty girl in picture praps she smell rat  stop your ribald talk said alan in a stern voice it would be better if instead of making jokes you gave thanks to providence for bringing both of us alive and well out of very dreadful dangers now i am going to dress for dinner and with an anxious glance seaward into the gathering darkness he turned and went    jeekie stood alone upon the empty deck wagging his great white head to and fro and soliloquizing thus  wonder if major see what under lady asikas feet when she stand out there over nasty deep think not or he say something that noble lord not look nice no private view for jeekie only free ticket and nothing to pay and me hope it no come back when i go to bed major know nothing about it so he not see but jeekie know a lot hope that aylward not write any letters home or if he write hope no one post them ghost bad enough but murder oh my  he paused a while then went on  jeekie do big sacrifice to bonsa when he reach yarleys get lamb in back kitchen at night or if ghost come any more calf in wood outside not steal it pay for it himself then think jeekie turn cathlic confess his sins they say them priest chaps not split and after they got his sins they tackle asika and bonsas too and he uttered a series of penitent groans turning slowly round and round to be sure that nothing was behind him  just then the full moon appeared out of a bank of clouds and as it rose higher flooding the world with light jeekies spirits rose also  asika never come in moonshine he said that not the game against rule and after all what jeekie done bad he very good fellow really aylward great villain serve him jolly well right if asika spiflicate him that not jeekies fault what jeekie do he do to save master and missus who he love care nothing for his self ready to die any day keep it dark to save them too cause they no like the story if once they know it always leave taste in mouth same as bad oyster also jeekie manage very well take major safe asikiland cause little bonsa make him give him very interesting time there get him plenty gold nurse him when he sick nobble mungana bring him out again find miss barbara catch hated rival and bamboozle all asiki army bring happy pair to coast and marry them arrange firstclass honeymoon on shipjeekie do all these things and lots more he could tell if he vain and not poor humble nigger  once more he paused a while lost in the contemplation of his own modesty and virtues then continued  this very ungrateful world major there he not say thank you jeekie jeekie you great wonderful man brave jeekie artful jeekie jeekie smart as paint who make all world believe just what he like and one too many for asika herself no no he say nothing like that he say thank provdence not jeekie as though provdence do all them things white folk think they clever but great fools really dont know nothing provdence all very well in his waypraps but provdence not a
