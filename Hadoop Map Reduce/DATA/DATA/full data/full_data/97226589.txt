the hunter hunted          the epilogue     chapter i  the strange mans arrival   the stranger came early in february one wintry day through a biting wind and a driving snow the last snowfall of the year over the down walking from bramblehurst railway station and carrying a little black portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand he was wrapped up from head to foot and the brim of his soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but the shiny tip of his nose the snow had piled itself against his shoulders and chest and added a white crest to the burden he carried he staggered into the coach and horses more dead than alive and flung his portmanteau down a fire he cried in the name of human charity a room and a fire he stamped and shook the snow from off himself in the bar and followed mrs hall into her guest parlour to strike his bargain and with that much introduction that and a couple of sovereigns flung upon the table he took up his quarters in the inn  mrs hall lit the fire and left him there while she went to prepare him a meal with her own hands a guest to stop at iping in the wintertime was an unheardof piece of luck let alone a guest who was no haggler and she was resolved to show herself worthy of her good fortune as soon as the bacon was well under way and millie her lymphatic maid had been brisked up a bit by a few deftly chosen expressions of contempt she carried the cloth plates and glasses into the parlour and began to lay them with the utmost eclat although the fire was burning up briskly she was surprised to see that her visitor still wore his hat and coat standing with his back to her and staring out of the window at the falling snow in the yard his gloved hands were clasped behind him and he seemed to be lost in thought she noticed that the melting snow that still sprinkled his shoulders dripped upon her carpet can i take your hat and coat sir she said and give them a good dry in the kitchen  no he said without turning  she was not sure she had heard him and was about to repeat her question  he turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder i prefer to keep them on he said with emphasis and she noticed that he wore big blue spectacles with sidelights and had a bush sidewhisker over his coatcollar that completely hid his cheeks and face  very well sir she said as you like in a bit the room will be warmer  he made no answer and had turned his face away from her again and mrs hall feeling that her conversational advances were illtimed laid the rest of the table things in a quick staccato and whisked out of the room when she returned he was still standing there like a man of stone his back hunched his collar turned up his dripping hatbrim turned down hiding his face and ears completely she put down the eggs and bacon with considerable emphasis and called rather than said to him your lunch is served sir  thank you he said at the same time and did not stir until she was closing the door then he swung round and approached the table with a certain eager quickness  as she went behind the bar to the kitchen she heard a sound repeated at regular intervals chirk chirk chirk it went the sound of a spoon being rapidly whisked round a basin that girl she said there i clean forgot it its her being so long and while she herself finished mixing the mustard she gave millie a few verbal stabs for her excessive slowness she had cooked the ham and eggs laid the table and done everything while millie help indeed had only succeeded in delaying the mustard and him a new guest and wanting to stay then she filled the mustard pot and putting it with a certain stateliness upon a gold and black teatray carried it into the parlour  she rapped and entered promptly as she did so her visitor moved quickly so that she got but a glimpse of a white object disappearing behind the table it would seem he was picking something from the floor she rapped down the mustard pot on the table and then she noticed the overcoat and hat had been taken off and put over a chair in front of the fire and a pair of wet boots threatened rust to her steel fender she went to these things resolutely i suppose i may have them to dry now she said in a voice that brooked no denial  leave the hat said her visitor in a muffled voice and turning she saw he had raised his head and was sitting and looking at her  for a moment she stood gaping at him too surprised to speak  he held a white clothit was a serviette he had brought with himover the lower part of his face so that his mouth and jaws were completely hidden and that was the reason of his muffled voice but it was not that which startled mrs hall it was the fact that all his forehead above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage and that another covered his ears leaving not a scrap of his face exposed excepting only his pink peaked nose it was bright pink and shiny just as it had been at first he wore a darkbrown velvet jacket with a high black linenlined collar turned up about his neck the thick black hair escaping as it could below and between the cross bandages projected in curious tails and horns giving him the strangest appearance conceivable this muffled and bandaged head was so unlike what she had anticipated that for a moment she was rigid  he did not remove the serviette but remained holding it as she saw now with a brown gloved hand and regarding her with his inscrutable blue glasses leave the hat he said speaking very distinctly through the white cloth  her nerves began to recover from the shock they had received she placed the hat on the chair again by the fire i didnt know sir she began that and she stopped embarrassed  thank you he said drily glancing from her to the door and then at her again  ill have them nicely dried sir at once she said and carried his clothes out of the room she glanced at his whiteswathed head and blue goggles again as she was going out of the door but his napkin was still in front of his face she shivered a little as she closed the door behind her and her face was eloquent of her surprise and perplexity i never she whispered there she went quite softly to the kitchen and was too preoccupied to ask millie what she was messing about with now when she got there  the visitor sat and listened to her retreating feet he glanced inquiringly at the window before he removed his serviette and resumed his meal he took a mouthful glanced suspiciously at the window took another mouthful then rose and taking the serviette in his hand walked across the room and pulled the blind down to the top of the white muslin that obscured the lower panes this left the room in a twilight this done he returned with an easier air to the table and his meal  the poor souls had an accident or an opration or somethin said mrs hall what a turn them bandages did give me to be sure  she put on some more coal unfolded the clotheshorse and extended the travellers coat upon this and they goggles why he looked more like a divin helmet than a human man she hung his muffler on a corner of the horse and holding that handkerchief over his mouth all the time talkin through it  perhaps his mouth was hurt toomaybe  she turned round as one who suddenly remembers bless my soul alive she said going off at a tangent aint you done them taters yet millie  when mrs hall went to clear away the strangers lunch her idea that his mouth must also have been cut or disfigured in the accident she supposed him to have suffered was confirmed for he was smoking a pipe and all the time that she was in the room he never loosened the silk muffler he had wrapped round the lower part of his face to put the mouthpiece to his lips yet it was not forgetfulness for she saw he glanced at it as it smouldered out he sat in the corner with his back to the windowblind and spoke now having eaten and drunk and being comfortably warmed through with less aggressive brevity than before the reflection of the fire lent a kind of red animation to his big spectacles they had lacked hitherto  i have some luggage he said at bramblehurst station and he asked her how he could have it sent he bowed his bandaged head quite politely in acknowledgment of her explanation tomorrow he said there is no speedier delivery and seemed quite disappointed when she answered no was she quite sure no man with a trap who would go over  mrs hall nothing loath answered his questions and developed a conversation its a steep road by the down sir she said in answer to the question about a trap and then snatching at an opening said it was there a carriage was upsettled a year ago and more a gentleman killed besides his coachman accidents sir happen in a moment dont they  but the visitor was not to be drawn so easily they do he said through his muffler eyeing her quietly through his impenetrable glasses  but they take long enough to get well dont they  there was my sisters son tom jest cut his arm with a scythe tumbled on it in the ayfield and bless me he was three months tied up sir youd hardly believe it its regular given me a dread of a scythe sir  i can quite understand that said the visitor  he was afraid one time that hed have to have an oprationhe was that bad sir  the visitor laughed abruptly a bark of a laugh that he seemed to bite and kill in his mouth was he he said  he was sir and no laughing matter to them as had the doing for him as i hadmy sister being took up with her little ones so much there was bandages to do sir and bandages to undo so that if i may make so bold as to say it sir  will you get me some matches said the visitor quite abruptly my pipe is out  mrs hall was pulled up suddenly it was certainly rude of him after telling him all she had done she gasped at him for a moment and remembered the two sovereigns she went for the matches  thanks he said concisely as she put them down and turned his shoulder upon her and stared out of the window again it was altogether too discouraging evidently he was sensitive on the topic of operations and bandages she did not make so bold as to say however after all but his snubbing way had irritated her and millie had a hot time of it that afternoon  the visitor remained in the parlour until four oclock without giving the ghost of an excuse for an intrusion for the most part he was quite still during that time it would seem he sat in the growing darkness smoking in the firelightperhaps dozing  once or twice a curious listener might have heard him at the coals and for the space of five minutes he was audible pacing the room he seemed to be talking to himself then the armchair creaked as he sat down again    chapter ii  mr teddy henfreys first impressions   at four oclock when it was fairly dark and mrs hall was screwing up her courage to go in and ask her visitor if he would take some tea teddy henfrey the clockjobber came into the bar my sakes mrs hall said he but this is terrible weather for thin boots the snow outside was falling faster  mrs hall agreed and then noticed he had his bag with him now youre here mr teddy said she id be glad if youd give th old clock in the parlour a bit of a look tis going and it strikes well and hearty but the hourhand wont do nuthin but point at six  and leading the way she went across to the parlour door and rapped and entered  her visitor she saw as she opened the door was seated in the armchair before the fire dozing it would seem with his bandaged head drooping on one side the only light in the room was the red glow from the firewhich lit his eyes like adverse railway signals but left his downcast face in darknessand the scanty vestiges of the day that came in through the open door everything was ruddy shadowy and indistinct to her the more so since she had just been lighting the bar lamp and her eyes were dazzled but for a second it seemed to her that the man she looked at had an enormous mouth wide opena vast and incredible mouth that swallowed the whole of the lower portion of his face it was the sensation of a moment the whitebound head the monstrous goggle eyes and this huge yawn below it then he stirred started up in his chair put up his hand she opened the door wide so that the room was lighter and she saw him more clearly with the muffler held up to his face just as she had seen him hold the serviette before the shadows she fancied had tricked her  would you mind sir this man acoming to look at the clock sir she said recovering from the momentary shock  look at the clock he said staring round in a drowsy manner and speaking over his hand and then getting more fully awake certainly  mrs hall went away to get a lamp and he rose and stretched himself then came the light and mr teddy henfrey entering was confronted by this bandaged person he was he says taken aback  good afternoon said the stranger regarding himas mr henfrey says with a vivid sense of the dark spectacleslike a lobster  i hope said mr henfrey that its no intrusion  none whatever said the stranger though i understand he said turning to mrs hall that this room is really to be mine for my own private use  i thought sir said mrs hall youd prefer the clock  certainly said the stranger certainlybut as a rule i like to be alone and undisturbed  but im really glad to have the clock seen to he said seeing a certain hesitation in mr henfreys manner very glad mr henfrey had intended to apologise and withdraw but this anticipation reassured him the stranger turned round with his back to the fireplace and put his hands behind his back and presently he said when the clockmending is over i think i should like to have some tea but not till the clockmending is over  mrs hall was about to leave the roomshe made no conversational advances this time because she did not want to be snubbed in front of mr henfreywhen her visitor asked her if she had made any arrangements about his boxes at bramblehurst she told him she had mentioned the matter to the postman and that the carrier could bring them over on the morrow you are certain that is the earliest he said  she was certain with a marked coldness  i should explain he added what i was really too cold and fatigued to do before that i am an experimental investigator  indeed sir said mrs hall much impressed  and my baggage contains apparatus and appliances  very useful things indeed they are sir said mrs hall  and im very naturally anxious to get on with my inquiries  of course sir  my reason for coming to iping he proceeded with a certain deliberation of manner was  a desire for solitude i do not wish to be disturbed in my work in addition to my work an accident  i thought as much said mrs hall to herself  necessitates a certain retirement my eyesare sometimes so weak and painful that i have to shut myself up in the dark for hours together lock myself up sometimesnow and then not at present certainly at such times the slightest disturbance the entry of a stranger into the room is a source of excruciating annoyance to meit is well these things should be understood  certainly sir said mrs hall and if i might make so bold as to ask  that i think is all said the stranger with that quietly irresistible air of finality he could assume at will mrs hall reserved her question and sympathy for a better occasion  after mrs hall had left the room he remained standing in front of the fire glaring so mr henfrey puts it at the clockmending mr henfrey not only took off the hands of the clock and the face but extracted the works and he tried to work in as slow and quiet and unassuming a manner as possible he worked with the lamp close to him and the green shade threw a brilliant light upon his hands and upon the frame and wheels and left the rest of the room shadowy when he looked up coloured patches swam in his eyes being constitutionally of a curious nature he had removed the worksa quite unnecessary proceedingwith the idea of delaying his departure and perhaps falling into conversation with the stranger but the stranger stood there perfectly silent and still so still it got on henfreys nerves he felt alone in the room and looked up and there grey and dim was the bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly with a mist of green spots drifting in front of them it was so uncanny to henfrey that for a minute they remained staring blankly at one another then henfrey looked down again very uncomfortable position one would like to say something should he remark that the weather was very cold for the time of year  he looked up as if to take aim with that introductory shot the weather he began  why dont you finish and go said the rigid figure evidently in a state of painfully suppressed rage all youve got to do is to fix the hourhand on its axle youre simply humbugging  certainly sirone minute more i overlooked and mr henfrey finished and went  but he went feeling excessively annoyed damn it said mr henfrey to himself trudging down the village through the thawing snow a man must do a clock at times surely  and again cant a man look at youugly  and yet again seemingly not if the police was wanting you you couldnt be more wropped and bandaged  at gleesons corner he saw hall who had recently married the strangers hostess at the coach and horses and who now drove the iping conveyance when occasional people required it to sidderbridge junction coming towards him on his return from that place hall had evidently been stopping a bit at sidderbridge to judge by his driving ow do teddy he said passing  you got a rum un up home said teddy  hall very sociably pulled up whats that he asked  rumlooking customer stopping at the coach and horses said teddy my sakes  and he proceeded to give hall a vivid description of his grotesque guest looks a bit like a disguise dont it id like to see a mans face if i had him stopping in my place said henfrey but women are that trustfulwhere strangers are concerned hes took your rooms and he aint even given a name hall  you dont say so said hall who was a man of sluggish apprehension  yes said teddy by the week whatever he is you cant get rid of him under the week and hes got a lot of luggage coming tomorrow so he says lets hope it wont be stones in boxes hall  he told hall how his aunt at hastings had been swindled by a stranger with empty portmanteaux altogether he left hall vaguely suspicious get up old girl said hall i spose i must see bout this  teddy trudged on his way with his mind considerably relieved  instead of seeing bout it however hall on his return was severely rated by his wife on the length of time he had spent in sidderbridge and his mild inquiries were answered snappishly and in a manner not to the point but the seed of suspicion teddy had sown germinated in the mind of mr hall in spite of these discouragements you wim dont know everything said mr hall resolved to ascertain more about the personality of his guest at the earliest possible opportunity and after the stranger had gone to bed which he did about halfpast nine mr hall went very aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard at his wifes furniture just to show that the stranger wasnt master there and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of mathematical computations the stranger had left when retiring for the night he instructed mrs hall to look very closely at the strangers luggage when it came next day  you mind your own business hall said mrs hall and ill mind mine  she was all the more inclined to snap at hall because the stranger was undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger and she was by no means assured about him in her own mind in the middle of the night she woke up dreaming of huge white heads like turnips that came trailing after her at the end of interminable necks and with vast black eyes but being a sensible woman she subdued her terrors and turned over and went to sleep again    chapter iii  the thousand and one bottles   so it was that on the twentyninth day of february at the beginning of the thaw this singular person fell out of infinity into iping village next day his luggage arrived through the slushand very remarkable luggage it was there were a couple of trunks indeed such as a rational man might need but in addition there were a box of booksbig fat books of which some were just in an incomprehensible handwritingand a dozen or more crates boxes and cases containing objects packed in straw as it seemed to hall tugging with a casual curiosity at the strawglass bottles the stranger muffled in hat coat gloves and wrapper came out impatiently to meet fearensides cart while hall was having a word or so of gossip preparatory to helping bring them in out he came not noticing fearensides dog who was sniffing in a dilettante spirit at halls legs come along with those boxes he said ive been waiting long enough  and he came down the steps towards the tail of the cart as if to lay hands on the smaller crate  no sooner had fearensides dog caught sight of him however than it began to bristle and growl savagely and when he rushed down the steps it gave an undecided hop and then sprang straight at his hand whup cried hall jumping back for he was no hero with dogs and fearenside howled lie down and snatched his whip  they saw the dogs teeth had slipped the hand heard a kick saw the dog execute a flanking jump and get home on the strangers leg and heard the rip of his trousering then the finer end of fearensides whip reached his property and the dog yelping with dismay retreated under the wheels of the waggon it was all the business of a swift halfminute no one spoke everyone shouted the stranger glanced swiftly at his torn glove and at his leg made as if he would stoop to the latter then turned and rushed swiftly up the steps into the inn they heard him go headlong across the passage and up the uncarpeted stairs to his bedroom  you brute you said fearenside climbing off the waggon with his whip in his hand while the dog watched him through the wheel come here said fearensideyoud better  hall had stood gaping he wuz bit said hall id better go and see to en and he trotted after the stranger he met mrs hall in the passage carriers darg he said bit en  he went straight upstairs and the strangers door being ajar he pushed it open and was entering without any ceremony being of a naturally sympathetic turn of mind  the blind was down and the room dim he caught a glimpse of a most singular thing what seemed a handless arm waving towards him and a face of three huge indeterminate spots on white very like the face of a pale pansy then he was struck violently in the chest hurled back and the door slammed in his face and locked it was so rapid that it gave him no time to observe a waving of indecipherable shapes a blow and a concussion there he stood on the dark little landing wondering what it might be that he had seen  a couple of minutes after he rejoined the little group that had formed outside the coach and horses there was fearenside telling about it all over again for the second time there was mrs hall saying his dog didnt have no business to bite her guests there was huxter the general dealer from over the road interrogative and sandy wadgers from the forge judicial besides women and children all of them saying fatuities wouldnt let en bite me i knows tasnt right have such dargs whad e bite n for then and so forth  mr hall staring at them from the steps and listening found it incredible that he had seen anything so very remarkable happen upstairs besides his vocabulary was altogether too limited to express his impressions  he dont want no help he says he said in answer to his wifes inquiry wed better be atakin of his luggage in  he ought to have it cauterised at once said mr huxter especially if its at all inflamed  id shoot en thats what id do said a lady in the group  suddenly the dog began growling again  come along cried an angry voice in the doorway and there stood the muffled stranger with his collar turned up and his hatbrim bent down the sooner you get those things in the better ill be pleased it is stated by an anonymous bystander that his trousers and gloves had been changed  was you hurt sir said fearenside im rare sorry the darg  not a bit said the stranger never broke the skin hurry up with those things  he then swore to himself so mr hall asserts  directly the first crate was in accordance with his directions carried into the parlour the stranger flung himself upon it with extraordinary eagerness and began to unpack it scattering the straw with an utter disregard of mrs halls carpet and from it he began to produce bottleslittle fat bottles containing powders small and slender bottles containing coloured and white fluids fluted blue bottles labeled poison bottles with round bodies and slender necks large greenglass bottles large whiteglass bottles bottles with glass stoppers and frosted labels bottles with fine corks bottles with bungs bottles with wooden caps wine bottles saladoil bottlesputting them in rows on the chiffonnier on the mantel on the table under the window round the floor on the bookshelfeverywhere the chemists shop in bramblehurst could not boast half so many quite a sight it was crate after crate yielded bottles until all six were empty and the table high with straw the only things that came out of these crates besides the bottles were a number of testtubes and a carefully packed balance  and directly the crates were unpacked the stranger went to the window and set to work not troubling in the least about the litter of straw the fire which had gone out the box of books outside nor for the trunks and other luggage that had gone upstairs  when mrs hall took his dinner in to him he was already so absorbed in his work pouring little drops out of the bottles into testtubes that he did not hear her until she had swept away the bulk of the straw and put the tray on the table with some little emphasis perhaps seeing the state that the floor was in then he half turned his head and immediately turned it away again but she saw he had removed his glasses they were beside him on the table and it seemed to her that his eye sockets were extraordinarily hollow he put on his spectacles again and then turned and faced her she was about to complain of the straw on the floor when he anticipated her  i wish you wouldnt come in without knocking he said in the tone of abnormal exasperation that seemed so characteristic of him  i knocked but seemingly  perhaps you did but in my investigationsmy really very urgent and necessary investigationsthe slightest disturbance the jar of a doori must ask you  certainly sir you can turn the lock if youre like that you know any time  a very good idea said the stranger  this stror sir if i might make so bold as to remark  dont if the straw makes trouble put it down in the bill and he mumbled at herwords suspiciously like curses  he was so odd standing there so aggressive and explosive bottle in one hand and testtube in the other that mrs hall was quite alarmed but she was a resolute woman in which case i should like to know sir what you consider  a shillingput down a shilling surely a shillings enough  so be it said mrs hall taking up the tablecloth and beginning to spread it over the table if youre satisfied of course  he turned and sat down with his coatcollar toward her  all the afternoon he worked with the door locked and as mrs hall testifies for the most part in silence but once there was a concussion and a sound of bottles ringing together as though the table had been hit and the smash of a bottle flung violently down and then a rapid pacing athwart the room fearing something was the matter she went to the door and listened not caring to knock  i cant go on he was raving i cant go on three hundred thousand four hundred thousand the huge multitude cheated all my life it may take me  patience patience indeed  fool fool  there was a noise of hobnails on the bricks in the bar and mrs hall had very reluctantly to leave the rest of his soliloquy when she returned the room was silent again save for the faint crepitation of his chair and the occasional clink of a bottle it was all over the stranger had resumed work  when she took in his tea she saw broken glass in the corner of the room under the concave mirror and a golden stain that had been carelessly wiped she called attention to it  put it down in the bill snapped her visitor for gods sake dont worry me if theres damage done put it down in the bill and he went on ticking a list in the exercise book before him  ill tell you something said fearenside mysteriously it was late in the afternoon and they were in the little beershop of iping hanger  well said teddy henfrey  this chap youre speaking of what my dog bit wellhes black leastways his legs are i seed through the tear of his trousers and the tear of his glove youd have expected a sort of pinky to show wouldnt you wellthere wasnt none just blackness i tell you hes as black as my hat  my sakes said henfrey its a rummy case altogether why his nose is as pink as paint  thats true said fearenside i knows that and i tell ee what im thinking that marns a piebald teddy black here and white therein patches and hes ashamed of it hes a kind of halfbreed and the colours come off patchy instead of mixing ive heard of such things before and its the common way with horses as any one can see    chapter iv  mr cuss interviews the stranger   i have told the circumstances of the strangers arrival in iping with a certain fulness of detail in order that the curious impression he created may be understood by the reader but excepting two odd incidents the circumstances of his stay until the extraordinary day of the club festival may be passed over very cursorily there were a number of skirmishes with mrs hall on matters of domestic discipline but in every case until late april when the first signs of penury began he overrode her by the easy expedient of an extra payment hall did not like him and whenever he dared he talked of the advisability of getting rid of him but he showed his dislike chiefly by concealing it ostentatiously and avoiding his visitor as much as possible wait till the summer said mrs hall sagely when the artisks are beginning to come then well see he may be a bit overbearing but bills settled punctual is bills settled punctual whatever youd like to say  the stranger did not go to church and indeed made no difference between sunday and the irreligious days even in costume he worked as mrs hall thought very fitfully some days he would come down early and be continuously busy on others he would rise late pace his room fretting audibly for hours together smoke sleep in the armchair by the fire communication with the world beyond the village he had none his temper continued very uncertain for the most part his manner was that of a man suffering under almost unendurable provocation and once or twice things were snapped torn crushed or broken in spasmodic gusts of violence he seemed under a chronic irritation of the greatest intensity his habit of talking to himself in a low voice grew steadily upon him but though mrs hall listened conscientiously she could make neither head nor tail of what she heard  he rarely went abroad by daylight but at twilight he would go out muffled up invisibly whether the weather were cold or not and he chose the loneliest paths and those most overshadowed by trees and banks his goggling spectacles and ghastly bandaged face under the penthouse of his hat came with a disagreeable suddenness out of the darkness upon one or two homegoing labourers and teddy henfrey tumbling out of the scarlet coat one night at halfpast nine was scared shamefully by the strangers skulllike head he was walking hat in hand lit by the sudden light of the opened inn door such children as saw him at nightfall dreamt of bogies and it seemed doubtful whether he disliked boys more than they disliked him or the reverse but there was certainly a vivid enough dislike on either side  it was inevitable that a person of so remarkable an appearance and bearing should form a frequent topic in such a village as iping opinion was greatly divided about his occupation mrs hall was sensitive on the point when questioned she explained very carefully that he was an experimental investigator going gingerly over the syllables as one who dreads pitfalls when asked what an experimental investigator was she would say with a touch of superiority that most educated people knew such things as that and would thus explain that he discovered things her visitor had had an accident she said which temporarily discoloured his face and hands and being of a sensitive disposition he was averse to any public notice of the fact  out of her hearing there was a view largely entertained that he was a criminal trying to escape from justice by wrapping himself up so as to conceal himself altogether from the eye of the police this idea sprang from the brain of mr teddy henfrey no crime of any magnitude dating from the middle or end of february was known to have occurred elaborated in the imagination of mr gould the probationary assistant in the national school this theory took the form that the stranger was an anarchist in disguise preparing explosives and he resolved to undertake such detective operations as his time permitted these consisted for the most part in looking very hard at the stranger whenever they met or in asking people who had never seen the stranger leading questions about him but he detected nothing  another school of opinion followed mr fearenside and either accepted the piebald view or some modification of it as for instance silas durgan who was heard to assert that if he chooses to show enself at fairs hed make his fortune in no time and being a bit of a theologian compared the stranger to the man with the one talent yet another view explained the entire matter by regarding the stranger as a harmless lunatic that had the advantage of accounting for everything straight away  between these main groups there were waverers and compromisers sussex folk have few superstitions and it was only after the events of early april that the thought of the supernatural was first whispered in the village even then it was only credited among the women folk  but whatever they thought of him people in iping on the whole agreed in disliking him his irritability though it might have been comprehensible to an urban brainworker was an amazing thing to these quiet sussex villagers the frantic gesticulations they surprised now and then the headlong pace after nightfall that swept him upon them round quiet corners the inhuman bludgeoning of all tentative advances of curiosity the taste for twilight that led to the closing of doors the pulling down of blinds the extinction of candles and lampswho could agree with such goings on they drew aside as he passed down the village and when he had gone by young humourists would up with coatcollars and down with hatbrims and go pacing nervously after him in imitation of his occult bearing there was a song popular at that time called the bogey man miss statchell sang it at the schoolroom concert in aid of the church lamps and thereafter whenever one or two of the villagers were gathered together and the stranger appeared a bar or so of this tune more or less sharp or flat was whistled in the midst of them also belated little children would call bogey man after him and make off tremulously elated  cuss the general practitioner was devoured by curiosity the bandages excited his professional interest the report of the thousand and one bottles aroused his jealous regard all through april and may he coveted an opportunity of talking to the stranger and at last towards whitsuntide he could stand it no longer but hit upon the subscriptionlist for a village nurse as an excuse he was surprised to find that mr hall did not know his guests name he give a name said mrs hallan assertion which was quite unfoundedbut i didnt rightly hear it she thought it seemed so silly not to know the mans name  cuss rapped at the parlour door and entered there was a fairly audible imprecation from within pardon my intrusion said cuss and then the door closed and cut mrs hall off from the rest of the conversation  she could hear the murmur of voices for the next ten minutes then a cry of surprise a stirring of feet a chair flung aside a bark of laughter quick steps to the door and cuss appeared his face white his eyes staring over his shoulder he left the door open behind him and without looking at her strode across the hall and went down the steps and she heard his feet hurrying along the road he carried his hat in his hand she stood behind the door looking at the open door of the parlour then she heard the stranger laughing quietly and then his footsteps came across the room she could not see his face where she stood the parlour door slammed and the place was silent again  cuss went straight up the village to bunting the vicar am i mad cuss began abruptly as he entered the shabby little study do i look like an insane person  whats happened said the vicar putting the ammonite on the loose sheets of his forthcoming sermon  that chap at the inn  well  give me something to drink said cuss and he sat down  when his nerves had been steadied by a glass of cheap sherrythe only drink the good vicar had availablehe told him of the interview he had just had went in he gasped and began to demand a subscription for that nurse fund hed stuck his hands in his pockets as i came in and he sat down lumpily in his chair sniffed i told him id heard he took an interest in scientific things he said yes sniffed again kept on sniffing all the time evidently recently caught an infernal cold no wonder wrapped up like that i developed the nurse idea and all the while kept my eyes open bottleschemicalseverywhere balance testtubes in stands and a smell ofevening primrose would he subscribe said hed consider it asked him pointblank was he researching said he was a long research got quite cross a damnable long research said he blowing the cork out so to speak oh said i and out came the grievance the man was just on the boil and my question boiled him over he had been given a prescription most valuable prescriptionwhat for he wouldnt say was it medical damn you what are you fishing after i apologised dignified sniff and cough he resumed hed read it five ingredients put it down turned his head draught of air from window lifted the paper swish rustle he was working in a room with an open fireplace he said saw a flicker and there was the prescription burning and lifting chimneyward rushed towards it just as it whisked up the chimney so just at that point to illustrate his story out came his arm  well  no handjust an empty sleeve lord i thought thats a deformity got a cork arm i suppose and has taken it off then i thought theres something odd in that what the devil keeps that sleeve up and open if theres nothing in it there was nothing in it i tell you nothing down it right down to the joint i could see right down it to the elbow and there was a glimmer of light shining through a tear of the cloth good god i said then he stopped stared at me with those black goggles of his and then at his sleeve  well  thats all he never said a word just glared and put his sleeve back in his pocket quickly i was saying said he that there was the prescription burning wasnt i interrogative cough how the devil said i can you move an empty sleeve like that empty sleeve yes said i an empty sleeve  its an empty sleeve is it you saw it was an empty sleeve he stood up right away i stood up too he came towards me in three very slow steps and stood quite close sniffed venomously i didnt flinch though im hanged if that bandaged knob of his and those blinkers arent enough to unnerve any one coming quietly up to you  you said it was an empty sleeve he said certainly i said at staring and saying nothing a barefaced man unspectacled starts scratch then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out of his pocket again and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to me again he did it very very slowly i looked at it seemed an age well said i clearing my throat theres nothing in it  had to say something i was beginning to feel frightened i could see right down it he extended it straight towards me slowly slowlyjust like thatuntil the cuff was six inches from my face queer thing to see an empty sleeve come at you like that and then  well  somethingexactly like a finger and thumb it feltnipped my nose  bunting began to laugh  there wasnt anything there said cuss his voice running up into a shriek at the there its all very well for you to laugh but i tell you i was so startled i hit his cuff hard and turned around and cut out of the roomi left him  cuss stopped there was no mistaking the sincerity of his panic he turned round in a helpless way and took a second glass of the excellent vicars very inferior sherry when i hit his cuff said cuss i tell you it felt exactly like hitting an arm and there wasnt an arm there wasnt the ghost of an arm  mr bunting thought it over he looked suspiciously at cuss its a most remarkable story he said he looked very wise and grave indeed its really said mr bunting with judicial emphasis a most remarkable story    chapter v  the burglary at the vicarage   the facts of the burglary at the vicarage came to us chiefly through the medium of the vicar and his wife it occurred in the small hours of whit monday the day devoted in iping to the club festivities mrs bunting it seems woke up suddenly in the stillness that comes before the dawn with the strong impression that the door of their bedroom had opened and closed she did not arouse her husband at first but sat up in bed listening she then distinctly heard the pad pad pad of bare feet coming out of the adjoining dressingroom and walking along the passage towards the staircase as soon as she felt assured of this she aroused the rev mr bunting as quietly as possible he did not strike a light but putting on his spectacles her dressinggown and his bath slippers he went out on the landing to listen he heard quite distinctly a fumbling going on at his study desk downstairs and then a violent sneeze  at that he returned to his bedroom armed himself with the most obvious weapon the poker and descended the staircase as noiselessly as possible mrs bunting came out on the landing  the hour was about four and the ultimate darkness of the night was past there was a faint shimmer of light in the hall but the study doorway yawned impenetrably black everything was still except the faint creaking of the stairs under mr buntings tread and the slight movements in the study then something snapped the drawer was opened and there was a rustle of papers then came an imprecation and a match was struck and the study was flooded with yellow light mr bunting was now in the hall and through the crack of the door he could see the desk and the open drawer and a candle burning on the desk but the robber he could not see he stood there in the hall undecided what to do and mrs bunting her face white and intent crept slowly downstairs after him one thing kept mr buntings courage the persuasion that this burglar was a resident in the village  they heard the chink of money and realised that the robber had found the housekeeping reserve of goldtwo pounds ten in half sovereigns altogether at that sound mr bunting was nerved to abrupt action gripping the poker firmly he rushed into the room closely followed by mrs bunting surrender cried mr bunting fiercely and then stooped amazed apparently the room was perfectly empty  yet their conviction that they had that very moment heard somebody moving in the room had amounted to a certainty for half a minute perhaps they stood gaping then mrs bunting went across the room and looked behind the screen while mr bunting by a kindred impulse peered under the desk then mrs bunting turned back the windowcurtains and mr bunting looked up the chimney and probed it with the poker then mrs bunting scrutinised the wastepaper basket and mr bunting opened the lid of the coalscuttle then they came to a stop and stood with eyes interrogating each other  i could have sworn said mr bunting  the candle said mr bunting who lit the candle  the drawer said mrs bunting and the moneys gone  she went hastily to the doorway  of all the strange occurrences  there was a violent sneeze in the passage they rushed out and as they did so the kitchen door slammed bring the candle said mr bunting and led the way they both heard a sound of bolts being hastily shot back  as he opened the kitchen door he saw through the scullery that the back door was just opening and the faint light of early dawn displayed the dark masses of the garden beyond he is certain that nothing went out of the door it opened stood open for a moment and then closed with a slam as it did so the candle mrs bunting was carrying from the study flickered and flared it was a minute or more before they entered the kitchen  the place was empty they refastened the back door examined the kitchen pantry and scullery thoroughly and at last went down into the cellar there was not a soul to be found in the house search as they would  daylight found the vicar and his wife a quaintlycostumed little couple still marvelling about on their own ground floor by the unnecessary light of a guttering candle    chapter vi  the furniture that went mad   now it happened that in the early hours of whit monday before millie was hunted out for the day mr hall and mrs hall both rose and went noiselessly down into the cellar their business there was of a private nature and had something to do with the specific gravity of their beer they had hardly entered the cellar when mrs hall found she had forgotten to bring down a bottle of sarsaparilla from their jointroom as she was the expert and principal operator in this affair hall very properly went upstairs for it  on the landing he was surprised to see that the strangers door was ajar he went on into his own room and found the bottle as he had been directed  but returning with the bottle he noticed that the bolts of the front door had been shot back that the door was in fact simply on the latch and with a flash of inspiration he connected this with the strangers room upstairs and the suggestions of mr teddy henfrey he distinctly remembered holding the candle while mrs hall shot these bolts overnight at the sight he stopped gaping then with the bottle still in his hand went upstairs again he rapped at the strangers door there was no answer he rapped again then pushed the door wide open and entered  it was as he expected the bed the room also was empty and what was stranger even to his heavy intelligence on the bedroom chair and along the rail of the bed were scattered the garments the only garments so far as he knew and the bandages of their guest his big slouch hat even was cocked jauntily over the bedpost  as hall stood there he heard his wifes voice coming out of the depth of the cellar with that rapid telescoping of the syllables and interrogative cocking up of the final words to a high note by which the west sussex villager is wont to indicate a brisk impatience george you gart whad a wand  at that he turned and hurried down to her janny he said over the rail of the cellar steps tas the truth what henfrey sez es not in uz room e ent and the front doors onbolted  at first mrs hall did not understand and as soon as she did she resolved to see the empty room for herself hall still holding the bottle went first if e ent there he said is close are and whats e doin ithout is close then tas a most curious business  as they came up the cellar steps they both it was afterwards ascertained fancied they heard the front door open and shut but seeing it closed and nothing there neither said a word to the other about it at the time mrs hall passed her husband in the passage and ran on first upstairs someone sneezed on the staircase hall following six steps behind thought that he heard her sneeze she going on first was under the impression that hall was sneezing she flung open the door and stood regarding the room of all the curious she said  she heard a sniff close behind her head as it seemed and turning was surprised to see hall a dozen feet off on the topmost stair but in another moment he was beside her she bent forward and put her hand on the pillow and then under the clothes  cold she said hes been up this hour or more  as she did so a most extraordinary thing happened the bedclothes gathered themselves together leapt up suddenly into a sort of peak and then jumped headlong over the bottom rail it was exactly as if a hand had clutched them in the centre and flung them aside immediately after the strangers hat hopped off the bedpost described a whirling flight in the air through the better part of a circle and then dashed straight at mrs halls face then as swiftly came the sponge from the washstand and then the chair flinging the strangers coat and trousers carelessly aside and laughing drily in a voice singularly like the strangers turned itself up with its four legs at mrs hall seemed to take aim at her for a moment and charged at her she screamed and turned and then the chair legs came gently but firmly against her back and impelled her and hall out of the room the door slammed violently and was locked the chair and bed seemed to be executing a dance of triumph for a moment and then abruptly everything was still  mrs hall was left almost in a fainting condition in mr halls arms on the landing it was with the greatest difficulty that mr hall and millie who had been roused by her scream of alarm succeeded in getting her downstairs and applying the restoratives customary in such cases  tas sperits said mrs hall i know tas sperits ive read in papers of en tables and chairs leaping and dancing  take a drop more janny said hall twill steady ye  lock him out said mrs hall dont let him come in again i half guessedi might ha known with them goggling eyes and bandaged head and never going to church of a sunday and all they bottlesmoren its right for any one to have hes put the sperits into the furniture my good old furniture twas in that very chair my poor dear mother used to sit when i was a little girl to think it should rise up against me now  just a drop more janny said hall your nerves is all upset  they sent millie across the street through the golden five oclock sunshine to rouse up mr sandy wadgers the blacksmith mr halls compliments and the furniture upstairs was behaving most extraordinary would mr wadgers come round he was a knowing man was mr wadgers and very resourceful he took quite a grave view of the case arm darmed if thet ent witchcraft was the view of mr sandy wadgers you warnt horseshoes for such gentry as he  he came round greatly concerned they wanted him to lead the way upstairs to the room but he didnt seem to be in any hurry he preferred to talk in the passage over the way huxters apprentice came out and began taking down the shutters of the tobacco window he was called over to join the discussion mr huxter naturally followed over in the course of a few minutes the anglosaxon genius for parliamentary government asserted itself there was a great deal of talk and no decisive action lets have the facts first insisted mr sandy wadgers lets be sure wed be acting perfectly right in bustin that there door open a door onbust is always open to bustin but ye cant onbust a door once youve busted en  and suddenly and most wonderfully the door of the room upstairs opened of its own accord and as they looked up in amazement they saw descending the stairs the muffled figure of the stranger staring more blackly and blankly than ever with those unreasonably large blue glass eyes of his he came down stiffly and slowly staring all the time he walked across the passage staring then stopped  look there he said and their eyes followed the direction of his gloved finger and saw a bottle of sarsaparilla hard by the cellar door then he entered the parlour and suddenly swiftly viciously slammed the door in their faces  not a word was spoken until the last echoes of the slam had died away they stared at one another well if that dont lick everything said mr wadgers and left the alternative unsaid  id go in and askn bout it said wadgers to mr hall id dmand an explanation  it took some time to bring the landladys husband up to that pitch at last he rapped opened the door and got as far as excuse me  go to the devil said the stranger in a tremendous voice and shut that door after you so that brief interview terminated    chapter vii  the unveiling of the stranger   the stranger went into the little parlour of the coach and horses about halfpast five in the morning and there he remained until near midday the blinds down the door shut and none after halls repulse venturing near him  all that time he must have fasted thrice he rang his bell the third time furiously and continuously but no one answered him him and his go to the devil indeed said mrs hall presently came an imperfect rumour of the burglary at the vicarage and two and two were put together hall assisted by wadgers went off to find mr shuckleforth the magistrate and take his advice no one ventured upstairs how the stranger occupied himself is unknown now and then he would stride violently up and down and twice came an outburst of curses a tearing of paper and a violent smashing of bottles  the little group of scared but curious people increased mrs huxter came over some gay young fellows resplendent in black readymade jackets and pique paper tiesfor it was whit mondayjoined the group with confused interrogations young archie harker distinguished himself by going up the yard and trying to peep under the windowblinds he could see nothing but gave reason for supposing that he did and others of the iping youth presently joined him  it was the finest of all possible whit mondays and down the village street stood a row of nearly a dozen booths a shooting gallery and on the grass by the forge were three yellow and chocolate waggons and some picturesque strangers of both sexes putting up a cocoanut shy the gentlemen wore blue jerseys the ladies white aprons and quite fashionable hats with heavy plumes wodger of the purple fawn and mr jaggers the cobbler who also sold old secondhand ordinary bicycles were stretching a string of unionjacks and royal ensigns which had originally celebrated the first victorian jubilee across the road  and inside in the artificial darkness of the parlour into which only one thin jet of sunlight penetrated the stranger hungry we must suppose and fearful hidden in his uncomfortable hot wrappings pored through his dark glasses upon his paper or chinked his dirty little bottles and occasionally swore savagely at the boys audible if invisible outside the windows in the corner by the fireplace lay the fragments of half a dozen smashed bottles and a pungent twang of chlorine tainted the air so much we know from what was heard at the time and from what was subsequently seen in the room  about noon he suddenly opened his parlour door and stood glaring fixedly at the three or four people in the bar mrs hall he said somebody went sheepishly and called for mrs hall  mrs hall appeared after an interval a little short of breath but all the fiercer for that hall was still out she had deliberated over this scene and she came holding a little tray with an unsettled bill upon it is it your bill youre wanting sir she said  why wasnt my breakfast laid why havent you prepared my meals and answered my bell do you think i live without eating  why isnt my bill paid said mrs hall thats what i want to know  i told you three days ago i was awaiting a remittance  i told you two days ago i wasnt going to await no remittances you cant grumble if your breakfast waits a bit if my bills been waiting these five days can you  the stranger swore briefly but vividly  nar nar from the bar  and id thank you kindly sir if youd keep your swearing to yourself sir said mrs hall  the stranger stood looking more like an angry divinghelmet than ever it was universally felt in the bar that mrs hall had the better of him his next words showed as much  look here my good woman he began  dont good woman me said mrs hall  ive told you my remittance hasnt come  remittance indeed said mrs hall  still i daresay in my pocket  you told me three days ago that you hadnt anything but a sovereigns worth of silver upon you  well ive found some more  ullo from the bar  i wonder where you found it said mrs hall  that seemed to annoy the stranger very much he stamped his foot what do you mean he said  that i wonder where you found it said mrs hall and before i take any bills or get any breakfasts or do any such things whatsoever you got to tell me one or two things i dont understand and what nobody dont understand and what everybody is very anxious to understand i want to know what you been doing tmy chair upstairs and i want to know how tis your room was empty and how you got in again them as stops in this house comes in by the doorsthats the rule of the house and that you didnt do and what i want to know is how you did come in and i want to know  suddenly the stranger raised his gloved hands clenched stamped his foot and said stop with such extraordinary violence that he silenced her instantly  you dont understand he said who i am or what i am ill show you by heaven ill show you then he put his open palm over his face and withdrew it the centre of his face became a black cavity here he said he stepped forward and handed mrs hall something which she staring at his metamorphosed face accepted automatically then when she saw what it was she screamed loudly dropped it and staggered back the noseit was the strangers nose pink and shiningrolled on the floor  then he removed his spectacles and everyone in the bar gasped he took off his hat and with a violent gesture tore at his whiskers and bandages for a moment they resisted him a flash of horrible anticipation passed through the bar oh my gard said some one then off they came  it was worse than anything mrs hall standing openmouthed and horrorstruck shrieked at what she saw and made for the door of the house everyone began to move they were prepared for scars disfigurements tangible horrors but nothing the bandages and false hair flew across the passage into the bar making a hobbledehoy jump to avoid them everyone tumbled on everyone else down the steps for the man who stood there shouting some incoherent explanation was a solid gesticulating figure up to the coatcollar of him and thennothingness no visible thing at all  people down the village heard shouts and shrieks and looking up the street saw the coach and horses violently firing out its humanity they saw mrs hall fall down and mr teddy henfrey jump to avoid tumbling over her and then they heard the frightful screams of millie who emerging suddenly from the kitchen at the noise of the tumult had come upon the headless stranger from behind these increased suddenly  forthwith everyone all down the street the sweetstuff seller cocoanut shy proprietor and his assistant the swing man little boys and girls rustic dandies smart wenches smocked elders and aproned gipsiesbegan running towards the inn and in a miraculously short space of time a crowd of perhaps forty people and rapidly increasing swayed and hooted and inquired and exclaimed and suggested in front of mrs halls establishment everyone seemed eager to talk at once and the result was babel a small group supported mrs hall who was picked up in a state of collapse there was a conference and the incredible evidence of a vociferous eyewitness o bogey whats he been doin then aint hurt the girl as e run at en with a knife i believe no ed i tell ye i dont mean no manner of speaking i mean marn ithout a ed narnsense tis some conjuring trick fetched off is wrapping e did  in its struggles to see in through the open door the crowd formed itself into a straggling wedge with the more adventurous apex nearest the inn he stood for a moment i heerd the gal scream and he turned i saw her skirts whisk and he went after her didnt take ten seconds back he comes with a knife in uz hand and a loaf stood just as if he was staring not a moment ago went in that there door i tell e e aint gart no ed at all you just missed en  there was a disturbance behind and the speaker stopped to step aside for a little procession that was marching very resolutely towards the house first mr hall very red and determined then mr bobby jaffers the village constable and then the wary mr wadgers they had come now armed with a warrant  people shouted conflicting information of the recent circumstances ed or no ed said jaffers i got to rest en and rest en i will  mr hall marched up the steps marched straight to the door of the parlour and flung it open constable he said do your duty  jaffers marched in hall next wadgers last they saw in the dim light the headless figure facing them with a gnawed crust of bread in one gloved hand and a chunk of cheese in the other  thats him said hall  what the devils this came in a tone of angry expostulation from above the collar of the figure  youre a damned rum customer mister said mr jaffers but ed or no ed the warrant says body and dutys duty  keep off said the figure starting back  abruptly he whipped down the bread and cheese and mr hall just grasped the knife on the table in time to save it off came the strangers left glove and was slapped in jaffers face in another moment jaffers cutting short some statement concerning a warrant had gripped him by the handless wrist and caught his invisible throat he got a sounding kick on the shin that made him shout but he kept his grip hall sent the knife sliding along the table to wadgers who acted as goalkeeper for the offensive so to speak and then stepped forward as jaffers and the stranger swayed and staggered towards him clutching and hitting in a chair stood in the way and went aside with a crash as they came down together  get the feet said jaffers between his teeth  mr hall endeavouring to act on instructions received a sounding kick in the ribs that disposed of him for a moment and mr wadgers seeing the decapitated stranger had rolled over and got the upper side of jaffers retreated towards the door knife in hand and so collided with mr huxter and the sidderbridge carter coming to the rescue of law and order at the same moment down came three or four bottles from the chiffonnier and shot a web of pungency into the air of the room  ill surrender cried the stranger though he had jaffers down and in another moment he stood up panting a strange figure headless and handlessfor he had pulled off his right glove now as well as his left its no good he said as if sobbing for breath  it was the strangest thing in the world to hear that voice coming as if out of empty space but the sussex peasants are perhaps the most matteroffact people under the sun jaffers got up also and produced a pair of handcuffs then he stared  i say said jaffers brought up short by a dim realization of the incongruity of the whole business darn it cant use em as i can see  the stranger ran his arm down his waistcoat and as if by a miracle the buttons to which his empty sleeve pointed became undone then he said something about his shin and stooped down he seemed to be fumbling with his shoes and socks  why said huxter suddenly thats not a man at all its just empty clothes look you can see down his collar and the linings of his clothes i could put my arm  he extended his hand it seemed to meet something in midair and he drew it back with a sharp exclamation i wish youd keep your fingers out of my eye said the aerial voice in a tone of savage expostulation the fact is im all herehead hands legs and all the rest of it but it happens im invisible its a confounded nuisance but i am thats no reason why i should be poked to pieces by every stupid bumpkin in iping is it  the suit of clothes now all unbuttoned and hanging loosely upon its unseen supports stood up arms akimbo  several other of the men folks had now entered the room so that it was closely crowded invisible eh said huxter ignoring the strangers abuse who ever heard the likes of that  its strange perhaps but its not a crime why am i assaulted by a policeman in this fashion  ah thats a different matter said jaffers no doubt you are a bit difficult to see in this light but i got a warrant and its all correct what im after aint no invisibilityits burglary theres a house been broke into and money took  well  and circumstances certainly point  stuff and nonsense said the invisible man  i hope so sir but ive got my instructions  well said the stranger ill come ill come but no handcuffs  its the regular thing said jaffers  no handcuffs stipulated the stranger  pardon me said jaffers  abruptly the figure sat down and before any one could realise was was being done the slippers socks and trousers had been kicked off under the table then he sprang up again and flung off his coat  here stop that said jaffers suddenly realising what was happening he gripped at the waistcoat it struggled and the shirt slipped out of it and left it limp and empty in his hand hold him said jaffers loudly once he gets the things off  hold him cried everyone and there was a rush at the fluttering white shirt which was now all that was visible of the stranger  the shirtsleeve planted a shrewd blow in halls face that stopped his openarmed advance and sent him backward into old toothsome the sexton and in another moment the garment was lifted up and became convulsed and vacantly flapping about the arms even as a shirt that is being thrust over a mans head jaffers clutched at it and only helped to pull it off he was struck in the mouth out of the air and incontinently threw his truncheon and smote teddy henfrey savagely upon the crown of his head  look out said everybody fencing at random and hitting at nothing hold him shut the door dont let him loose i got something here he is a perfect babel of noises they made everybody it seemed was being hit all at once and sandy wadgers knowing as ever and his wits sharpened by a frightful blow in the nose reopened the door and led the rout the others following incontinently were jammed for a moment in the corner by the doorway the hitting continued phipps the unitarian had a front tooth broken and henfrey was injured in the cartilage of his ear jaffers was struck under the jaw and turning caught at something that intervened between him and huxter in the melee and prevented their coming together he felt a muscular chest and in another moment the whole mass of struggling excited men shot out into the crowded hall  i got him shouted jaffers choking and reeling through them all and wrestling with purple face and swelling veins against his unseen enemy  men staggered right and left as the extraordinary conflict swayed swiftly towards the house door and went spinning down the halfdozen steps of the inn jaffers cried in a strangled voiceholding tight nevertheless and making play with his kneespun around and fell heavily undermost with his head on the gravel only then did his fingers relax  there were excited cries of hold him invisible and so forth and a young fellow a stranger in the place whose name did not come to light rushed in at once caught something missed his hold and fell over the constables prostrate body halfway across the road a woman screamed as something pushed by her a dog kicked apparently yelped and ran howling into huxters yard and with that the transit of the invisible man was accomplished for a space people stood amazed and gesticulating and then came panic and scattered them abroad through the village as a gust scatters dead leaves  but jaffers lay quite still face upward and knees bent at the foot of the steps of the inn    chapter viii  in transit   the eighth chapter is exceedingly brief and relates that gibbons the amateur naturalist of the district while lying out on the spacious open downs without a soul within a couple of miles of him as he thought and almost dozing heard close to him the sound as of a man coughing sneezing and then swearing savagely to himself and looking beheld nothing yet the voice was indisputable it continued to swear with that breadth and variety that distinguishes the swearing of a cultivated man it grew to a climax diminished again and died away in the distance going as it seemed to him in the direction of adderdean it lifted to a spasmodic sneeze and ended gibbons had heard nothing of the mornings occurrences but the phenomenon was so striking and disturbing that his philosophical tranquillity vanished he got up hastily and hurried down the steepness of the hill towards the village as fast as he could go    chapter ix  mr thomas marvel   you must picture mr thomas marvel as a person of copious flexible visage a nose of cylindrical protrusion a liquorish ample fluctuating mouth and a beard of bristling eccentricity his figure inclined to embonpoint his short limbs accentuated this inclination he wore a furry silk hat and the frequent substitution of twine and shoelaces for buttons apparent at critical points of his costume marked a man essentially bachelor  mr thomas marvel was sitting with his feet in a ditch by the roadside over the down towards adderdean about a mile and a half out of iping his feet save for socks of irregular openwork were bare his big toes were broad and pricked like the ears of a watchful dog in a leisurely mannerhe did everything in a leisurely mannerhe was contemplating trying on a pair of boots they were the soundest boots he had come across for a long time but too large for him whereas the ones he had were in dry weather a very comfortable fit but too thinsoled for damp mr thomas marvel hated roomy shoes but then he hated damp he had never properly thought out which he hated most and it was a pleasant day and there was nothing better to do so he put the four shoes in a graceful group on the turf and looked at them and seeing them there among the grass and springing agrimony it suddenly occurred to him that both pairs were exceedingly ugly to see he was not at all startled by a voice behind him  theyre boots anyhow said the voice  they arecharity boots said mr thomas marvel with his head on one side regarding them distastefully and which is the ugliest pair in the whole blessed universe im darned if i know  hm said the voice  ive worn worsein fact ive worn none but none so owdacious uglyif youll allow the expression ive been cadging bootsin particularfor days because i was sick of them theyre sound enough of course but a gentleman on tramp sees such a thundering lot of his boots and if youll believe me ive raised nothing in the whole blessed country try as i would but them look at em and a good country for boots too in a general way but its just my promiscuous luck ive got my boots in this country ten years or more and then they treat you like this  its a beast of a country said the voice and pigs for people  aint it said mr thomas marvel lord but them boots it beats it  he turned his head over his shoulder to the right to look at the boots of his interlocutor with a view to comparisons and lo where the boots of his interlocutor should have been were neither legs nor boots he was irradiated by the dawn of a great amazement where are yer said mr thomas marvel over his shoulder and coming on all fours he saw a stretch of empty downs with the wind swaying the remote greenpointed furze bushes  am i drunk said mr marvel have i had visions was i talking to myself what the  dont be alarmed said a voice  none of your ventriloquising me said mr thomas marvel rising sharply to his feet where are yer alarmed indeed  dont be alarmed repeated the voice  youll be alarmed in a minute you silly fool said mr thomas marvel where are yer lemme get my mark on yer  are yer buried said mr thomas marvel after an interval  there was no answer mr thomas marvel stood bootless and amazed his jacket nearly thrown off  peewit said a peewit very remote  peewit indeed said mr thomas marvel this aint no time for foolery the down was desolate east and west north and south the road with its shallow ditches and white bordering stakes ran smooth and empty north and south and save for that peewit the blue sky was empty too so help me said mr thomas marvel shuffling his coat on to his shoulders again its the drink i might ha known  its not the drink said the voice you keep your nerves steady  ow said mr marvel and his face grew white amidst its patches its the drink his lips repeated noiselessly he remained staring about him rotating slowly backwards i could have swore i heard a voice he whispered  of course you did  its there again said mr marvel closing his eyes and clasping his hand on his brow with a tragic gesture he was suddenly taken by the collar and shaken violently and left more dazed than ever dont be a fool said the voice  imoffmybloomingchump said mr marvel its no good its fretting about them blarsted boots im off my blessed blooming chump or its spirits  neither one thing nor the other said the voice listen  chump said mr marvel  one minute said the voice penetratingly tremulous with selfcontrol  well said mr thomas marvel with a strange feeling of having been dug in the chest by a finger  you think im just imagination just imagination  what else can you be said mr thomas marvel rubbing the back of his neck  very well said the voice in a tone of relief then im going to throw flints at you till you think differently  but where are yer  the voice made no answer whizz came a flint apparently out of the air and missed mr marvels shoulder by a hairsbreadth mr marvel turning saw a flint jerk up into the air trace a complicated path hang for a moment and then fling at his feet with almost invisible rapidity he was too amazed to dodge whizz it came and ricochetted from a bare toe into the ditch mr thomas marvel jumped a foot and howled aloud then he started to run tripped over an unseen obstacle and came head over heels into a sitting position  now said the voice as a third stone curved upward and hung in the air above the tramp am i imagination  mr marvel by way of reply struggled to his feet and was immediately rolled over again he lay quiet for a moment if you struggle any more said the voice i shall throw the flint at your head  its a fair do said mr thomas marvel sitting up taking his wounded toe in hand and fixing his eye on the third missile i dont understand it stones flinging themselves stones talking put yourself down rot away im done  the third flint fell  its very simple said the voice im an invisible man  tell us something i dont know said mr marvel gasping with pain where youve hidhow you do iti dont know im beat  thats all said the voice im invisible thats what i want you to understand

simple idea invisible  what real like  yes real  lets have a hand of you said marvel if you are real it wont be so darn outoftheway like thenlord he said how you made me jumpgripping me like that  he felt the hand that had closed round his wrist with his disengaged fingers and his fingers went timorously up the arm patted a muscular chest and explored a bearded face marvels face was astonishment  im dashed he said if this dont beat cockfighting most remarkableand there i can see a rabbit clean through you arf a mile away not a bit of you visibleexcept  he scrutinised the apparently empty space keenly you avent been eatin bread and cheese he asked holding the invisible arm  youre quite right and its not quite assimilated into the system  ah said mr marvel sort of ghostly though  of course all this isnt half so wonderful as you think  its quite wonderful enough for my modest wants said mr thomas marvel howjer manage it how the dooce is it done  its too long a story and besides  i tell

steady a bit and youve pretty near broken my toe its all so unreasonable empty downs empty sky nothing visible for miles except the bosom of nature and then comes a voice a voice out of heaven and stones and a fistlord  pull yourself together said the voice for you have to do the job ive chosen for you  mr marvel blew out his cheeks and his eyes were round  ive chosen you said the voice you are the only man except some of those fools down there who knows there is such a thing as an invisible man you have to be my helper help meand i will do great things for you an invisible man is a man of power he stopped for a moment to sneeze violently  but if you betray me he said if you fail to do as i direct you he paused and tapped mr marvels shoulder smartly mr marvel gave a yelp of terror at the touch i dont want to betray you said mr marvel edging away from the direction of the fingers dont you go athinking that whatever you do all i want to do is to help youjust tell me what i got to do lord whatever you want done that im most willing to do    chapter x  mr marvels visit to iping   after the first gusty panic had spent itself iping became argumentative scepticism suddenly reared its headrather nervous scepticism not at all assured of its back but scepticism nevertheless it is so much easier not to believe in an invisible man and those who had actually seen him dissolve into air or felt the strength of his arm could be counted on the fingers of two hands and of these witnesses mr wadgers was presently missing having retired impregnably behind the bolts and bars of his own house and jaffers was lying stunned in the parlour of the coach and horses great and strange ideas transcending experience often have less effect upon men and women than smaller more tangible considerations iping was gay with bunting and everybody was in gala dress whit monday had been looked forward to for a month or more by the afternoon even those who believed in the unseen were beginning to resume their little amusements in a tentative fashion on the supposition that he had quite gone away and with the sceptics he was already a jest but people sceptics and believers alike were remarkably sociable all that day  haysmans meadow was gay with a tent in which mrs bunting and other ladies were preparing tea while without the sundayschool children ran races and played games under the noisy guidance of the curate and the misses cuss and sackbut no doubt there was a slight uneasiness in the air but people for the most part had the sense to conceal whatever imaginative qualms they experienced on the village green an inclined strong rope down which clinging the while to a pulleyswung handle one could be hurled violently against a sack at the other end came in for considerable favour among the adolescents as also did the swings and the cocoanut shies there was also promenading and the steam organ attached to a small roundabout filled the air with a pungent flavour of oil and with equally pungent music members of the club who had attended church in the morning were splendid in badges of pink and green and some of the gayerminded had also adorned their bowler hats with brilliantcoloured favours of ribbon old fletcher whose conceptions of holidaymaking were severe was visible through the jasmine about his window or through the open door whichever way you chose to look poised delicately on a plank supported on two chairs and whitewashing the ceiling of his front room  about four oclock a stranger entered the village from the direction of the downs he was a short stout person in an extraordinarily shabby top hat and he appeared to be very much out of breath his cheeks were alternately limp and tightly puffed his mottled face was apprehensive and he moved with a sort of reluctant alacrity he turned the corner of the church and directed his way to the coach and horses among others old fletcher remembers seeing him and indeed the old gentleman was so struck by his peculiar agitation that he inadvertently allowed a quantity of whitewash to run down the brush into the sleeve of his coat while regarding him  this stranger to the perceptions of the proprietor of the cocoanut shy appeared to be talking to himself and mr huxter remarked the same thing he stopped at the foot of the coach and horses steps and according to mr huxter appeared to undergo a severe internal struggle before he could induce himself to enter the house finally he marched up the steps and was seen by mr huxter to turn to the left and open the door of the parlour mr huxter heard voices from within the room and from the bar apprising the man of his error that rooms private said hall and the stranger shut the door clumsily and went into the bar  in the course of a few minutes he reappeared wiping his lips with the back of his hand with an air of quiet satisfaction that somehow impressed mr huxter as assumed he stood looking about him for some moments and then mr huxter saw him walk in an oddly furtive manner towards the gates of the yard upon which the parlour window opened the stranger after some hesitation leant against one of the gateposts produced a short clay pipe and prepared to fill it his fingers trembled while doing so he lit it clumsily and folding his arms began to smoke in a languid attitude an attitude which his occasional glances up the yard altogether belied  all this mr huxter saw over the canisters of the tobacco window and the singularity of the mans behaviour prompted him to maintain his observation  presently the stranger stood up abruptly and put his pipe in his pocket then he vanished into the yard forthwith mr huxter conceiving he was witness of some petty larceny leapt round his counter and ran out into the road to intercept the thief as he did so mr marvel reappeared his hat askew a big bundle in a blue tablecloth in one hand and three books tied togetheras it proved afterwards with the vicars bracesin the other directly he saw huxter he gave a sort of gasp and turning sharply to the left began to run stop thief cried huxter and set off after him mr huxters sensations were vivid but brief he saw the man just before him and spurting briskly for the church corner and the hill road he saw the village flags and festivities beyond and a face or so turned towards him he bawled stop again he had hardly gone ten strides before his shin was caught in some mysterious fashion and he was no longer running but flying with inconceivable rapidity through the air he saw the ground suddenly close to his face the world seemed to splash into a million whirling specks of light and subsequent proceedings interested him no more    chapter xi  in the coach and horses   now in order clearly to understand what had happened in the inn it is necessary to go back to the moment when mr marvel first came into view of mr huxters window  at that precise moment mr cuss and mr bunting were in the parlour they were seriously investigating the strange occurrences of the morning and were with mr halls permission making a thorough examination of the invisible mans belongings jaffers had partially recovered from his fall and had gone home in the charge of his sympathetic friends the strangers scattered garments had been removed by mrs hall and the room tidied up and on the table under the window where the stranger had been wont to work cuss had hit almost at once on three big books in manuscript labelled diary  diary said cuss putting the three books on the table now at any rate we shall learn something the vicar stood with his hands on the table  diary repeated cuss sitting down putting two volumes to support the third and opening it hmno name on the flyleaf bothercypher and figures  the vicar came round to look over his shoulder  cuss turned the pages over with a face suddenly disappointed imdear me its all cypher bunting  there are no diagrams asked mr bunting no illustrations throwing light  see for yourself said mr cuss some of its mathematical and some of its russian or some such language to judge by the letters and some of its greek now the greek i thought you  of course said mr bunting taking out and wiping his spectacles and feeling suddenly very uncomfortablefor he had no greek left in his mind worth talking about yesthe greek of course may furnish a clue  ill find you a place  id rather glance through the volumes first said mr bunting still wiping a general impression first cuss and then you know we can go looking for clues  he coughed put on his glasses arranged them fastidiously coughed again and wished something would happen to avert the seemingly inevitable exposure then he took the volume cuss handed him in a leisurely manner and then something did happen  the door opened suddenly  both gentlemen started violently looked round and were relieved to see a sporadically rosy face beneath a furry silk hat tap asked the face and stood staring  no said both gentlemen at once  over the other side my man said mr bunting and please shut that door said mr cuss irritably  all right said the intruder as it seemed in a low voice curiously different from the huskiness of its first inquiry right you are said the intruder in the former voice stand clear and he vanished and closed the door  a sailor i should judge said mr bunting amusing fellows they are stand clear indeed a nautical term referring to his getting back out of the room i suppose  i daresay so said cuss my nerves are all loose today it quite made me jumpthe door opening like that  mr bunting smiled as if he had not jumped and now he said with a sigh these books  someone sniffed as he did so  one thing is indisputable said bunting drawing up a chair next to that of cuss there certainly have been very strange things happen in iping during the last few daysvery strange i cannot of course believe in this absurd invisibility story  its incredible said cussincredible but the fact remains that i sawi certainly saw right down his sleeve  but did youare you sure suppose a mirror for instance hallucinations are so easily produced i dont know if you have ever seen a really good conjuror  i wont argue again said cuss weve thrashed that out bunting and just now theres these booksah heres some of what i take to be greek greek letters certainly  he pointed to the middle of the page mr bunting flushed slightly and brought his face nearer apparently finding some difficulty with his glasses suddenly he became aware of a strange feeling at the nape of his neck he tried to raise his head and encountered an immovable resistance the feeling was a curious pressure the grip of a heavy firm hand and it bore his chin irresistibly to the table dont move little men whispered a voice or ill brain you both he looked into the face of cuss close to his own and each saw a horrified reflection of his own sickly astonishment  im sorry to handle you so roughly said the voice but its unavoidable  since when did you learn to pry into an investigators private memoranda said the voice and two chins struck the table simultaneously and two sets of teeth rattled  since when did you learn to invade the private rooms of a man in misfortune and the concussion was repeated  where have they put my clothes  listen said the voice the windows are fastened and ive taken the key out of the door i am a fairly strong man and i have the poker handybesides being invisible theres not the slightest doubt that i could kill you both and get away quite easily if i wanted todo you understand very well if i let you go will you promise not to try any nonsense and do what i tell you  the vicar and the doctor looked at one another and the doctor pulled a face yes said mr bunting and the doctor repeated it then the pressure on the necks relaxed and the doctor and the vicar sat up both very red in the face and wriggling their heads  please keep sitting where you are said the invisible man heres the poker you see  when i came into this room continued the invisible man after presenting the poker to the tip of the nose of each of his visitors i did not expect to find it occupied and i expected to find in addition to my books of memoranda an outfit of clothing where is it nodont rise i can see its gone now just at present though the days are quite warm enough for an invisible man to run about stark the evenings are quite chilly i want clothingand other accommodation and i must also have those three books    chapter xii  the invisible man loses his temper   it is unavoidable that at this point the narrative should break off again for a certain very painful reason that will presently be apparent while these things were going on in the parlour and while mr huxter was watching mr marvel smoking his pipe against the gate not a dozen yards away were mr hall and teddy henfrey discussing in a state of cloudy puzzlement the one iping topic  suddenly there came a violent thud against the door of the parlour a sharp cry and thensilence  hullo said teddy henfrey  hullo from the tap  mr hall took things in slowly but surely that aint right he said and came round from behind the bar towards the parlour door  he and teddy approached the door together with intent faces their eyes considered summat wrong said hall and henfrey nodded agreement whiffs of an unpleasant chemical odour met them and there was a muffled sound of conversation very rapid and subdued  you all right thur asked hall rapping  the muttered conversation ceased abruptly for a moment silence then the conversation was resumed in hissing whispers then a sharp cry of no no you dont there came a sudden motion and the oversetting of a chair a brief struggle silence again  what the dooce exclaimed henfrey sotto voce  youallright thur asked mr hall sharply again  the vicars voice answered with a curious jerking intonation quite riright please dontinterrupt  odd said mr henfrey  odd said mr hall  says dont interrupt said henfrey  i heerdn said hall  and a sniff said henfrey  they remained listening the conversation was rapid and subdued i cant said mr bunting his voice rising i tell you sir i will not  what was that asked henfrey  says he wi nart said hall warnt speaking to us wuz he  disgraceful said mr bunting within  disgraceful said mr henfrey i heard itdistinct  whos that speaking now asked henfrey  mr cuss i spose said hall can you hearanything  silence the sounds within indistinct and perplexing  sounds like throwing the tablecloth about said hall  mrs hall appeared behind the bar hall made gestures of silence and invitation this aroused mrs halls wifely opposition what yer listenin there for hall she asked aint you nothin better to dobusy day like this  hall tried to convey everything by grimaces and dumb show but mrs hall was obdurate she raised her voice so hall and henfrey rather crestfallen tiptoed back to the bar gesticulating to explain to her  at first she refused to see anything in what they had heard at all then she insisted on hall keeping silence while henfrey told her his story she was inclined to think the whole business nonsenseperhaps they were just moving the furniture about i heerdn say disgraceful that i did said hall  i heerd that mrs hall said henfrey  like as not began mrs hall  hsh said mr teddy henfrey didnt i hear the window  what window asked mrs hall  parlour window said henfrey  everyone stood listening intently mrs halls eyes directed straight before her saw without seeing the brilliant oblong of the inn door the road white and vivid and huxters shopfront blistering in the june sun abruptly huxters door opened and huxter appeared eyes staring with excitement arms gesticulating yap cried huxter stop thief and he ran obliquely across the oblong towards the yard gates and vanished  simultaneously came a tumult from the parlour and a sound of windows being closed  hall henfrey and the human contents of the tap rushed out at once pellmell into the street they saw someone whisk round the corner towards the road and mr huxter executing a complicated leap in the air that ended on his face and shoulder down the street people were standing astonished or running towards them  mr huxter was stunned henfrey stopped to discover this but hall and the two labourers from the tap rushed at once to the corner shouting incoherent things and saw mr marvel vanishing by the corner of the church wall they appear to have jumped to the impossible conclusion that this was the invisible man suddenly become visible and set off at once along the lane in pursuit but hall had hardly run a dozen yards before he gave a loud shout of astonishment and went flying headlong sideways clutching one of the labourers and bringing him to the ground he had been charged just as one charges a man at football the second labourer came round in a circle stared and conceiving that hall had tumbled over of his own accord turned to resume the pursuit only to be tripped by the ankle just as huxter had been then as the first labourer struggled to his feet he was kicked sideways by a blow that might have felled an ox  as he went down the rush from the direction of the village green came round the corner the first to appear was the proprietor of the cocoanut shy a burly man in a blue jersey he was astonished to see the lane empty save for three men sprawling absurdly on the ground and then something happened to his rearmost foot and he went headlong and rolled sideways just in time to graze the feet of his brother and partner following headlong the two were then kicked knelt on fallen over and cursed by quite a number of overhasty people  now when hall and henfrey and the labourers ran out of the house mrs hall who had been disciplined by years of experience remained in the bar next the till and suddenly the parlour door was opened and mr cuss appeared and without glancing at her rushed at once down the steps toward the corner hold him he cried dont let him drop that parcel  he knew nothing of the existence of marvel for the invisible man had handed over the books and bundle in the yard the face of mr cuss was angry and resolute but his costume was defective a sort of limp white kilt that could only have passed muster in greece hold him he bawled hes got my trousers and every stitch of the vicars clothes  tend to him in a minute he cried to henfrey as he passed the prostrate huxter and coming round the corner to join the tumult was promptly knocked off his feet into an indecorous sprawl somebody in full flight trod heavily on his finger he yelled struggled to regain his feet was knocked against and thrown on all fours again and became aware that he was involved not in a capture but a rout everyone was running back to the village he rose again and was hit severely behind the ear he staggered and set off back to the coach and horses forthwith leaping over the deserted huxter who was now sitting up on his way  behind him as he was halfway up the inn steps he heard a sudden yell of rage rising sharply out of the confusion of cries and a sounding smack in someones face he recognised the voice as that of the invisible man and the note was that of a man suddenly infuriated by a painful blow  in another moment mr cuss was back in the parlour hes coming back bunting he said rushing in save yourself  mr bunting was standing in the window engaged in an attempt to clothe himself in the hearthrug and a west surrey gazette whos coming he said so startled that his costume narrowly escaped disintegration  invisible man said cuss and rushed on to the window wed better clear out from here hes fighting mad mad  in another moment he was out in the yard  good heavens said mr bunting hesitating between two horrible alternatives he heard a frightful struggle in the passage of the inn and his decision was made he clambered out of the window adjusted his costume hastily and fled up the village as fast as his fat little legs would carry him  from the moment when the invisible man screamed with rage and mr bunting made his memorable flight up the village it became impossible to give a consecutive account of affairs in iping possibly the invisible mans original intention was simply to cover marvels retreat with the clothes and books but his temper at no time very good seems to have gone completely at some chance blow and forthwith he set to smiting and overthrowing for the mere satisfaction of hurting  you must figure the street full of running figures of doors slamming and fights for hidingplaces you must figure the tumult suddenly striking on the unstable equilibrium of old fletchers planks and two chairswith cataclysmic results you must figure an appalled couple caught dismally in a swing and then the whole tumultuous rush has passed and the iping street with its gauds and flags is deserted save for the still raging unseen and littered with cocoanuts overthrown canvas screens and the scattered stock in trade of a sweetstuff stall everywhere there is a sound of closing shutters and shoving bolts and the only visible humanity is an occasional flitting eye under a raised eyebrow in the corner of a window pane  the invisible man amused himself for a little while by breaking all the windows in the coach and horses and then he thrust a street lamp through the parlour window of mrs gribble he it must have been who cut the telegraph wire to adderdean just beyond higgins cottage on the adderdean road and after that as his peculiar qualities allowed he passed out of human perceptions altogether and he was neither heard seen nor felt in iping any more he vanished absolutely  but it was the best part of two hours before any human being ventured out again into the desolation of iping street    chapter xiii  mr marvel discusses his resignation   when the dusk was gathering and iping was just beginning to peep timorously forth again upon the shattered wreckage of its bank holiday a short thickset man in a shabby silk hat was marching painfully through the twilight behind the beechwoods on the road to bramblehurst he carried three books bound together by some sort of ornamental elastic ligature and a bundle wrapped in a blue tablecloth his rubicund face expressed consternation and fatigue he appeared to be in a spasmodic sort of hurry he was accompanied by a voice other than his own and ever and again he winced under the touch of unseen hands  if you give me the slip again said the voice if you attempt to give me the slip again  lord said mr marvel that shoulders a mass of bruises as it is  on my honour said the voice i will kill you  i didnt try to give you the slip said marvel in a voice that was not far remote from tears i swear i didnt i didnt know the blessed turning that was all how the devil was i to know the blessed turning as it is ive been knocked about  youll get knocked about a great deal more if you dont mind said the voice and mr marvel abruptly became silent he blew out his cheeks and his eyes were eloquent of despair  its bad enough to let these floundering yokels explode my little secret without your cutting off with my books its lucky for some of them they cut and ran when they did here am i  no one knew i was invisible and now what am i to do  what am i to do asked marvel sotto voce  its all about it will be in the papers everybody will be looking for me everyone on their guard the voice broke off into vivid curses and ceased  the despair of mr marvels face deepened and his pace slackened  go on said the voice  mr marvels face assumed a greyish tint between the ruddier patches  dont drop those books stupid said the voice sharplyovertaking him  the fact is said the voice i shall have to make use of you youre a poor tool but i must  im a miserable tool said marvel  you are said the voice  im the worst possible tool you could have said marvel  im not strong he said after a discouraging silence  im not over strong he repeated  no  and my hearts weak that little businessi pulled it through of coursebut bless you i could have dropped  well  i havent the nerve and strength for the sort of thing you want  ill stimulate you  i wish you wouldnt i wouldnt like to mess up your plans you know but i mightout of sheer funk and misery  youd better not said the voice with quiet emphasis  i wish i was dead said marvel  it aint justice he said you must admit it seems to me ive a perfect right  get on said the voice  mr marvel mended his pace and for a time they went in silence again  its devilish hard said mr marvel  this was quite ineffectual he tried another tack  what do i make by it he began again in a tone of unendurable wrong  oh shut up said the voice with sudden amazing vigour ill see to you all right you do what youre told youll do it all right youre a fool and all that but youll do  i tell you sir im not the man for it respectfullybut it is so  if you dont shut up i shall twist your wrist again said the invisible man i want to think  presently two oblongs of yellow light appeared through the trees and the square tower of a church loomed through the gloaming i shall keep my hand on your shoulder said the voice all through the village go straight through and try no foolery it will be the worse for you if you do  i know that sighed mr marvel i know all that  the unhappylooking figure in the obsolete silk hat passed up the street of the little village with his burdens and vanished into the gathering darkness beyond the lights of the windows    chapter xiv  at port stowe   ten oclock the next morning found mr marvel unshaven dirty and travelstained sitting with the books beside him and his hands deep in his pockets looking very weary nervous and uncomfortable and inflating his cheeks at infrequent intervals on the bench outside a little inn on the outskirts of port stowe beside him were the books but now they were tied with string the bundle had been abandoned in the pinewoods beyond bramblehurst in accordance with a change in the plans of the invisible man mr marvel sat on the bench and although no one took the slightest notice of him his agitation remained at fever heat his hands would go ever and again to his various pockets with a curious nervous fumbling  when he had been sitting for the best part of an hour however an elderly mariner carrying a newspaper came out of the inn and sat down beside him pleasant day said the mariner  mr marvel glanced about him with something very like terror very he said  just seasonable weather for the time of year said the mariner taking no denial  quite said mr marvel  the mariner produced a toothpick and saving his regard was engrossed thereby for some minutes his eyes meanwhile were at liberty to examine mr marvels dusty figure and the books beside him as he had approached mr marvel he had heard a sound like the dropping of coins into a pocket he was struck by the contrast of mr marvels appearance with this suggestion of opulence thence his mind wandered back again to a topic that had taken a curiously firm hold of his imagination  books he said suddenly noisily finishing with the toothpick  mr marvel started and looked at them oh yes he said yes theyre books  theres some extraordinary things in books said the mariner  i believe you said mr marvel  and some extraordinary things out of em said the mariner  true likewise said mr marvel he eyed his interlocutor and then glanced about him  theres some extraordinary things in newspapers for example said the mariner  there are  in this newspaper said the mariner  ah said mr marvel  theres a story said the mariner fixing mr marvel with an eye that was firm and deliberate theres a story about an invisible man for instance  mr marvel pulled his mouth askew and scratched his cheek and felt his ears glowing what will they be writing next he asked faintly ostria or america  neither said the mariner here  lord said mr marvel starting  when i say here said the mariner to mr marvels intense relief i dont of course mean here in this place i mean hereabouts  an invisible man said mr marvel and whats he been up to  everything said the mariner controlling marvel with his eye and then amplifying everyblessedthing  i aint seen a paper these four days said marvel  ipings the place he started at said the mariner  indeed said mr marvel  he started there and where he came from nobody dont seem to know here it is peculiar story from iping and it says in this paper that the evidence is extraordinary strongextraordinary  lord said mr marvel  but then its an extraordinary story there is a clergyman and a medical gent witnessessaw im all right and properor leastways didnt see im he was staying it says at the coach an horses and no one dont seem to have been aware of his misfortune it says aware of his misfortune until in an altercation in the inn it says his bandages on his head was torn off it was then observed that his head was invisible attempts were at once made to secure him but casting off his garments it says he succeeded in escaping but not until after a desperate struggle in which he had inflicted serious injuries it says on our worthy and able constable mr j a jaffers pretty straight story eh names and everything  lord said mr marvel looking nervously about him trying to count the money in his pockets by his unaided sense of touch and full of a strange and novel idea it sounds most astonishing  dont it extraordinary i call it never heard tell of invisible men before i havent but nowadays one hears such a lot of extraordinary thingsthat  that all he did asked marvel trying to seem at his ease  its enough aint it said the mariner  didnt go back by any chance asked marvel just escaped and thats all eh  all said the mariner whyaint it enough  quite enough said marvel  i should think it was enough said the mariner i should think it was enough  he didnt have any palsit dont say he had any pals does it asked mr marvel anxious  aint one of a sort enough for you asked the mariner no thank heaven as one might say he didnt  he nodded his head slowly it makes me regular uncomfortable the bare thought of that chap running about the country he is at present at large and from certain evidence it is supposed that he hastakentook i suppose they meanthe road to port stowe you see were right in it none of your american wonders this time and just think of the things he might do whered you be if he took a drop over and above and had a fancy to go for you suppose he wants to robwho can prevent him he can trespass he can burgle he could walk through a cordon of policemen as easy as me or you could give the slip to a blind man easier for these here blind chaps hear uncommon sharp im told and wherever there was liquor he fancied  hes got a tremenjous advantage certainly said mr marvel andwell  youre right said the mariner he has  all this time mr marvel had been glancing about him intently listening for faint footfalls trying to detect imperceptible movements he seemed on the point of some great resolution he coughed behind his hand  he looked about him again listened bent towards the mariner and lowered his voice the fact of it isi happento know just a thing or two about this invisible man from private sources  oh said the mariner interested you  yes said mr marvel me  indeed said the mariner and may i ask  youll be astonished said mr marvel behind his hand its tremenjous  indeed said the mariner  the fact is began mr marvel eagerly in a confidential undertone suddenly his expression changed marvellously ow he said he rose stiffly in his seat his face was eloquent of physical suffering wow he said  whats up said the mariner concerned  toothache said mr marvel and put his hand to his ear he caught hold of his books i must be getting on i think he said he edged in a curious way along the seat away from his interlocutor but you was just agoing to tell me about this here invisible man protested the mariner mr marvel seemed to consult with himself hoax said a voice its a hoax said mr marvel  but its in the paper said the mariner  hoax all the same said marvel i know the chap that started the lie there aint no invisible man whatsoeverblimey  but how bout this paper dyou mean to say  not a word of it said marvel stoutly  the mariner stared paper in hand mr marvel jerkily faced about wait a bit said the mariner rising and speaking slowly dyou mean to say  i do said mr marvel  then why did you let me go on and tell you all this blarsted stuff then what dyer mean by letting a man make a fool of himself like that for eh  mr marvel blew out his cheeks the mariner was suddenly very red indeed he clenched his hands i been talking here this ten minutes he said and you you little potbellied leatheryfaced son of an old boot couldnt have the elementary manners  dont you come bandying words with me said mr marvel  bandying words im a jolly good mind  come up said a voice and mr marvel was suddenly whirled about and started marching off in a curious spasmodic manner youd better move on said the mariner whos moving on said mr marvel he was receding obliquely with a curious hurrying gait with occasional violent jerks forward some way along the road he began a muttered monologue protests and recriminations  silly devil said the mariner legs wide apart elbows akimbo watching the receding figure ill show you you silly asshoaxing me its hereon the paper  mr marvel retorted incoherently and receding was hidden by a bend in the road but the mariner still stood magnificent in the midst of the way until the approach of a butchers cart dislodged him then he turned himself towards port stowe full of extraordinary asses he said softly to himself just to take me down a bitthat was his silly gameits on the paper  and there was another extraordinary thing he was presently to hear that had happened quite close to him and that was a vision of a fist full of money no less travelling without visible agency along by the wall at the corner of st michaels lane a brother mariner had seen this wonderful sight that very morning he had snatched at the money forthwith and had been knocked headlong and when he had got to his feet the butterfly money had vanished our mariner was in the mood to believe anything he declared but that was a bit too stiff afterwards however he began to think things over  the story of the flying money was true and all about that neighbourhood even from the august london and country banking company from the tills of shops and innsdoors standing that sunny weather entirely openmoney had been quietly and dexterously making off that day in handfuls and rouleaux floating quietly along by walls and shady places dodging quickly from the approaching eyes of men and it had though no man had traced it invariably ended its mysterious flight in the pocket of that agitated gentleman in the obsolete silk hat sitting outside the little inn on the outskirts of port stowe  it was ten days afterand indeed only when the burdock story was already oldthat the mariner collated these facts and began to understand how near he had been to the wonderful invisible man    chapter xv  the man who was running   in the early evening time dr kemp was sitting in his study in the belvedere on the hill overlooking burdock it was a pleasant little room with three windowsnorth west and southand bookshelves covered with books and scientific publications and a broad writingtable and under the north window a microscope glass slips minute instruments some cultures and scattered bottles of reagents dr kemps solar lamp was lit albeit the sky was still bright with the sunset light and his blinds were up because there was no offence of peering outsiders to require them pulled down dr kemp was a tall and slender young man with flaxen hair and a moustache almost white and the work he was upon would earn him he hoped the fellowship of the royal society so highly did he think of it  and his eye presently wandering from his work caught the sunset blazing at the back of the hill that is over against his own for a minute perhaps he sat pen in mouth admiring the rich golden colour above the crest and then his attention was attracted by the little figure of a man inky black running over the hillbrow towards him he was a shortish little man and he wore a high hat and he was running so fast that his legs verily twinkled  another of those fools said dr kemp like that ass who ran into me this morning round a corner with the visible man acoming sir i cant imagine what possesses people one might think we were in the thirteenth century  he got up went to the window and stared at the dusky hillside and the dark little figure tearing down it he seems in a confounded hurry said dr kemp but he doesnt seem to be getting on if his pockets were full of lead he couldnt run heavier  spurted sir said dr kemp  in another moment the higher of the villas that had clambered up the hill from burdock had occulted the running figure he was visible again for a moment and again and then again three times between the three detached houses that came next and then the terrace hid him  asses said dr kemp swinging round on his heel and walking back to his writingtable  but those who saw the fugitive nearer and perceived the abject terror on his perspiring face being themselves in the open roadway did not share in the doctors contempt by the man pounded and as he ran he chinked like a wellfilled purse that is tossed to and fro he looked neither to the right nor the left but his dilated eyes stared straight downhill to where the lamps were being lit and the people were crowded in the street and his illshaped mouth fell apart and a glairy foam lay on his lips and his breath came hoarse and noisy all he passed stopped and began staring up the road and down and interrogating one another with an inkling of discomfort for the reason of his haste  and then presently far up the hill a dog playing in the road yelped and ran under a gate and as they still wondered somethinga winda pad pad pada sound like a panting breathing rushed by  people screamed people sprang off the pavement it passed in shouts it passed by instinct down the hill they were shouting in the street before marvel was halfway there they were bolting into houses and slamming the doors behind them with the news he heard it and made one last desperate spurt fear came striding by rushed ahead of him and in a moment had seized the town  the invisible man is coming the invisible man    chapter xvi  in the jolly cricketers   the jolly cricketers is just at the bottom of the hill where the tramlines begin the barman leant his fat red arms on the counter and talked of horses with an anaemic cabman while a blackbearded man in grey snapped up biscuit and cheese drank burton and conversed in american with a policeman off duty  whats the shouting about said the anaemic cabman going off at a tangent trying to see up the hill over the dirty yellow blind in the low window of the inn somebody ran by outside fire perhaps said the barman  footsteps approached running heavily the door was pushed open violently and marvel weeping and dishevelled his hat gone the neck of his coat torn open rushed in made a convulsive turn and attempted to shut the door it was held half open by a strap  coming he bawled his voice shrieking with terror hes coming the visible man after me for gawds sake elp elp elp  shut the doors said the policeman whos coming whats the row he went to the door released the strap and it slammed the american closed the other door  lemme go inside said marvel staggering and weeping but still clutching the books lemme go inside lock me insomewhere i tell you hes after me i give him the slip he said hed kill me and he will  youre safe said the man with the black beard the doors shut whats it all about  lemme go inside said marvel and shrieked aloud as a blow suddenly made the fastened door shiver and was followed by a hurried rapping and a shouting outside hullo cried the policeman whos there mr marvel began to make frantic dives at panels that looked like doors hell kill mehes got a knife or something for gawds sake  here you are said the barman come in here and he held up the flap of the bar  mr marvel rushed behind the bar as the summons outside was repeated dont open the door he screamed please dont open the door where shall i hide  this this invisible man then asked the man with the black beard with one hand behind him i guess its about time we saw him  the window of the inn was suddenly smashed in and there was a screaming and running to and fro in the street the policeman had been standing on the settee staring out craning to see who was at the door he got down with raised eyebrows its that he said the barman stood in front of the barparlour door which was now locked on mr marvel stared at the smashed window and came round to the two other men  everything was suddenly quiet i wish i had my truncheon said the policeman going irresolutely to the door once we open in he comes theres no stopping him  dont you be in too much hurry about that door said the anaemic cabman anxiously  draw the bolts said the man with the black beard and if he comes he showed a revolver in his hand  that wont do said the policeman thats murder  i know what country im in said the man with the beard im going to let off at his legs draw the bolts  not with that blinking thing going off behind me said the barman craning over the blind  very well said the man with the black beard and stooping down revolver ready drew them himself barman cabman and policeman faced about  come in said the bearded man in an undertone standing back and facing the unbolted doors with his pistol behind him no one came in the door remained closed five minutes afterwards when a second cabman pushed his head in cautiously they were still waiting and an anxious face peered out of the barparlour and supplied information are all the doors of the house shut asked marvel hes going roundprowling round hes as artful as the devil  good lord said the burly barman theres the back just watch them doors i say he looked about him helplessly the barparlour door slammed and they heard the key turn theres the yard door and the private door the yard door  he rushed out of the bar  in a minute he reappeared with a carvingknife in his hand the yard door was open he said and his fat underlip dropped he may be in the house now said the first cabman  hes not in the kitchen said the barman theres two women there and ive stabbed every inch of it with this little beef slicer and they dont think hes come in they havent noticed  have you fastened it asked the first cabman  im out of frocks said the barman  the man with the beard replaced his revolver and even as he did so the flap of the bar was shut down and the bolt clicked and then with a tremendous thud the catch of the door snapped and the barparlour door burst open they heard marvel squeal like a caught leveret and forthwith they were clambering over the bar to his rescue the bearded mans revolver cracked and the lookingglass at the back of the parlour starred and came smashing and tinkling down  as the barman entered the room he saw marvel curiously crumpled up and struggling against the door that led to the yard and kitchen the door flew open while the barman hesitated and marvel was dragged into the kitchen there was a scream and a clatter of pans marvel head down and lugging back obstinately was forced to the kitchen door and the bolts were drawn  then the policeman who had been trying to pass the barman rushed in followed by one of the cabmen gripped the wrist of the invisible hand that collared marvel was hit in the face and went reeling back the door opened and marvel made a frantic effort to obtain a lodgment behind it then the cabman collared something i got him said the cabman the barmans red hands came clawing at the unseen here he is said the barman  mr marvel released suddenly dropped to the ground and made an attempt to crawl behind the legs of the fighting men the struggle blundered round the edge of the door the voice of the invisible man was heard for the first time yelling out sharply as the policeman trod on his foot then he cried out passionately and his fists flew round like flails the cabman suddenly whooped and doubled up kicked under the diaphragm the door into the barparlour from the kitchen slammed and covered mr marvels retreat the men in the kitchen found themselves clutching at and struggling with empty air  wheres he gone cried the man with the beard out  this way said the policeman stepping into the yard and stopping  a piece of tile whizzed by his head and smashed among the crockery on the kitchen table  ill show him shouted the man with the black beard and suddenly a steel barrel shone over the policemans shoulder and five bullets had followed one another into the twilight whence the missile had come as he fired the man with the beard moved his hand in a horizontal curve so that his shots radiated out into the narrow yard like spokes from a wheel  a silence followed five cartridges said the man with the black beard thats the best of all four aces and a joker get a lantern someone and come and feel about for his body    chapter xvii  dr kemps visitor   dr kemp had continued writing in his study until the shots aroused him crack crack crack they came one after the other  hullo said dr kemp putting his pen into his mouth again and listening whos letting off revolvers in burdock what are the asses at now  he went to the south window threw it up and leaning out stared down on the network of windows beaded gaslamps and shops with its black interstices of roof and yard that made up the town at night looks like a crowd down the hill he said by the cricketers and remained watching thence his eyes wandered over the town to far away where the ships lights shone and the pier gloweda little illuminated facetted pavilion like a gem of yellow light the moon in its first quarter hung over the westward hill and the stars were clear and almost tropically bright  after five minutes during which his mind had travelled into a remote speculation of social conditions of the future and lost itself at last over the time dimension dr kemp roused himself with a sigh pulled down the window again and returned to his writing desk  it must have been about an hour after this that the frontdoor bell rang he had been writing slackly and with intervals of abstraction since the shots he sat listening he heard the servant answer the door and waited for her feet on the staircase but she did not come wonder what that was said dr kemp  he tried to resume his work failed got up went downstairs from his study to the landing rang and called over the balustrade to the housemaid as she appeared in the hall below was that a letter he asked  only a runaway ring sir she answered  im restless tonight he said to himself he went back to his study and this time attacked his work resolutely in a little while he was hard at work again and the only sounds in the room were the ticking of the clock and the subdued shrillness of his quill hurrying in the very centre of the circle of light his lampshade threw on his table  it was two oclock before dr kemp had finished his work for the night he rose yawned and went downstairs to bed he had already removed his coat and vest when he noticed that he was thirsty he took a candle and went down to the diningroom in search of a syphon and whiskey  dr kemps scientific pursuits have made him a very observant man and as he recrossed the hall he noticed a dark spot on the linoleum near the mat at the foot of the stairs he went on upstairs and then it suddenly occurred to him to ask himself what the spot on the linoleum might be apparently some subconscious element was at work at any rate he turned with his burden went back to the hall put down the syphon and whiskey and bending down touched the spot without any great surprise he found it had the stickiness and colour of drying blood  he took up his burden again and returned upstairs looking about him and trying to account for the bloodspot on the landing he saw something and stopped astonished the doorhandle of his own room was bloodstained  he looked at his own hand it was quite clean and then he remembered that the door of his room had been open when he came down from his study and that consequently he had not touched the handle at all he went straight into his room his face quite calmperhaps a trifle more resolute than usual his glance wandering inquisitively fell on the bed on the counterpane was a mess of blood and the sheet had been torn he had not noticed this before because he had walked straight to the dressingtable on the further side the bedclothes were depressed as if someone had been recently sitting there  then he had an odd impression that he had heard a low voice say good heavenskemp but dr kemp was no believer in voices  he stood staring at the tumbled sheets was that really a voice he looked about again but noticed nothing further than the disordered and bloodstained bed then he distinctly heard a movement across the room near the washhand stand all men however highly educated retain some superstitious inklings the feeling that is called eerie came upon him he closed the door of the room came forward to the dressingtable and put down his burdens suddenly with a start he perceived a coiled and bloodstained bandage of linen rag hanging in midair between him and the washhand stand  he stared at this in amazement it was an empty bandage a bandage properly tied but quite empty he would have advanced to grasp it but a touch arrested him and a voice speaking quite close to him  kemp said the voice  eh said kemp with his mouth open  keep your nerve said the voice im an invisible man  kemp made no answer for a space simply stared at the bandage invisible man he said  i am an invisible man repeated the voice  the story he had been active to ridicule only that morning rushed through kemps brain he does not appear to have been either very much frightened or very greatly surprised at the moment realisation came later  i thought it was all a lie he said the thought uppermost in his mind was the reiterated arguments of the morning have you a bandage on he asked  yes said the invisible man  oh said kemp and then roused himself i say he said but this is nonsense its some trick he stepped forward suddenly and his hand extended towards the bandage met invisible fingers  he recoiled at the touch and his colour changed  keep steady kemp for gods sake i want help badly stop  the hand gripped his arm he struck at it  kemp cried the voice kemp keep steady and the grip tightened  a frantic desire to free himself took possession of kemp the hand of the bandaged arm gripped his shoulder and he was suddenly tripped and flung backwards upon the bed he opened his mouth to shout and the corner of the sheet was thrust between his teeth the invisible man had him down grimly but his arms were free and he struck and tried to kick savagely  listen to reason will you said the invisible man sticking to him in spite of a pounding in the ribs by heaven youll madden me in a minute  lie still you fool bawled the invisible man in kemps ear  kemp struggled for another moment and then lay still  if you shout ill smash your face said the invisible man relieving his mouth  im an invisible man its no foolishness and no magic i really am an invisible man and i want your help i dont want to hurt you but if you behave like a frantic rustic i must dont you remember me kemp griffin of university college  let me get up said kemp ill stop where i am and let me sit quiet for a minute  he sat up and felt his neck  i am griffin of university college and i have made myself invisible i am just an ordinary mana man you have knownmade invisible  griffin said kemp  griffin answered the voice a younger student than you were almost an albino six feet high and broad with a pink and white face and red eyes who won the medal for chemistry  i am confused said kemp my brain is rioting what has this to do with griffin  i am griffin  kemp thought its horrible he said but what devilry must happen to make a man invisible  its no devilry its a process sane and intelligible enough  its horrible said kemp how on earth  its horrible enough but im wounded and in pain and tired  great god kemp you are a man take it steady give me some food and drink and let me sit down here  kemp stared at the bandage as it moved across the room then saw a basket chair dragged across the floor and come to rest near the bed it creaked and the seat was depressed the quarter of an inch or so he rubbed his eyes and felt his neck again this beats ghosts he said and laughed stupidly  thats better thank heaven youre getting sensible  or silly said kemp and knuckled his eyes  give me some whiskey im near dead  it didnt feel so where are you if i get up shall i run into you there all right whiskey here where shall i give it to you  the chair creaked and kemp felt the glass drawn away from him he let go by an effort his instinct was all against it it came to rest poised twenty inches above the front edge of the seat of the chair he stared at it in infinite perplexity this isthis must behypnotism you have suggested you are invisible  nonsense said the voice  its frantic  listen to me  i demonstrated conclusively this morning began kemp that invisibility  never mind what youve demonstratedim starving said the voice and the night is chilly to a man without clothes  food said kemp  the tumbler of whiskey tilted itself yes said the invisible man rapping it down have you a dressinggown  kemp made some exclamation in an undertone he walked to a wardrobe and produced a robe of dingy scarlet this do he asked it was taken from him it hung limp for a moment in midair fluttered weirdly stood full and decorous buttoning itself and sat down in his chair drawers socks slippers would be a comfort said the unseen curtly and food  anything but this is the insanest thing i ever was in in my life  he turned out his drawers for the articles and then went downstairs to ransack his larder he came back with some cold cutlets and bread pulled up a light table and placed them before his guest never mind knives said his visitor and a cutlet hung in midair with a sound of gnawing  invisible said kemp and sat down on a bedroom chair  i always like to get something about me before i eat said the invisible man with a full mouth eating greedily queer fancy  i suppose that wrist is all right said kemp  trust me said the invisible man  of all the strange and wonderful  exactly but its odd i should blunder into your house to get my bandaging my first stroke of luck anyhow i meant to sleep in this house tonight you must stand that its a filthy nuisance my blood showing isnt it quite a clot over there gets visible as it coagulates i see its only the living tissue ive changed and only for as long as im alive ive been in the house three hours  but hows it done began kemp in a tone of exasperation confound it the whole businessits unreasonable from beginning to end  quite reasonable said the invisible man perfectly reasonable  he reached over and secured the whiskey bottle kemp stared at the devouring dressing gown a ray of candlelight penetrating a torn patch in the right shoulder made a triangle of light under the left ribs what were the shots he asked how did the shooting begin  there was a real fool of a mana sort of confederate of minecurse himwho tried to steal my money has done so  is he invisible too  no  well  cant i have some more to eat before i tell you all that im hungryin pain and you want me to tell stories  kemp got up you didnt do any shooting he asked  not me said his visitor some fool id never seen fired at random a lot of them got scared they all got scared at me curse themi sayi want more to eat than this kemp  ill see what there is to eat downstairs said kemp not much im afraid  after he had done eating and he made a heavy meal the invisible man demanded a cigar he bit the end savagely before kemp could find a knife and cursed when the outer leaf loosened it was strange to see him smoking his mouth and throat pharynx and nares became visible as a sort of whirling smoke cast  this blessed gift of smoking he said and puffed vigorously im lucky to have fallen upon you kemp you must help me fancy tumbling on you just now im in a devilish scrapeive been mad i think the things i have been through but we will do things yet let me tell you  he helped himself to more whiskey and soda kemp got up looked about him and fetched a glass from his spare room its wildbut i suppose i may drink  you havent changed much kemp these dozen years you fair men dont cool and methodicalafter the first collapse i must tell you we will work together  but how was it all done said kemp and how did you get like this  for gods sake let me smoke in peace for a little while and then i will begin to tell you  but the story was not told that night the invisible mans wrist was growing painful he was feverish exhausted and his mind came round to brood upon his chase down the hill and the struggle about the inn he spoke in fragments of marvel he smoked faster his voice grew angry kemp tried to gather what he could  he was afraid of me i could see that he was afraid of me said the invisible man many times over he meant to give me the sliphe was always casting about what a fool i was  the cur  i should have killed him  where did you get the money asked kemp abruptly  the invisible man was silent for a space i cant tell you tonight he said  he groaned suddenly and leant forward supporting his invisible head on invisible hands kemp he said ive had no sleep for near three days except a couple of dozes of an hour or so i must sleep soon  well have my roomhave this room  but how can i sleep if i sleephe will get away ugh what does it matter  whats the shot wound asked kemp abruptly  nothingscratch and blood oh god how i want sleep  why not  the invisible man appeared to be regarding kemp because ive a particular objection to being caught by my fellowmen he said slowly  kemp started  fool that i am said the invisible man striking the table smartly ive put the idea into your head    chapter xviii  the invisible man sleeps   exhausted and wounded as the invisible man was he refused to accept kemps word that his freedom should be respected he examined the two windows of the bedroom drew up the blinds and opened the sashes to confirm kemps statement that a retreat by them would be possible outside the night was very quiet and still and the new moon was setting over the down then he examined the keys of the bedroom and the two dressingroom doors to satisfy himself that these also could be made an assurance of freedom finally he expressed himself satisfied he stood on the hearth rug and kemp heard the sound of a yawn  im sorry said the invisible man if i cannot tell you all that i have done tonight but i am worn out its grotesque no doubt its horrible but believe me kemp in spite of your arguments of this morning it is quite a possible thing i have made a discovery i meant to keep it to myself i cant i must have a partner and you we can do such things  but tomorrow now kemp i feel as though i must sleep or perish  kemp stood in the middle of the room staring at the headless garment i suppose i must leave you he said itsincredible three things happening like this overturning all my preconceptionswould make me insane but its real is there anything more that i can get you  only bid me goodnight said griffin  goodnight said kemp and shook an invisible hand he walked sideways to the door suddenly the dressinggown walked quickly towards him understand me said the dressinggown no attempts to hamper me or capture me or  kemps face changed a little i thought i gave you my word he said  kemp closed the door softly behind him and the key was turned upon him forthwith then as he stood with an expression of passive amazement on his face the rapid feet came to the door of the dressingroom and that too was locked kemp slapped his brow with his hand am i dreaming has the world gone mador have i  he laughed and put his hand to the locked door barred out of my own bedroom by a flagrant absurdity he said  he walked to the head of the staircase turned and stared at the locked doors its fact he said he put his fingers to his slightly bruised neck undeniable fact  but  he shook his head hopelessly turned and went downstairs  he lit the diningroom lamp got out a cigar and began pacing the room ejaculating now and then he would argue with himself  invisible he said  is there such a thing as an invisible animal  in the sea yes thousandsmillions all the larvae all the little nauplii and tornarias all the microscopic things the jellyfish in the sea there are more things invisible than visible i never thought of that before and in the ponds too all those little pondlife thingsspecks of colourless translucent jelly but in air no  it cant be  but after allwhy not  if a man was made of glass he would still be visible  his meditation became profound the bulk of three cigars had passed into the invisible or diffused as a white ash over the carpet before he spoke again then it was merely an exclamation he turned aside walked out of the room and went into his little consultingroom and lit the gas there it was a little room because dr kemp did not live by practice and in it were the days newspapers the mornings paper lay carelessly opened and thrown aside he caught it up turned it over and read the account of a strange story from iping that the mariner at port stowe had spelt over so painfully to mr marvel kemp read it swiftly  wrapped up said kemp disguised hiding it no one seems to have been aware of his misfortune what the devil is his game  he dropped the paper and his eye went seeking ah he said and caught up the st james gazette lying folded up as it arrived now we shall get at the truth said dr kemp he rent the paper open a couple of columns confronted him an entire village in sussex goes mad was the heading  good heavens said kemp reading eagerly an incredulous account of the events in iping of the previous afternoon that have already been described over the leaf the report in the morning paper had been reprinted  he reread it ran through the streets striking right and left jaffers insensible mr huxter in great painstill unable to describe what he saw painful humiliationvicar woman ill with terror windows smashed this extraordinary story probably a fabrication too good not to printcum grano  he dropped the paper and stared blankly in front of him probably a fabrication  he caught up the paper again and reread the whole business but when does the tramp come in why the deuce was he chasing a tramp  he sat down abruptly on the surgical bench hes not only invisible he said but hes mad homicidal  when dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamplight and cigar smoke of the diningroom kemp was still pacing up and down trying to grasp the incredible  he was altogether too excited to sleep his servants descending sleepily discovered him and were inclined to think that overstudy had worked this ill on him he gave them extraordinary but quite explicit instructions to lay breakfast for two in the belvedere studyand then to confine themselves to the basement and groundfloor then he continued to pace the diningroom until the mornings paper came that had much to say and little to tell beyond the confirmation of the evening before and a very badly written account of another remarkable tale from port burdock this gave kemp the essence of the happenings at the jolly cricketers and the name of marvel he has made me keep with him twentyfour hours marvel testified certain minor facts were added to the iping story notably the cutting of the village telegraphwire but there was nothing to throw light on the connexion between the invisible man and the tramp for mr marvel had supplied no information about the three books or the money with which he was lined the incredulous tone had vanished and a shoal of reporters and inquirers were already at work elaborating the matter  kemp read every scrap of the report and sent his housemaid out to get every one of the morning papers she could these also he devoured  he is invisible he said and it reads like rage growing to mania the things he may do the things he may do and hes upstairs free as the air what on earth ought i to do  for instance would it be a breach of faith if no  he went to a little untidy desk in the corner and began a note he tore this up half written and wrote another he read it over and considered it then he took an envelope and addressed it to colonel adye port burdock  the invisible man awoke even as kemp was doing this he awoke in an evil temper and kemp alert for every sound heard his pattering feet rush suddenly across the bedroom overhead then a chair was flung over and the washhand stand tumbler smashed kemp hurried upstairs and rapped eagerly    chapter xix  certain first principles   whats the matter asked kemp when the invisible man admitted him  nothing was the answer  but confound it the smash  fit of temper said the invisible man forgot this arm and its sore  youre rather liable to that sort of thing  i am  kemp walked across the room and picked up the fragments of broken glass all the facts are out about you said kemp standing up with the glass in his hand all that happened in iping and down the hill the world has become aware of its invisible citizen but no one knows you are here  the invisible man swore  the secrets out i gather it was a secret i dont know what your plans are but of course im anxious to help you  the invisible man sat down on the bed  theres breakfast upstairs said kemp speaking as easily as possible and he was delighted to find his strange guest rose willingly kemp led the way up the narrow staircase to the belvedere  before we can do anything else said kemp i must understand a little more about this invisibility of yours he had sat down after one nervous glance out of the window with the air of a man who has talking to do his doubts of the sanity of the entire business flashed and vanished again as he looked across to where griffin sat at the breakfasttablea headless handless dressinggown wiping unseen lips on a miraculously held serviette  its simple enoughand credible enough said griffin putting the serviette aside and leaning the invisible head on an invisible hand  no doubt to you but kemp laughed  well yes to me it seemed wonderful at first no doubt but now great god  but we will do great things yet i came on the stuff first at chesilstowe  chesilstowe  i went there after i left london you know i dropped medicine and took up physics no well i did light fascinated me  ah  optical density the whole subject is a network of riddlesa network with solutions glimmering elusively through and being but twoandtwenty and full of enthusiasm i said i will devote my life to this this is worth while you know what fools we are at twoandtwenty  fools then or fools now said kemp  as though knowing could be any satisfaction to a man  but i went to worklike a slave and i had hardly worked and thought about the matter six months before light came through one of the meshes suddenlyblindingly i found a general principle of pigments and refractiona formula a geometrical expression involving four dimensions fools common men even common mathematicians do not know anything of what some general expression may mean to the student of molecular physics in the booksthe books that tramp has hiddenthere are marvels miracles but this was not a method it was an idea that might lead to a method by which it would be possible without changing any other property of matterexcept in some instances coloursto lower the refractive index of a substance solid or liquid to that of airso far as all practical purposes are concerned  phew said kemp thats odd but still i dont see quite  i can understand that thereby you could spoil a valuable stone but personal invisibility is a far cry  precisely said griffin but consider visibility depends on the action of the visible bodies on light either a body absorbs light or it reflects or refracts it or does all these things if it neither reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light it cannot of itself be visible you see an opaque red box for instance because the colour absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest all the red part of the light to you if it did not absorb any particular part of the light but reflected it all then it would be a shining white box silver a diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor reflect much from the general surface but just here and there where the surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and refracted so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing reflections and translucenciesa sort of skeleton of light a glass box would not be so brilliant nor so clearly visible as a diamond box because there would be less refraction and reflection see that from certain points of view you would see quite clearly through it some kinds of glass would be more visible than others a box of flint glass would be brighter than a box of ordinary window glass a box of very thin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light because it would absorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little and if you put a sheet of common white glass in water still more if you put it in some denser liquid than water it would vanish almost altogether because light passing from water to glass is only slightly refracted or reflected or indeed affected in any way it is almost as invisible as a jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in air and for precisely the same reason  yes said kemp that is pretty plain sailing  and here is another fact you will know to be true if a sheet of glass is smashed kemp and beaten into a powder it becomes much more visible while it is in the air it becomes at last an opaque white powder this is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces of the glass at which refraction and reflection occur in the sheet of glass there are only two surfaces in the powder the light is reflected or refracted by each grain it passes through and very little gets right through the powder but if the white powdered glass is put into water it forthwith vanishes the powdered glass and water have much the same refractive index that is the light undergoes very little refraction or reflection in passing from one to the other  you make the glass invisible by putting it into a liquid of nearly the same refractive index a transparent thing becomes invisible if it is put in any medium of almost the same refractive index and if you will consider only a second you will see also that the powder of glass might be made to vanish in air if its refractive index could be made the same as that of air for then there would be no refraction or reflection as the light passed from glass to air  yes yes said kemp but a mans not powdered glass  no said griffin hes more transparent  nonsense  that from a doctor how one forgets have you already forgotten your physics in ten years just think of all the things that are transparent and seem not to be so paper for instance is made up of transparent fibres and it is white and opaque only for the same reason that a powder of glass is white and opaque oil white paper fill up the interstices between the particles with oil so that there is no longer refraction or reflection except at the surfaces and it becomes as transparent as glass and not only paper but cotton fibre linen fibre wool fibre woody fibre and bone kemp flesh kemp hair kemp nails and nerves kemp in fact the whole fabric of a man except the red of his blood and the black pigment of hair are all made up of transparent colourless tissue so little suffices to make us visible one to the other for the most part the fibres of a living creature are no more opaque than water  great heavens cried kemp of course of course i was thinking only last night of the sea larvae and all jellyfish  now you have me and all that i knew and had in mind a year after i left londonsix years ago but i kept it to myself i had to do my work under frightful disadvantages oliver my professor was a scientific bounder a journalist by instinct a thief of ideashe was always prying and you know the knavish system of the scientific world i simply would not publish and let him share my credit i went on working i got nearer and nearer making my formula into an experiment a reality i told no living soul because i meant to flash my work upon the world with crushing effect and become famous at a blow i took up the question of pigments to fill up certain gaps and suddenly not by design but by accident i made a discovery in physiology  yes  you know the red colouring matter of blood it can be made whitecolourlessand remain with all the functions it has now  kemp gave a cry of incredulous amazement  the invisible man rose and began pacing the little study you may well exclaim i remember that night it was late at nightin the daytime one was bothered with the gaping silly studentsand i worked then sometimes till dawn it came suddenly splendid and complete in my mind i was alone the laboratory was still with the tall lights burning brightly and silently in all my great moments i have been alone one could make an animala tissuetransparent one could make it invisible all except the pigmentsi could be invisible i said suddenly realising what it meant to be an albino with such knowledge it was overwhelming i left the filtering i was doing and went and stared out of the great window at the stars i could be invisible i repeated  to do such a thing would be to transcend magic and i beheld unclouded by doubt a magnificent vision of all that invisibility might mean to a manthe mystery the power the freedom drawbacks i saw none you have only to think and i a shabby povertystruck hemmedin demonstrator teaching fools in a provincial college might suddenly becomethis i ask you kemp if you  anyone i tell you would have flung himself upon that research and i worked three years and every mountain of difficulty i toiled over showed another from its summit the infinite details and the exasperation a professor a provincial professor always prying when are you going to publish this work of yours was his everlasting question and the students the cramped means three years i had of it  and after three years of secrecy and exasperation i found that to complete it was impossibleimpossible  how asked kemp  money said the invisible man and went again to stare out of the window  he turned around abruptly i robbed the old manrobbed my father  the money was not his and he shot himself    chapter xx  at the house in great portland street   for a moment kemp sat in silence staring at the back of the headless figure at the window then he started struck by a thought rose took the invisible mans arm and turned him away from the outlook  you are tired he said and while i sit you walk about have my chair  he placed himself between griffin and the nearest window  for a space griffin sat silent and then he resumed abruptly  i had left the chesilstowe cottage already he said when that happened it was last december i had taken a room in london a large unfurnished room in a big illmanaged lodginghouse in a slum near great portland street the room was soon full of the appliances i had bought with his money the work was going on steadily successfully drawing near an end i was like a man emerging from a thicket and suddenly coming on some unmeaning tragedy i went to bury him my mind was still on this research and i did not lift a finger to save his character i remember the funeral the cheap hearse the scant ceremony the windy frostbitten hillside and the old college friend of his who read the service over hima shabby black bent old man with a snivelling cold  i remember walking back to the empty house through the place that had once been a village and was now patched and tinkered by the jerry builders into the ugly likeness of a town every way the roads ran out at last into the desecrated fields and ended in rubble heaps and rank wet weeds i remember myself as a gaunt black figure going along the slippery shiny pavement and the strange sense of detachment i felt from the squalid respectability the sordid commercialism of the place  i did not feel a bit sorry for my father he seemed to me to be the victim of his own foolish sentimentality the current cant required my attendance at his funeral but it was really not my affair  but going along the high street my old life came back to me for a space for i met the girl i had known ten years since our eyes met  something moved me to turn back and talk to her she was a very ordinary person  it was all like a dream that visit to the old places i did not feel then that i was lonely that i had come out from the world into a desolate place i appreciated my loss of sympathy but i put it down to the general inanity of things reentering my room seemed like the recovery of reality there were the things i knew and loved there stood the apparatus the experiments arranged and waiting and now there was scarcely a difficulty left beyond the planning of details  i will tell you kemp sooner or later all the complicated processes we need not go into that now for the most part saving certain gaps i chose to remember they are written in cypher in those books that tramp has hidden we must hunt him down we must get those books again but the essential phase was to place the transparent object whose refractive index was to be lowered between two radiating centres of a sort of ethereal vibration of which i will tell you more fully later no not those roentgen vibrationsi dont know that these others of mine have been described yet they are obvious enough i needed two little dynamos and these i worked with a cheap gas engine my first experiment was with a bit of white wool fabric it was the strangest thing in the world to see it in the flicker of the flashes soft and white and then to watch it fade like a wreath of smoke and vanish  i could scarcely believe i had done it i put my hand into the emptiness and there was the thing as solid as ever i felt it awkwardly and threw it on the floor i had a little trouble finding it again  and then came a curious experience i heard a miaow behind me and turning saw a lean white cat very dirty on the cistern cover outside the window a thought came into my head everything ready for you i said and went to the window opened it and called softly she came in purringthe poor beast was starvingand i gave her some milk all my food was in a cupboard in the corner of the room after that she went smelling round the room evidently with the idea of making herself at home the invisible rag upset her a bit you should have seen her spit at it but i made her comfortable on the pillow of my trucklebed and i gave her butter to get her to wash  and you processed her  i processed her but giving drugs to a cat is no joke kemp and the process failed  failed  in two particulars these were the claws and the pigment stuff what is itat the back of the eye in a cat you know  tapetum  yes the tapetum it didnt go after id given the stuff to bleach the blood and done certain other things to her i gave the beast opium and put her and the pillow she was sleeping on on the apparatus and after all the rest had faded and vanished there remained two little ghosts of her eyes  odd  i cant explain it she was bandaged and clamped of courseso i had her safe but she woke while she was still misty and miaowed dismally and someone came knocking it was an old woman from downstairs who suspected me of vivisectinga drinksodden old creature with only a white cat to care for in all the world i whipped out some chloroform applied it and answered the door did i hear a cat she asked my cat not here said i very politely she was a little doubtful and tried to peer past me into the room strange enough to her no doubtbare walls uncurtained windows trucklebed with the gas engine vibrating and the seethe of the radiant points and that faint ghastly stinging of chloroform in the air she had to be satisfied at last and went away again  how long did it take asked kemp  three or four hoursthe cat the bones and sinews and the fat were the last to go and the tips of the coloured hairs and as i say the back part of the eye tough iridescent stuff it is wouldnt go at all  it was night outside long before the business was over and nothing was to be seen but the dim eyes and the claws i stopped the gas engine felt for and stroked the beast which was still insensible and then being tired left it sleeping on the invisible pillow and went to bed i found it hard to sleep i lay awake thinking weak aimless stuff going over the experiment over and over again or dreaming feverishly of things growing misty and vanishing about me until everything the ground i stood on vanished and so i came to that sickly falling nightmare one gets about two the cat began miaowing about the room i tried to hush it by talking to it and then i decided to turn it out i remember the shock i had when striking a lightthere were just the round eyes shining greenand nothing round them i would have given it milk but i hadnt any it wouldnt be quiet it just sat down and miaowed at the door i tried to catch it with an idea of putting it out of the window but it wouldnt be caught it vanished then it began miaowing in different parts of the room at last i opened the window and made a bustle i suppose it went out at last i never saw any more of it  thenheaven knows whyi fell thinking of my fathers funeral again and the dismal windy hillside until the day had come i found sleeping was hopeless and locking my door after me wandered out into the morning streets  you dont mean to say theres an invisible cat at large said kemp  if it hasnt been killed said the invisible man why not  why not said kemp i didnt mean to interrupt  its very probably been killed said the invisible man it was alive four days after i know and down a grating in great titchfield street because i saw a crowd round the place trying to see whence the miaowing came  he was silent for the best part of a minute then he resumed abruptly  i remember that morning before the change very vividly i must have gone up great portland street i remember the barracks in albany street and the horse soldiers coming out and at last i found the summit of primrose hill it was a sunny day in januaryone of those sunny frosty days that came before the snow this year my weary brain tried to formulate the position to plot out a plan of action  i was surprised to find now that my prize was within my grasp how inconclusive its attainment seemed as a matter of fact i was worked out the intense stress of nearly four years continuous work left me incapable of any strength of feeling i was apathetic and i tried in vain to recover the enthusiasm of my first inquiries the passion of discovery that had enabled me to compass even the downfall of my fathers grey hairs nothing seemed to matter i saw pretty clearly this was a transient mood due to overwork and want of sleep and that either by drugs or rest it would be possible to recover my energies  all i could think clearly was that the thing had to be carried through the fixed idea still ruled me and soon for the money i had was almost exhausted i looked about me at the hillside with children playing and girls watching them and tried to think of all the fantastic advantages an invisible man would have in the world after a time i crawled home took some food and a strong dose of strychnine and went to sleep in my clothes on my unmade bed strychnine is a grand tonic kemp to take the flabbiness out of a man  its the devil said kemp its the palaeolithic in a bottle  i awoke vastly invigorated and rather irritable you know  i know the stuff  and there was someone rapping at the door it was my landlord with threats and inquiries an old polish jew in a long grey coat and greasy slippers i had been tormenting a cat in the night he was surethe old womans tongue had been busy he insisted on knowing all about it the laws in this country against vivisection were very severehe might be liable i denied the cat then the vibration of the little gas engine could be felt all over the house he said that was true certainly he edged round me into the room peering about over his germansilver spectacles and a sudden dread came into my mind that he might carry away something of my secret i tried to keep between him and the concentrating apparatus i had arranged and that only made him more curious what was i doing why was i always alone and secretive was it legal was it dangerous i paid nothing but the usual rent his had always been a most respectable housein a disreputable neighbourhood suddenly my temper gave way i told him to get out he began to protest to jabber of his right of entry in a moment i had him by the collar something ripped and he went spinning out into his own passage i slammed and locked the door and sat down quivering  he made a fuss outside which i disregarded and after a time he went away  but this brought matters to a crisis i did not know what he would do nor even what he had the power to do to move to fresh apartments would have meant delay altogether i had barely twenty pounds left in the world for the most part in a bankand i could not afford that vanish it was irresistible then there would be an inquiry the sacking of my room  at the thought of the possibility of my work being exposed or interrupted at its very climax i became very angry and active i hurried out with my three books of notes my chequebookthe tramp has them nowand directed them from the nearest post office to a house of call for letters and parcels in great portland street i tried to go out noiselessly coming in i found my landlord going quietly upstairs he had heard the door close i suppose you would have laughed to see him jump aside on the landing as i came tearing after him he glared at me as i went by him and i made the house quiver with the slamming of my door i heard him come shuffling up to my floor hesitate and go down i set to work upon my preparations forthwith  it was all done that evening and night while i was still sitting under the sickly drowsy influence of the drugs that decolourise blood there came a repeated knocking at the door it ceased footsteps went away and returned and the knocking was resumed there was an attempt to push something under the doora blue paper then in a fit of irritation i rose and went and flung the door wide open now then said i  it was my landlord with a notice of ejectment or something he held it out to me saw something odd about my hands i expect and lifted his eyes to my face  for a moment he gaped then he gave a sort of inarticulate cry dropped candle and writ together and went blundering down the dark passage to the stairs i shut the door locked it and went to the lookingglass then i understood his terror my face was whitelike white stone  but it was all horrible i had not expected the suffering a night of racking anguish sickness and fainting i set my teeth though my skin was presently afire all my body afire but i lay there like grim death i understood now how it was the cat had howled until i chloroformed it lucky it was i lived alone and untended in my room there were times when i sobbed and groaned and talked but i stuck to it i became insensible and woke languid in the darkness  the pain had passed i thought i was killing myself and i did not care i shall never forget that dawn and the strange horror of seeing that my hands had become as clouded glass and watching them grow clearer and thinner as the day went by until at last i could see the sickly disorder of my room through them though i closed my transparent eyelids my limbs became glassy the bones and arteries faded vanished and the little white nerves went last i gritted my teeth and stayed there to the end at last only the dead tips of the fingernails remained pallid and white and the brown stain of some acid upon my fingers  i struggled up at first i was as incapable as a swathed infantstepping with limbs i could not see i was weak and very hungry i went and stared at nothing in my shavingglass at nothing save where an attenuated pigment still remained behind the retina of my eyes fainter than mist i had to hang on to the table and press my forehead against the glass  it was only by a frantic effort of will that i dragged myself back to the apparatus and completed the process  i slept during the forenoon pulling the sheet over my eyes to shut out the light and about midday i was awakened again by a knocking my strength had returned i sat up and listened and heard a whispering i sprang to my feet and as noiselessly as possible began to detach the connections of my apparatus and to distribute it about the room so as to destroy the suggestions of its arrangement presently the knocking was renewed and voices called first my landlords and then two others to gain time i answered them the invisible rag and pillow came to hand and i opened the window and pitched them out on to the cistern cover as the window opened a heavy crash came at the door someone had charged it with the idea of smashing the lock but the stout bolts i had screwed up some days before stopped him that startled me made me angry i began to tremble and do things hurriedly  i tossed together some loose paper straw packing paper and so forth in the middle of the room and turned on the gas heavy blows began to rain upon the door i could not find the matches i beat my hands on the wall with rage i turned down the gas again stepped out of the window on the cistern cover very softly lowered the sash and sat down secure and invisible but quivering with anger to watch events they split a panel i saw and in another moment they had broken away the staples of the bolts and stood in the open doorway it was the landlord and his two stepsons sturdy young men of three or four and twenty behind them fluttered the old hag of a woman from downstairs  you may imagine their astonishment to find the room empty one of the younger men rushed to the window at once flung it up and stared out his staring eyes and thicklipped bearded face came a foot from my face i was half minded to hit his silly countenance but i arrested my doubled fist he stared right through me so did the others as they joined him the old man went and peered under the bed and then they all made a rush for the cupboard they had to argue about it at length in yiddish and cockney english they concluded i had not answered them that their imagination had deceived them a feeling of extraordinary elation took the place of my anger as i sat outside the window and watched these four peoplefor the old lady came in glancing suspiciously about her like a cat trying to understand the riddle of my behaviour  the old man so far as i could understand his patois agreed with the old lady that i was a vivisectionist the sons protested in garbled english that i was an electrician and appealed to the dynamos and radiators they were all nervous about my arrival although i found subsequently that they had bolted the front door the old lady peered into the cupboard and under the bed and one of the young men pushed up the register and stared up the chimney one of my fellow lodgers a costermonger who shared the opposite room with a butcher appeared on the landing and he was called in and told incoherent things  it occurred to me that the radiators if they fell into the hands of some acute welleducated person would give me away too much and watching my opportunity i came into the room and tilted one of the little dynamos off its fellow on which it was standing and smashed both apparatus then while they were trying to explain the smash i dodged out of the room and went softly downstairs  i went into one of the sittingrooms and waited until they came down still speculating and argumentative all a little disappointed at finding no horrors and all a little puzzled how they stood legally towards me then i slipped up again with a box of matches fired my heap of paper and rubbish put the chairs and bedding thereby led the gas to the affair by means of an indiarubber tube and waving a farewell to the room left it for the last time  you fired the house exclaimed kemp  fired the house it was the only way to cover my trailand no doubt it was insured i slipped the bolts of the front door quietly and went out into the street i was invisible and i was only just beginning to realise the extraordinary advantage my invisibility gave me my head was already teeming with plans of all the wild and wonderful things i had now impunity to do    chapter xxi  in oxford street   in going downstairs the first time i found an unexpected difficulty because i could not see my feet indeed i stumbled twice and there was an unaccustomed clumsiness in gripping the bolt by not looking down however i managed to walk on the level passably well  my mood i say was one of exaltation i felt as a seeing man might do with padded feet and noiseless clothes in a city of the blind i experienced a wild impulse to jest to startle people to clap men on the back fling peoples hats astray and generally revel in my extraordinary advantage  but hardly had i emerged upon great portland street however my lodging was close to the big drapers shop there when i heard a clashing concussion and was hit violently behind and turning saw a man carrying a basket of sodawater syphons and looking in amazement at his burden although the blow had really hurt me i found something so irresistible in his astonishment that i laughed aloud the devils in the basket i said and suddenly twisted it out of his hand he let go incontinently and i swung the whole weight into the air  but a fool of a cabman standing outside a public house made a sudden rush for this and his extending fingers took me with excruciating violence under the ear i let the whole down with a smash on the cabman and then with shouts and the clatter of feet about me people coming out of shops vehicles pulling up i realised what i had done for myself and cursing my folly backed against a shop window and prepared to dodge out of the confusion in a moment i should be wedged into a crowd and inevitably discovered i pushed by a butcher boy who luckily did not turn to see the nothingness that shoved him aside and dodged behind the cabmans fourwheeler i do not know how they settled the business i hurried straight across the road which was happily clear and hardly heeding which way i went in the fright of detection the incident had given me plunged into the afternoon throng of oxford street  i tried to get into the stream of people but they were too thick for me and in a moment my heels were being trodden upon i took to the gutter the roughness of which i found painful to my feet and forthwith the shaft of a crawling hansom dug me forcibly under the shoulder blade reminding me that i was already bruised severely i staggered out of the way of the cab avoided a perambulator by a convulsive movement and found myself behind the hansom a happy thought saved me and as this drove slowly along i followed in its immediate wake trembling and astonished at the turn of my adventure and not only trembling but shivering it was a bright day in january and i was stark naked and the thin slime of mud that covered the road was freezing foolish as it seems to me now i had not reckoned that transparent or not i was still amenable to the weather and all its consequences  then suddenly a bright idea came into my head i ran round and got into the cab and so shivering scared and sniffing with the first intimations of a cold and with the bruises in the small of my back growing upon my attention i drove slowly along oxford street and past tottenham court road my mood was as different from that in which i had sallied forth ten minutes ago as it is possible to imagine this invisibility indeed the one thought that possessed me washow was i to get out of the scrape i was in  we crawled past mudies and there a tall woman with five or six yellowlabelled books hailed my cab and i sprang out just in time to escape her shaving a railway van narrowly in my flight i made off up the roadway to bloomsbury square intending to strike north past the museum and so get into the quiet district i was now cruelly chilled and the strangeness of my situation so unnerved me that i whimpered as i ran at the northward corner of the square a little white dog ran out of the pharmaceutical societys offices and incontinently made for me nose down  i had never realised it before but the nose is to the mind of a dog what the eye is to the mind of a seeing man dogs perceive the scent of a man moving as men perceive his vision this brute began barking and leaping showing as it seemed to me only too plainly that he was aware of me i crossed great russell street glancing over my shoulder as i did so and went some way along montague street before i realised what i was running towards  then i became aware of a blare of music and looking along the street saw a number of people advancing out of russell square red shirts and the banner of the salvation army to the fore such a crowd chanting in the roadway and scoffing on the pavement i could not hope to penetrate and dreading to go back and farther from home again and deciding on the spur of the moment i ran up the white steps of a house facing the museum railings and stood there until the crowd should have passed happily the dog stopped at the noise of the band too hesitated and turned tail running back to bloomsbury square again  on came the band bawling with unconscious irony some hymn about when shall we see his face and it seemed an interminable time to me before the tide of the crowd washed along the pavement by me thud thud thud came the drum with a vibrating resonance and for the moment i did not notice two urchins stopping at the railings by me see em said one see what said the other whythem footmarksbare like what you makes in mud  i looked down and saw the youngsters had stopped and were gaping at the muddy footmarks i had left behind me up the newly whitened steps the passing people elbowed and jostled them but their confounded intelligence was arrested thud thud thud when thud shall we see thud his face thud thud theres a barefoot man gone up them steps or i dont know nothing said one and he aint never come down again and his foot was ableeding  the thick of the crowd had already passed looky there ted quoth the younger of the detectives with the sharpness of surprise in his voice and pointed straight to my feet i looked down and saw at once the dim suggestion of their outline sketched in splashes of mud for a moment i was paralysed  why thats rum said the elder dashed rum its just like the ghost of a foot aint it he hesitated and advanced with outstretched hand a man pulled up short to see what he was catching and then a girl in another moment he would have touched me then i saw what to do i made a step the boy started back with an exclamation and with a rapid movement i swung myself over into the portico of the next house but the smaller boy was sharpeyed enough to follow the movement and before i was well down the steps and upon the pavement he had recovered from his momentary astonishment and was shouting out that the feet had gone over the wall  they rushed round and saw my new footmarks flash into being on the lower step and upon the pavement whats up asked someone feet look feet running  everybody in the road except my three pursuers was pouring along after the salvation army and this blow not only impeded me but them there was an eddy of surprise and interrogation at the cost of bowling over one young fellow i got through and in another moment i was rushing headlong round the circuit of russell square with six or seven astonished people following my footmarks there was no time for explanation or else the whole host would have been after me  twice i doubled round corners thrice i crossed the road and came back upon my tracks and then as my feet grew hot and dry the damp impressions began to fade at last i had a breathing space and rubbed my feet clean with my hands and so got away altogether the last i saw of the chase was a little group of a dozen people perhaps studying with infinite perplexity a slowly drying footprint that had resulted from a puddle in tavistock square a footprint as isolated and incomprehensible to them as crusoes solitary discovery  this running warmed me to a certain extent and i went on with a better courage through the maze of less frequented roads that runs hereabouts my back had now become very stiff and sore my tonsils were painful from the cabmans fingers and the skin of my neck had been scratched by his nails my feet hurt exceedingly and i was lame from a little cut on one foot i saw in time a blind man approaching me and fled limping for i feared his subtle intuitions once or twice accidental collisions occurred and i left people amazed with unaccountable curses ringing in their ears then came something silent and quiet against my face and across the square fell a thin veil of slowly falling flakes of snow i had caught a cold and do as i would i could not avoid an occasional sneeze and every dog that came in sight with its pointing nose and curious sniffing was a terror to me  then came men and boys running first one and then others and shouting as they ran it was a fire they ran in the direction of my lodging and looking back down a street i saw a mass of black smoke streaming up above the roofs and telephone wires it was my lodging burning my clothes my apparatus all my resources indeed except my chequebook and the three volumes of memoranda that awaited me in great portland street were there burning i had burnt my boatsif ever a man did the place was blazing  the invisible man paused and thought kemp glanced nervously out of the window yes he said go on    chapter xxii  in the emporium   so last january with the beginning of a snowstorm in the air about meand if it settled on me it would betray meweary cold painful inexpressibly wretched and still but half convinced of my invisible quality i began this new life to which i am committed i had no refuge no appliances no human being in the world in whom i could confide to have told my secret would have given me awaymade a mere show and rarity of me nevertheless i was halfminded to accost some passerby and throw myself upon his mercy but i knew too clearly the terror and brutal cruelty my advances would evoke i made no plans in the street my sole object was to get shelter from the snow to get myself covered and warm then i might hope to plan but even to me an invisible man the rows of london houses stood latched barred and bolted impregnably  only one thing could i see clearly before methe cold exposure and misery of the snowstorm and the night  and then i had a brilliant idea i turned down one of the roads leading from gower street to tottenham court road and found myself outside omniums the big establishment where everything is to be boughtyou know the place meat grocery linen furniture clothing oil paintings evena huge meandering collection of shops rather than a shop i had thought i should find the doors open but they were closed and as i stood in the wide entrance a carriage stopped outside and a man in uniformyou know the kind of personage with omnium on his capflung open the door i contrived to enter and walking down the shopit was a department where they were selling ribbons and gloves and stockings and that kind of thingcame to a more spacious region devoted to picnic baskets and wicker furniture  i did not feel safe there however people were going to and fro and i prowled restlessly about until i came upon a huge section in an upper floor containing multitudes of bedsteads and over these i clambered and found a restingplace at last among a huge pile of folded flock mattresses the place was already lit up and agreeably warm and i decided to remain where i was keeping a cautious eye on the two or three sets of shopmen and customers who were meandering through the place until closing time came then i should be able i thought to rob the place for food and clothing and disguised prowl through it and examine its resources perhaps sleep on some of the bedding that seemed an acceptable plan my idea was to procure clothing to make myself a muffled but acceptable figure to get money and then to recover my books and parcels where they awaited me take a lodging somewhere and elaborate plans for the complete realisation of the advantages my invisibility gave me as i still imagined over my fellowmen  closing time arrived quickly enough it could not have been more than an hour after i took up my position on the mattresses before i noticed the blinds of the windows being drawn and customers being marched doorward and then a number of brisk young men began with remarkable alacrity to tidy up the goods that remained disturbed i left my lair as the crowds diminished and prowled cautiously out into the less desolate parts of the shop i was really surprised to observe how rapidly the young men and women whipped away the goods displayed for sale during the day all the boxes of goods the hanging fabrics the festoons of lace the boxes of sweets in the grocery section the displays of this and that were being whipped down folded up slapped into tidy receptacles and everything that could not be taken down and put away had sheets of some coarse stuff like sacking flung over them finally all the chairs were turned up on to the counters leaving the floor clear directly each of these young people had done he or she made promptly for the door with such an expression of animation as i have rarely observed in a shop assistant before then came a lot of youngsters scattering sawdust and carrying pails and brooms i had to dodge to get out of the way and as it was my ankle got stung with the sawdust for some time wandering through the swathed and darkened departments i could hear the brooms at work and at last a good hour or more after the shop had been closed came a noise of locking doors silence came upon the place and i found myself wandering through the vast and intricate shops galleries showrooms of the place alone it was very still in one place i remember passing near one of the tottenham court road entrances and listening to the tapping of bootheels of the passersby  my first visit was to the place where i had seen stockings and gloves for sale it was dark and i had the devil of a hunt after matches which i found at last in the drawer of the little cash desk then i had to get a candle i had to tear down wrappings and ransack a number of boxes and drawers but at last i managed to turn out what i sought the box label called them lambswool pants and lambswool vests then socks a thick comforter and then i went to the clothing place and got trousers a lounge jacket an overcoat and a slouch hata clerical sort of hat with the brim turned down i began to feel a human being again and my next thought was food  upstairs was a refreshment department and there i got cold meat there was coffee still in the urn and i lit the gas and warmed it up again and altogether i did not do badly afterwards prowling through the place in search of blanketsi had to put up at last with a heap of down quiltsi came upon a grocery section with a lot of chocolate and candied fruits more than was good for me indeedand some white burgundy and near that was a toy department and i had a brilliant idea i found some artificial nosesdummy noses you know and i thought of dark spectacles but omniums had no optical department my nose had been a difficulty indeedi had thought of paint but the discovery set my mind running on wigs and masks and the like finally i went to sleep in a heap of down quilts very warm and comfortable  my last thoughts before sleeping were the most agreeable i had had since the change i was in a state of physical serenity and that was reflected in my mind i thought that i should be able to slip out unobserved in the morning with my clothes upon me muffling my face with a white wrapper i had taken purchase with the money i had taken spectacles and so forth and so complete my disguise i lapsed into disorderly dreams of all the fantastic things that had happened during the last few days i saw the ugly little jew of a landlord vociferating in his rooms i saw his two sons marvelling and the wrinkled old womans gnarled face as she asked for her cat i experienced again the strange sensation of seeing the cloth disappear and so i came round to the windy hillside and the sniffing old clergyman mumbling earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust at my fathers open grave  you also said a voice and suddenly i was being forced towards the grave i struggled shouted appealed to the mourners but they continued stonily following the service the old clergyman too never faltered droning and sniffing through the ritual i realised i was invisible and inaudible that overwhelming forces had their grip on me i struggled in vain i was forced over the brink the coffin rang hollow as i fell upon it and the gravel came flying after me in spadefuls nobody heeded me nobody was aware of me i made convulsive struggles and awoke  the pale london dawn had come the place was full of a chilly grey light that filtered round the edges of the window blinds i sat up and for a time i could not think where this ample apartment with its counters its piles of rolled stuff its heap of quilts and cushions its iron pillars might be then as recollection came back to me i heard voices in conversation  then far down the place in the brighter light of some department which had already raised its blinds i saw two men approaching i scrambled to my feet looking about me for some way of escape and even as i did so the sound of my movement made them aware of me i suppose they saw merely a figure moving quietly and quickly away whos that cried one and stop there shouted the other i dashed around a corner and came full tilta faceless figure mind youon a lanky lad of fifteen he yelled and i bowled him over rushed past him turned another corner and by a happy inspiration threw myself behind a counter in another moment feet went running past and i heard voices shouting all hands to the doors asking what was up and giving one another advice how to catch me  lying on the ground i felt scared out of my wits butodd as it may seemit did not occur to me at the moment to take off my clothes as i should have done i had made up my mind i suppose to get away in them and that ruled me and then down the vista of the counters came a bawling of here he is  i sprang to my feet whipped a chair off the counter and sent it whirling at the fool who had shouted turned came into another round a corner sent him spinning and rushed up the stairs he kept his footing gave a view hallo and came up the staircase hot after me up the staircase were piled a multitude of those brightcoloured pot thingswhat are they  art pots suggested kemp  thats it art pots well i turned at the top step and swung round plucked one out of a pile and smashed it on his silly head as he came at me the whole pile of pots went headlong and i heard shouting and footsteps running from all parts i made a mad rush for the refreshment place and there was a man in white like a man cook who took up the chase i made one last desperate turn and found myself among lamps and ironmongery i went behind the counter of this and waited for my cook and as he bolted in at the head of the chase i doubled him up with a lamp down he went and i crouched down behind the counter and began whipping off my clothes as fast as i could coat jacket trousers shoes were all right but a lambswool vest fits a man like a skin i heard more men coming my cook was lying quiet on the other side of the counter stunned or scared speechless and i had to make another dash for it like a rabbit hunted out of a woodpile  this way policeman i heard someone shouting i found myself in my bedstead storeroom again and at the end of a wilderness of wardrobes i rushed among them went flat got rid of my vest after infinite wriggling and stood a free man again panting and scared as the policeman and three of the shopmen came round the corner they made a rush for the vest and pants and collared the trousers hes dropping his plunder said one of the young men he must be somewhere here  but they did not find me all the same  i stood watching them hunt for me for a time and cursing my illluck in losing the clothes then i went into the refreshmentroom drank a little milk i found there and sat down by the fire to consider my position  in a little while two assistants came in and began to talk over the business very excitedly and like the fools they were i heard a magnified account of my depredations and other speculations as to my whereabouts then i fell to scheming again the insurmountable difficulty of the place especially now it was alarmed was to get any plunder out of it i went down into the warehouse to see if there was any chance of packing and addressing a parcel but i could not understand the system of checking about eleven oclock the snow having thawed as it fell and the day being finer and a little warmer than the previous one i decided that the emporium was hopeless and went out again exasperated at my want of success with only the vaguest plans of action in my mind    chapter xxiii  in drury lane   but you begin now to realise said the invisible man the full disadvantage of my condition i had no shelterno coveringto get clothing was to forego all my advantage to make myself a strange and terrible thing i was fasting for to eat to fill myself with unassimilated matter would be to become grotesquely visible again  i never thought of that said kemp  nor had i and the snow had warned me of other dangers i could not go abroad in snowit would settle on me and expose me rain too would make me a watery outline a glistening surface of a mana bubble and fogi should be like a fainter bubble in a fog a surface a greasy glimmer of humanity moreover as i went abroadin the london airi gathered dirt about my ankles floating smuts and dust upon my skin i did not know how long it would be before i should become visible from that cause also but i saw clearly it could not be for long  not in london at any rate  i went into the slums towards great portland street and found myself at the end of the street in which i had lodged i did not go that way because of the crowd halfway down it opposite to the still smoking ruins of the house i had fired my most immediate problem was to get clothing what to do with my face puzzled me then i saw in one of those little miscellaneous shopsnews sweets toys stationery belated christmas tomfoolery and so forthan array of masks and noses i realised that problem was solved in a flash i saw my course i turned about no longer aimless and wentcircuitously in order to avoid the busy ways towards the back streets north of the strand for i remembered though not very distinctly where that some theatrical costumiers had shops in that district  the day was cold with a nipping wind down the northward running streets i walked fast to avoid being overtaken every crossing was a danger every passenger a thing to watch alertly one man as i was about to pass him at the top of bedford street turned upon me abruptly and came into me sending me into the road and almost under the wheel of a passing hansom the verdict of the cabrank was that he had had some sort of stroke i was so unnerved by this encounter that i went into covent garden market and sat down for some time in a quiet corner by a stall of violets panting and trembling i found i had caught a fresh cold and had to turn out after a time lest my sneezes should attract attention  at last i reached the object of my quest a dirty flyblown little shop in a byway near drury lane with a window full of tinsel robes sham jewels wigs slippers dominoes and theatrical photographs the shop was oldfashioned and low and dark and the house rose above it for four storeys dark and dismal i peered through the window and seeing no one within entered the opening of the door set a clanking bell ringing i left it open and walked round a bare costume stand into a corner behind a cheval glass for a minute or so no one came then i heard heavy feet striding across a room and a man appeared down the shop  my plans were now perfectly definite i proposed to make my way into the house secrete myself upstairs watch my opportunity and when everything was quiet rummage out a wig mask spectacles and costume and go into the world perhaps a grotesque but still a credible figure and incidentally of course i could rob the house of any available money  the man who had just entered the shop was a short slight hunched beetlebrowed man with long arms and very short bandy legs apparently i had interrupted a meal he stared about the shop with an expression of expectation this gave way to surprise and then to anger as he saw the shop empty damn the boys he said he went to stare up and down the street he came in again in a minute kicked the door to with his foot spitefully and went muttering back to the house door  i came forward to follow him and at the noise of my movement he stopped dead i did so too startled by his quickness of ear he slammed the house door in my face  i stood hesitating suddenly i heard his quick footsteps returning and the door reopened he stood looking about the shop like one who was still not satisfied then murmuring to himself he examined the back of the counter and peered behind some fixtures then he stood doubtful he had left the house door open and i slipped into the inner room  it was a queer little room poorly furnished and with a number of big masks in the corner on the table was his belated breakfast and it was a confoundedly exasperating thing for me kemp to have to sniff his coffee and stand watching while he came in and resumed his meal and his table manners were irritating three doors opened into the little room one going upstairs and one down but they were all shut i could not get out of the room while he was there i could scarcely move because of his alertness and there was a draught down my back twice i strangled a sneeze just in time  the spectacular quality of my sensations was curious and novel but for all that i was heartily tired and angry long before he had done his eating but at last he made an end and putting his beggarly crockery on the black tin tray upon which he had had his teapot and gathering all the crumbs up on the mustard stained cloth he took the whole lot of things after him his burden prevented his shutting the door behind himas he would have done i never saw such a man for shutting doorsand i followed him into a very dirty underground kitchen and scullery i had the pleasure of seeing him begin to wash up and then finding no good in keeping down there and the brick floor being cold on my feet i returned upstairs and sat in his chair by the fire it was burning low and scarcely thinking i put on a little coal the noise of this brought him up at once and he stood aglare he peered about the room and was within an ace of touching me even after that examination he scarcely seemed satisfied he stopped in the doorway and took a final inspection before he went down  i waited in the little parlour for an age and at last he came up and opened the upstairs door i just managed to get by him  on the staircase he stopped suddenly so that i very nearly blundered into him he stood looking back right into my face and listening i could have sworn he said his long hairy hand pulled at his lower lip his eye went up and down the staircase then he grunted and went on up again  his hand was on the handle of a door and then he stopped again with the same puzzled anger on his face he was becoming aware of the faint sounds of my movements about him the man must have had diabolically acute hearing he suddenly flashed into rage if theres anyone in this house he cried with an oath and left the threat unfinished he put his hand in his pocket failed to find what he wanted and rushing past me went blundering noisily and pugnaciously downstairs but i did not follow him i sat on the head of the staircase until his return  presently he came up again still muttering he opened the door of the room and before i could enter slammed it in my face  i resolved to explore the house and spent some time in doing so as noiselessly as possible the house was very old and tumbledown damp so that the paper in the attics was peeling from the walls and rat infested some of the door handles were stiff and i was afraid to turn them several rooms i did inspect were unfurnished and others were littered with theatrical lumber bought secondhand i judged from its appearance in one room next to his i found a lot of old clothes i began routing among these and in my eagerness forgot again the evident sharpness of his ears i heard a stealthy footstep and looking up just in time saw him peering in at the tumbled heap and holding an oldfashioned revolver in his hand i stood perfectly still while he stared about openmouthed and suspicious it must have been her he said slowly damn her  he shut the door quietly and immediately i heard the key turn in the lock then his footsteps retreated i realised abruptly that i was locked in for a minute i did not know what to do i walked from door to window and back and stood perplexed a gust of anger came upon me but i decided to inspect the clothes before i did anything further and my first attempt brought down a pile from an upper shelf this brought him back more sinister than ever that time he actually touched me jumped back with amazement and stood astonished in the middle of the room  presently he calmed a little rats he said in an undertone fingers on lips he was evidently a little scared i edged quietly out of the room but a plank creaked then the infernal little brute started going all over the house revolver in hand and locking door after door and pocketing the keys when i realised what he was up to i had a fit of ragei could hardly control myself sufficiently to watch my opportunity by this time i knew he was alone in the house and so i made no more ado but knocked him on the head  knocked him on the head exclaimed kemp  yesstunned himas he was going downstairs hit him from behind with a stool that stood on the landing he went downstairs like a bag of old boots  buti say the common conventions of humanity  are all very well for common people but the point was kemp that i had to get out of that house in a disguise without his seeing me i couldnt think of any other way of doing it and then i gagged him with a louis quatorze vest and tied him up in a sheet  tied him up in a sheet  made a sort of bag of it it was rather a good idea to keep the idiot scared and quiet and a devilish hard thing to get out ofhead away from the string my dear kemp its no good your sitting glaring as though i was a murderer it had to be done he had his revolver if once he saw me he would be able to describe me  but still said kemp in englandtoday and the man was in his own house and you werewell robbing  robbing confound it youll call me a thief next surely kemp youre not fool enough to dance on the old strings cant you see my position  and his too said kemp  the invisible man stood up sharply what do you mean to say  kemps face grew a trifle hard he was about to speak and checked himself i suppose after all he said with a sudden change of manner the thing had to be done you were in a fix but still  of course i was in a fixan infernal fix and he made me wild toohunting me about the house fooling about with his revolver locking and unlocking doors he was simply exasperating you dont blame me do you you dont blame me  i never blame anyone said kemp its quite out of fashion what did you do next  i was hungry downstairs i found a loaf and some rank cheesemore than sufficient to satisfy my hunger i took some brandy and water and then went up past my impromptu baghe was lying quite stillto the room containing the old clothes this looked out upon the street two lace curtains brown with dirt guarding the window i went and peered out through their interstices outside the day was brightby contrast with the brown shadows of the dismal house in which i found myself dazzlingly bright a brisk traffic was going by fruit carts a hansom a fourwheeler with a pile of boxes a fishmongers cart i turned with spots of colour swimming before my eyes to the shadowy fixtures behind me my excitement was giving place to a clear apprehension of my position again the room was full of a faint scent of benzoline used i suppose in cleaning the garments  i began a systematic search of the place i should judge the hunchback had been alone in the house for some time he was a curious person everything that could possibly be of service to me i collected in the clothes storeroom and then i made a deliberate selection i found a handbag i thought a suitable possession and some powder rouge and stickingplaster  i had thought of painting and powdering my face and all that there was to show of me in order to render myself visible but the disadvantage of this lay in the fact that i should require turpentine and other appliances and a considerable amount of time before i could vanish again finally i chose a mask of the better type slightly grotesque but not more so than many human beings dark glasses greyish whiskers and a wig i could find no underclothing but that i could buy subsequently and for the time i swathed myself in calico dominoes and some white cashmere scarfs i could find no socks but the hunchbacks boots were rather a loose fit and sufficed in a desk in the shop were three sovereigns and about thirty shillings worth of silver and in a locked cupboard i burst in the inner room were eight pounds in gold i could go forth into the world again equipped  then came a curious hesitation was my appearance really credible i tried myself with a little bedroom lookingglass inspecting myself from every point of view to discover any forgotten chink but it all seemed sound i was grotesque to the theatrical pitch a stage miser but i was certainly not a physical impossibility gathering confidence i took my lookingglass down into the shop pulled down the shop blinds and surveyed myself from every point of view with the help of the cheval glass in the corner  i spent some minutes screwing up my courage and then unlocked the shop door and marched out into the street leaving the little man to get out of his sheet again when he liked in five minutes a dozen turnings intervened between me and the costumiers shop no one appeared to notice me very pointedly my last difficulty seemed overcome  he stopped again  and you troubled no more about the hunchback said kemp  no said the invisible man nor have i heard what became of him i suppose he untied himself or kicked himself out the knots were pretty tight  he became silent and went to the window and stared out  what happened when you went out into the strand  ohdisillusionment again i thought my troubles were over practically i thought i had impunity to do whatever i chose everythingsave to give away my secret so i thought whatever i did whatever the consequences might be was nothing to me i had merely to fling aside my garments and vanish no person could hold me i could take my money where i found it i decided to treat myself to a sumptuous feast and then put up at a good hotel and accumulate a new outfit of property i felt amazingly confident its not particularly pleasant recalling that i was an ass i went into a place and was already ordering lunch when it occurred to me that i could not eat unless i exposed my invisible face i finished ordering the lunch told the man i should be back in ten minutes and went out exasperated i dont know if you have ever been disappointed in your appetite  not quite so badly said kemp but i can imagine it  i could have smashed the silly devils at last faint with the desire for tasteful food i went into another place and demanded a private room i am disfigured i said badly they looked at me curiously but of course it was not their affairand so at last i got my lunch it was not particularly well served but it sufficed and when i had had it i sat over a cigar trying to plan my line of action and outside a snowstorm was beginning  the more i thought it over kemp the more i realised what a helpless absurdity an invisible man wasin a cold and dirty climate and a crowded civilised city before i made this mad experiment i had dreamt of a thousand advantages that afternoon it seemed all disappointment i went over the heads of the things a man reckons desirable no doubt invisibility made it possible to get them but it made it impossible to enjoy them when they are got ambitionwhat is the good of pride of place when you cannot appear there what is the good of the love of woman when her name must needs be delilah i have no taste for politics for the blackguardisms of fame for philanthropy for sport what was i to do and for this i had become a wrappedup mystery a swathed and bandaged caricature of a man  he paused and his attitude suggested a roving glance at the window  but how did you get to iping said kemp anxious to keep his guest busy talking  i went there to work i had one hope it was a half idea i have it still it is a full blown idea now a way of getting back of restoring what i have done when i choose when i have done all i mean to do invisibly and that is what i chiefly want to talk to you about now  you went straight to iping  yes i had simply to get my three volumes of memoranda and my chequebook my luggage and underclothing order a quantity of chemicals to work out this idea of minei will show you the calculations as soon as i get my booksand then i started jove i remember the snowstorm now and the accursed bother it was to keep the snow from damping my pasteboard nose  at the end said kemp the day before yesterday when they found you out you ratherto judge by the papers  i did rather did i kill that fool of a constable  no said kemp hes expected to recover  thats his luck then i clean lost my temper the fools why couldnt they leave me alone and that grocer lout  there are no deaths expected said kemp  i dont know about that tramp of mine said the invisible man with an unpleasant laugh  by heaven kemp you dont know what rage is  to have worked for years to have planned and plotted and then to get some fumbling purblind idiot messing across your course  every conceivable sort of silly creature that has ever been created has been sent to cross me  if i have much more of it i shall go wildi shall start mowing em  as it is theyve made things a thousand times more difficult  no doubt its exasperating said kemp drily    chapter xxiv  the plan that failed   but now said kemp with a side glance out of the window what are we to do  he moved nearer his guest as he spoke in such a manner as to prevent the possibility of a sudden glimpse of the three men who were advancing up the hill roadwith an intolerable slowness as it seemed to kemp  what were you planning to do when you were heading for port burdock had you any plan  i was going to clear out of the country but i have altered that plan rather since seeing you i thought it would be wise now the weather is hot and invisibility possible to make for the south especially as my secret was known and everyone would be on the lookout for a masked and muffled man you have a line of steamers from here to france my idea was to get aboard one and run the risks of the passage thence i could go by train into spain or else get to algiers it would not be difficult there a man might always be invisibleand yet live and do things i was using that tramp as a money box and luggage carrier until i decided how to get my books and things sent over to meet me  thats clear  and then the filthy brute must needs try and rob me he has hidden my books kemp hidden my books if i can lay my hands on him  best plan to get the books out of him first  but where is he do you know  hes in the town police station locked up by his own request in the strongest cell in the place  cur said the invisible man  but that hangs up your plans a little  we must get those books those books are vital  certainly said kemp a little nervously wondering if he heard footsteps outside certainly we must get those books but that wont be difficult if he doesnt know theyre for you  no said the invisible man and thought  kemp tried to think of something to keep the talk going but the invisible man resumed of his own accord  blundering into your house kemp he said changes all my plans for you are a man that can understand in spite of all that has happened in spite of this publicity of the loss of my books of what i have suffered there still remain great possibilities huge possibilities  you have told no one i am here he asked abruptly  kemp hesitated that was implied he said  no one insisted griffin  not a soul  ah now the invisible man stood up and sticking his arms akimbo began to pace the study  i made a mistake kemp a huge mistake in carrying this thing through alone i have wasted strength time opportunities aloneit is wonderful how little a man can do alone to rob a little to hurt a little and there is the end  what i want kemp is a goalkeeper a helper and a hidingplace an arrangement whereby i can sleep and eat and rest in peace and unsuspected i must have a confederate with a confederate with food and resta thousand things are possible  hitherto i have gone on vague lines we have to consider all that invisibility means all that it does not mean it means little advantage for eavesdropping and so forthone makes sounds its of little helpa little help perhapsin housebreaking and so forth once youve caught me you could easily imprison me but on the other hand i am hard to catch this invisibility in fact is only good in two cases its useful in getting away its useful in approaching its particularly useful therefore in killing i can walk round a man whatever weapon he has choose my point strike as i like dodge as i like escape as i like  kemps hand went to his moustache was that a movement downstairs  and it is killing we must do kemp  it is killing we must do repeated kemp im listening to your plan griffin but im not agreeing mind why killing  not wanton killing but a judicious slaying the point is they know there is an invisible manas well as we know there is an invisible man and that invisible man kemp must now establish a reign of terror yes no doubt its startling but i mean it a reign of terror he must take some town like your burdock and terrify and dominate it he must issue his orders he can do that in a thousand waysscraps of paper thrust under doors would suffice and all who disobey his orders he must kill and kill all who would defend them  humph said kemp no longer listening to griffin but to the sound of his front door opening and closing  it seems to me griffin he said to cover his wandering attention that your confederate would be in a difficult position  no one would know he was a confederate said the invisible man eagerly and then suddenly hush whats that downstairs  nothing said kemp and suddenly began to speak loud and fast i dont agree to this griffin he said understand me i dont agree to this why dream of playing a game against the race how can you hope to gain happiness dont be a lone wolf publish your results take the worldtake the nation at leastinto your confidence think what you might do with a million helpers  the invisible man interruptedarm extended there are footsteps coming upstairs he said in a low voice  nonsense said kemp  let me see said the invisible man and advanced arm extended to the door  and then things happened very swiftly kemp hesitated for a second and then moved to intercept him the invisible man started and stood still traitor cried the voice and suddenly the dressinggown opened and sitting down the unseen began to disrobe kemp made three swift steps to the door and forthwith the invisible manhis legs had vanishedsprang to his feet with a shout kemp flung the door open  as it opened there came a sound of hurrying feet downstairs and voices  with a quick movement kemp thrust the invisible man back sprang aside and slammed the door the key was outside and ready in another moment griffin would have been alone in the belvedere study a prisoner save for one little thing the key had been slipped in hastily that morning as kemp slammed the door it fell noisily upon the carpet  kemps face became white he tried to grip the door handle with both hands for a moment he stood lugging then the door gave six inches but he got it closed again the second time it was jerked a foot wide and the dressinggown came wedging itself into the opening his throat was gripped by invisible fingers and he left his hold on the handle to defend himself he was forced back tripped and pitched heavily into the corner of the landing the empty dressinggown was flung on the top of him  halfway up the staircase was colonel adye the recipient of kemps letter the chief of the burdock police he was staring aghast at the sudden appearance of kemp followed by the extraordinary sight of clothing tossing empty in the air he saw kemp felled and struggling to his feet he saw him rush forward and go down again felled like an ox  then suddenly he was struck violently by nothing a vast weight it seemed leapt upon him and he was hurled headlong down the staircase with a grip on his throat and a knee in his groin an invisible foot trod on his back a ghostly patter passed downstairs he heard the two police officers in the hall shout and run and the front door of the house slammed violently  he rolled over and sat up staring he saw staggering down the staircase kemp dusty and disheveled one side of his face white from a blow his lip bleeding and a pink dressinggown and some underclothing held in his arms  my god cried kemp the games up hes gone    chapter xxv  the hunting of the invisible man   for a space kemp was too inarticulate to make adye understand the swift things that had just happened they stood on the landing kemp speaking swiftly the grotesque swathings of griffin still on his arm but presently adye began to grasp something of the situation  he is mad said kemp inhuman he is pure selfishness he thinks of nothing but his own advantage his own safety i have listened to such a story this morning of brutal selfseeking he has wounded men he will kill them unless we can prevent him he will create a panic nothing can stop him he is going out nowfurious  he must be caught said adye that is certain  but how cried kemp and suddenly became full of ideas you must begin at once you must set every available man to work you must prevent his leaving this district once he gets away he may go through the countryside as he wills killing and maiming he dreams of a reign of terror a reign of terror i tell you you must set a watch on trains and roads and shipping the garrison must help you must wire for help the only thing that may keep him here is the thought of recovering some books of notes he counts of value i will tell you of that there is a man in your police stationmarvel  i know said adye i know those booksyes but the tramp  says he hasnt them but he thinks the tramp has and you must prevent him from eating or sleeping day and night the country must be astir for him food must be locked up and secured all food so that he will have to break his way to it the houses everywhere must be barred against him heaven send us cold nights and rain the whole countryside must begin hunting and keep hunting i tell you adye he is a danger a disaster unless he is pinned and secured it is frightful to think of the things that may happen  what else can we do said adye i must go down at once and begin organising but why not come yesyou come too come and we must hold a sort of council of warget hopps to helpand the railway managers by jove its urgent come alongtell me as we go what else is there we can do put that stuff down  in another moment adye was leading the way downstairs they found the front door open and the policemen standing outside staring at empty air hes got away sir said one  we must go to the central station at once said adye one of you go on down and get a cab to come up and meet usquickly and now kemp what else  dogs said kemp get dogs they dont see him but they wind him get dogs  good said adye its not generally known but the prison officials over at halstead know a man with bloodhounds dogs what else  bear in mind said kemp his food shows after eating his food shows until it is assimilated so that he has to hide after eating you must keep on beating every thicket every quiet corner and put all weaponsall implements that might be weapons away he cant carry such things for long and what he can snatch up and strike men with must be hidden away  good again said adye we shall have him yet  and on the roads said kemp and hesitated  yes said adye  powdered glass said kemp its cruel i know but think of what he may do  adye drew the air in sharply between his teeth its unsportsmanlike i dont know but ill have powdered glass got ready if he goes too far  the mans become inhuman i tell you said kemp i am as sure he will establish a reign of terrorso soon as he has got over the emotions of this escapeas i am sure i am talking to you our only chance is to be ahead he has cut himself off from his kind his blood be upon his own head    chapter xxvi  the wicksteed murder   the invisible man seems to have rushed out of kemps house in a state of blind fury a little child playing near kemps gateway was violently caught up and thrown aside so that its ankle was broken and thereafter for some hours the invisible man passed out of human perceptions no one knows where he went nor what he did but one can imagine him hurrying through the hot june forenoon up the hill and on to the open downland behind port burdock raging and despairing at his intolerable fate and sheltering at last heated and weary amid the thickets of hintondean to piece together again his shattered schemes against his species that seems the most probable refuge for him for there it was he reasserted himself in a grimly tragical manner about two in the afternoon  one wonders what his state of mind may have been during that time and what plans he devised no doubt he was almost ecstatically exasperated by kemps treachery and though we may be able to understand the motives that led to that deceit we may still imagine and even sympathise a little with the fury the attempted surprise must have occasioned perhaps something of the stunned astonishment of his oxford street experiences may have returned to him for he had evidently counted on kemps cooperation in his brutal dream of a terrorised world at any rate he vanished from human ken about midday and no living witness can tell what he did until about halfpast two it was a fortunate thing perhaps for humanity but for him it was a fatal inaction  during that time a growing multitude of men scattered over the countryside were busy in the morning he had still been simply a legend a terror in the afternoon by virtue chiefly of kemps drily worded proclamation he was presented as a tangible antagonist to be wounded captured or overcome and the countryside began organising itself with inconceivable rapidity by two oclock even he might still have removed himself out of the district by getting aboard a train but after two that became impossible every passenger train along the lines on a great parallelogram between southampton manchester brighton and horsham travelled with locked doors and the goods traffic was almost entirely suspended and in a great circle of twenty miles round port burdock men armed with guns and bludgeons were presently setting out in groups of three and four with dogs to beat the roads and fields  mounted policemen rode along the country lanes stopping at every cottage and warning the people to lock up their houses and keep indoors unless they were armed and all the elementary schools had broken up by three oclock and the children scared and keeping together in groups were hurrying home kemps proclamationsigned indeed by adyewas posted over almost the whole district by four or five oclock in the afternoon it gave briefly but clearly all the conditions of the struggle the necessity of keeping the invisible man from food and sleep the necessity for incessant watchfulness and for a prompt attention to any evidence of his movements and so swift and decided was the action of the authorities so prompt and universal was the belief in this strange being that before nightfall an area of several hundred square miles was in a stringent state of siege and before nightfall too a thrill of horror went through the whole watching nervous countryside going from whispering mouth to mouth swift and certain over the length and breadth of the country passed the story of the murder of mr wicksteed  if our supposition that the invisible mans refuge was the hintondean thickets then we must suppose that in the early afternoon he sallied out again bent upon some project that involved the use of a weapon we cannot know what the project was but the evidence that he had the iron rod in hand before he met wicksteed is to me at least overwhelming  of course we can know nothing of the details of that encounter it occurred on the edge of a gravel pit not two hundred yards from lord burdocks lodge gate everything points to a desperate strugglethe trampled ground the numerous wounds mr wicksteed received his splintered walkingstick but why the attack was made save in a murderous frenzy it is impossible to imagine indeed the theory of madness is almost unavoidable mr wicksteed was a man of fortyfive or fortysix steward to lord burdock of inoffensive habits and appearance the very last person in the world to provoke such a terrible antagonist against him it would seem the invisible man used an iron rod dragged from a broken piece of fence he stopped this quiet man going quietly home to his midday meal attacked him beat down his feeble defences broke his arm felled him and smashed his head to a jelly  of course he must have dragged this rod out of the fencing before he met his victimhe must have been carrying it ready in his hand only two details beyond what has already been stated seem to bear on the matter one is the circumstance that the gravel pit was not in mr wicksteeds direct path home but nearly a couple of hundred yards out of his way the other is the assertion of a little girl to the effect that going to her afternoon school she saw the murdered man trotting in a peculiar manner across a field towards the gravel pit her pantomime of his action suggests a man pursuing something on the ground before him and striking at it ever and again with his walkingstick she was the last person to see him alive he passed out of her sight to his death the struggle being hidden from her only by a clump of beech trees and a slight depression in the ground  now this to the present writers mind at least lifts the murder out of the realm of the absolutely wanton we may imagine that griffin had taken the rod as a weapon indeed but without any deliberate intention of using it in murder wicksteed may then have come by and noticed this rod inexplicably moving through the air without any thought of the invisible manfor port burdock is ten miles awayhe may have pursued it it is quite conceivable that he may not even have heard of the invisible man one can then imagine the invisible man making offquietly in order to avoid discovering his presence in the neighbourhood and wicksteed excited and curious pursuing this unaccountably locomotive objectfinally striking at it  no doubt the invisible man could easily have distanced his middleaged pursuer under ordinary circumstances but the position in which wicksteeds body was found suggests that he had the ill luck to drive his quarry into a corner between a drift of stinging nettles and the gravel pit to those who appreciate the extraordinary irascibility of the invisible man the rest of the encounter will be easy to imagine  but this is pure hypothesis the only undeniable factsfor stories of children are often unreliableare the discovery of wicksteeds body done to death and of the bloodstained iron rod flung among the nettles the abandonment of the rod by griffin suggests that in the emotional excitement of the affair the purpose for which he took itif he had a purposewas abandoned he was certainly an intensely egotistical and unfeeling man but the sight of his victim his first victim bloody and pitiful at his feet may have released some long pent fountain of remorse which for a time may have flooded whatever scheme of action he had contrived  after the murder of mr wicksteed he would seem to have struck across the country towards the downland there is a story of a voice heard about sunset by a couple of men in a field near fern bottom it was wailing and laughing sobbing and groaning and ever and again it shouted it must have been queer hearing it drove up across the middle of a clover field and died away towards the hills  that afternoon the invisible man must have learnt something of the rapid use kemp had made of his confidences he must have found houses locked and secured he may have loitered about railway stations and prowled about inns and no doubt he read the proclamations and realised something of the nature of the campaign against him and as the evening advanced the fields became dotted here and there with groups of three or four men and noisy with the yelping of dogs these menhunters had particular instructions in the case of an encounter as to the way they should support one another but he avoided them all we may understand something of his exasperation and it could have been none the less because he himself had supplied the information that was being used so remorselessly against him for that day at least he lost heart for nearly twentyfour hours save when he turned on wicksteed he was a hunted man in the night he must have eaten and slept for in the morning he was himself again active powerful angry and malignant prepared for his last great struggle against the world    chapter xxvii  the siege of kemps house   kemp read a strange missive written in pencil on a greasy sheet of paper  you have been amazingly energetic and clever this letter ran though what you stand to gain by it i cannot imagine you are against me for a whole day you have chased me you have tried to rob me of a nights rest but i have had food in spite of you i have slept in spite of you and the game is only beginning the game is only beginning there is nothing for it but to start the terror this announces the first day of the terror port burdock is no longer under the queen tell your colonel of police and the rest of them it is under methe terror this is day one of year one of the new epochthe epoch of the invisible man i am invisible man the first to begin with the rule will be easy the first day there will be one execution for the sake of examplea man named kemp death starts for him today he may lock himself away hide himself away get guards about him put on armour if he likesdeath the unseen death is coming let him take precautions it will impress my people death starts from the pillar box by midday the letter will fall in as the postman comes along then off the game begins death starts help him not my people lest death fall upon you also today kemp is to die  kemp read this letter twice its no hoax he said thats his voice and he means it  he turned the folded sheet over and saw on the addressed side of it the postmark hintondean and the prosaic detail 2d to pay  he got up slowly leaving his lunch unfinishedthe letter had come by the one oclock postand went into his study he rang for his housekeeper and told her to go round the house at once examine all the fastenings of the windows and close all the shutters he closed the shutters of his study himself from a locked drawer in his bedroom he took a little revolver examined it carefully and put it into the pocket of his lounge jacket he wrote a number of brief notes one to colonel adye gave them to his servant to take with explicit instructions as to her way of leaving the house there is no danger he said and added a mental reservation to you he remained meditative for a space after doing this and then returned to his cooling lunch  he ate with gaps of thought finally he struck the table sharply we will have him he said and i am the bait he will come too far  he went up to the belvedere carefully shutting every door after him its a game he said an odd gamebut the chances are all for me mr griffin in spite of your invisibility griffin contra mundum  with a vengeance  he stood at the window staring at the hot hillside he must get food every dayand i dont envy him did he really sleep last night out in the open somewheresecure from collisions i wish we could get some good cold wet weather instead of the heat  he may be watching me now  he went close to the window something rapped smartly against the brickwork over the frame and made him start violently back  im getting nervous said kemp but it was five minutes before he went to the window again it must have been a sparrow he said  presently he heard the frontdoor bell ringing and hurried downstairs he unbolted and unlocked the door examined the chain put it up and opened cautiously without showing himself a familiar voice hailed him it was adye  your servants been assaulted kemp he said round the door  what exclaimed kemp  had that note of yours taken away from her hes close about here let me in  kemp released the chain and adye entered through as narrow an opening as possible he stood in the hall looking with infinite relief at kemp refastening the door note was snatched out of her hand scared her horribly shes down at the station hysterics hes close here what was it about  kemp swore  what a fool i was said kemp i might have known its not an hours walk from hintondean already  whats up said adye  look here said kemp and led the way into his study he handed adye the invisible mans letter adye read it and whistled softly and you said adye  proposed a traplike a fool said kemp and sent my proposal out by a maid servant to him  adye followed kemps profanity  hell clear out said adye  not he said kemp  a resounding smash of glass came from upstairs adye had a silvery glimpse of a little revolver half out of kemps pocket its a window upstairs said kemp and led the way up there came a second smash while they were still on the staircase when they reached the study they found two of the three windows smashed half the room littered with splintered glass and one big flint lying on the writing table the two men stopped in the doorway contemplating the wreckage kemp swore again and as he did so the third window went with a snap like a pistol hung starred for a moment and collapsed in jagged shivering triangles into the room  whats this for said adye  its a beginning said kemp  theres no way of climbing up here  not for a cat said kemp  no shutters  not here all the downstairs roomshullo  smash and then whack of boards hit hard came from downstairs confound him said kemp that must beyesits one of the bedrooms hes going to do all the house but hes a fool the shutters are up and the glass will fall outside hell cut his feet  another window proclaimed its destruction the two men stood on the landing perplexed i have it said adye let me have a stick or something and ill go down to the station and get the bloodhounds put on that ought to settle him theyre hard bynot ten minutes  another window went the way of its fellows  you havent a revolver asked adye  kemps hand went to his pocket then he hesitated i havent oneat least to spare  ill bring it back said adye youll be safe here  kemp ashamed of his momentary lapse from truthfulness handed him the weapon  now for the door said adye  as they stood hesitating in the hall they heard one of the firstfloor bedroom windows crack and clash kemp went to the door and began to slip the bolts as silently as possible his face was a little paler than usual you must step straight out said kemp in another moment adye was on the doorstep and the bolts were dropping back into the staples he hesitated for a moment feeling more comfortable with his back against the door then he marched upright and square down the steps he crossed the lawn and approached the gate a little breeze seemed to ripple over the grass something moved near him stop a bit said a voice and adye stopped dead and his hand tightened on the revolver  well said adye white and grim and every nerve tense  oblige me by going back to the house said the voice as tense and grim as adyes  sorry said adye a little hoarsely and moistened his lips with his tongue the voice was on his left front he thought suppose he were to take his luck with a shot  what are you going for said the voice and there was a quick movement of the two and a flash of sunlight from the open lip of adyes pocket  adye desisted and thought where i go he said slowly is my own business the words were still on his lips when an arm came round his neck his back felt a knee and he was sprawling backward he drew clumsily and fired absurdly and in another moment he was struck in the mouth and the revolver wrested from his grip he made a vain clutch at a slippery limb tried to struggle up and fell back damn said adye the voice laughed id kill you now if it wasnt the waste of a bullet it said he saw the revolver in midair six feet off covering him  well said adye sitting up  get up said the voice  adye stood up  attention said the voice and then fiercely dont try any games remember i can see your face if you cant see mine youve got to go back to the house  he wont let me in said adye  thats a pity said the invisible man ive got no quarrel with you  adye moistened his lips again he glanced away from the barrel of the revolver and saw the sea far off very blue and dark under the midday sun the smooth green down the white cliff of the head and the multitudinous town and suddenly he knew that life was very sweet his eyes came back to this little metal thing hanging between heaven and earth six yards away what am i to do he said sullenly  what am i to do asked the invisible man you will get help the only thing is for you to go back  i will try if he lets me in will you promise not to rush the door  ive got no quarrel with you said the voice  kemp had hurried upstairs after letting adye out and now crouching among the broken glass and peering cautiously over the edge of the study window sill he saw adye stand parleying with the unseen why doesnt he fire whispered kemp to himself then the revolver moved a little and the glint of the sunlight flashed in kemps eyes he shaded his eyes and tried to see the source of the blinding beam  surely he said adye has given up the revolver  promise not to rush the door adye was saying dont push a winning game too far give a man a chance  you go back to the house i tell you flatly i will not promise anything  adyes decision seemed suddenly made he turned towards the house walking slowly with his hands behind him kemp watched himpuzzled the revolver vanished flashed again into sight vanished again and became evident on a closer scrutiny as a little dark object following adye then things happened very quickly adye leapt backwards swung around clutched at this little object missed it threw up his hands and fell forward on his face leaving a little puff of blue in the air kemp did not hear the sound of the shot adye writhed raised himself on one arm fell forward and lay still  for a space kemp remained staring at the quiet carelessness of adyes attitude the afternoon was very hot and still nothing seemed stirring in all the world save a couple of yellow butterflies chasing each other through the shrubbery between the house and the road gate adye lay on the lawn near the gate the blinds of all the villas down the hillroad were drawn but in one little green summerhouse was a white figure apparently an old man asleep kemp scrutinised the surroundings of the house for a glimpse of the revolver but it had vanished his eyes came back to adye the game was opening well  then came a ringing and knocking at the front door that grew at last tumultuous but pursuant to kemps instructions the servants had locked themselves into their rooms this was followed by a silence kemp sat listening and then began peering cautiously out of the three windows one after another he went to the staircase head and stood listening uneasily he armed himself with his bedroom poker and went to examine the interior fastenings of the groundfloor windows again everything was safe and quiet he returned to the belvedere adye lay motionless over the edge of the gravel just as he had fallen coming along the road by the villas were the housemaid and two policemen  everything was deadly still the three people seemed very slow in approaching he wondered what his antagonist was doing  he started there was a smash from below he hesitated and went downstairs again suddenly the house resounded with heavy blows and the splintering of wood he heard a smash and the destructive clang of the iron fastenings of the shutters he turned the key and opened the kitchen door as he did so the shutters split and splintering came flying inward he stood aghast the window frame save for one crossbar was still intact but only little teeth of glass remained in the frame the shutters had been driven in with an axe and now the axe was descending in sweeping blows upon the window frame and the iron bars defending it then suddenly it leapt aside and vanished he saw the revolver lying on the path outside and then the little weapon sprang into the air he dodged back the revolver cracked just too late and a splinter from the edge of the closing door flashed over his head he slammed and locked the door and as he stood outside he heard griffin shouting and laughing then the blows of the axe with its splitting and smashing consequences were resumed  kemp stood in the passage trying to think in a moment the invisible man would be in the kitchen this door would not keep him a moment and then  a ringing came at the front door again it would be the policemen he ran into the hall put up the chain and drew the bolts he made the girl speak before he dropped the chain and the three people blundered into the house in a heap and kemp slammed the door again  the invisible man said kemp he has a revolver with two shotsleft hes killed adye shot him anyhow didnt you see him on the lawn hes lying there  who said one of the policemen  adye said kemp  we came in the back way said the girl  whats that smashing asked one of the policemen  hes in the kitchenor will be he has found an axe  suddenly the house was full of the invisible mans resounding blows on the kitchen door the girl stared towards the kitchen shuddered and retreated into the diningroom kemp tried to explain in broken sentences they heard the kitchen door give  this way said kemp starting into activity and bundled the policemen into the diningroom doorway  poker said kemp and rushed to the fender he handed the poker he had carried to the policeman and the diningroom one to the other he suddenly flung himself backward  whup said one policeman ducked and caught the axe on his poker the pistol snapped its penultimate shot and ripped a valuable sidney cooper the second policeman brought his poker down on the little weapon as one might knock down a wasp and sent it rattling to the floor  at the first clash the girl screamed stood screaming for a moment by the fireplace and then ran to open the shutterspossibly with an idea of escaping by the shattered window  the axe receded into the passage and fell to a position about two feet from the ground they could hear the invisible man breathing stand away you two he said i want that man kemp  we want you said the first policeman making a quick step forward and wiping with his poker at the voice the invisible man must have started back and he blundered into the umbrella stand  then as the policeman staggered with the swing of the blow he had aimed the invisible man countered with the axe the helmet crumpled like paper and the blow sent the man spinning to the floor at the head of the kitchen stairs but the second policeman aiming behind the axe with his poker hit something soft that snapped there was a sharp exclamation of pain and then the axe fell to the ground the policeman wiped again at vacancy and hit nothing he put his foot on the axe and struck again then he stood poker clubbed listening intent for the slightest movement  he heard the diningroom window open and a quick rush of feet within his companion rolled over and sat up with the blood running down between his eye and ear where is he asked the man on the floor  dont know ive hit him hes standing somewhere in the hall unless hes slipped past you doctor kempsir  pause  doctor kemp cried the policeman again  the second policeman began struggling to his feet he stood up suddenly the faint pad of bare feet on the kitchen stairs could be heard yap cried the first policeman and incontinently flung his poker it smashed a little gas bracket  he made as if he would pursue the invisible man downstairs then he thought better of it and stepped into the diningroom  doctor kemp he began and stopped short  doctor kemps a hero he said as his companion looked over his shoulder  the diningroom window was wide open and neither housemaid nor kemp was to be seen  the second policemans opinion of kemp was terse and vivid    chapter xxviii  the hunter hunted   mr heelas mr kemps nearest neighbour among the villa holders was asleep in his summer house when the siege of kemps house began mr heelas was one of the sturdy minority who refused to believe in all this nonsense about an invisible man his wife however as he was subsequently to be reminded did he insisted upon walking about his garden just as if nothing was the matter and he went to sleep in the afternoon in accordance with the custom of years he slept through the smashing of the windows and then woke up suddenly with a curious persuasion of something wrong he looked across at kemps house rubbed his eyes and looked again then he put his feet to the ground and sat listening he said he was damned but still the strange thing was visible the house looked as though it had been deserted for weeksafter a violent riot every window was broken and every window save those of the belvedere study was blinded by the internal shutters  i could have sworn it was all righthe looked at his watchtwenty minutes ago  he became aware of a measured concussion and the clash of glass far away in the distance and then as he sat openmouthed came a still more wonderful thing the shutters of the drawingroom window were flung open violently and the housemaid in her outdoor hat and garments appeared struggling in a frantic manner to throw up the sash suddenly a man appeared beside her helping herdr kemp in another moment the window was open and the housemaid was struggling out she pitched forward and vanished among the shrubs mr heelas stood up exclaiming vaguely and vehemently at all these wonderful things he saw kemp stand on the sill spring from the window and reappear almost instantaneously running along a path in the shrubbery and stooping as he ran like a man who evades observation he vanished behind a laburnum and appeared again clambering over a fence that abutted on the open down in a second he had tumbled over and was running at a tremendous pace down the slope towards mr heelas  lord cried mr heelas struck with an idea its that invisible man brute its right after all  with mr heelas to think things like that was to act and his cook watching him from the top window was amazed to see him come pelting towards the house at a good nine miles an hour there was a slamming of doors a ringing of bells and the voice of mr heelas bellowing like a bull shut the doors shut the windows shut everythingthe invisible man is coming instantly the house was full of screams and directions and scurrying feet he ran himself to shut the french windows that opened on the veranda as he did so kemps head and shoulders and knee appeared over the edge of the garden fence in another moment kemp had ploughed through the asparagus and was running across the tennis lawn to the house  you cant come in said mr heelas shutting the bolts im very sorry if hes after you but you cant come in  kemp appeared with a face of terror close to the glass rapping and then shaking frantically at the french window then seeing his efforts were useless he ran along the veranda vaulted the end and went to hammer at the side door then he ran round by the side gate to the front of the house and so into the hillroad and mr heelas staring from his windowa face of horrorhad scarcely witnessed kemp vanish ere the asparagus was being trampled this way and that by feet unseen at that mr heelas fled precipitately upstairs and the rest of the chase is beyond his purview but as he passed the staircase window he heard the side gate slam  emerging into the hillroad kemp naturally took the downward direction and so it was he came to run in his own person the very race he had watched with such a critical eye from the belvedere study only four days ago he ran it well for a man out of training and though his face was white and wet his wits were cool to the last he ran with wide strides and wherever a patch of rough ground intervened wherever there came a patch of raw flints or a bit of broken glass shone dazzling he crossed it and left the bare invisible feet that followed to take what line they would  for the first time in his life kemp discovered that the hillroad was indescribably vast and desolate and that the beginnings of the town far below at the hill foot were strangely remote never had there been a slower or more painful method of progression than running all the gaunt villas sleeping in the afternoon sun looked locked and barred no doubt they were locked and barredby his own orders but at any rate they might have kept a lookout for an eventuality like this the town was rising up now the sea had dropped out of sight behind it and people down below were stirring a tram was just arriving at the hill foot beyond that was the police station was that footsteps he heard behind him spurt  the people below were staring at him one or two were running and his breath was beginning to saw in his throat the tram was quite near now and the jolly cricketers was noisily barring its doors beyond the tram were posts and heaps of gravelthe drainage works he had a transitory idea of jumping into the tram and slamming the doors and then he resolved to go for the police station in another moment he had passed the door of the jolly cricketers and was in the blistering fag end of the street with human beings about him the tram driver and his helperarrested by the sight of his furious hastestood staring with the tram horses unhitched further on the astonished features of navvies appeared above the mounds of gravel  his pace broke a little and then he heard the swift pad of his pursuer and leapt forward again the invisible man he cried to the navvies with a vague indicative gesture and by an inspiration leapt the excavation and placed a burly group between him and the chase then abandoning the idea of the police station he turned into a little side street rushed by a greengrocers cart hesitated for the tenth of a second at the door of a sweetstuff shop and then made for the mouth of an alley that ran back into the main hill street again two or three little children were playing here and shrieked and scattered at his apparition and forthwith doors and windows opened and excited mothers revealed their hearts out he shot into hill street again three hundred yards from the tramline end and immediately he became aware of a tumultuous vociferation and running people  he glanced up the street towards the hill hardly a dozen yards off ran a huge navvy cursing in fragments and slashing viciously with a spade and hard behind him came the tram conductor with his fists clenched up the street others followed these two striking and shouting down towards the town men and women were running and he noticed clearly one man coming out of a shopdoor with a stick in his hand spread out spread out cried some one kemp suddenly grasped the altered condition of the chase he stopped and looked round panting hes close here he cried form a line across  he was hit hard under the ear and went reeling trying to face round towards his unseen antagonist he just managed to keep his feet and he struck a vain counter in the air then he was hit again under the jaw and sprawled headlong on the ground in another moment a knee compressed his diaphragm and a couple of eager hands gripped his throat but the grip of one was weaker than the other he grasped the wrists heard a cry of pain from his assailant and then the spade of the navvy came whirling through the air above him and struck something with a dull thud he felt a drop of moisture on his face the grip at his throat suddenly relaxed and with a convulsive effort kemp loosed himself grasped a limp shoulder and rolled uppermost he gripped the unseen elbows near the ground ive got him screamed kemp help helphold hes down hold his feet  in another second there was a simultaneous rush upon the struggle and a stranger coming into the road suddenly might have thought an exceptionally savage game of rugby football was in progress and there was no shouting after kemps cryonly a sound of blows and feet and heavy breathing  then came a mighty effort and the invisible man threw off a couple of his antagonists and rose to his knees kemp clung to him in front like a hound to a stag and a dozen hands gripped clutched and tore at the unseen the tram conductor suddenly got the neck and shoulders and lugged him back  down went the heap of struggling men again and rolled over there was i am afraid some savage kicking then suddenly a wild scream of mercy mercy that died down swiftly to a sound like choking  get back you fools cried the muffled voice of kemp and there was a vigorous shoving back of stalwart forms hes hurt i tell you stand back  there was a brief struggle to clear a space and then the circle of eager faces saw the doctor kneeling as it seemed fifteen inches in the air and holding invisible arms to the ground behind him a constable gripped invisible ankles  dont you leave go of en cried the big navvy holding a bloodstained spade hes shamming  hes not shamming said the doctor cautiously raising his knee and ill hold him his face was bruised and already going red he spoke thickly because of a bleeding lip he released one hand and seemed to be feeling at the face the mouths all wet he said and then good god  he stood up abruptly and then knelt down on the ground by the side of the thing unseen there was a pushing and shuffling a sound of heavy feet as fresh people turned up to increase the pressure of the crowd people now were coming out of the houses the doors of the jolly cricketers stood suddenly wide open very little was said  kemp felt about his hand seeming to pass through empty air hes not breathing he said and then i cant feel his heart his sideugh  suddenly an old woman peering under the arm of the big navvy screamed sharply looky there she said and thrust out a wrinkled finger  and looking where she pointed everyone saw faint and transparent as though it was made of glass so that veins and arteries and bones and nerves could be distinguished the outline of a hand a hand limp and prone it grew clouded and opaque even as they stared  hullo cried the constable heres his feet ashowing  and so slowly beginning at his hands and feet and creeping along his limbs to the vital centres of his body that strange change continued it was like the slow spreading of a poison first came the little white nerves a hazy grey sketch of a limb then the glassy bones and intricate arteries then the flesh and skin first a faint fogginess and then growing rapidly dense and opaque presently they could see his crushed chest and his shoulders and the dim outline of his drawn and battered features  when at last the crowd made way for kemp to stand erect there lay naked and pitiful on the ground the bruised and broken body of a young man about thirty his hair and brow were whitenot grey with age but white with the whiteness of albinismand his eyes were like garnets his hands were clenched his eyes wide open and his expression was one of anger and dismay  cover his face said a man for gawds sake cover that face and three little children pushing forward through the crowd were suddenly twisted round and sent packing off again  someone brought a sheet from the jolly cricketers and having covered him they carried him into that house and there it was on a shabby bed in a tawdry illlighted bedroom surrounded by a crowd of ignorant and excited people broken and wounded betrayed and unpitied that griffin the first of all men to make himself invisible griffin the most gifted physicist the world has ever seen ended in infinite disaster his strange and terrible career    the epilogue   so ends the story of the strange and evil experiments of the invisible man and if you would learn more of him you must go to a little inn near port stowe and talk to the landlord the sign of the inn is an empty board save for a hat and boots and the name is the title of this story the landlord is a short and corpulent little man with a nose of cylindrical proportions wiry hair and a sporadic rosiness of visage drink generously and he will tell you generously of all the things that happened to him after that time and of how the lawyers tried to do him out of the treasure found upon him  when they found they couldnt prove whose money was which im blessed he says if they didnt try to make me out a blooming treasure trove do i look like a treasure trove and then a gentleman gave me a guinea a night to tell the story at the empire music alljust to tell em in my own wordsbarring one  and if you want to cut off the flow of his reminiscences abruptly you can always do so by asking if there werent three manuscript books in the story he admits there were and proceeds to explain with asseverations that everybody thinks he has em but bless you he hasnt the invisible man it was took em off to hide em when i cut and ran for port stowe its that mr kemp put people on with the idea of my having em  and then he subsides into a pensive state watches you furtively bustles nervously with glasses and presently leaves the bar  he is a bachelor manhis tastes were ever bachelor and there are no women folk in the house outwardly he buttonsit is expected of himbut in his more vital privacies in the matter of braces for example he still turns to string he conducts his house without enterprise but with eminent decorum his movements are slow and he is a great thinker but he has a reputation for wisdom and for a respectable parsimony in the village and his knowledge of the roads of the south of england would beat cobbett  and on sunday mornings every sunday morning all the year round while he is closed to the outer world and every night after ten he goes into his bar parlour bearing a glass of gin faintly tinged with water and having placed this down he locks the door and examines the blinds and even looks under the table and then being satisfied of his solitude he unlocks the cupboard and a box in the cupboard and a drawer in that box and produces three volumes bound in brown leather and places them solemnly in the middle of the table the covers are weatherworn and tinged with an algal greenfor once they sojourned in a ditch and some of the pages have been washed blank by dirty water the landlord sits down in an armchair fills a long clay pipe slowlygloating over the books the while then he pulls one towards him and opens it and begins to study itturning over the leaves backwards and forwards  his brows are knit and his lips move painfully hex little two up in the air cross and a fiddlededee lord what a one he was for intellect  presently he relaxes and leans back and blinks through his smoke across the room at things invisible to other eyes full of secrets he says wonderful secrets  once i get the haul of themlord  i wouldnt do what he did id justwell he pulls at his pipe  so he lapses into a dream the undying wonderful dream of his life and though kemp has fished unceasingly no human being save the landlord knows those books are there with the subtle secret of invisibility and a dozen other strange secrets written therein and none other will know of them until he dies
