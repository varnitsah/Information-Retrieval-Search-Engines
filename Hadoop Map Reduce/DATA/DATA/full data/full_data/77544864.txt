77544864	ships company  by ww jacobs   contents       fine feathers      friends in need      good intentions      fairy gold      watchdogs      the bequest      the guardian angel      dual control      skilled assistance      for better or worse      the old man of the sea      manners makyth man     illustration can i ave it took off while i eat my bloater mother     fine feathers   mr jobson awoke with a sundayish feeling probably due to the fact that it was bank holiday  he had been aware in a dim fashion of the rising of mrs jobson some time before and in a semiconscious condition had taken over a large slice of unoccupied territory  he stretched himself and yawned and then by an effort of will threw off the clothes and springing out of bed reached for his trousers  he was an orderly man and had hung them every night for over twenty years on the brass knob on his side of the bed  he had hung them there the night before and now they had absconded with a pair of red braces just entering their teens  instead on a chair at the foot of the bed was a collection of garments that made him shudder  with trembling fingers he turned over a black tailcoat a white waistcoat and a pair of light check trousers  a white shirt a collar and tie kept them company and greatest outrage of all a tall silk hat stood on its own bandbox beside the chair  mr jobson fingering his bristly chin stood regarding the collection with a wan smile  so thats their little game is it  he muttered  want to make a toff of me  wheres my clothes got to i wonder  a hasty search satisfied him that they were not in the room and pausing only to drape himself in the counterpane he made his way into the next he passed on to the others and then with a growing sense of alarm stole softly downstairs and making his way to the shop continued the search  with the shutters up the place was almost in darkness and in spite of his utmost care apples and potatoes rolled on to the floor and travelled across it in a succession of bumps  then a sudden turn brought the scales clattering down  good gracious alf  said a voice  whatever are you adoing of  mr jobson turned and eyed his wife who was standing at the door  im looking for my clothes mother he replied briefly  clothes  said mrs jobson with an obvious attempt at unconcerned speech  clothes  why theyre on the chair  i mean clothes fit for a christian to wearfit for a greengrocer to wear said mr jobson raising his voice  it was a little surprise for you dear said his wife  me and bert and gladys and dorothy ave all been saving up for it for ever so long  its very kind of you all said mr jobson feeblyvery but  theyve all been doing without things themselves to do it interjected his wife  as for gladys im sure nobody knows what shes given up  well if nobody knows it dont matter said mr jobson  as i was saying its very kind of you all but i cant wear em  wheres my others  mrs jobson hesitated  wheres my others  repeated her husband  theyre being took care of replied his wife with spirit  aunt emmas minding em for youand you know what she is  hsh  alf  alf im surprised at you  mr jobson coughed  its the collar mother he said at last  i aint wore a collar for over twenty years not since we was walking out together  and then i didnt like it  more shame for you said his wife  im sure theres no other respectable tradesman goes about with a handkerchief knotted round his neck  praps their skins aint as tender as what mine is urged mr jobson and besides fancy me in a topat  why i shall be the laughingstock of the place  nonsense  said his wife  its only the lower classes what would laugh and nobody minds what they think  mr jobson sighed  well i shall ave to go back to bed again then he said ruefully  so long mother  hope you have a pleasant time at the palace  he took a reef in the counterpane and with a fair amount of dignity considering his appearance stalked upstairs again and stood gloomily considering affairs in his bedroom  ever since gladys and dorothy had been big enough to be objects of interest to the young men of the neighbourhood the clothes nuisance had been rampant  he peeped through the windowblind at the bright sunshine outside and then looked back at the tumbled bed  a murmur of voices downstairs apprised him that the conspirators were awaiting the result  he dressed at last and stood like a lamba redfaced bullnecked lamb while mrs jobson fastened his collar for him  bert wanted to get a taller one she remarked but i said this would do to begin with  wanted it to come over my mouth i spose said the unfortunate mr jobson  well ave it your own way  dont mind about me  what with the trousers and the collar i couldnt pick up a sovereign if i saw one in front of me  if you see one ill pick it up for you said his wife taking up the hat and moving towards the door  come along  mr jobson with his arms standing out stiffly from his sides and his head painfully erect followed her downstairs and a sudden hush as he entered the kitchen testified to the effect produced by his appearance it was followed by a hum of admiration that sent the blood flying to his head  why he couldnt have done it before i dont know said the dutiful gladys  why there aint a man in the street looks a quarter as smart  fits him like a glove  said dorothy walking round him  just the right length said bert scrutinizing the coat  and he stands as straight as a soldier said gladys clasping her hands gleefully  collar said mr jobson briefly  can i ave it took off while i eat my bloater mother  dont be silly alf said his wife  gladys pour your father out a nice strong pot cup o tea and dont forget that the train starts at ha past ten  itll start all right when it sees me observed mr jobson squinting down at his trousers  mother and children delighted with the success of their scheme laughed applause and mr jobson somewhat gratified at the success of his retort sat down and attacked his breakfast  a short clay pipe smoked as a digestive was impounded by the watchful mrs jobson the moment he had finished it  hed smoke it along the street if i didnt she declared  and why not demanded her husbandalways do  not in a topat said mrs jobson shaking her head at him  or a tailcoat said dorothy  one would spoil the other said gladys  i wish something would spoil the hat said mr jobson wistfully its no good i must smoke mother  mrs jobson smiled and going to the cupboard produced with a smile of triumph an envelope containing seven dangerouslooking cigars  mr jobson whistled and taking one up examined it carefully  what do they call em mother  he inquired  the cut and try again smokes  mrs jobson smiled vaguely  me and the girls are going upstairs to get ready now she said  keep your eye on him bert  father and son grinned at each other and to pass the time took a cigar apiece  they had just finished them when a swish and rustle of skirts sounded from the stairs and mrs jobson and the girls beautifully attired entered the room and stood buttoning their gloves  a strong smell of scent fought with the aroma of the cigars  you get round me like so as to hide me a bit entreated mr jobson as they quitted the house  i dont mind so much when we get out of our street  mrs jobson laughed his fears to scorn  well cross the road then said mr jobson urgently  theres bill foley standing at his door  his wife sniffed  let him stand she said haughtily  mr foley failed to avail himself of the permission  he regarded mr jobson with dilated eyeballs and as the party approached sank slowly into a sitting position on his doorstep and as the door opened behind him rolled slowly over onto his back and presented an enormous pair of hobnailed soles to the gaze of an interested world  i told you ow it would be said the blushing mr jobson  you know what bills like as well as i do  his wife tossed her head and they all quickened their pace  the voice of the ingenious mr foley calling piteously for his mother pursued them to the end of the road  i knew what it ud be said mr jobson wiping his hot face  bill will never let me ear the end of this  nonsense  said his wife bridling  do you mean to tell me youve got to ask bill foley ow youre to dress  hell soon get tired of it and besides its just as well to let him see who you are  theres not many tradesmen as would lower themselves by mixing with a plasterer  mr jobson scratched his ear but wisely refrained from speech  once clear of his own district mental agitation subsided but bodily discomfort increased at every step  the hat and the collar bothered him most but every article of attire contributed its share  his uneasiness was so manifest that mrs jobson after a little womanly sympathy suggested that besides sundays it might be as well to wear them occasionally of an evening in order to get used to them  what ave i got to wear them every sunday  demanded the unfortunate blankly why i thought they was only for bank holidays  mrs jobson told him not to be silly  straight i did said her husband earnestly  youve no idea ow im suffering ive got a headache im arf choked and theres a feeling about my waist as though im being cuddled by somebody i dont like  mrs jobson said it would soon wear off and seated in the train that bore them to the crystal palace put the hat on the rack  her husbands attempt to leave it in the train was easily frustrated and his explanation that he had forgotten all about it received in silence  it was evident that he would require watching and under the clear gaze of his children he seldom had a button undone for more than three minutes at a time  the day was hot and he perspired profusely  his collar lost its starch a thing to be grateful forand for the greater part of the day he wore his tie under the left ear  by the time they had arrived home again he was in a state of open mutiny  never again he said loudly as he tore the collar off and hung his coat on a chair  there was a chorus of lamentation but he remained firm  dorothy began to sniff ominously and gladys spoke longingly of the fathers possessed by other girls  it was not until mrs jobson sat eyeing her supper instead of eating it that he began to temporize  he gave way bit by bit garment by garment  when he gave way at last on the great hat question his wife took up her knife and fork  his workaday clothes appeared in his bedroom next morning but the others still remained in the clutches of aunt emma  the suit provided was of considerable antiquity and at closing time mr jobson after some hesitation donned his new clothes and with a sheepish glance at his wife went out mrs jobson nodded delight at her daughters  hes coming round she whispered  he liked that ticketcollector calling him sir yesterday  i noticed it  hes put on everything but the topper  dont say nothing about it take it as a matter of course  it became evident as the days wore on that she was right  bit by bit she obtained the other clotheswith some difficultyfrom aunt emma but her husband still wore his best on sundays and sometimes of an evening and twice on going into the bedroom suddenly she had caught him surveying himself at different angles in the glass  and moreover he had spoken with some heatfor such a goodtempered manon the shortcomings of dorothys laundry work  wed better put your collars out said his wife  and the shirts said mr jobson  nothing looks worse than a bad gotup cuff  youre getting quite dressy said his wife with a laugh  mr jobson eyed her seriously  no mother no he replied  all ive done is to find out that youre right as you always ave been  a man in my persition has got no right to dress as if he kept a stall on the kerb  it aint fair to the gals or to young bert  i dont want em to be ashamed of their father  they wouldnt be that said mrs jobson  im trying to improve said her husband  o course its no use dressing up and behaving wrong and yesterday i bought a book what tells you all about behaviour  well done  said the delighted mrs jobson  mr jobson was glad to find that her opinion on his purchase was shared by the rest of the family  encouraged by their approval he told them of the benefit he was deriving from it and at teatime that day after a little hesitation ventured to affirm that it was a book that might do them all good  hear hear  said gladys  for one thing said mr jobson slowly i didnt know before that it was wrong to blow your tea and as for drinking it out of a saucer the book says its a thing that is only done by the lower orders  if youre in a hurry  demanded mr bert jobson pausing with his saucer half way to his mouth  if youre in anything responded his father  a gentleman would rather go without his tea than drink it out of a saucer  thats the sort o thing bill foley would do  mr bert jobson drained his saucer thoughtfully  picking your teeth with your finger is wrong too said mr jobson taking a breath  food should be removed in aaunundemonstrative fashion with the tip of the tongue  i wasnt said gladys  a knife pursued her fathera knife should never in any circumstances be allowed near the mouth  youve made mother cut herself said gladys sharply thats what youve done  i thought it was my fork said mrs jobson  i was so busy listening i wasnt thinking what i was doing  silly of me  we shall all do better in time said mr jobson  but what i want to know is what about the gravy  you cant eat it with a fork and it dont say nothing about a spoon  oh and what about our cold tubs mother  cold tubs  repeated his wife staring at him  what cold tubs  the cold tubs me and bert ought to ave said mr jobson  it says in the book that an englishman would just as soon think of going without his breakfus as his cold tub and you know how fond i am of my breakfus  and what about me and the gals  said the amazed mrs jobson  dont you worry about me ma said gladys hastily  the book dont say nothing about gals it says englishmen said mr jobson  but we aint got a bathroom said his son  it dont signify said mr jobson  a washtubll do  me and bertll ave a washtub each brought up overnight and itll be exercise for the gals bringing the water up of a morning to us  well i dont know im sure said the bewildered mrs jobson anyway you and bertll ave to carry the tubs up and down  messy i call it  its got to be done mother said mr jobson cheerfully  its only the lower orders what dont ave their cold tub reglar  the book says so  he trundled the tub upstairs the same night and after his wife had gone downstairs next morning opened the door and took in the can and pail that stood outside  he poured the contents into the tub and after eyeing it thoughtfully for some time agitated the surface with his right foot  he dipped and dried that much enduring member some ten times and after regarding the damp condition of the towels with great satisfaction dressed himself and went downstairs  im all of a glow he said seating himself at the table  i believe i could eat a elephant  i feel as fresh as a daisy dont you bert  mr jobson junior who had just come in from the shop remarked shortly that he felt more like a blooming snowdrop  and somebody slopped a lot of water over the stairs carrying it up said mrs jobson  i dont believe as everybody has cold baths of a morning  it dont seem wholesome to me  mr jobson took a book from his pocket and opening it at a certain page handed it over to her  if im going to do the thing at all i must do it properly he said gravely  i dont suppose bill foley ever ad a cold tub in his life he dont know no better  gladys  halloa  said that young lady with a start  are youare you eating that kipper with your fingers  gladys turned and eyed her mother appealingly  pagepage one hundred and something i think it is said her father with his mouth full  manners at the dinner table its near the end of the book i know  if i never do no worse than that i shant come to no harm said his daughter  mr jobson shook his head at her and after eating his breakfast with great care wiped his mouth on his handkerchief and went into the shop  i suppose its all right said mrs jobson looking after him but hes taking it very seriousvery  he washed his hands five times yesterday morning said dorothy who had just come in from the shop to her breakfast and kept customers waiting while he did it too  its the coldtub business i cant get over said her mother  im sure its more trouble to empty them than what it is to fill them theres quite enough work in the ouse as it is  too much said bert with unwonted consideration  i wish hed leave me alone said gladys  my food dont do me no good when hes watching every mouthful i eat  of murmurings such as these mr jobson heard nothing and in view of the great improvement in his dress and manners a strong resolution was passed to avoid the faintest appearance of discontent  even when satisfied with his own appearance he set to work to improve that of mrs jobson that admirable woman made no complaint  hitherto the brightness of her attire and the size of her hats had been held to atone for her lack of figure and the roomy comfort of her boots but mr jobson infected with new ideas refused to listen to such sophistry  he went shopping with dorothy and the sunday after when mrs jobson went for an airing with him she walked in boots with heels two inches high and toes that ended in a point  a waist that had disappeared some years before was recaptured and placed in durance vile and a hat which called for a new style of hairdressing completed the effect  you look splendid ma  said gladys as she watched their departure splendid  i dont feel splendid sighed mrs jobson to her husband  these ere boots feel redot  your usual size said mr jobson looking across the road  and the clothes seem just a teenyweeny bit tight praps continued his wife  mr jobson regarded her critically  praps they might have been let out a quarter of an inch he said thoughtfully  theyre the best fit youve ad for a long time mother  i only ope the galsll ave such good figgers  his wife smiled faintly but with little breath for conversation walked on for some time in silence  a growing redness of face testified to her distress  ii feel awful she said at last pressing her hand to her side awful  youll soon get used to it said mr jobson gently  look at me  i felt like you do at first and now i wouldnt go back to old clothesand comfortfor anything  youll get to love them boots  if i could only take em off i should love em better said his wife panting and i cant breathe properlyi cant breathe  you look ripping mother said her husband simply  his wife essayed another smile but failed  she set her lips together and plodded on mr jobson chatting cheerily and taking no notice of the fact that she kept lurching against him  two miles from home she stopped and eyed him fixedly  if i dont get these boots off alf i shall be a elpless cripple for the rest of my days she murmured  my ankles gone over three times  but you cant take em off here said mr jobson hastily  think ow it would look  i must ave a cab or something said his wife hysterically  if i dont get em off soon i shall scream  she leaned against the iron palings of a house for support while mr jobson standing on the kerb looked up and down the road for a cab  a fourwheeler appeared just in time to prevent the scandalof mrs jobson removing her boots in the street  thank goodness she gasped as she climbed in  never mind about untying em alf cut the laces and get em off quick  they drove home with the boots standing side by side on the seat in front of them  mr jobson got out first and knocked at the door and as soon as it opened mrs jobson pattered across the intervening space with the boots dangling from her hand  she had nearly reached the door when mr foley who had a diabolical habit of always being on hand when he was least wanted appeared suddenly from the offside of the cab  been paddlin  he inquired  mrs jobson safe in her doorway drew herself up and holding the boots behind her surveyed him with a stare of highbred disdain  been paddlin  he inquired  i see you going down the road in em said the unabashed mr foley and i says to myself i says pridell bear a pinch but shes going too far  if she thinks that she can squeedge those little tootsywootsies of ers into them boo  the door slammed violently and left him exchanging grins with mr jobson  hows the at  he inquired  mr jobson winked  bet you a level arfdollar i aint wearing it next sunday he said in a hoarse whisper  mr foley edged away  not good enough he said shaking his head  ive had a good many bets with you first and last alf but i cant remember as i ever won one yet so long        friends in need    r joseph gibbs finished his halfpint in the private bar of the red lion with the slowness of a man unable to see where the next was coming from and placing the mug on the counter filled his pipe from a small paper of tobacco and shook his head slowly at his companions  first ive ad since ten oclock this morning he said in a hard voice  cheer up said mr george brown  it cant go on for ever said bob kidd encouragingly  all i ask foris work said mr gibbs impressively  not slavery mind yer but work  its rather difficult to distinguish said mr brown  specially for some people added mr kidd  go on said mr gibbs gloomily  go on  stand a man arf a pint and then go and hurt is feelings  twice yesterday i wondered to myself what it would feel like to make a hole in the water  lots o chaps do do it said mr brown musingly  and leave their wives and families to starve said mr gibbs icily  very often the wife is better off said his friend  its one mouth less for her to feed  besides she genrally gets something  when pore old bill went they ad a friendly lead at the kings head and got his missis pretty nearly seventeen pounds  and i believe wed get more than that for your old woman said mr kidd  theres no kids and she could keep erself easy  not that i want to encourage you to make away with yourself  mr gibbs scowled and tilting his mug peered gloomily into the interior  joe wont make no ole in the water said mr brown wagging his head if it was beer now  mr gibbs turned and drawing himself up to five feet three surveyed the speaker with an offensive stare  i dont see why he need make a ole in anything said mr kidd slowly it ud do just as well if we said he ad  then we could pass the hat round and share it  divide it into three halves and each ave one said mr brown nodding but ow is it to be done  ave some more beer and think it over said mr kidd pale with excitement  three pints please  he and mr brown took up their pints and nodded at each other  mr gibbs toying idly with the handle of his eyed them carefully  mind im not promising anything he said slowly  understand i aint acommitting of myself by drinking this ere pint  you leave it to me joe said mr kidd  mr gibbs left it to him after a discussion in which pints played a persuasive part with the result that mr brown sitting in the same bar the next evening with two or three friends was rudely disturbed by the cyclonic entrance of mr kidd who dripping with water sank on a bench and breathed heavily  whats up  whats the matter  demanded several voices  its joepoor joe gibbs said mr kidd  i was on smiths wharf shifting that lighter to the next berth and o course joe must come aboard to help  he was shoving her off with is foot when  he broke off and shuddered and accepting a mug of beer pending the arrival of some brandy that a sympathizer had ordered drank it slowly  it all appened in a flash he said looking round  by the time i ad run round to his end he was just going down for the third time  i hung over the side and grabbed at im and his collar and tie came off in my hand  nearly went in i did  he held out the collar and tie and approving notice was taken of the fact that he was soaking wet from the top of his head to the middle button of his waistcoat  pore chap  said the landlord leaning over the bar  he was in ere only arf an hour ago standing in this very bar  well hes ad his last drop o beer said a carman in a chastened voice  thats more than anybody can say said the landlord sharply  i never heard anything against the man hes led a good life so far as i know and ow can we tell that he wont ave beer  he made mr kidd a present of another small glass of brandy  he didnt leave any family did he he inquired as he passed it over  only a wife said mr kidd and whos to tell that pore soul i dont know  she fair doated on im  ow shes to live i dont know  i shall do what i can for er  same ere said mr brown in a deep voice  something ought to be done for er said the carman as he went out  first thing is to tell the police said the landlord  they ought to know then praps one of themll tell her  its what theyre paid for  its so awfully sudden  i dont know where i am ardly said mr kidd i dont believe shes got a pennypiece in the ouse  pore joe ad a lot o pals  i wonder whether we couldnt get up something for her  go round and tell the police first said the landlord pursing up his lips thoughtfully  we can talk about that later on  mr kidd thanked him warmly and withdrew accompanied by mr brown twenty minutes later they left the station considerably relieved at the matteroffact way in which the police had received the tidings and hurrying across london bridge made their way towards a small figure supporting its back against a post in the borough market  well  said mr gibbs snappishly as he turned at the sound of their footsteps  itll be all right joe said mr kidd  weve sowed the seed  sowed the wot  demanded the other  mr kidd explained  ho  said mr gibbs  an while your precious seed is acoming up wot am i to do  wot about my comfortable ome  wot about my bed and grub  his two friends looked at each other uneasily  in the excitement of the arrangements they had for gotten these things and a long and sometimes painful experience of mr gibbs showed them only too plainly where they were drifting  youll ave to get a bed this side o the river somewhere said mr brown slowly  coffeeshop or something and a smart active man wot keeps his eyes open can always pick up a little money  mr gibbs laughed  and mind said mr kidd furiously in reply to the laugh anything we lend you is to be paid back out of your half when you get it  and wots more you dont get a hapenny till youve come into a barbers shop and ad them whiskers off  we dont want no accidents  mr gibbs with his back against the post fought for his whiskers for nearly half an hour and at the end of that time was led into a barbers and in a state of sullen indignation proffered his request for a clean shave  he gazed at the barefaced creature that confronted him in the glass after the operation in openeyed consternation and messrs  kidd and browns politeness easily gave way before their astonishment  well i may as well have a aircut while im here said mr gibbs after a lengthy survey  and a shampoo sir  said the assistant  just as you like said mr gibbs turning a deaf ear to the frenzied expostulations of his financial backers  wot is it  illustration mr gibbs with his back against the post fought for nearly half an hour  he sat in amazed discomfort during the operation and emerging with his friends remarked that he felt half a stone lighter  the information was received in stony silence and having spent some time in the selection they found a quiet publichouse and in a retired corner formed themselves into a committee of ways and means  thatll do for you to go on with said mr kidd after he and mr brown had each made a contribution and mind its coming off of your share  mr gibbs nodded  and any evening you want to see me youll find me in here he remarked  beers ripping  now youd better go and see my old woman  the two friends departed and to their great relief found a little knot of people outside the abode of mrs gibbs  it was clear that the news had been already broken and pushing their way upstairs they found the widow with a damp handkerchief in her hand surrounded by attentive friends  in feeble accents she thanked mr kidd for his noble attempts at rescue  he aint dry yet said mr brown  i done wot i could said mr kidd simply  pore joe  nobody could ha had a better pal  nobody  always ready to lend a helping and to them as was in trouble he was said mr brown looking round  ear ear  said a voice  and well lend im a helping and said mr kidd energetically  we cant do im no good pore chap but we can try and do something for er as is left behind  he moved slowly to the door accompanied by mr brown and catching the eye of one or two of the men beckoned them to follow  under his able guidance a small but gradually increasing crowd made its way to the red lion for the next three or four days the friends worked unceasingly cards stating that a friendly lead would be held at the red lion for the benefit of the widow of the late mr joseph gibbs were distributed broadcast and anecdotes portraying a singularly rare and beautiful character obtained an even wider circulation  too late wapping realized the benevolent disposition and the kindly but unobtrusive nature that had departed from it for ever  mr gibbs from his retreat across the water fully shared his friends enthusiasm but an insane desireengendered by vanityto be present at the function was a source of considerable trouble and annoyance to them when he offered to black his face and take part in the entertainment as a nigger minstrel mr kidd had to be led outside and kept there until such time as he could converse in english pure and undefiled  getting above imself thats wot it is said mr brown as they wended their way home  hes having too much money out of us to spend but it wont be for long now  hes having a lords life of it while were slaving ourselves to death grumbled mr kidd  i never seeim looking so fat and well  by rights he oughtnt to ave the same share as wot were going to ave he aint doing none of the work  his illhumour lasted until the night of the lead which largely owing to the presence of a sporting fishmonger who had done well at the races that day and some of his friends realized a sum far beyond the expectations of the hardworking promoters  the fishmonger led off by placing a fivepound note in the plate and the packed audience breathed so hard that the plateholders responsibility began to weigh upon his spirits  in all a financial tribute of thirtyseven pounds three and fourpence was paid to the memory of the late mr gibbs  over twelve quid apiece said the delighted mr kidd as he bade his coworker good night  sounds too good to be true  the next day passed all too slowly but work was over at last and mr kidd led the way over london bridge a yard or two ahead of the more phlegmatic mr brown  mr gibbs was in his old corner at the wheelwrights arms and instead of going into ecstasies over the sum realized hinted darkly that it would have been larger if he had been allowed to have had a hand in it  itll ardly pay me for my trouble he said shaking his head  its very dull over ere all alone by myself  by the time you two have ad your share besides taking wot i owe you therell be ardly anything left  ill talk to you another time said mr kidd regarding him fixedly wot youve got to do now is to come acrost the river with us  what for  demanded mr gibbs  were going to break the joyful news to your old woman that youre alive afore she starts spending money wot isnt hers said mr kidd  and we want you to be close by in case she dont believe us  well do it gentle mind said the fond husband  we dont want er screaming or anything o that sort  i know er better than wot you do and my advice to you is to go easy  he walked along by the side of them and after some demur consented as a further disguise to put on a pair of spectacles for which mr kidds wifes mother had been hunting high and low since eight oclock that morning  you doddle about ere for ten minutes said mr kidd as they reached the monument and then foller on  when you pass a lamppost old your handkerchief up to your face  and wait for us at the corner of your road till we come for you  he went off at a brisk pace with mr brown a pace moderated to one of almost funeral solemnity as they approached the residence of mrs gibbs to their relief she was alone and after the usual amenities thanked them warmly for all they had done for her  id do more than that for pore joe said mr brown  theythey avent found im yet  said the widow  mr kidd shook his head  my idea is they wont find im he said slowly  went down on the ebb tide explained mr brown and spoilt mr kidds opening  wherever he is es better off said mrs gibbs  no more trouble about being out o work no more worry no more pain weve all got to go some day  yes began mr kidd but  im sure i dont wish im back said mrs gibbs that would be sinful  but ow if he wanted to come back  said mr kidd playing for an opening  and elp you spend that money said mr brown ignoring the scowls of his friend  mrs gibbs looked bewildered  spend the money she began  suppose said mr kidd suppose he wasnt drownded after all  only last night i dreamt he was alive  so did i said mr brown  he was smiling at me said mr kidd in a tender voice  bob he ses go and tell my pore missis that im alive he ses break it to er gentle  its the very words he said to me in my dream said mr brown  bit strange aint it  very said mrs gibbs  i suppose said mr kidd after a pause i suppose you havent been dreaming about im  no im a teetotaller said the widow  the two gentlemen exchanged glances and mr kidd ever of an impulsive nature resolved to bring matters to a head  wot would you do if joe was to come in ere at this door  he asked  scream the house down said the widow promptly  screamscream the ouse down  said the distressed mr kidd  mrs gibbs nodded  i should go screaming raving mad she said with conviction  butbut not if e was alive  said mr kidd  i dont know what youre driving at said mrs gibbs  why dont you speak out plain  poor joe is drownded you know that you saw it all and yet you come talking to me about dreams and things  mr kidd bent over her and put his hand affectionately on her shoulder he escaped he said in a thrilling whisper  hes alive and well  what said mrs gibbs starting back  true as i stand ere said mr kidd aint it george  truer said mr brown loyally  mrs gibbs leaned back gasping  alive she said  but ow  ow can he be  dont make such a noise said mr kidd earnestly  mind if anybody else gets to ear of it youll ave to give that money back  id give more than that to get im back said mrs gibbs wildly  i believe youre deceiving me  true as i stand ere asseverated the

 let me go to im  all right said mr kidd with a satisfied smile at mr brown all in good time  ill go and fetch im now but mind if you scream youll spoil everything  he bustled cheerfully out of the room and downstairs and mrs gibbs motioning mr brown to silence stood by the door with parted lips waiting  three or four minutes elapsed  ere they come said mr brown as footsteps sounded on the stairs now no screaming mind  mrs gibbs drew back and to the gratification of all concerned did not utter a sound as mr kidd followed by her husband entered the room she stood looking expectantly towards the doorway  where is he  she gasped  eh  said mr kidd in a startled voice  why here  dont you know im  its me susan said mr gibbs in a low voice  oh i might ave known it was a joke cried mrs gibbs in a faint voice as she tottered to a chair  ohow cruel of you to tell me my pore joe was alive  oh ow could you  lor lumme said the incensed mr kidd pushing mr gibbs forward here he is  same as you saw im last except for is whiskers  dont make that sobbing noise peoplell be coming in  oh  oh  oh  take im away cried mrs gibbs  go and play your tricks with somebody elses broken art  but its your husband said mr brown  take im away wailed mrs gibbs  mr kidd grinding his teeth tried to think  ave you got any marks on your body joe  he inquired  i aint got a mark on me said mr gibbs with a satisfied air or a blemish  my skin is as whi  thats enough about your skin interrupted mr kidd rudely  if you aint all of you gone before i count ten said mrs gibbs in a suppressed voice ill scream  ow dare you come into a respectable womans place and talk about your skins  are you going  one  two three  four  five  her voice rose with each numeral and mr gibbs himself led the way downstairs and followed by his friends slipped nimbly round the corner  its a wonder she didnt rouse the whole ouse he said wiping his brow on his sleeve and where should we ha been then  i thought at the time it was a mistake you making me ave my whiskers off but i let you know best  shes never seen me without em  i ad a remarkable strong growth when i was quite a boy  while other boys was  shutup  vociferated mr kidd  shant  said mr gibbs defiantly  ive ad enough of being away from my comfortable little ome and my wife and im going to let em start growing agin this very night  shell never reckernize me without em thats certain  hes right bob said mr brown with conviction  dye mean to tell me weve got to wait till is blasted whiskers grow cried mr kidd almost dancing with fury  and go on keeping im in idleness till they do  youll get it all back out o my share said mr gibbs with dignity but you can please yourself  if you like to call it quits now i dont mind  mr brown took his seething friend aside and conferred with him in low but earnest tones  mr gibbs with an indifferent air stood by whistling softly  ow long will they take to grow  inquired mr kidd turning to him with a growl  mr gibbs shrugged his shoulders  cant say he replied but i should think two or three weeks would be enough for er to reckernize me by  if she dont we must wait another week or so thats all  well there wont be much o your share left mind that said mr kidd glowering at him  i cant help it said mr gibbs  you neednt keep reminding me of it  they walked the rest of the way in silence and for the next fortnight mr gibbss friends paid nightly visits to note the change in his appearance and grumble at its slowness  well try and pull it off tomorrow night said mr kidd at the end of that period  im fair sick o lending you money  mr gibbs shook his head and spoke sagely about not spoiling the ship for a haporth o tar but mr kidd was obdurate  theres enough for er to reckernize you by he said sternly and we dont want other people to  meet us at the monument at eight oclock tomorrow night and well get it over  give your orders said mr gibbs in a nasty voice  keep your at well over your eyes commanded mr kidd sternly  put them spectacles on wot i lent you and it wouldnt be a bad idea if you tied your face up in a piece o red flannel  i know wot im going to do without you telling me said mr gibbs nodding  ill bet you pots round that you dont either of you reckernize me tomorrow night  the bet was taken at once and from eight oclock until ten minutes to nine the following night messrs kidd and brown did their best to win it then did mr kidd turning to mr brown in perplexity inquire with many redundant words what it all meant  illustration gone exclaimed both gentlemen  where  he must ave gone on by imself said mr brown  wed better go and see  in a state of some disorder they hurried back to wapping and mounting the stairs to mrs gibbss room found the door fast  to their fervent and repeated knocking there was no answer  ah you wont make her ear said a woman thrusting an untidy head over the balusters on the next landing  shes gone  gone  exclaimed both gentlemen  where  canada said the woman  she went off this morning  mr kidd leaned up against the wall for support mr brown stood openmouthed and voiceless  it was a surprise to me said the woman but she told me this morning shes been getting ready on the quiet for the last fortnight  good spirits she was in too laughing like anything  laughing  repeated mr kidd in a terrible voice  the woman nodded  and when i spoke about it and reminded er that she ad only just lost er pore husband i thought she would ha burst she said severely  she sat down on that stair and laughed till the tears ran dowwn er face like water  mr brown turned a bewildered face upon his partner  laughing  he said slowly  wot ad she got to laugh at  two bornfools replied mr kidd       good intentions   jealousy thats wot it is said the nightwatchman trying to sneer pure jealousy  he had left his broom for a hurried halfpint at the bulls headleft it leaning in a negligent attitude against the warehousewall now lashed to the top of the crane at the jetty end it pointed its soiled bristles towards the evening sky and defied capture  and i know who it is and why es done it he continued  fust and last i dont suppose i was talking to the gal for more than ten minutes and arf of that was about the weather  i dont suppose anybody as suffered more from jealousy than wot i ave other peoples jealousy i mean  ever since i was married the missis has been setting traps for me and asking people to keep an eye on me  i blacked one of the eyes oncelike a fooland the chap it belonged to made up a tale about me that i aint lived down yet  years ago when i was out with the missis one evening i saved a gals life for her  she slipped as she was getting off a bus and i caught er just in time  fine strapping gal she was and afore i could get my balance we ad danced round and round arfway acrost the road with our arms round each others necks and my missis watching us from the pavement  when we were safe she said the gal adnt slipped at all and as soon as the gal ad got er breath im blest if she didnt say so too  you cant argufy with jealous people and you cant shame em  when i told my missis once that i should never dream of being jealous of her instead of up and thanking me for it she spoilt the best fryingpan we ever had  when the widderwoman nextdoor but two and me ad rheumatics at the same time she went and asked the doctor whether it was catching  the worse trouble o that kind i ever got into was all through trying to do somebody else a kindness  i went out o my way to do it i wasted the whole evening for the sake of other people and got into such trouble over it that even now it gives me the cold shivers to think of  capn tarbell was the man i tried to do a good turn to a man what used to be master of a ketch called the lizzie and annie trading between ere and shoremouth  artful jack he used to be called and if ever a man deserved the name he did  a widderman of about fifty and as silly as a boy of fifteen  he ad been talking of getting married agin for over ten years and thinking it was only talk i didnt give im any good advice  then he told me one night that e was keeping company with a woman named lamb who lived at a place near shoremouth  when i asked im what she looked like he said that she had a good art and knowing wot that meant i wasnt at all surprised when he told me some time arter that e had been a silly fool  well if shes got a good art i ses praps shell let you go  talk sense he ses  it aint good enough for that  why she worships the ground i tread on  she thinks there is nobody like me in the whole wide world  lets ope shell think so arter youre married i ses trying to cheer him up  im not going to get married he ses  leastways not to er  but ow to get out of it without breaking her art and being had up for breach o promise i cant think  and if the other one got to ear of it i should lose her too  other one i ses wot other one  capn tarbell shook his ead and smiled like a silly gal  she fell in love with me on top of a bus in the mile end road he ses love at fust sight it was  shes a widder lady with a nice little ouse at bow and plenty to live onher usband having been a builder  i dont know what to do  you see if i married both of em its sure to be found out sooner or later  youll be found out as it is i ses if you aint careful  im surprised at you  yes he ses getting up and walking backwards and forwards especially as mrs plimmer is always talking about coming down to see the ship  one thing is the crew wont give me away theyve been with me too long for that  praps you could give me a little advice bill  i did  i talked to that man for an hour and aarf and when i ad finished he said he didnt want that kind of advice at all  wot e wanted was for me to tell im ow to get rid of miss lamb and marry mrs plimmer without anybody being offended or having their feelings hurt  mrs plimmer came down to the ship the very next evening  finelooking woman she was and wot with er watch and chain and dimond rings and brooches and suchlike i should think she must ave ad five or six pounds worth of jewellry on er  she gave me a very pleasant smile and i gave er one back and we stood chatting there like old friends till at last she tore erself away and went on board the ship  she came off by and by hanging on capn tarbells arm  the capn was dressed up in is sunday clothes with one of the cleanest collars on i ave ever seen in my life and smoking a cigar that smelt like an escape of gas  he came back alone at hapast eleven that night and e told me that if it wasnt for the other one down shoremouth way he should be the appiest man on earth  mrs plimmers only got one fault he ses shaking his cad and thats jealousy  if she got to know of laura lamb it would be all up it makes me go cold all over when i think of it  the only thing is to get married as quick as i can then she cant help erself  it wouldnt prevent the other one making a fuss though i ses  no he ses very thoughtfully it wouldnt  i shall ave to do something there but wot i dont know  he climbed on board like a man with a load on his mind and arter a look at the sky went below and forgot both is troubles in sleep  mrs plimmer came down to the wharf every time the ship was up arter that  sometimes shed spend the evening aboard and sometimes theyd go off and spend it somewhere else  she ad a fancy for the cabin i think and the capn told me that she ad said when they were married she was going to sail with im sometimes  but it aint for six months yet he ses and a lot o things might appen to the other one in that time with luck  it was just about a month arter that that e came to me one evening trembling all over  i ad just come on dooty and afore i could ask im wot was the matter he ad got me in the bulls head and stood me three arfpints one arter the other  im ruined he ses in a usky whisper im done for  why was wimmen made  wot good are they  fancy ow bright and appy we should all be without em  i started to pint out one or two things to im that he seemed to ave forgot but e wouldnt listen  he was so excited that he didnt seem to know wot e was doing and arter he ad got three more arfpints waiting for me all in a row on the counter i ad to ask im whether he thought i was there to do conjuring tricks or wot  there was a letter waiting for me in the office he ses  from miss lambshes in london  shes coming to pay me a surprise visit this eveningi know wholl get the surprise  mrs plimmers coming too  i gave im one of my arfpints and made im drink it  he chucked the pot on the floor when he ad done in a desprit sort o way and im and the landlord ad a little breeze then that did im more good than wot the beer ad  when we came outside e seemed more contented with imself but he shook his ead and got miserable as soon as we got to the wharf agin  spose they both come along at the same time he ses  wots to be done  i shut the gate with a bang and fastened the wicket  then i turned to im with a smile  im watchman ere i ses and i lets in who i thinks i will  this aint a public ighway i ses its a wharf  bill he ses youre a genius  if miss lamb comes ere asking arter you i ses i shall say youve gone out for the evening  wot about her letter he ses  you didnt ave it i ses winking at im  and suppose she waits about outside for me and mrs plimmer wants me to take er out he ses shivering  shes a fearful obstinate woman and shed wait a week for me  he kept peeping up the road while we talked it over and then we both see mrs plimmer coming along  he backed on to the wharf and pulled out is purse  bill he ses gabbling as fast as e could gabble heres five or six shillings  if the other one comes and wont go away tell er ive gone to the pagoda musicall and youll take er to me keep er out all the evening someow if you can if she comes back too soon keep er in the office  and wot about leaving the wharf and my dooty i ses staring  ill put joe on to keep watch for you he ses pressing the money in my and  i rely on you bill and ill never forget you  you wont lose by it trust me  he nipped off and tumbled aboard the ship afore i could say a word  i just stood there staring arter im and feeling the money and afore i could make up my mind mrs plimmer came up  i thought i should never ha got rid of er  she stood there chatting and smiling and seemed to forget all about the capn and every moment i was afraid that the other one might come up  at last she went off looking behind er to the ship and then i went outside and put my back up agin the gate and waited  i ad hardly been there ten minutes afore the other one came along  i saw er stop and speak to a policeman and then she came straight over to me  i want to see capn tarbell she ses  capn tarbell i ses very slow capn tarbell as gone off for the evening  gone off she ses staring  but he cant ave  are you sure  sartain i ses  then i ad a bright idea  and theres a letter come for im i ses  oh dear she ses  and i thought it would be in plenty of time well i must go on the ship and wait for im i suppose  if i ad only let er go i should ha saved myself a lot o trouble and the man wot deserved it would ha got it  instead o that i told er about the musicall and arter carrying on like a silly gal o seventeen and saying she couldnt think of it she gave way and said shed go with me to find im  i was all right so far as clothes went as it happened mrs plimmer said once that i got more and more dressy every time she saw me and my missis ad said the same thing only in a different way  i just took a peep through the wicket and saw that joe ad taken up my dooty and then we set off  i said i wasnt quite sure which one hed gone to but wed try the pagoda musicall fust and we went there on a bus from aldgate  it was the fust evening out i ad ad for years and i should ave enjoyed it if it adnt been for miss lamb  wotever capn tarbell could ha seen in er i cant think  she was quiet and stupid and badtempered  when the busconductor came round for the fares she adnt got any change and when we got to the hall she did such eggsterrordinary things trying to find er pocket that i tried to look as if she didnt belong to me  when she left off she smiled and said she was farther off than ever and arter three or four wot was standing there ad begged er to have another try i ad to pay for the two  the ouse was pretty full when we got in but she didnt take no notice of that  her idea was that she could walk about all over the place looking for capn tarbell and it took three men in buttons and a policeman to persuade er different  we were pushed into a couple o seats at last and then she started finding fault with me  where is capn tarbell she ses  why dont you find him  ill go and look for im in the bar presently i ses  hes sure to be there arter a turn or two  i managed to keep er quiet for arf an hourwith the elp of the people wot sat near usand then i ad to go  i ad a glass o beer to pass the time away and while i was drinking it who should come up but the cook and one of the hands from the lizzie and annie  we saw you ses the cook winking didnt we bob  yes ses bob shaking his silly ead but it wasnt no surprise to me  ive ad my eye on im for a long time past  i thought e was married ses the cook  so he is ses bob and to the best wife in london  i know where she lives  mines a bottle o bass he ses turning to me  sos mine ses the cook  i paid for two bottles for em and arter that they said that theyd ave a whisky and soda apiece just to show as there was no illfeeling  its very good ses bob sipping his but it wants a sixpenny cigar to go with it  its been the dream o my life to smoke a sixpenny cigar  so it as mine ses the cook but i dont suppose i ever shall  they both coughed arter that and like a goodnatured fool i stood em a sixpenny cigar apiece and i ad just turned to go back to my seat when up come two more hands from the lizzie and annie  halloa watchman ses one of em  why i thought you was ataking care of the wharf  hes got something better than the wharf to take care of ses bob grinning  i know we see im ses the other chap  weve been watching is goingson for the last arfhour better than a play it was  i stopped their mouths with a glass o bitter each and went back to my seat while they was drinking it  i told miss lamb in whispers that e wasnt there but id ave another look for him by and by  if shed ha whispered back it would ha been all right but she wouldnt and arter a most unpleasant scene she walked out with her ead in the air follered by me with two men in buttons and a policeman  o course nothing would do but she must go back to the wharf and wait for capn tarbell and all the way there i was wondering wot would appen if she went on board and found im there with mrs plimmer  however when we got there i persuaded er to go into the office while i went aboard to see if i could find out where he was and three minutes arterwards he was standing with me behind the galley trembling all over and patting me on the back  keep er in the office a little longer he ses in a whisper  the others going soon  keep er there as long as you can  and suppose she sees you and mrs plimmer passing the window i ses  thatll be all right im going to take er to the stairs in the ships boat he ses  its more romantic  he gave me a little punch in the ribs playfullike and arter telling me i was worth my weight in golddust went back to the cabin agin  i told miss lamb that the cabin was locked up but that capn tarbell was expected back in about arfanhours time  then i found er an old newspaper and a comfortable chair and sat down to wait  i couldnt go on the wharf for fear shed want to come with me and i sat there as patient as i could till a little clicking noise made us both start up and look at each other  wots that she ses listening  it sounded i ses it sounded like somebody locking the door  i went to the door to try it just as somebody dashed past the window with their ead down  it was locked fast and arter i had ad a try at it and miss lamb had ad a try at it we stood and looked at each other in surprise  somebodys playing a joke on us i ses  joke ses miss lamb  open that door at once  if you dont open it ill call for the police  she looked at the windows but the iron bars wot was strong enough to keep the vans outside was strong enough to keep er in and then she gave way to such a fit o temper that i couldnt do nothing with er  capn tarbell cant be long now i ses as soon as i could get a word in  we shall get out as soon as e comes  she flung erself down in the chair agin with er back to me and for nearly threequarters of an hour we sat there without a word  then to our joy we eard footsteps turn in at the gate  quick footsteps they was  somebody turned the handle of the door and then a face looked in at the window that made me nearly jump out of my boots in surprise  a face that was as white as chalk with temper and a bonnet cocked over one eye with walking fast  she shook er fist at me and then she shook it at miss lamb  whos that ses miss lamb  my missis i ses in a loud voice  thank goodness shes come  open the door ses my missis with a screech  open the door  i cant i ses  somebodys locked it  this is capn tarbells young lady  ill capn tarbell er when i get in ses my wife  you too  ill musicall you  ill learn you to go gallivanting about  open the door  she walked up and down the alleyway in front of the window waiting for me just like a lion walking up and down its cage waiting for its dinner and i made up my mind then and there that i should ave to make a clean breast of it and let capn tarbell get out of it the best way he could i wasnt going to suffer for him  ow long my missis walked up and down there i dont know  it seemed ages to me but at last i eard footsteps and voices and bob and the cook and the other two chaps wot we ad met at the musicall came along and stood grinning in at the window  somebodys locked us in i ses  go and fetch capn tarbell  capn tarbell ses the cook  you dont want to see im  why hes the last man in the world you ought to want to see  you dont know ow jealous he is  you go and fetch im i ses  ow dare you talk like that afore my wife  i dursent take the responserbility ses the cook  it might mean bloodshed  you go and fetch im ses my missis  never mind about the bloodshed i dont  open the door  she started banging on the door agin and arter talking among themselves for a time they moved off to the ship  they came back in three or four minutes and the cook eld up something in front of the window  the boy ad got it he ses  now shall i open the door and let your missis in or would you rather stay where you are in peace and quietness  i saw my missis jump at the key and bob and the others laughing fit to split their sides olding her back  then i heard a shout and the next moment capn tarbell came up and asked em wot the trouble was about  they all started talking at once and then the capn arter one look in at the window threw up his ands and staggered back as if e couldnt believe his eyesight  he stood dazedlike for a second or two and then e took the key out of the cooks and opened the door and walked in the four men was close beind im and do all she could my missis couldnt get in front of em  watchman he ses in a stuckup voice wot does this mean  laura lamb  wot ave you got to say for yourself  where ave you been all the evening  shes been to a musicall with bill ses the cook  we saw em  wot ses the capn falling back again  it cant be  it was them ses my wife  a little boy brought me a note telling me you let me go its my husband and i want to talk to im  its all right i ses waving my and at miss lamb wot was going to speak and smiling at my missis wot was trying to get at me  we went to look for you ses miss lamb very quick  he said you were at the musicall and as you adnt got my letter i thought it was very likely  but i did get your letter ses the capn  he said you didnt ses miss lamb  look ere i ses  why dont you keep quiet and let me explain  i can explain everything  im glad o that for your sake my man ses the capn looking at me very hard  i ope you will be able to explain ow it was you came to leave the wharf for three hours  i saw it all then  if i split about mrs plimmer hed split to the guvnor about my leaving my dooty and i should get the sack  i thought i should ha choked and judging by the way they banged me on the back bob and the cook thought so too  they elped me to a chair when i got better and i sat there elpless while the capn went on talking  im no mischiefmaker he ses and besides praps hes been punished enough  and as far as im concerned he can take this lady to a musicall every night of the week if e likes  ive done with her  there was an eggsterrordinary noise from where my missis was standing like the gurgling water makes sometimes running down the kitchen sink at ome only worse  then they all started talking together and arfa dozen times or more miss lamb called me to back er up in wot she was saying but i only shook my ead and at last arter tossing her ead at capn tarbell and telling im she wouldnt ave im if hed got fifty million a year the five of em eld my missis while she went off  they gave er ten minutes start and then capn tarbell arter looking at me and shaking his ead said he was afraid they must be going  and i ope this nightll be a lesson to you he ses  dont neglect your dooty again  i shall keep my eye on you and if you beave yourself i shant say anything  why for all you know or could ha done the wharf might ha been burnt to the ground while you was away  he nodded to his crew and they all walked out laughing and left me alonewith the missis       illustration mr chase with his friend in his powerful grasp was doing his best as he expressed it to shake the life out of him    fairy gold   come and have a pint and talk it over said mr augustus teak  ive got reasons in my ead that you dont dream of alf  mr chase grunted and stole a sideglance at the small figure of his companion  all brains you are gussie he remarked  thats why it is youre so well off  come and have a pint repeated the other and with surprising ease pushed his bulky friend into the bar of the ship and anchor  mr chase mellowed by a long draught placed his mug on the counter and eyeing him kindly said  ive been in my lodgings thirteen years  i know said mr teak but ive got a partikler reason for wanting you  our lodger mr dunn left last week and i only thought of you yesterday  i mentioned you to my missis and she was quite pleased  you see she knows ive known you for over twenty years and she wants to make sure of only aving honest people in the ouse  she has got a reason for it  he closed one eye and nodded with great significance at his friend  oh  said mr chase waiting  shes a rich woman said mr teak pulling the others ear down to his mouth  she  when youve done tickling me with your whiskers said mr chase withdrawing his head and rubbing his ear vigorously i shall be glad  mr teak apologized  a rich woman he repeated  shes been stinting me for twentynine years and saving the moneymy moneymoney that i ave earned with the sweat of my brow  she as got over three undred pounds  ow much  demanded mr chase  three undred pounds and more repeated the other and if she had ad the sense to put it in a bank it would ha been over four undred by this time  instead o that she keeps it hid in the ouse  where  inquired the greatly interested mr chase  mr teak shook his head  thats just what i want to find out he answered  she dont know i know it and she mustnt know either thats important  how did you find out about it then  inquired his friend  my wifes sisters husband bert adams told me  his wife told im in strict confidence and i might ave gone to my grave without knowing about it only she smacked his face for im the other night  if its in the house you ought to be able to find it easy enough said mr chase  yes its all very well to talk retorted mr teak  my missis never leaves the ouse unless im with her except when im at work and if she thought i knew of it shed take and put it in some bank or somewhere unbeknown to me and i should be farther off it than ever  havent you got no idea  said mr chase  not the leastest bit said the other  i never thought for a moment she was saving money  shes always asking me for more for one thing but then women alway do  and look ow bad it is for hersaving money like that on the sly  she might grow into a miser pore thing  for er own sake i ought to get hold of it if its only to save her from erself  mr chases face reflected the gravity of his own  youre the only man i can trust continued mr teak and i thought if you came as lodger you might be able to find out where it is hid and get hold of it for me  me steal it dye mean  demanded the gaping mr chase  and suppose she got me locked up for it  i should look pretty shouldnt i  no you find out where it is hid said the other thats all you need do  ill find someway of getting hold of it then  but if you cant find it how should i be able to  inquired mr chase  cos youll ave opportunities said the other  i take her out some time when youre supposed to be out late you come ome let yourself in with your key and spot the hidingplace  i get the cash and give you tengoldensovereignsall to your little self  it only occurred to me after bert told me about it that i aint been in the house alone for years  he ordered some more beer and drawing mr chase to a bench sat down to a long and steady argument  it shook his faith in human nature to find that his friend estimated the affair as a twentypound job but he was in no position to bargain  they came out smoking twopenny cigars whose strength was remarkable for their age and before they parted mr chase was pledged to the hilt to do all that he could to save mrs teak from the vice of avarice  it was a more difficult undertaking than he had supposed  the house small and compact seemed to offer few opportunities for the concealment of large sums of money and after a fortnights residence he came to the conclusion that the treasure must have been hidden in the garden  the unalloyed pleasure however with which mrs teak regarded the efforts of her husband to put under cultivation land that had lain fallow for twenty years convinced both men that they were on a wrong scent  mr teak who did the digging was the first to realize it but his friend pointing out the suspicions that might be engendered by a sudden cessation of labour induced him to persevere  and try and look as if you liked it he said severely  why from the window even the back view of you looks disagreeable  im fair sick of it declared mr teak  anybody might ha known she wouldnt have buried it in the garden  she must ave been saving for pretty near thirty years week by week and she couldnt keep coming out here to hide it  taint likely  mr chase pondered  let her know casual like that i shant be ome till late on saturday he said slowly  then you come ome in the afternoon and take her out  as soon as youre gone ill pop in and have a thorough good hunt round  is she fond of animals  i blieve so said the other staring  why  take er to the zoo said mr chase impressively  take twopennorth o nuts with you for the monkeys and some stale buns forforfor animals as likes em  give er a ride on the elephant and a ride on the camel  anything else  inquired mr teak disagreeably  any more ways you can think of for me to spend my money  you do as i tell you said his friend  ive got an idea now where it is  if im able to show you where to put your finger on three undred pounds when you come ome itll be the cheapest outing you have ever ad wont it  mr teak made no reply but after spending the evening in deliberation issued the invitation at the suppertable  his wifes eyes sparkled at first then the light slowly faded from them and her face fell  i cant go she said at last  ive got nothing to go in  rubbish  said her husband starting uneasily  its a fact said mrs teak  i should like to go tooits years since i was at the zoo  i might make my jacket do its my hat im thinking about  mr chase meeting mr teaks eye winked an obvious suggestion  so thanking you all the same continued mrs teak with amiable cheerfulness ill stay at ome  owow much are they  growled her husband scowling at mr chase  all prices replied his wife  yes i know said mr teak in a grating voice  you go in to buy a hat at one and elevenpence you get talked over and flattered by a man like a barbers block and you come out with a fourandsix penny one the only real difference in hats is the price but women can never see it  mrs teak smiled faintly and again expressed her willingness to stay at home  they could spend the afternoon working in the garden she said her husband with another indignant glance at the right eye of mr chase which was still enacting the part of a camerashutter said that she could have a hat but asked her to remember when buying it that nothing suited her so well as a plain one  the remainder of the week passed away slowly and mr teak despite his utmost efforts was unable to glean any information from mr chase as to that gentlemans ideas concerning the hidingplace  at every suggestion mr chases smile only got broader and more indulgent  you leave it to me he said  you leave it to me and when you come home from a happy outing i ope to be able to cross your little hand with three undred golden quids  but why not tell me  urged mr teak  cos i want to surprise you was the reply  but mind whatever you do dont let your wife run away with the idea that ive been mixed up in it at all  now if you worry me any more i shall ask you to make it thirty pounds for me instead of twenty  the two friends parted at the corner of the road on saturday afternoon and mr teak conscious of his friends impatience sought to hurry his wife by occasionally calling the wrong time up the stairs  she came down at last smiling in a plain hat with three roses two bows and a feather  ive had the feather for years she remarked  this is the fourth hat it has been onbut then ive taken care of it  mr teak grunted and opening the door ushered her into the street  a sense of adventure and the hope of a profitable afternoon made his spirits rise  he paid a compliment to the hat and then to the surprise of both followed it up with anothera very little oneto his wife  they took a tram at the end of the street and for the sake of the air mounted to the top  mrs teak leaned back in her seat with placid enjoyment and for the first ten minutes amused herself with the life in the streets  then she turned suddenly to her husband and declared that she had felt a spot of rain  magination he said shortly  something cold touched him lightly on the eyelid a tiny pattering sounded from the seats and then swish down came the rain  with an angry exclamation he sprang up and followed his wife below  just our luck she said mournfully  best thing we can do is to stay in the car and go back with it  nonsense  said her husband in a startled voice itll be over in a minute  events proved the contrary  by the time the car reached the terminus it was coming down heavily  mrs teak settled herself squarely in her seat and patches of blue sky visible only to the eye of faith and her husband failed to move her  even his reckless reference to a cab failed  its no good she said tartly  we cant go about the grounds in a cab and im not going to slop about in the wet to please anybody  we must go another time  its hard luck but theres worse things in life  mr teak wondering as to the operations of mr chase agreed dumbly  he stopped the car at the corner of their road and holding his head down against the rain sprinted towards home  mrs teak anxious for her hat passed him  what on earths the matter  she inquired fumbling in her pocket for the key as her husband executed a clumsy but noisy breakdown on the front step  chill replied mr teak  ive got wet  he resumed his lumberings and the door being opened gave vent to his relief at being home again in the dry in a voice that made the windows rattle  then with anxious eyes he watched his wife pass upstairs  wonder what excuse old alfll make for being in  he thought  he stood with one foot on the bottom stair listening acutely  he heard a door open above and then a wild earsplitting shriek rang through the house  instinctively he dashed upstairs and following his wife into their bedroom stood by her side gaping stupidly at a pair of legs standing on the hearthstone  as he watched they came backwards into the room the upper part of a body materialized from the chimney and turning round revealed the sootstained face of mr alfred chase  another wild shriek from mrs teak greeted its appearance  hullo  exclaimed mr teak groping for the right thing to say hullo  whatwhat are you doing alf  mr chase blew the soot from his lips  iii come ome unexpected he stammered  butwhat areyou doing  panted mrs teak in a rising voice  ii was passing your door said mr chase passing your doorto go to my room toto ave a bit of a rinse when  yes said mrs teak  mr chase gave mr teak a glance the pathos of which even the soot could not conceal  when ii heard a pore little bird struggling in your chimbley he continued with a sigh of relief  being fond of animals i took the liberty of comin into your room and saving its life  mr teak drew a breath which he endeavoured in vain to render noiseless  it got its pore little foot caught in the brickwork continued the veracious mr chase tenderly  i released it and it flowedi mean flewup the chimbley  with the shamefaced air of a man detected in the performance of a noble action he passed out of the room  husband and wife eyed each other  thats alfthats alf all over said mr teak with enthusiasm  hes been like it from a child  hes the sort of man that ud dive off waterloo bridge to save the life of a drownding sparrow  hes made an awful mess said his wife frowning itll take me the rest of the day to clean up  theres soot everywhere  the rug is quite spoilt  she took off her hat and jacket and prepared for the fray  down below messrs  teak and chase comparing notes sought with much warmth to put the blame on the right shoulders  well it aint there said mr chase finally  ive made sure of that  thats something towards it  i shant ave to look there again thank goodness  mr teak sniffed  got any more ideas  he queried  i have said the other sternly  theres plenty of places to search yet  ive only just begun  get her out as much as you can and ill ave my hands on it afore you can say  soot  suggested mr teak sourly  any more of your nasty snacks and i chuck it up altogether said mr chase heatedly  if i wasnt hard up id drop it now  he went up to his room in dudgeon and for the next few days mr teak saw but little of him  to lure mrs teak out was almost as difficult as to persuade a snail to leave its shell but he succeeded on two or three occasions and each time she added something to her wardrobe  the assistant fortunehunter had been in residence just a month when mr teak returning home one afternoon stood in the small passage listening to a suppressed wailing noise proceeding from upstairs  it was so creepy that halfway up he hesitated and in a stern but trembling voice demanded to know what his wife meant by it  a louder wail than before was the only reply and summoning up his courage he pushed open the door of the bedroom and peeped in  his gaze fell on mrs teak who was sitting on the hearthrug rocking to and fro in front of a dismantled fireplace  whatwhats the matter  he said hastily  mrs teak raised her voice to a pitch that set his teeth on edge  my money she wailed  its all gone  all gone  money  repeated mr teak hardly able to contain himself  what money  allall my savings  moaned his wife  savings  said the delighted mr teak  what savings  money i have been putting by for our old age said his wife  three hundred and twentytwo pounds  all gone  in a fit of sudden generosity mr teak decided then and there that mr chase should have the odd twentytwo pounds  youre dreaming  he said sternly  i wish i was said his wife wiping her eyes  three hundred and twentytwo pounds in empty mustardtins  every hapennys gone  mr teaks eye fell on the stove  he stepped for ward and examined it the back was out and mrs teak calling his attention to a tunnel at the side implored him to put his arm in and satisfy himself that it was empty  but where could you get all that money from  he demanded after a prolonged groping  sasasaved it sobbed his wife for our old age  our old age  repeated mr teak in lofty tones  and suppose i had died first  or suppose you had died sudden  this is what comes of deceitfulness and keeping things from your husband  now somebody has stole it  mrs teak bent her head and sobbed again  ii had just been out for for an hour she gasped  when i came back i foufoufound the washhouse window smashed and  sobs choked her utterance  mr teak lost in admiration of mr chases cleverness stood regarding her in silence  whatwhat about the police  said his wife at last  police  repeated mr teak with extraordinary vehemence  police certainly not  dye think im going to let it be known all round that im the husband of a miser  id sooner lose ten times the money  he stalked solemnly out of the room and downstairs and safe in the parlour gave vent to his feelings in a wild but silent hornpipe  he cannoned against the table at last and subsiding into an easychair crammed his handkerchief to his mouth and gave way to suppressed mirth  in his excitement he forgot all about tea and the bereaved mrs teak made no attempt to come downstairs to prepare it  with his eye on the clock he waited with what patience he might for the arrival of mr chase the usual hour for his return came and went  another hour passed and another  a horrible idea that mr chase had been robbed gave way to one more horrible still  he paced the room in dismay until at nine oclock his wife came down and in a languid fashion began to set the suppertable  alfs very late said mr teak thickly  is he  said his wife dully  very late said mr teak  i cant thinkah there he is  he took a deep breath and clenched his hands together  by the time mr chase came into the room he was able to greet him with a stealthy wink mr chase with a humorous twist of his mouth winked back  weve ad a upset said mr teak in warning tones  eh said the other as mrs teak threw her apron over her head and sank into a chair  what about  in bated accents interrupted at times by broken murmurs from his wife mr teak informed him of the robbery  mr chase leaning against the doorpost listened with open mouth and distended eyeballs  occasional interjections of pity and surprise attested his interest  the tale finished the gentlemen exchanged a significant wink and sighed in unison  and now said mr teak an hour later after his wife had retired where is it  ah thats the question said mr chase roguishly  i wonder where it can be  ii hope its in a safe place said mr teak anxiously  where ave you put it  me  said mr chase  who are you getting at  i aint put it anywhere  you know that  dont play the giddy goat said the other testily  whereve you hid it  is it safe  mr chase leaned back in his chair and shaking his head at him smiled approvingly  youre a little wonder thats what you are gussie he remarked  no wonder your pore wife is took in so easy  mr teak sprang up in a fury  dont play the fool he said hoarsely wheres the money  i want it  now whereve you put it  go on said mr chase with a chuckle  go on  dont mind me  you ought to be on the stage gussie thats where you ought to be  im not joking said mr teak in a trembling voice and i dont want you to joke with me  if you think you are going off with my money youre mistook  if you dont tell me in two minutes where it is i shall give you in charge for theft  oh said mr chase  he took a deep breath  oh really  he said  i wouldnt ave thought it of you gussie  i wouldnt ave thought youd have played it so low down  im surprised at you  you thought wrong then said the other  trying to do me out o my twenty pounds thats what you are said mr chase knitting his brows  but it wont do my boy  i wasnt born yesterday  hand it over afore i lose my temper  twenty pounds i want of you and i dont leave this room till i get it  speechless with fury mr teak struck at him  the next moment the suppertable was overturned with a crash and mr chase with his friend in his powerful grasp was doing his best as he expressed it to shake the life out of him  a faint scream sounded from above steps pattered on the stairs and mrs teak with a red shawl round her shoulders burst hurriedly into the room  mr chase released mr teak opened his mouth to speak and then thinking better of it dashed into the passage took his hat from the peg and slamming the front door with extraordinary violence departed  he sent round for his clothes next day but he did not see mr teak until a month afterwards  his fists clenched and his mouth hardened but mr teak with a pathetic smile held out his hand and mr chase after a moments hesitation took it  mr teak still holding his friends hand piloted him to a neighbouring hostelry  it was my mistake alf he said shaking his head but it wasnt my fault  its a mistake anybody might ha made  have you found out who took it  inquired mr chase regarding him suspiciously  mr teak gulped and nodded  i met bert adams yesterday he said slowly  it took three pints afore he told me but i got it out of im at last  my missis took it herself  mr chase put his mug down with a bang  what  he gasped  the day after she found you with your head up the chimbley added mr teak mournfully  shes shoved it away in some bank now and i shall never see a hapenny of it  if you was a married man alf youd understand it better  you wouldnt be surprised at anything      illustration as i was asaying kindness to animals is all very well    watchdogs  its amost the only enjyment ive got left said the oldest inhabitant taking a long slow draught of beer that and a pipe o baccy  neither of em wants chewing and thats a great thing when you aint got anything worth speaking about left to chew with  he put his mug on the table and ignoring the stillness of the summer air sheltered the flame of a match between his cupped hands and conveyed it with infinite care to the bowl of his pipe  a dull but crafty old eye squinting down the stem assured itself that the tobacco was well alight before the match was thrown away  as i was asaying kindness to animals is all very well he said to the wayfarer who sat opposite him in the shade of the cauliflower elms but kindness to your fellercreeturs is more  the pint wot you give me is gone but im just as thankful to you as if it wasnt  he half closed his eyes and gazing on to the fields beyond fell into a reverie so deep that he failed to observe the landlord come for his mug and return with it filled  a little start attested his surprise and to his great annoyance upset a couple of tablespoonfuls of the precious liquid  some people waste all their kindness on dumb animals he remarked after the landlord had withdrawn from his offended vision but i was never a believer in it  i mind some time ago when a genlemen from lunnon wot ad more money than sense offered a prize for kindness to animals  i was the only one that didnt try for to win it  mr bunnett is name was and e come down and took farmer halls ouse for the summer  over sixty e was and old enough to know better  he used to put saucers of milk all round the ouse for cats to drink and by the time pore farmer hall got back every cat for three miles round ad got in the habit of coming round to the backdoor and asking for milk as if it was their right  farmer hall poisoned a saucer o milk at last and then ad to pay five shillings for a thin black cat with a mangy tail and one eye that bob pretty said belonged to is children  farmer hall said hed go to jail afore hed pay at fust but arter five men ad spoke the truth and said they ad see bobs youngsters tying a empty mustardtin to its tail ony the day afore he gave way  tha was bob pretty all over that was the biggest raskel claybury as ever had and it wasnt the fust bit o money e made out o mr bunnett coming to the place  it all come through mr bunnetts love for animals  i never see a man so fond of animals as e was and if he had ad is way claybury would ave been overrun by em by this time  the day arter e got to the farm he couldnt eat is breakfuss because of a pig that was being killed in the yard and it was no good pointing out to im that the pig was ony making a fuss about it because it was its nature so to do  he lived on wegetables and such like and the way e carried on one day over arf a biled caterpillar e found in his cabbage wouldnt be believed  he wouldnt eat another mossel but sat hunting igh and low for the other arf  he adnt been in claybury more than a week afore he said ow surprised e was to see ow pore dumb animals was treated  he made a little speech about it one evening up at the schoolroom and arter he ad finished he up and offered to give a prize of a gold watch that used to belong to is dear sister wot loved animals to the one wot was the kindest to em afore he left the place  if hed ha known claybury men better e wouldnt ha done it  the very next morning bill chambers took is babys milk for the cat and smacked is wifes ead for talking arter hed told er to stop  henery walker got into trouble for leaning over charlie stubbss fence and feeding his chickens for im and sam joness wife had to run off ome to er mother arfdressed because she had appened to overlay a sick rabbit wot sam ad taken to bed with im to keep warm  people used to stop animals in the road and try and do em a kindness especially when mr bunnett was passingand peter gubbins walked past is house one day with ole mrs broads cat in is arms  a badtempered old cat it was and wot with peter kissing the top of its ead and calling of it tiddleums it nearly went out of its mind  the fust time mr bunnett see bob pretty was about a week arter hed offered that gold watch  bob was stooping down very careful over something in the hedge and mr bunnett going up quietlike behind im see im messing about with a pore old toad he ad found with a smashed leg  wots the matter with it ses mr bunnett  bob didnt seem to hear im  he was akneeling on the ground with is ead on one side looking at the toad and by and by he pulled out is pocketankercher and put the toad in it as if it was made of eggshells and walked away  wots the matter with it ses mr bunnett amost trotting to keep up with im  got its leg urt in some way pore thing ses bob  i want to get it ome as soon as i can and wash it and put it on a piece o damp moss but im afraid its not long for this world  mr bunnett said it did im credit and walked home alongside of im talking  he was surprised to find that bob hadnt eard anything of the gold watch e was offering but bob said he was a busy ardworking man and didnt ave no time to go to hear speeches or listen to tittletattle  when ive done my days work he ses i can always find a job in the garden and arter that i go in and elp my missis put the children to bed  she aint strong pore thing and its better than wasting time and money up at the cauliflower  he ad a lot o talk with mr bunnett for the next day or two and when e went round with the toad on the third day as lively and well as possible the old genleman said it was a miracle  and so it would ha been if it had been the same toad  he took a great fancy to bob pretty and somehow or other they was always dropping acrost each other  he met bob with is dog one daya large ugly brute but amost as clever as wot bob was imself  it stood there with its tongue anging out and looking at bob uneasylike out of the corner of its eye as bob stood apatting of it and calling it pet names   wunnerful affectionate old dog aint you joseph ses bob  hes got a kind eye ses mr bunnett  hes like another child to me aint you my pretty ses bob smiling at im and feeling in is pocket  here you are old chap  he threw down a biskit so sudden that joseph thinking it was a stone went off like a streak o lightning with is tail between is legs and yelping his ardest  most men would ha looked a bit foolish but bob pretty didnt turn a hair  aint it wunnerful the sense theyve got he ses to mr bunnett wot was still staring arter the dog  sense ses the old genleman  yes ses bob smiling  his food aint been agreeing with im lately and hes starving hisself for a bit to get round agin and e knew that e couldnt trust hisself alongside o this biskit  wot a pity men aint like that with beer  i wish as ow bill chambers and henery walker and a few more ad been ere just now  mr bunnett agreed with im and said wot a pity it was everybody adnt got bob prettys commonsense and good feeling  it aint that ses bob shaking his ead at him it aint to my credit  i dessay if sam jones and peter gubbins and charlie stubbs and dicky weed ad been brought up the same as i was theyd ave been a lot better than wot i am  he bid mr bunnett goodbye becos e said hed got to get back to is work and mr bunnett had ardly got ome afore henery walker turned up full of anxiousness to ask his advice about five little baby kittens wot is old cat had found in the washplace the night afore  drownd them little innercent things same as most would do i cant he ses shaking his ead but wot to do with em i dont know  couldnt you find omes for em ses mr bunnett  henery walker shook his ead agin  taint no use thinking o that he ses  theres more cats than omes about ere  why bill chambers drownded six ony last week right afore the eyes of my pore little boy upset im dreadful it did  mr bunnett walked up and down the room thinking  we must try and find omes for em when they are old enough he says at last ill go round myself and see wot i can do for you  henery walker thanked im and went off ome doing a bit o thinking and well he ad reason to  everybody wanted one o them kittens  peter gubbins offered for to take two and mr bunnett told henery walker next day that e could ha found omes for em ten times over  youve no idea wot fine kindarted people they are in this village when their arts are touched he ses smiling at henery  you ought to ave seen mr joness smile when i asked im to take one  it did me good to see it  and i spoke to mr chambers about drowning is kittens and he told me e hadnt slept a wink ever since  and he offered to take your old cat to make up for it if you was tired of keeping it  it was very ard on henery walker i must say that  other people was getting the credit of bringing up is kittens and more than that they used to ask mr bunnett into their places to see ow the little dears was agetting on  kindness to animals caused more unpleasantness in claybury than anything ad ever done afore  there was hardly a man as ud speak civil to each other and the wimmen was amost as bad  cats and dogs and suchlike began to act as if the place belonged to em and seven people stopped mr bunnett one day to tell im that joe parsons ad been putting down ratpoison and killed five little baby rats and their mother  it was some time afore anybody knew that bob pretty ad got is eye on that gold watch and when they did they could ardly believe it  they give bob credit for too much sense to waste time over wot they knew e couldnt get but arter they ad heard one or two things they got alarmed and pretty near the whole village went up to see mr bunnett and tell im about bobs true character  mr bunnett couldnt believe em at fast but arter they ad told im of bobs poaching and the artful ways and tricks he ad of getting money as didnt belong to im e began to think different  he spoke to parson about im and arter that e said he never wanted for to see bob prettys face again  there was a fine todo about it up at this ere cauliflower publicouse that night and the quietest man o the whole lot was bob pretty  he sat still all the time drinking is beer and smiling at em and giving em good advice ow to get that gold watch  its no good to me he ses shaking his ead  im a pore labourin man and i know my place  ow you

all  cos why  cos i deserves it  they all laughed agin and bill chambers laughed so arty that e joggled peter gubbinss arm and upset is beer  laugh away ses bob pretending to get savage  them that laughs best laughs last mind  ill ave that watch now just to spite you all  ow are you going to get it bob ses sam jones jeering  never you mind mate ses bob stamping is foot im going to win it fair  im going to ave it for kindness to pore dumb animals  ear ear ses dicky weed winking at the others  will you ave a bet on it bob  no ses bob pretty i dont want to win no mans money  i like to earn my money in the sweat o my brow  but you wont win it bob ses dicky grinning  look ere  ill lay you a level bob you dont get it  bob shook his ead and started talking to bill chambers about something else  ill bet you two bob to one bob ses dicky well three to one then  bob sat up and looked atim for a long time considering and at last he ses all right he ses if smith the landlord will mind the money i will  he anded over his shilling but very slowlike and dicky weed anded over is money  arter that bob sat looking disagreeable like especially when  dicky said wot e was goin to do with the money and by an by sam jones dared im to ave the same bet with im in sixpences  bob pretty ad a pint more beer to think it over and arter bill chambers ad stood im another he said e would  he seemed a bit dazed like and by the time he went ome he ad made bets with thirteen of em being saturday night they ad all got money on em and as for bob he always ad some  smith took care of the money and wrote it all up on a slate  why dont you ave a bit on mr smith ses dicky  oh i dunno ses smith wiping down the bar with a wet cloth  its the chance of a lifetime ses dicky  looks like it ses smith coughing  but e

mates all  he rumpled bill chamberss air for im as he passeda thing bill never can abearand gave henery walker wot was drinking beer a smack on the back wot nearly ruined im for life   illustration some of em went and told mr bunnett some more things about bob next day   some of em went and told mr bunnett some more things about bob next day but they might as well ha saved their breath  the old genleman said he knew all about im and he never wanted to ear his name mentioned agin  arter which they began for to ave a more cheerful way of looking at things and sam jones said e was going to ave a hole bored through is sixpence and wear it round is neck to aggravate bob pretty with  for the next three or four weeks bob pretty seemed to keep very quiet and we all began to think as ow he ad made a mistake for once everybody else was trying their ardest for the watch and all bob done was to make a laugh of em and to say he believed it was ony made of brass arter all  then one arternoon just a few days afore mr bunnetts time was up at the farm bob took is dog out for a walk and arter watching the farm for some time met the old genleman by accident up at coes plantation  good

caught joseph one behind that surprised im  bob pretty lifted is foot and caught joseph one behind that surprised im  then he elped mr bunnett look at is leg and arter pointing out that the skin wasnt hardly broken and saying that joseph ad got the best mouth of any dog in claybury e walked ome with the old genleman and got the watch  he said mr bunnett made a little speech when e gave it to im wot he couldnt remember and wot he wouldnt repeat if e could  he came up to this ere cauliflower publicouse the same night for the money e had won and bill chambers made another speech but as smith the landlord put in outside for it it didnt do bob pretty the good it ought to ha done        the bequest  r robert clarkson sat by his fire smoking thoughtfully  his lifelong neighbour and successful rival in love had passed away a few days before and mr clarkson fresh from the obsequies sat musing on the fragility of man and the inconvenience that sometimes attended his departure  his meditations were disturbed by a low knocking on the front door which opened on to the street  in response to his invitation it opened slowly and a small middleaged man of doleful aspect entered softly and closed it behind him  evening bob he said in stricken accents  i thought id just step round to see how you was bearing up  fancy pore old phipps  why id amost as soon it had been me  amost  mr clarkson nodded  here today and gone tomorrow continued mr smithson taking a seat well well  so youll have her at lastpore thing  that was his wish said mr clarkson in a dull voice  and very generous of him too said mr smithson  everybody is saying so  certainly he couldnt take her away with him  how long is it since you was both of you courting her  thirty years come june replied the other  shows what waiting does and patience commented mr smithson  if youd been like some chaps and gone abroad where would you have been now  where would have been the reward of your faithful heart  mr clarkson whose pipe had gone out took a coal from the fire and lit it again  i cant understand him dying at his age he said darkly  he ought to have lived to ninety if hed been taken care of  well hes gone pore chap said his friend  what a blessing it must ha been to him in his last moments to think that he had made provision for his wife  provision  exclaimed mr clarkson  why hes left her nothing but the furniture and fifty pounds insurance moneynothing in the world  mr smithson fidgeted  i mean you he said staring  oh said the other  oh yesyes of course  and he doesnt want you to eat your heart out in waiting said mr smithson  never mind about me he said to her you go and make bob happy  wonderful pretty girl she used to be didnt she  mr clarkson assented  and ive no doubt she looks the same to you as ever she did pursued the sentimental mr smithson  thats the extraordinary part of it  mr clarkson turned and eyed him removed the pipe from his mouth and after hesitating a moment replaced it with a jerk  she says shed rather be faithful to his memory continued the persevering mr smithson but his wishes are her law  she said so to my missis only yesterday  still she ought to be considered said mr clarkson shaking his head i think that somebody ought to put it to her  she has got her feelings poor thing and if she would rather not marry again she oughtnt to be compelled to  just what my missis did say to her said the other but she didnt pay much attention  she said it was henrys wish and she didnt care what happened to her now hes gone  besides if you come to think of it what else is she to do  dont you worry bob you wont lose her again  mr clarkson staring at the fire mused darkly  for thirty years he had played the congenial part of the disappointed admirer but faithful friend  he had intended to play it for at least fifty or sixty  he wished that he had had the strength of mind to refuse the bequest when the late mr phipps first mentioned it or taken a firmer line over the congratulations of his friends  as it was little molton quite understood that after thirty years waiting the faithful heart was to be rewarded at last  public opinion seemed to be that the late mr phipps had behaved with extraordinary generosity  its rather late in life for me to begin said mr clarkson at last  better late than never said the cheerful mr smithson  and something seems to tell me that i aint long for this world continued mr clarkson eyeing him with some disfavour  stuff and nonsense said mr smithson  youll lose all them ideas as soon as youre married  youll have somebody to look after you and help you spend your money  mr clarkson emitted a dismal groan and clapping his hand over his mouth strove to make it pass muster as a yawn  it was evident that the malicious mr smithson was deriving considerable pleasure from his discomfiturethe pleasure natural to the father of seven over the troubles of a comfortable bachelor  mr clarkson anxious to share his troubles with somebody came to a sudden and malicious determination to share them with mr smithson  i dont want anybody to help me spend my money he said slowly first and last ive saved a tidy bit  ive got this house those three cottages in turners lane and pretty near six hundred pounds in the bank  mr smithsons eyes glistened  i had thoughtit had occurred to me said mr clarkson trying to keep as near the truth as possible to leave my property to a friend o mine a hardworking man with a large family  however its no use talking about that now  its too late  whowho was it  inquired his friend trying to keep his voice steady  mr clarkson shook his head  its no good talking about that now george he said eyeing him with sly enjoyment  i shall have to leave everything to my wife now  after all perhaps it does more harm than good to leave money to people  rubbish  said mr smithson sharply  who was it  you george said mr clarkson softly  me  said the other with a gasp  me  he jumped up from his chair and seizing the others hand shook it fervently  i oughtnt to have told you george said mr clarkson with great satisfaction  itll only make you miserable  its just one o the might ha beens  mr smithson with his back to the fire and his hands twisted behind him stood with his eyes fixed in thought  its rather cool of phipps he said after a long silence rather cool i think to go out of the world and just leave his wife to you to look after  some men wouldnt stand it  youre too easygoing bob thats whats the matter with you  mr clarkson sighed  and get took advantage of added his friend  its all very well to talk said mr clarkson but what can i do  i ought to have spoke up at the time  its too late now  if i was you said his friend very earnestly and didnt want to marry her i should tell her so  say what you like it aint fair to her you know  it aint fair to the pore woman  shed never forgive you if she found it out  everybodys taking it for granted said the other  let everybody look after their own business said mr smithson tartly now look here bob suppose i get you out of this business how am i to be sure youll leave your property to menot that i want it  suppose you altered your will  if you get me out of it every penny i leave will go to you said mr clarkson fervently  i havent got any relations and it dont matter in the slightest to me who has it after im gone  as true as you stand there  demanded the other eyeing him fixedly  as true as i stand here said mr clarkson smiting his chest and shook hands again  long after his visitor had gone he sat gazing in a brooding fashion at the fire  as a single man his wants were few and he could live on his savings as the husband of mrs phipps he would be compelled to resume the work he thought he had dropped for good three years before moreover mrs phipps possessed a strength of character that had many times caused him to congratulate himself upon her choice of a husband  slowly but surely his fetters were made secure  two days later the widow departed to spend six weeks with a sister but any joy that he might have felt over the circumstance was marred by the fact that he had to carry her bags down to the railway station and see her off  the key of her house was left with him with strict injunctions to go in and water her geraniums every day while two canaries and a bullfinch had to be removed to his own house in order that they might have constant attention and company  shes doing it on purpose said mr smithson fiercely shes binding you hand and foot  mr clarkson assented gloomily  im trusting to you george he remarked  howd it be to forget to water the geraniums and let the birds die because they missed her so much  suggested mr smithson after prolonged thought  mr clarkson shivered  it would be a hint said his friend  mr clarkson took some letters from the mantelpiece and held them up she writes about them every day he said briefly and i have to answer them  sheshe dont refer to your getting married i suppose  said his friend anxiously  mr clarkson said no  but her sister does he added  ive had two letters from her  mr smithson got up and paced restlessly up and down the room  thats women all over he said bitterly  they never ask for things straight out but they always get em in roundabout ways  she cant do it herself so she gets her sister to do it  mr clarkson groaned  and her sister is hinting that she cant leave the house where she spent so many happy years he said and says what a pleasant surprise it would be for mrs phipps if she was to come home and find it done up  that means youve got to live there when youre married said his friend solemnly  mr clarkson glanced round his comfortable room and groaned again  she asked me to get an estimate from digson he said dully  she knows as well as i do her sister hasnt got any money  i wrote to say that it had better be left till she comes home as i might not know what was wanted  mr smithson nodded approval  and mrs phipps wrote herself and thanked me for being so considerate continued his friend grimly and says that when she comes back we must go over the house together and see what wants doing  mr smithson got up and walked round the room again  you never promised to marry her  he said stopping suddenly  no said the other  its all been arranged for me  i never said a word  i couldnt tell phipps i wouldnt have her with them all standing round and him thinking he was doing me the greatest favour in the world  well she cant name the day unless you ask her said the other  all youve got to do is to keep quiet and not commit yourself  be as cool as you can and just before she comes home you go off to london on business and stay there as long as possible  mr clarkson carried out his instructions to the letter and mrs phipps returning home at the end of her visit learned that he had left for london three days before leaving the geraniums and birds to the care of mr smithson  from the hands of that unjust steward she received two empty birdcages together with a detailed account of the manner in which the occupants had effected their escape and a bullfinch that seemed to be suffering from torpid liver  the condition of the geraniums was ascribed to worms in the pots frost and premature decay  they go like it sometimes said mr smithson and when they do nothing will save em  mrs phipps thanked him  its very kind of you to take so much trouble she said quietly some people would have lost the cages too while they were about it  i did my best said mr smithson in a surly voice  i know you did said mrs phipps thoughtfully and i am sure i am much obliged to you  if there is anything of yours i can look after at any time i shall be only too pleased  when did you say mr clarkson was coming back  he dont know said mr smithson promptly  he might be away a month and then again he might be away six  it all depends  you know what business is  its very thoughtful of him said mrs phipps  very  thoughtful  repeated mr smithson  he has gone away for a time out of consideration for me said the widow  as things are it is a little bit awkward for us to meet much at present  i dont think hes gone away for that at all said the other bluntly  mrs phipps shook her head  ah you dont know him as well as i do she said fondly  he has gone away on my account i feel sure  mr smithson screwed his lips together and remained silent  when he feels that it is right and proper for him to come back pursued mrs phipps turning her eyes upwards he will come  he has left his comfortable home just for my sake and i shall not forget it  mr smithson cougheda short dry cough meant to convey incredulity  i shall not do anything to this house till he comes back said mrs phipps  i expect he would like to have a voice in it  he always used to admire it and say how comfortable it was  well well we never know what is before us  mr smithson repeated the substance of the interview to mr clarkson by letter and in the lengthy correspondence that followed kept him posted as to the movements of mrs phipps  by dint of warnings and entreaties he kept the bridegroomelect in london for three months  by that time little molton was beginning to talk  theyre beginning to see how the land lays said mr smithson on the evening of his friends return and if you keep quiet and do as i tell you shell begin to see it too  as i said before she cant name the day till you ask her  mr clarkson agreed and the following morning when he called upon mrs phipps at her request his manner was so distant that she attributed it to illhealth following business worries and the atmosphere of london in the front parlour mr digson a small builder and contractor was busy whitewashing  i thought we might as well get on with that said mrs phipps there is only one way of doing whitewashing and the room has got to be done tomorrow mr digson will bring up some papers and if youll come round you can help me choose  mr clarkson hesitated  why not choose em yourself  he said at last  just what i told her said mr digson stroking his black beard whatll please you will be sure to please him i says and if it dont it ought to  mr clarkson started  perhaps you could help her choose he said sharply  mr digson came down from his perch  just what i said he replied if mrs phipps will let me advise her ill make this house so she wont know it before ive done with it  mr digson has been very kind said mrs phipps reproachfully  not at all maam said the builder softly  anything i can do to make you happy or comfortable will be a pleasure to me  mr clarkson started again and an odd idea sent his blood dancing digson was a widower mrs phipps was a widow  could anything be more suitable or desirable  better let him choose he said  after all he ought to be a good judge  mrs phipps after a faint protest gave way and mr digson smiling broadly mounted his perch again  mr clarksons first idea was to consult mr smithson then he resolved to wait upon events  the idea was fantastic to begin with but if things did take such a satisfactory turn he could not help reflecting that it would not be due to any efforts on the part of mr smithson and he would no longer be under any testamentary obligations to that enterprising gentleman  by the end of a week he was jubilant  a child could have told mr digsons intentionsand mrs phipps was anything but a child  mr clarkson admitted cheerfully that mr digson was a younger and betterlooking man than himselfa more suitable match in every way and so far as he could judge mrs phipps seemed to think so  at any rate she had ceased to make the faintest allusion to any tie between them  he left her one day painting a door while the attentive digson guided the brush and walked homewards smiling  morning  said a voice behind him  morning bignell said mr clarkson  whenwhen is it to be inquired his friend walking beside him  mr clarkson frowned  when is what to be he demanded disagreeably  mr bignell lowered his voice  youll lose her if you aint careful he said  mark my words  cant you see digsons little game  mr clarkson shrugged his shoulders  hes after her money said the other with a cautious glance around  money  said the other with an astonished laugh  why she hasnt got any   illustration shell be riding in her carriage and pair in six months   oh all right said mr bignell  you know best of course  i was just giving you the tip but if you know betterwhy theres nothing more to be said  shell be riding in her carriage and pair in six months anyhow the richest woman in little molton  mr clarkson stopped short and eyed him in perplexity  digson got a bit sprung one night and told me said mr bignell  she dont know it herself yetuncle on her mothers side in america  she might know at any moment  butbut how did digson know  inquired the astonished mr clarkson  he wouldnt tell me was the reply  but its good enough for him what do you think hes after  her  and mind dont let on to a soul that i told you  he walked on leaving mr clarkson standing in a dazed condition in the centre of the footpath  recovering himself by an effort he walked slowly away and after prowling about for some time in an aimless fashion made his way back to mrs phippss house  he emerged an hour later an engaged man with the date of the wedding fixed  with jaunty steps he walked round and put up the banns and then with the air of a man who has completed a successful stroke of business walked homewards  little molton is a small town and news travels fast but it did not travel faster than mr smithson as soon as he had heard it  he burst into mr clarksons room like the proverbial hurricane and gasping for breath leaned against the table and pointed at him an incriminating finger  you youve been running said mr clarkson uneasily  whatwhatwhat do youmean by it gasped mr smithson  after all my trouble  after ourbargain  i altered my mind said mr clarkson with dignity  pah  said the other  just in time said mr clarkson speaking rapidly  another day and i believe i should ha been too late  it took me pretty near an hour to talk her over  said id been neglecting her and all that sort of thing said that she was beginning to think i didnt want her  as hard a job as ever i had in my life  but you didnt want her said the amazed mr smithson  you told me so  you misunderstood me said mr clarkson coughing  you jump at conclusions  mr smithson sat staring at him  i heard he said at last with an effort  i heard that digson was paying her attentions  mr clarkson spoke without thought  ha he was only after her money he said severely  good heavens  whats the matter  mr smithson who had sprung to his feet made no reply but stood for some time incapable of speech  whatisthematter  repeated mr clarkson  aint you well  mr smithson swayed a little and sank slowly back into his chair again  rooms too hot said his astonished host  mr smithson staring straight before him nodded  as i was saying resumed mr clarkson in the low tones of confidence digson was after her money  of course her money dont make any difference to me although perhaps i may be able to do something for friends like you  its from an uncle in america on her mothers  mr smithson made a strange moaning noise and snatching his hat from the table clapped it on his head and made for the door  mr clarkson flung his arms around him and dragged him back by main force  what are you carrying on like that for he demanded  what do you mean by it  fancy  returned mr smithson with intense bitterness  i thought digson was the biggest fool in the place and i find ive made  a mistake  so have you  goodnight  he opened the door and dashed out  mr clarkson with a strange sinking at his heart watched him up the road       the guardian angel  illustration the lodger was standing at the foot o gingers bed going through is pockets  the nightwatchman shook his head  i never met any of these phil philantherpists as you call em he said decidedly  if i ad they wouldnt ave got away from me in a hurry i can tell you  i dont say i dont believe in em i only say i never met any of em  if people do you a kindness its generally because they want to get something out of you same as a man oncea perfick strangerwot stood me eight arfpints becos i reminded im of his dead brother and then borrered five bob off of me  o course there must be some kindarted people in the worldall men who get married must ave a soft spot somewhere if its only in the eadbut they dont often give things away  kindartedness is often only another name for artfulness same as sam smalls kindness to ginger dick and peter russet  it started with a row  they was just back from a vyge and ad taken a nice room together in wapping and for the fust day or two wot with aving plenty o money to spend and nothing to do they was like three brothers  then in a little oldfashioned publicouse down poplar way one night they fell out over a little joke ginger played on sam  it was the fust drink that evening and sam ad just ordered a pot o beer and three glasses when ginger winked at the landlord and offered to bet sam a level arfdollar that e wouldnt drink off that pot o beer without taking breath  the landlord held the money and old sam with a appy smile on is face ad just taken up the mug when he noticed the odd way in which they was all watching him  twice he took the mug up and put it down agin without starting and asked em wot the little game was but they ony laughed  he took it up the third time and started and he ad just got about arfway through when ginger turns to the landlord and ses  did you catch it in the mousetrap he ses or did it die of poison  pore sam started as though he ad been shot and arter getting rid of the beer in is mouth stood there olding the mug away from im and making such orrible faces that they was amost frightened  wots the matter with him  ive never seen im carry on like that over a drop of beer before ses ginger staring  he usually likes it ses peter russet  not with a dead mouse in it ses sam trembling with passion  mouse ses ginger innercentlike  mouse  why i didnt say it was in your beer sam  wotever put that into your ead  and made you lose your bet ses peter  then old sam see ow hed been done and the way he carried on when the landlord gave ginger the arfdollar and said it was won fair and honest was a disgrace  he opped about that bar arf crazy until at last the landlord and is brother and a couple o soldiers and a helpless cripple wot wos selling matches put im outside and told im to stop there  he stopped there till ginger and peter came out and then drawing imself up in a proud way he told em their characters and wot he thought about em  and he said e never wanted to see wot they called their faces agin as long as he lived  ive done with you he ses both of you for ever  all right ses ginger moving off  tata for the present  lets ope hell come ome in a better temper peter  ome ses sam with a nasty laugh ome  dye think im coming back to breathe the same air as you ginger  dye think i want to be suffocated  he held his ead up very igh and arter looking at them as if they was dirt he turned round and walked off with his nose in the air to spend the evening by imself  his temper kept him up for a time but arter a while he ad to own up to imself that it was very dull and the later it got the more he thought of is nice warm bed  the more e thought of it the nicer and warmer it seemed and arter a struggle between his pride and a few arfpints he got is good temper back agin and went off ome smiling  the room was dark when e got there and arter standing listening a moment to ginger and peter snoring he took off is coat and sat down on is bed to take is boots off  he only sat down for a flash and then he bent down and hit his ead an awful smack against another ead wot ad just started up to see wot it was sitting on its legs  he thought it was peter or ginger in the wrong bed at fust but afore he could make it out ginger ad got out of is own bed and lit the candle then e saw it was a stranger in is bed and without saying a word he laid old of him by the air and began dragging him out  here stop that ses ginger catching hold of im  lend a hand ere peter  peter lent a hand and screwed it into the back o sams neck till he made im leave go and then the stranger a nastylooking little chap with a yellow face and a little dark moustache told sam wot hed like to do to him  who are you ses sam and wot are you adoing of in my bed  its our lodger ses ginger  your wot ses sam ardly able to believe his ears  our lodger ses peter russet  weve let im the bed you said you didnt want for sixpence a night  now you take yourself off  old sam couldnt speak for a minute there was no words that he knew bad enough but at last he licks is lips and he ses ive paid for that bed up to saturday and im going to have it  he rushed at the lodger but peter and ginger got hold of im agin and put im down on the floor and sat on im till he promised to beave himself  they let im get up at last and then arter calling themselves names for their kindartedness they said if he was very good he might sleep on the floor  sam looked at em for a moment and then without a word he took off is boots and put on is coat and went up in a corner to be out of the draught but wot with the cold and is temper and the hardness of the floor it was a long time afore e could get to sleep  he dropped off at last and it seemed to im that he ad only just closed is eyes when it was daylight  he opened one eye and was just going to open the other when he saw something as made im screw em both up sharp and peep through is eyelashes  the lodger was standing at the foot o gingers bed going through is pockets and then arter waiting a moment and aving a look round he went through peter russets  sam lay still mouse while the lodger tiptoed out o the room with is boots in his and and then springing up follered him downstairs  he caught im up just as he ad undone the front door and catching hold of im by the back o the neck shook im till e was tired  then he let go of im and holding his fist under is nose told im to hand over the money and look sharp about it  yeyeyes sir ses the lodger who was arf choked  sam held out his and and the lodger arter saying it was only a little bit o fun on is part and telling im wot a fancy he ad taken to im from the fust put gingers watch and chain into his ands and eighteen pounds four shillings and sevenpence  sam put it into his pocket and arter going through the lodgers pockets to make sure he adnt forgot anything opened the door and flung im into the street  he stopped on the landing to put the money in a belt he was wearing under is clothes and then e went back on tiptoe to is corner and went to sleep with one eye open and the appiest smile that had been on his face for years  he shut both eyes when he eard ginger wake up and he slept like a child through the orrible noise that peter and ginger see fit to make when they started to put their clothes on  he got tired of it afore they did and arter opening is eyes slowly and yawning he asked ginger wot he meant by it  youll wake your lodger up if you aint careful making that noise he ses  wots the matter  sam ses ginger in a very different voice to wot he ad used the night before sam old pal hes taken all our money and bolted  wot ses sam sitting up on the floor and blinking nonsense  robbed me and peter ses ginger in a trembling voice taken every penny weve got and my watch and chain  youre dreaming ses sam  i wish i was ses ginger  but surely ginger ses sam standing up surely you didnt take a lodger without a character  he seemed such a nice chap ses peter  we was only saying wot a much nicer chap he was thanthan  go on peter ses sam very perlite  than he might ha been ses ginger very quick  well ive ad a wonderful escape ses sam  if it hadnt ha been for sleeping in my clothes i suppose hed ha ad my money as well  he felt in is pockets anxiouslike then he smiled and stood there letting is money fall through is fingers into his pocket over and over agin  pore chap he ses pore chap praps hed got a starving wife and family  who knows  it aint for us to judge im ginger  he stood a little while longer chinking is money and when he took off his coat to wash ginger dick poured the water out for im and peter russet picked up the soap which ad fallen on the floor  then they started pitying themselves looking very ard at the back of old sam while they did it  i spose weve got to starve peter ses ginger in a sad voice  looks like it ses peter dressing hisself very slowly  theres nobodyll mourn for me thats one comfort ses ginger  or me ses peter  praps samll miss us a bit ses ginger grinding is teeth as old sam went on washing as if he was deaf  hess the only real pal we ever ad  wot

cheaspeake agin sam ses ginger very mild  she wont be ready for sea for pretty near three weeks ses sam  you know that  praps sam would lend us a trifle to go on with ginger ses peter russet  just

where they was in the abit of going and ad just started on a plate of eggs and bacon when ginger dick and peter came into the place with a pocketankercher of is wot they ad found in the fender  we thought you might want it sam ses peter  so we brought it along ses ginger  i ope youre enjoying of your brekfuss sam  sam took the ankercher and thanked em very perlite and arter standing there for a minute or two as if they wanted to say something they couldnt remember they sheered off  when sam left the place arfanhour afterwards they was still hanging about and as sam passed ginger asked im if he was going for a walk  walk ses sam  certnly not  im going to bed i didnt ave a good nights rest like you and your lodger  he went back ome and arter taking off is coat and boots got into bed and slept like a top till one oclock when he woke up to find ginger shaking im by the shoulders  wots the matter he ses  wot are you up to  its dinnertime ses ginger  i thought praps youd like to know in case you missed it  you leave me alone ses sam cuddling into the clothes agin  i dont want no dinner  you go and look arter your own dinners  he stayed in bed for another arfhour listening to peter and ginger telling each other in loud whispers ow hungry they was and then he got up and put is things on and went to the door  im going to get a bit o dinner he ses  and mind ive got my pocket ankercher  he went out and ad a steak and onions and a pint o beer but although he kept looking up sudden from is plate he didnt see peter or ginger it spoilt is dinner a bit but arter he got outside e saw them standing at the corner and pretending not to see them he went off for a walk down the mile end road  illustration we thought you might want it sam ses peter  he walked as far as bow with them folleringim and then he jumped on a bus and rode back as far as whitechapel  there was no sign of em when he got off and feeling a bit lonesome he stood about looking in shopwindows until e see them coming along as hard as they could come  why halloa he ses  where did you spring from  weweweve beenfor a bit of a walk ses ginger dick puffing and blowing like a grampus  tokeep down the unger ses peter russet  old sam looked at em very stern for a moment then he beckoned em to foller im and stopping at a little publicouse he went in and ordered a pint o bitter  and give them two pore fellers a crust o bread and cheese and arfapint of four ale each he ses to the barmaid  ginger and peter looked at each other but they was so hungry they didnt say a word they just stood waiting  put that inside you my pore fellers ses sam with a oily smile  i cant bear to see people suffering for want o food he ses to the barmaid as he chucked down a sovereign on the counter  the barmaid a very nice gal with black air and her fingers covered all over with rings said that it did im credit and they stood there talking about tramps and beggars and suchlike till peter and ginger nearly choked  he stood there watching em and smoking a threepenny cigar and when they ad finished he told the barmaid to give em a sausageroll each and went off  peter and ginger snatched up their sausagerolls and follered im and at last ginger swallowed his pride and walked up to im and asked im to lend them some money  youll get it back agin he ses  you know that well enough  certnly not ses sam and im surprised at you asking  why a child could rob you  its ard enough as it is for a pore man like me to ave to keep a couple o hulking sailormen but im not going to give you money to chuck away on lodgers  no more sleeping on the floor for me now i dont want none o your langwidge and i dont want you follering me like a couple o cats arter a meatbarrer  i shall be aving a cup o tea at browns coffeeshop by and by and if youre there at five sharp ill see wot i can do for you  wot did you call me  ginger told im three times and then peter russet dragged im away they turned up outside browns at a quarter to five and at ten past six sam small strolled up smoking a cigar and arter telling them that he ad forgot all about em took em inside and paid for their teas  he told mr brown e was paying for em and e told the gal wot served em e was paying for em and it was all pore ginger could do to stop imself from throwing his plate in is face  sam went off by imself and arter walking about all the evening without a hapenny in their pockets ginger dick and peter went off ome to bed and went to sleep till twelve oclock when sam came in and woke em up to tell em about a musicall he ad been to and ow many pints he had ad  he sat up in bed till past one oclock talking about imself and twice peter russet woke ginger up to listen and got punched for is trouble  they both said theyd get a ship next morning and then old sam turned round and wouldnt ear of it  the airs he gave imself was awful  he said hed tell em when they was to get a ship and if they went and did things without asking im hed let em starve  he kept em with im all that day for fear of losing em and having to give em their money when e met em agin instead of spending it on em and getting praised for it  they ad their dinner with im at browns and nothing they could do pleased him  he spoke to peter russet out loud about making a noise while he was eating and directly arterwards he told ginger to use his pocket ankercher  pore ginger sat there looking at im and swelling and swelling until he nearly bust and sam told im if he couldnt keep is temper when people was trying to do im a kindness hed better go and get somebody else to keep him  he took em to a musicall that night but he spoilt it all for em by taking em into the little publicouse in whitechapel road fust and standing em a drink  he told the barmaid e was keeping em till they could find a job and arter she ad told him he was too softarted and would only be took advantage of she brought another barmaid up to look at em and ask em wot they could do and why they didnt do it  sam served em like that for over a week and he ad so much praise from mr brown and other people that it nearly turned his ead  for once in his life he ad it pretty near all is own way  twice ginger dick slipped off and tried to get a ship and came back sulky and hungry and once peter russet sprained his thumb trying to get a job at the docks  they gave it up then and kept to sam like a couple o shadders only giving im backanswers when they felt as if something ud give way inside if they didnt  for the fust time in their lives they began to count the days till their boat was ready for sea  then something happened  they was all coming ome late one night along the minories when ginger dick gave a shout and suddenly bolting up a little street arter a man that ad turned up there fust of all sent im flying with a heavy punch of is fist and then knelt on im  now then ginger ses sam bustling up with peter russet wots all this  wot yer doing  its the thief

putting his arm round peters waist danced a waltz round the room with im while pore old sam got on to his bed to be out of the way they danced for nearly arfanhour and then they undressed and sat on

dont like you she can keep single till she does  mr albert sharp thanked him  come in more oftener said mr culpepper  if she dont know a steady young man when she sees him its her mistake  nobody could be steadier than what i am sighed mr sharp  mr culpepper nodded  the worst of it is girls dont like steady young men he said rumpling his thin grey hair thats the silly part of it  but you was always steady and mrs culpepper married you said the young man  mr culpepper nodded again  she thought i was and that came to the same thing he said composedly  and it aint for me to say but she had an idea that i was very goodlooking in them days  i had chestnutty hair  she burnt a piece of it only the other day shed kept for thirty years  illustration a very faint squeeze in return decided him  burnt it  what for  inquired mr sharp  words said the other lowering his voice  when i want one thing nowadays she generally wants another and the things she wants aint the things i want  mr sharp shook his head and sighed again  you aint talkative enough for florrie you know said mr culpepper regarding him  i can talk all right as a rule retorted mr sharp  you ought to hear me at the debating society but you cant talk to a girl who doesnt talk back  youre far too humble continued the other  you should cheek her a bit now and then  let er see youve got some spirit  chaff er  thats no good said the young man restlessly  ive tried it  only the other day i called her a saucy little kipper and the way she went on anybody would have thought id insulted her  cant see a joke i spose  where is she now  upstairs was the reply  thats because im here said mr sharp  if it had been jack butler shed have been down fast enough  it couldnt be him said mr culpepper because i wont have im in the house  ive told him so ive told her so and ive told er aunt so  and if she marries without my leave afore shes thirty she loses the seven hundred pounds er father left her  youve got plenty of timeten years  mr sharp sitting with his hands between his knees gazed despondently at the floor  theres a lot o girls would jump at me he remarked ive only got to hold up my little finger and theyd jump  thats because theyve got sense said mr culpepper  theyve got the sense to prefer steadiness and humdrumness to good looks and dash  a young fellow like you earning thirtytwoandsix a week can do without good looks and if ive told florrie so once i have told her fifty times  looks are a matter of taste said mr sharp morosely  some of them girls i was speaking about just now  yes yes said mr culpepper hastily  now look here you go on a different tack  take a glass of ale like a man or a couple o glasses smoke a cigarette or a pipe  be like other young men  cut a dash and dont be a nambypamby  after youre married you can be as miserable as you like  mr sharp after a somewhat lengthy interval thanked him  its my birthday next wednesday continued mr culpepper regarding him benevolently come round about seven and ill ask you to stay to supper  thatll give you a chance  anybodys allowed to step a bit over the mark on birthdays and you might take a glass or two and make a speech and be so happy and bright that theyd ardly know you  if you want an excuse for calling you could bring me a box of cigars for my birthday  or come in to wish you many happy returns of the day said the thrifty mr sharp  and dont forget to get above yourself said mr culpepper regarding him sternly in a gentlemanly way of course  have as many glasses as you liketheres no stint about me  if it ever comes off said mr sharp risingif i get her through you you shant have reason to repent it  ill look after that  mr culpepper whose feelings were a trifle ruffled said that he would look after it too  he had a faint idea that even from his own point of view he might have made a better selection for his nieces hand  mr sharp smoked his first cigarette the following morning and encouraged by the entire absence of any aftereffects purchased a pipe which was taken up by a policeman the same evening for obstructing the public footpath in company with a metal tobaccobox three parts full  in the matter of ale he found less difficulty  certainly the taste was unpleasant but treated as medicine and gulped down quickly it was endurable  after a day or two he even began to be critical and on monday evening went so far as to complain of its flatness to the wideeyed landlord of the royal george  too much cellarwork he said as he finished his glass and made for the door  too much  ere come ere said the landlord thickly  i want to speak to you  the expert shook his head and passing out into the street changed colour as he saw miss garland approaching  in a blundering fashion he clutched at his hat and stammered out a good evening  miss garland returned the greeting and instead of passing on stopped and with a friendly smile held out her hand  mr sharp shook it convulsively  you are just the man i want to see she exclaimed  aunt and i have been talking about you all the afternoon  mr sharp said really  but i dont want uncle to see us pursued miss garland in the low tones of confidence  which way shall we go  mr sharps brain reeled  all ways were alike to him in such company he walked beside her like a man in a dream  we want to give him a lesson said the girl presently  a lesson that he will remember  him  said the young man  uncle explained the girl  its a shocking thing a wicked thing to try and upset a steady young man like you  aunt is quite put out about it and i feel the same as she does  but gasped the astonished mr sharp how did you  aunt heard him said miss garland  she was just going into the room when she caught a word or two and she stayed outside and listened  you dont know what a lot she thinks of you  mr sharps eyes opened wider than ever  i thought she didnt like me he said slowly  good gracious  said miss garland  whatever could have put such an idea as that into your head  of course aunt isnt always going to let uncle see that she agrees with him  still as if anybody could help she murmured to herself  eh  said the young man in a trembling voice  nothing  miss garland walked along with averted face mr sharp his pulses bounding trod on air beside her  i thought he said at last i thought that jack butler was a favourite of hers  jack butler  said the girl in tones of scornful surprise  the idea how blind men are youre all alike i think  you cant see two inches in front of you  shes as pleased as possible that you are coming on wednesday and so am  mr sharp caught his breath  yes  he murmured  lets go down here said miss garland quickly down by the river  and ill tell you what we want you to do  she placed her hand lightly on his arm and mr sharp with a tremulous smile obeyed  the smile faded gradually as he listened and an expression of anxious astonishment took its place  he shook his head as she proceeded and twice ventured a faint suggestion that she was only speaking in jest  convinced at last against his will he walked on in silent consternation  but he said at last as miss garland paused for breath your uncle would never forgive me  hed never let me come near the house again  aunt will see to that said the girl confidently  but of course if you dont wish to please me  she turned away and mr sharp plucking up spirit ventured to take her hand and squeeze it  a faint a very faint squeeze in return decided him  it will come all right afterwards said miss garland especially with the hold it will give aunt over him  i hope so said the young man  if not i shall be farfarther off than ever  miss garland blushed and turning her head gazed steadily at the river  trust me she said at last  me and auntie  mr sharp said that so long as he pleased her nothing else mattered and in the seventh heaven of delight paced slowly along the towpath by her side  and you mustnt mind what auntie and i say to you said the girl continuing her instructions  we must keep up appearances you know and if we seem to be angry you must remember we are only pretending  mr sharp with a tender smile said that he understood perfectly  and now i had better go said florrie returning the smile  uncle might see us together or somebody else might see us and tell him goodbye  she shook hands and went off stopping three times to turn and wave her hand  in a state of bewildered delight mr sharp continued his stroll rehearsing as he went the somewhat complicated and voluminous instructions she had given him  by wednesday evening he was partperfect and in a state of mind divided between nervousness and exaltation set out for mr culpeppers  he found that gentleman dressed in his best sitting in an easychair with his hands folded over a fancy waistcoat of startling design and placing a small box of small cigars on his knees wished him the usual happy returns  the entrance of the ladies who seemed as though they had just come off the ice interrupted mr culpeppers thanks  getting spoiled thats what i am he remarked playfully  see this waistcoat  my old aunt elizabeth sent it this morning  he leaned back in his chair and glanced down in warm approval  the missis gave me a pipe and florrie gave me half a pound of tobacco  and i bought a bottle of port wine myself for all of us  he pointed to a bottle that stood on the suppertable and the ladies retiring to the kitchen to bring in the supper rose and placed chairs a piece of roast beef was placed before him and motioning mr sharp to a seat opposite florrie he began to carve  just a nice comfortable party he said genially as he finished help yourself to the ale bert  mr sharp ignoring the surprise on the faces of the ladies complied and passed the bottle to mr culpepper  they drank to each other and again a flicker of surprise appeared on the faces of mrs culpepper and her niece  mr culpepper noticing it shook his head waggishly at mr sharp  he drinks it as if he likes it he remarked  i do asserted mr sharp and raising his glass emptied it and resumed the attack on his plate  mr culpepper unscrewed the top of another bottle and the reckless mr sharp after helping himself made a short and feeling speech in which he wished mr culpepper long life and happiness  if you aint happy with mrs culpepper he concluded gallantly you ought to be  mr culpepper nodded and went on eating in silence until the keen edge of his appetite having been taken off he put down his knife and fork and waxed sentimental  been married over thirty years he said slowly with a glance at his wife and never regretted it  who hasnt  inquired mr sharp  why me returned the surprised mr culpepper  mr sharp who had just raised his glass put it down again and smiled it was a faint smile but it seemed to affect his host unfavourably  what are you smiling at  he demanded  thoughts said mr sharp exchanging a covert glance with florrie something you told me the other day  mr culpepper looked bewildered  ill give you a penny for them thoughts he said with an air of jocosity  mr sharp shook his head  money couldnt buy em he said with owlish solemnity especespecially after the good supper youre giving me  bert said mr culpepper uneasily as his wife sat somewhat erect bert its my birthday and i dont grudge nothing to nobody but go easy with the beer  you aint used to it you know  whats the matter with the beer  inquired mr sharp  it tastes all rightwhat there is of it  it aint the beer its you explained mr culpepper  mr sharp stared at him  have i said anything i oughtnt to  he inquired  mr culpepper shook his head and taking up a fork and spoon began to serve a plumpudding that miss garland had just placed on the table  what was it you said i was to be sure and not tell mrs culpepper inquired mr sharp dreamily  i havent said that have i  no  snapped the harassed mr culpepper laying down the fork and spoon and regarding him ferociously  i mean there wasnt anything  i mean i didnt say so  youre raving  if i did say it im sorry persisted mr sharp  i cant say fairer than that can i  youre all right said mr culpepper trying but in vain to exchange a waggish glance with his wife  i didnt say it  inquired mr sharp  no said mr culpepper still smiling in a wooden fashion  i mean the other thing  said mr sharp in a thrilling whisper  look here exclaimed the overwrought mr culpepper why not eat your pudding and leave off talking nonsense  nobodys listening to you  speak for yourself said his wife tartly  i like to hear mr sharp talk  what was it he told you not to tell me  mr sharp eyed her mistily  ii cant tell you he said slowly  why not  asked mrs culpepper coaxingly  because itit would make your hair stand on end said the industrious mr sharp  nonsense said mrs culpepper sharply  he said it would said mr sharp indicating his host with his spoon and he oughtto know whos that kicking me under the table  mr culpepper shivering with wrath and dread struggled for speech youd better get home bert he said at last  youre not yourself theres nobody kicking you under the table  you dont know what you are saying  youve been dreaming things  i never said anything of the kind  memorys gone said mr sharp shaking his head at him  clean gone dont you remember  no  roared mr culpepper  mr sharp sat blinking at him but his misgivings vanished before the glances of admiring devotion which miss garland was sending in his direction  he construed them rightly not only as a reward but as an incentive to further efforts  in the midst of an impressive silence mrs culpepper collected the plates and producing a dish of fruit from the sideboard placed it upon the table  help yourself mr sharp she said pushing the bottle of port towards him  mr sharp complied having first after several refusals put a little into the ladies glasses and a lot on the tablecloth near mr culpepper then after a satisfying sip or two he rose with a bland smile and announced his intention of making a speech  but youve made one said his host in tones of fierce expostulation  thatthat was las night said mr sharp  this is tonightyour birthday  well we dont want any more said mr culpepper  mr sharp hesitated  its only his fun he said looking round and raising his glass  hes afraid im going to praise him uppraise him up  heres to my old friend mr culpepper one of the best  we all have ourfaults and he has hishas his  where was i  sit down growled mr culpepper  talking about my husbands faults said his wife  so i was said mr sharp putting his hand to his brow  dont be alarm he continued turning to his host nothing to be alarm about im not going to talk about em  not so silly as that i hope  i dont want spoil your life  sit down repeated mr culpepper  youre very anxious he should sit down said his wife sharply  no im not said mr culpepper only hes talking nonsense  mr sharp still on his legs took another sip of port and avoiding the eye of mr culpepper which was showing signs of incipient inflammation looked for encouragement to miss garland  hes a man we all look up to and respect he continued  if he does go off to london every now and then on business thats his lookout  my idea is he always ought to take mrs culpepper with him  hed have pleasure of her company and same time hed be money in pocket by it  and why shouldnt she go to musichalls sometimes  why shouldnt she  you get off home said the purple mr culpepper rising and hammering the table with his fist  get off home and if you so much as show your face inside this ouse again therell be trouble  go on  out you go  home  repeated mr sharp sitting down suddenly  wont go home till morning  oh well soon see about that said mr culpepper taking him by the shoulders  come on now  mr sharp subsided lumpishly into his chair and mr culpepper despite his utmost efforts failed to move him  the two ladies exchanged a glance and then with their heads in the air sailed out of the room the younger pausing at the door to bestow a mirthful glance upon mr sharp ere she disappeared  comeout said mr culpepper panting  you trying to tickle me  inquired mr sharp  you get off home said the other  youve been doing nothing but make mischief ever since you came in  what put such things into your silly head i dont know  i shall never hear the end of em as long as i live  silly head  repeated mr sharp with an alarming change of manner say it again  mr culpepper repeated it with gusto  very good said mr sharp  he seized him suddenly and pushing him backwards into his easychair stood over him with such hideous contortions of visage that mr culpepper was horrified  now you sit there and keep quite still he said with smouldering ferocity  where did you put carvingknife  eh  wheres carvingknife  no no bert said mr culpepper clutching at his sleeve  ii was only joking  youyou aint quite yourself bert  what  demanded the other rolling his eyes and clenching his fists  ii mean youve improved said mr culpepper hurriedly  wonderful you have  mr sharps countenance cleared a little  lets make a night of it he said  dont move whatever you do  illustration he felt the large and clumsy hand of mr butler take him by the collar  he closed the door and putting the wine and a couple of glasses on the mantelpiece took a chair by mr culpepper and prepared to spend the evening  his instructions were too specific to be disregarded and three times he placed his arm about the waist of the frenzied mr culpepper and took him for a lumbering dance up and down the room  in the intervals between dances he regaled him with interminable extracts from speeches made at the debating society and recitations learned at school suggestions relating to bed thrown out by mr culpepper from time to time were repelled with scorn  and twice in deference to mr sharps desires he had to join in the chorus of a song  ten oclock passed and the hands of the clock crawled round to eleven the hour struck and as though in answer the door opened and the agreeable face of florrie garland appeared  behind her to the intense surprise of both gentlemen loomed the stalwart figure of mr jack butler  i thought he might be useful uncle said miss garland coming into the room  auntie wouldnt let me come down before  mr sharp rose in a dazed fashion and saw mr culpepper grasp mr butler by the hand  more dazed still he felt the large and clumsy hand of mr butler take him by the collar and propel him with some violence along the small passage while another hand which he dimly recognized as belonging to mr culpepper was inserted in the small of his back  then the front door opened and he was thrust out into the night  the door closed and a low feminine laugh sounded from a window above     illustration i tell you i am as innercent as a newborn babe    skilled assistance  the nightwatchman who had left his seat on the jetty to answer the gatebell came back with disgust written on a countenance only too well designed to express it  if shes been up ere once in the last week to know whether the silvia is up shes been four or five times he growled  hes fortyseven if hes a day is left leg is shorter than is right and he talks with a stutter  when shes with im youd think as butter wouldnt melt in er mouth but the way she talked to me just now youd think i was paid apurpose to wait on her  i asked er at last wot she thought i was here for and she said she didnt know and nobody else neither  and afore she went off she told the potman from the albion wot was listening that i was known all over wapping as the sleeping beauty  she aint the fust ive ad words with not by a lot  theyre all the same they all start in a nice kind soapy sort o way and as soon as they dont get wot they want fly into a temper and ask me who i think i am  i told one woman once not to be silly and i shall never forget it as long as i livenever  for all i know shes wearing a bit o my air in a locket to this day and very likely boasting that i gave it to her  talking of her reminds me of another woman  there was a capn pinner used to trade between ere and hull on a schooner named the snipe  nice little craft she was and e was a very nice feller  many and manys the pint weve ad together turn and turnabout and the ony time we ever ad a cross word was when somebody hid his clay pipe in my beer and e was foolish enough to think id done it  he ad a nice little cottage e told me about near hull and is wifes father a man of pretty near seventy lived with em  welloff the old man was and as she was his only daughter they looked to ave all his money when hed gorn  their only fear was that e might marry agin and judging from wot e used to tell me about the old man i thought it more than likely  if it wasnt for my missis hed ha been married over and over agin he ses one day  hes like a child playing with gunpowder  ow would it be to let im burn hisself a bit i ses  if you was to see some o the gunpowder he wants to play with you wouldnt talk like that ses the capn  youd know better  the ony thing is to keep em apart and my pore missis is wore to a shadder adoing of it  it was just about a month arter that that he brought the old man up to london with im  they ad some stuff to put out at smiths wharf tother side of the river afore they came to us and though they was ony there four or five days it was long enough for that old man to get into trouble  the skipper told me about it ten minutes arter they was made snug in the inner berth ere  he walked up and down like a man with a raging toothache and arter follering im up and down the wharf till i was tired out i discovered that is fatherinlaw ad got imself mixed up with a widderwoman ninety years old and weighing twenty stun  arter he ad cooled down a bit and i ad given im a few little pats on the shoulder e made it fortyeight years old and fourteen stun  hes getting ready to go and meet her now he ses and wot my missisll say to me i dont know  his fatherinlaw came up on deck as e spoke and began to brush imself all over with a clothesbrush  nicelooking little man e was with blue eyes and a little white beard cut to a point and dressed up in a serge suit with brass buttons and a white yachting cap  his real name was mr finch but the skipper called im uncle dick and he took such a fancy to me that in five minutes i was calling im uncle dick too  time i was moving he ses by and by  ive got an appintment  oh who with ses the skipper pretending not to know  friend o mine in the army ses the old man with a wink at me  so long  he went off as spry as a boy and as soon as hed gorn the skipper started walking backards and forards agin and raving  lets ope as hes ony amusing imself i ses  wait till you see er ses the skipper then you wont talk foolishness  as it appened she came back with uncle dick that evening to see im safe and i see at once wot sort of a woman it was  she adnt been on the wharf five minutes afore youd ha thought it belonged to er and when she went and sat on the schooner it seemed to be about arf its size  she called the skipper tom and sat there as cool as you please holding uncle dicks and and patting it  i took the skipper round to the bulls head arter she ad gorn and i wouldnt let im say a word until he had ad two pints  he felt better then and some o the words e used surprised me  wots to be done he ses at last  you see ow it is bill  cant you get im away i ses  who is she and wots er name  her name ses the skipper her name is jane maria elizabeth muffit and she lives over at rotherhithe  shes very likely married already i ses  her usband died ten years ago ses the skipper passed away in is sleep  overlaid i should say  he sat there smoking and i sat there thinking  twice e spoke to me and i held my and up and said hsh then i turned to im all of a sudden and pinched his arm so hard he nearly dropped is beer  is uncle dick a nervous man i ses  nervous is no name for it he ses staring  very good then i ses  ill send er husband to frighten im  the skipper looked at me very strange  yes he ses  yes  yes  frighten im out of is boots and make him give er up i ses  or better still get im to run away and go into hiding for a time  that ud be best in case e found out  found out wot ses the skipper  found out it wasnt er husband i ses  bill ses the skipper very earnest this is the fust beer ive ad today and i wish i could say the same for you  i didnt take im at fast but when i did i gave a laugh that brought in two more customers to see wot was the matter  then i took im by the armarter a little troubleand taking im back to the wharf explained my meaning to im  i know the very man i ses  he comes into a publicouse down my way sometimes  artful arry hes called and for arfaquid say hed frighten uncle dick arf to death  hes big and ugly and picks up a living by selling meerschaum pipes hes found to small men wot dont want em  wonderful gift o the gab hes got  we went acrost to the albion to talk it over  theres several bars there and the landlady always keeps cottonwool in er ears not aving been brought up to the public line  the skipper told me all e knew about mrs muffit and we arranged that artful arry should come down at seven oclock next night if so be as i could find im in time  i got up early the next arternoon and as it appened he came into the duke of edinburgh five minutes arter i got there  nasty temper e was in too  hed just found a meerschaum pipe as usual and the very fust man e tried to sell it to said that it was the one e lost last christmas and gave im a punch in the jaw for it  hes a thief thats wot he is ses arry and i ate thiefs  ows a honest tradesman to make a living when theres people like that about  i stood im arf a pint and though it hurt im awful to drink it he said ed ave another just to see if he could bear the pain  arter he had ad three e began for to take a more cheerful view o life and told me about a chap that spent three weeks in the london orsepittle for calling im a liar  treat me fair he ses and ill treat other people fair  i never broke my word without a good reason for it and thats more than everybody can say  if i told you the praise ive ad from some people you wouldnt believe it  i let im go on till he ad talked imself into a good temper and then i told im of the little job i ad got for im  he listened quiet till i ad finished and then he shook is ead  it aint in my line he ses  theres arf a quid anging to it i ses  arry shook his ead agin  taint enough mate he ses  if you was to make it a quid i wont say as i mightnt think of it  i ad told the skipper that it might cost im a quid so i knew ow far i could go and at last arter arry ad got as far as the door three times i gave way  and ill ave it now he ses to prevent mistakes  no arry i ses very firm  besides it aint my money you see  you mean to say you dont trust me e ses firing up  id trust you with untold gold i ses but not with a real quid youre too fond of a joke arry  we ad another long argyment about it and i had to tell im plain at last that when i wanted to smell is fist id say so  you turn up at the wharf at five minutes to seven i ses and ill give you ten bob of it arter youve done your business ill give you the other  come along quiet and youll see me waiting at the gate for you  he gave way arter a time and fust going ome for a cup o tea i went on to the wharf to tell the skipper ow things stood  it couldnt ave appened better he ses  uncle dick is sure to be aboard at that time cos es going acrost the water at eight oclock to pay er a visit  and all the handsll be away  ive made sure of that  he gave me the money for artful arry in two arfsuverins and then we went over to the albion for a quiet glass and a pipe and to wait for seven oclock  i left im there at ten minutes to and at five minutes to punctual to the minute i see arry coming along swinging a thick stick with a knob on the end of it  wheres the arf thickun he ses looking round to see that the coast was clear  i gave it to im and arter biting it in three places and saying it was a bit short in weight he dropped it in is weskitpocket and said e was ready  i left im there for a minute while i went and ad a look round  the deck of the snipe was empty but i could ear uncle dick down in the cabin singing and arter listening for a few seconds to make sure that it was singing i went back and beckoned to arry  hes down in the cabin i ses pointing  dont overdo it arry and at the same time dont underdo it as you might say  i know just wot you want ses arry and if youd got the art of a man in you youd make it two quids  he climbed on board and stood listening for a moment at the companion and then e went down while i went off outside the gate so as to be out of earshot in case uncle dick called for me  i knew that i should ear all about wot went on arterwardsand i did  artful arry went down the companionladder very quiet and then stood at the foot of it looking at uncle dick  he looked im up and down and all over and then e gave a fierce loud cough  goodevening he ses  goodevening ses uncle dick staring at im  did you want to see anybody  i did ses arry  i do  and when i see im im going to put my arms round im and twist is neck then im going to break every bone in is body and arter that im going to shy im overboard to pison the fishes with  dear me ses uncle dick shifting away as far as e could  i aint ad a wink o sleep for two

pass away and then i see the wicket in the gate open and the skipper come through  he jumped on deck without a word and then going over to the skylight anded down the money to arry  righto ses arry

uncle dick  thats the man  mrs muffit walked up to im and my art amost stopped beating  her face was the colour of beetroot with temper and you could ave heard her breath fifty yards away  ho she says

turned on me like a wild cat with her ands in front of her  ive been scratched once in my life and i wasnt going to be agin so fixing my eyes on er i just stepped back a bit ready for er  so long as i kept my eye fixed on ers she couldnt do anything  i knew that unfortunately i stepped back just a inch too far and next moment i went over backards in twelve foot of water  arter all praps it was the best thing that could have appened to me it stopped her talking  it aint the fust time ive ad a wet jacket but as for the skipper and pore uncle dickwot married hertheyve been in hot water ever since         for better or worse   mr george wotton gently pushing the swing doors of the public bar of the kings head an inch apart applied an eye to the aperture in the hope of discovering a moneyed friend  his gaze fell on the only man in the bar a greybeard of sixty whose weatherbeaten face and rough clothing spoke of the sea  with a faint sigh he widened the opening and passed through  mornin ben he said with an attempt at cheerfulness  have a drop with me said the other heartily  got any money about you  mr wotton shook his head and his face fell clearing somewhat as the other handed him his mug  drink it all up george he said  his friend complied  a more tactful man might have taken longer over the job but mr benjamin davis who appeared to be labouring under some strong excitement took no notice  ive had a shock george he said regarding the other steadily  ive heard news of my old woman  didnt know you ad one said mr wotton calmly  wots she done  she left me said mr davis solemnlyshe left me thirtyfive years ago  i went off to sea one fine morning and that was the last i ever see of er  why did she bolt  inquired mr wotton with mild interest  no said his friend but i did  wed been married three yearsthree long yearsand i had ad enough of it  awful temper she had  the last words i ever heard er say was take that  mr wotton took up the mug and after satisfying himself as to the absence of contents put it down again and yawned  i shouldnt worry about it if i was you he remarked  shes hardly likely to find you now  and if she does she wont get much  mr davis gave vent to a contemptuous laugh  get much  he repeated its her whats got it  i met a old shipmate of mine this morning what i adnt seen for ten years and he told me he run acrost er only a month ago  after she left me  but you said you left her  exclaimed his listening friend  same thing said mr davis impatiently  after she left me to work myself to death at sea running here and there at the orders of a pack olazy scuts aft she went into service and stayed in one place for fifteen years  then er missis died and left her all er money  for twenty years while ive been working myself to skin and bone shes been living in comfort and idleness  ard lines said mr wotton shaking his head  it dont bear thinking of  why didnt she advertise for me  said mr davis raising his voice thats what i want to know  advertisements is cheap enough why didnt she advertise  i should ave come at once if shed said anything about money  mr wotton shook his head again  praps she didnt want you he said slowly  whats that got to do with it  demanded the other  it was er dooty shed got money and i ought to have ad my arf of it  nothing can make up for that wasted twenty yearsnothing  praps shell take you back said mr wotton  take me back  repeated mr davis  o course shell take me back shell have to  theres a law in the land aint there  what im thinking of is can i get back my share what i ought to have ad for the last twenty years  get er to take you back first counselled his friend  thirtyfive years is along time and praps she has lost er love for you  was you goodlooking in those days  yes snapped mr davis i aint altered much  sides what about her  that aint the question said the other  shes got a home and money it dont matter about looks and wots more she aint bound to keep you  if you take my advice you wont dream of letting her know you run away from her  say you was cast away at sea and when you came back years afterwards you couldnt find her  mr davis pondered for some time in sulky silence  praps it would be as well he said at last but i shant stand no nonsense mind  if you like ill come with you said mr wotton  i aint got nothing to do  i could tell er i was cast away with you if you liked  anything to help a pal  mr davis took two inches of soiled clay pipe from his pocket and puffed thoughtfully  you can come he said at last  if youd only got a copper or two we could ride its down clapham way  mr wotton smiled feebly and after going carefully through his pockets shook his head and followed his friend outside  i wonder whether shell be pleased  he remarked as they walked slowly along  she might bewomen are funny creaturesso faithful  i knew one whose husband used to knock er about dreadful and after he died she was so true to his memory she wouldnt marry again  mr davis grunted and with a longing eye at the omnibuses passing over london bridge asked a policeman the distance to clapham  never mind said mr wotton as his friend uttered an exclamation youll have money in your pocket soon  mr daviss face brightened  and a watch and chain too he said  and smoke your cigar of a sunday said mr wotton and have a easychair and a glass for a friend  mr davis almost smiled and then suddenly remembering his wasted twenty years shook his head grimly over the friendship that attached itself to easychairs and glasses of ale and said that there was plenty of it about  more friendship than glasses of ale and easychairs perhaps  at clapham they inquired the way of a small boy and after following the road indicated retraced their steps cheered by a faint but bloodthirsty hope of meeting him again  a friendly baker put them on the right track at last both gentlemen eyeing the road with a mixture of concern and delight  it was a road of trim semidetached villas each with a wellkept front garden and neatlycurtained windows  at the gate of a house with the word blairgowrie inscribed in huge gilt letters on the fanlight mr davis paused for a moment uneasily and then walking up the path followed by mr wotton knocked at the door  he retired a step in disorder before the apparition of a maid in cap and apron  a sharp not today  sounded in his ears and the door closed again  he faced his friend gasping  i should give her the sack first thing said mr wotton  mr davis knocked again and again  the maid reappeared and after surveying them through the glass opened the door a little way and parleyed  i want to see your missis said mr davis fiercely  what for  demanded the girl  you tell er said mr davis inserting his foot just in time you tell er that theres two gentlemen here what have brought er news of her husband and look sharp about it  they was cast away with im said mr wotton  on a desert island said mr davis  he pushed his way in followed by his friend and a head that had been leaning over the banisters was suddenly withdrawn  for a moment he stood irresolute in the tiny passage and then with a husbands boldness he entered the front room and threw himself into an easychair  mr wotton after a scared glance around the wellfurnished room seated himself on the extreme edge of the most uncomfortable chair he could find and coughed nervously  illustration you tell er that theres two gentlemen here what have brought er news of her husband  better not be too sudden with her he whispered  you dont want her to faint or anything of that sort  dont let er know who you are at first let her find it out for herself  mr davis who was also suffering from the stiff grandeur of his surroundings nodded  praps youd better start in case she reckernizes my voice he said slowly  pitch it in strong about me and ow i was always wondering what had appened to her  youre in luck thats wot you are said his friend enviously  ive only seen furniture like thiss in shop windows before  hsh  here she comes  he started and both men tried to look at their ease as a stiff rustling sounded from the stairs  then the door opened and a tall stoutlybuilt old lady with white hair swept into the room and stood regarding them  mr davis unprepared for the changes wrought by thirtyfive years stared at her aghast  the black silk dress the gold watchchain and huge cameo brooch did not help to reassure him  goodgood afternoon maam said mr wotton in a thin voice  the old lady returned the greeting and crossing to a chair and seating herself in a very upright fashion regarded him calmly  wewe called to see you about a dear old palfriend i mean continued mr wotton one o the best  the best  yes  said the old lady  hes been missing said mr wotton watching closely for any symptoms of fainting for thirtyfive years  thirtyfive years agovery much against his wishhe left is young and handsome wife to go for a sea vyge and was shipwrecked and cast away on a desert island  yes  said the old lady again  i was cast away with im said mr wotton  both of us was cast away with him  he indicated mr davis with his hand and the old lady after a glance at that gentleman turned to mr wotton again  we was on that island for longer than i like to think of continued mr wotton who had a wholesome dread of dates  but we was rescued at last and ever since then he has been hunting high and low for his wife  its very interesting murmured the old lady but what has it got to do with me  mr wotton gasped and cast a helpless glance at his friend  you aint heard his name yet he said impressively  wot would you say if i said it wasben davis  i should say it wasnt true said the old lady promptly  nottrue  said mr wotton catching his breath painfully  wish i may die  about the desert island continued the old lady calmly  the story that i heard was that he went off like a cur and left his young wife to do the best she could for herself  i suppose hes heard since that she has come in for a bit of money  money repeated mr wotton in a voice that he fondly hoped expressed artless surprise  money  money said the old lady and i suppose he sent you two gentlemen round to see how the land lay  she was looking full at mr davis as she spoke and both men began to take a somewhat sombre view of the situation  you didnt know him else you wouldnt talk like that said mr wotton i dont suppose youd know im if you was to see him now  i dont suppose i should said the other  praps youd reckernize his voice  said mr davis breaking silence at last  mr wotton held his breath but the old lady merely shook her head thoughtfully  it was a disagreeable voice when his wife used to hear it she said at last  always faultfinding when it wasnt swearing  mr wotton glanced at his friend and raising his eyebrows slightly gave up his task  might ha been faults on both sides said mr davis gruffly  you werent all that you should ha been you know  me said his hostess raising her voice  illustration dont you know me mary  yes you said mr davis rising  dont you know me mary  why i knew you the moment you come into the room  he moved towards her awkwardly but she rose in her turn and drew back  if you touch me ill scream she said firmly  how dare you  why ive never seen you before in my life  its ben davis maam its im right enough said mr wotton meekly  hold your tongue said the old lady  look at me  commanded mr davis sternly  look at me straight in the eye  dont talk nonsense said the other sharply  look you in the eye indeed  i dont want to look in your eye  what would people think  let em think wot they like said mr davis recklessly  this is a nice homecoming after being away thirtyfive years  most of it on a desert island put in mr wotton pathetically  and now ive come back resumed mr davis come back to stop  he hung his cap on a vase on the mantelpiece that reeled under the shock and dropping into his chair again crossed his legs and eyed her sternly  her gaze was riveted on his dilapidated boots  she looked up and spoke mildly  youre not my husband she said  youve made a mistakei think you had better go  ho  said mr davis with a hard laugh  indeed  and ow do you know im not  for the best of reasons was the reply  besides how can you prove that you are  thirtyfive years is a long time  specially on a desert island said mr wotton rapidly  youd be surprised ow slow the time passes  i was there with im and i can lay my hand on my art and assure you that that is your husband  nonsense  said the old lady vigorously  rubbish  i can prove it said mr davis fixing her with a glittering eye  do you remember the serpent i ad tattooed on my leg for a garter  if you dont go at once said the old lady hastily ill send for the police  you used to admire it said mr davis reproachfully  i remember once  if you say another word said the other in a fierce voice ill send straight off for the police  you and your serpents  ill tell my husband of you thats what ill do  your what  roared mr davis springing to his feet  my husband  he wont stand any of your nonsense i can tell you  youd better go before he comes in  ooh said mr davis taking a long breath  oh so you been and got married again ave you  thats your love for your husband as was cast away while trying to earn a living for you  thats why you dont want me is it  well see  ill wait for him  you dont know what youre talking about said the other with great dignity  ive only been married once  mr davis passed the back of his hand across his eyes in a dazed fashion and stared at her  isis somebody passing himself off as me  he demanded  cos if he is ill ave you both up for bigamy  certainly not  butbut  mr davis turned and looked blankly at his friend  mr wotton met his gaze with dilated eyes  you say you recognize me as your wife  said the old lady  certainly said mr davis hotly  its very curious said the othervery  but are you sure  look again  mr davis thrust his face close to hers and stared hard  she bore his scrutiny without flinching  im positive certain said mr davis taking a breath  thats very curious said the old lady but then i suppose we are a bit alike  you see mrs davis being away im looking after her house for a bit  my name happens to be smith  mr davis uttered a sharp exclamation and falling back a step stared at her openmouthed  we all make mistakes urged mr wotton after a long silence and bens sight aint wot it used to be  he strained it looking out for a sail when we was on that desert  whenwhenll she be back  inquired mr davis finding his voice at last  the old lady affected to look puzzled  but i thought you were certain that i was your wife  she said smoothly  my mistake said mr davis ruefully  thirtyfive years is a long time and people change a bit i have myself  for one thing i must say i didnt expect to find er so stout  stout  repeated the other quickly  not that i mean youre too stout said mr davis hurriedlyfor people that like stoutness that is  my wife used to ave a very good figger  mr wotton nodded  he used to rave about it on that des  when will she be back  inquired mr davis interrupting him  mrs smith shook her head  i cant say she replied moving towards the door  when shes off holidaying i never know when shell return shall i tell her you called  tell her icertainly said mr davis with great vehemence  ill come in a weeks time and see if shes back  she might be away for months said the old lady moving slowly to the passage and opening the street door  goodafternoon  she closed the door behind them and stood watching them through the glass as they passed disconsolately into the street  then she went back into the parlour and standing before the mantelpiece looked long and earnestly into the mirror  mr davis returned a week lateralone and pausing at the gate glanced in dismay at a bill in the window announcing that the house was to be sold  he walked up the path still looking at it and being admitted by the trim servant was shown into the parlour and stood in a dispirited fashion before mrs smith  not back yet  he inquired gruffly  the old lady shook her head  whatwhatis that bill for  demanded mr davis jerking his thumb towards it  she is thinking of selling the house said mrs smith  i let her know you had been and that is the result  she wont comeback  you wont see her again  where is she  inquired mr davis frowning  mrs smith shook her head again  and it would be no use my telling you she said  what she has got is her own and the law wont let you touch a penny of it without her consent  you must have treated her badly why did you leave her  why  repeated mr davis  why  why because she hit me over the ead with a broomhandle  mrs smith tossed her head  fancy you remembering that for thirtyfive years  she said  fancy forgetting it  retorted mr davis  i suppose she had a hot temper said the old lady  ot temper  said the other  yes  he leaned forward and holding his chilled hands over the fire stood for some time deep in thought  i dont know what it is he said at last but theres a something about you that reminds me of her  it aint your voice cos she had a very nice voicewhen she wasnt in a temperand it aint your face because  yes  said mrs smith sharply  because it dont remind me of her  and yet the other day you said you recognized me at once said the old lady  i thought i did said mr davis  one thing is i was expecting to see her i spose  there was a long silence  well i wont keep you said mrs smith at last and its no good for you to keep coming here to see her  she will never come here again i dont want to hurt your feelings but you dont look over and above respectable  your coat is torn your trousers are patched in a dozen places and your boots are half off your feeti dont know what the servant must think  ii only came to look for my wife said mr davis in a startled voice  i wont come again  thats right said the old lady  thatll please her i know  and if she should happen to ask what sort of a living you are making what shall i tell her  tell her what you said about my clothes maam said mr davis with his hand on the doorknob  shell understand then  shes known wot it is to be poor herself  shed got a bad temper but shed have cut her tongue out afore shed ave thrown a poor devils rags in his face goodafternoon  goodafternoon ben said the old woman in a changed voice  mr davis halfway through the door started as though he had been shot and facing about stood eyeing her in dumb bewilderment  if i take you back again repeated his wife are you going to behave yourself  it isnt the same voice and it isnt the same face said the old woman but if id only got a broomhandle handy  mr davis made an odd noise in his throat  if you hadnt been so down on your luck said his wife blinking her eyes rapidly id have let you go  if you hadnt looked so miserable i could have stood it  if i take you back are you going to behave yourself  mr davis stood gaping at her  if i take you back again repeated his wife speaking very slowly are you going to behave yourself  yes said mr davis finding his voice at last  yes if you are        the old man of the sea  what i want you to do said mr george wright as he leaned towards the old sailor is to be an uncle to me  aye aye said the mystified mr kemp pausing with a mug of beer midway to his lips  a rich uncle continued the young man lowering his voice to prevent any keen ears in the next bar from acquiring useless knowledge  an uncle from new zealand who is going to leave me all is money  wheres it coming from  demanded mr kemp with a little excitement  it aint coming was the reply  youve only got to say youve got it fact of the matter is ive got my eye on a young lady theres another chap after er too and if she thought id got a rich uncle it might make all the difference  she knows i ad an uncle that went to new zealand and was never heard of since  thats what made me think of it  mr kemp drank his beer in thoughtful silence  how can i be a rich uncle without any brass  he inquired at length  i should ave to lend you somea little said mr wright  illustration what i want you to do said mr george wright is to be an uncle to me  the old man pondered  ive had money lent me before he said candidly but i cant call to mind ever paying it back  i always meant to but thats as far as it got  it dont matter said the other  itll only be for a little while and then youll ave a letter calling you back to new zealand  see  and youll go back promising to come home in a years time after youve wound up your business and leave us all your money  see  mr kemp scratched the back of his neck  but shes sure to find it out in time he objected  praps said mr wright  and praps not  therell be plenty of time for me to get married before she does and you could write back and say you had got married yourself or given your money to a hospital  he ordered some more beer for mr kemp and in a low voice gave him as much of the family history as he considered necessary  ive only known you for about ten days he concluded but id sooner trust you than people ive known for years  i took a fancy to you the moment i set eyes on you rejoined mr kemp youre the living image of a young fellow that lent me five pounds once and was drowned afore my eyes the week after  he ad a bit of a squint and i spose thats how he came to fall overboard  he emptied his mug and then accompanied by mr wright fetched his seachest from the boardinghouse where he was staying and took it to the young mans lodgings  fortunately for the latters pocket the chest contained a good best suit and boots and the only expenses incurred were for a large soft felt hat and a gilded watch and chain  dressed in his best with a bulging pocketbook in his breastpocket he set out with mr wright on the following evening to make his first call  mr wright who was also in his best clothes led the way to a small tobacconists in a side street off the mile end road and raising his hat with some ceremony shook hands with a goodlooking young woman who stood behind the counter mr kemp adopting an air of scornful dignity intended to indicate the possession of great wealth waited  this is my uncle said mr wright speaking rapidly from new zealand the one i spoke to you about  he turned up last night and you might have knocked me down with a feather  the last person in the world i expected to see  mr kemp in a good rolling voice said good evening miss i hope you are well and subsiding into a chair asked for a cigar  his surprise when he found that the best cigar they stocked only cost sixpence almost assumed the dimensions of a grievance  itll do to go on with he said smelling it suspiciously  have you got change for a fiftypound note  miss bradshaw concealing her surprise by an effort said that she would see and was scanning the contents of a drawer when mr kemp in some haste discovered a few odd sovereigns in his waistcoatpocket  five minutes later he was sitting in the little room behind the shop holding forth to an admiring audience  so far as i know he said in reply to a question of mrs bradshaws george is the only relation ive got  him and me are quite alone and i can tell you i was glad to find him  mrs bradshaw sighed  its a pity you are so far apart she said  its not for long said mr kemp  im just going back for about a year to wind up things out there and then im coming back to leave my old bones over here  george has very kindly offered to let me live with him  he wont suffer for it ill be bound said mrs bradshaw archly  so far as money goes he wont said the old man  not that that would make any difference to george  it would be the same to me if you hadnt got a farthing said mr wright promptly  illustration itll do to go on with he said  mr kemp somewhat affected shook hands with him and leaning back in the most comfortable chair in the room described his life and struggles in new zealand  hard work teetotalism and the simple life combined appeared to be responsible for a fortune which he affected to be too old to enjoy  misunderstandings of a painful nature were avoided by a timely admission that under medical advice he was now taking a fair amount of stimulant  illustration ow much did you say youd got in the bank  mind he said as he walked home with the elated george its your game not mine and its sure to come a bit expensive  i cant be a rich uncle without spending a bit  ow much did you say youd got in the bank  we must be as careful as we can said mr wright hastily  one thing is they cant leave the shop to go out much  its a very good little business and it ought to be all right for me and bella one of these days eh  mr kemp prompted by a nudge in the ribs assented  its wonderful how they took it all in about me he said but i feel certain in my own mind that i ought to chuck some money about  tell em of the money you have chucked about said mr wright  itll do just as well and come a good deal cheaper  and you had better go round alone tomorrow evening  itll look better  just go in for another one of their sixpenny cigars  mr kemp obeyed and the following evening after sitting a little while chatting in the shop was invited into the parlour where mindful of mr wrights instructions he held his listeners enthralled by tales of past expenditure  a tip of fifty pounds to his bedroom steward coming over was characterized by mrs bradshaw as extravagant  seems to be going all right said mr wright as the old man made his report but be careful dont go overdoing it  mr kemp nodded  i can turn em round my little finger he said youll have bella all to yourself tomorrow evening  mr wright flushed  how did you manage that  he inquired  its the first time she has ever been out with me alone  she aint coming out said mr kemp  shes going to stay at home and mind the shop its the mother whats coming out  going to spend the evening with me  mr wright frowned  what did you do that for  he demanded hotly  i didnt do it said mr kemp equably they done it  the old lady says that just for once in her life she wants to see how it feels to spend money like water  money like water  repeated the horrified mr wright  money like ill money herill  it dont matter to me said mr kemp  i can have a headache or a chill or something of that sort if you like  i dont want to go  its no pleasure to me  what will it cost  demanded mr wright pacing up and down the room  the rich uncle made a calculation  she wants to go to a place called the empire he said slowly and have something for supper and thered be cabs and things  i dessay it would cost a couple o pounds and it might be more  but id just as soon ave a chilljust  mr wright groaned and after talking of mrs bradshaw as though she were already his motherinlaw produced the money  his instructions as to economy lasted almost up to the moment when he stood with bella outside the shop on the following evening and watched the couple go off  its wonderful how well they get on together said bella as they reentered the shop and passed into the parlour  ive never seen mother take to anybody so quick as she has to him  i hope you like him too said mr wright  hes a dear said bella  fancy having all that money  i wonder what it feels like  i suppose i shall know some day said the young man slowly but it wont be much good to me unless  unless  said bella after a pause  unless it gives me what i want replied the other  id sooner be a poor man and married to the girl i love than a millionaire  miss bradshaw stole an uneasy glance at his somewhat sallow features and became thoughtful  its no good having diamonds and motorcars and that sort of thing unless you have somebody to share them with pursued mr wright  miss bradshaws eyes sparkled and at that moment the shopbell tinkled and a lively whistle sounded  she rose and went into the shop and mr wright settled back in his chair and scowled darkly as he saw the intruder  good evening said the latter  i want a sixpenny smoke for twopence please  how are we this evening  sitting up and taking nourishment  miss bradshaw told him to behave himself  always do said the young man  thats why i can never get anybody to play with  i had such an awful dream about you last night that i couldnt rest till i saw you  awful it was  what was it  inquired miss bradshaw  dreamt you were married said mr hills smiling at her  miss bradshaw tossed her head  who to pray  she inquired  me said mr hills simply  i woke up in a cold perspiration halloa is that georgie in there  how are you george  better  im all right said mr wright with dignity as the other hooked the door open with his stick and nodded at him  well why dont you look it  demanded the lively mr hills  have you got your feet wet or what  oh be quiet said miss bradshaw smiling at him  righto said mr hills dropping into a chair by the counter and caressing his moustache  but you wouldnt speak to me like that if you knew what a terrible day ive had  what have you been doing  asked the girl  working said the other with a huge sigh  wheres the millionaire i came round on purpose to have a look at him  him and mother have gone to the empire  said miss bradshaw  mr hills gave three long penetrating whistles and then placing his cigar with great care on the counter hid his face in a huge handkerchief  miss bradshaw glanced from him to the frowning mr wright and then entering the parlour closed the door with a bang  mr hills took the hint and with a somewhat thoughtful grin departed  he came in next evening for another cigar and heard all that there was to hear about the empire  mrs bradshaw would have treated him but coldly but the innocent mr kemp charmed by his manner paid him great attention  hes just like what i was at his age he said  lively  im not a patch on you said mr hills edging his way by slow degrees into the parlour  i dont take young ladies to the empire  were you telling me you came over here to get married or did i dream it  ark at him said the blushing mr kemp as mrs bradshaw shook her head at the offender and told him to behave himself  hes a man any woman might be happy with said mr hills  he never knows how much there is in his trouserspocket  fancy sewing on buttons for a man like that  goldmining aint in it  mrs bradshaw shook her head at him again and mr hills after apologizing to her for revealing her innermost thoughts before the most guileless of men began to question mr kemp as to the prospects of a bright and energetic young man with a distaste for work in new zealand the audience listened with keen attention to the replies the only disturbing factor being a cough of mr wrights which became more and more troublesome as the evening wore on  by the time uncle and nephew rose to depart the latter was so hoarse that he could scarcely speak  why didnt you tell em you had got a letter calling you home as i told you  he vociferated as soon as they were clear of the shop  ii forgot it said the old man  forgot it  repeated the incensed mr wright  what did you think i was coughing like that forfun  i forgot it said the old man doggedly  besides if you take my advice youd better let me stay a little longer to make sure of things  mr wright laughed disagreeably  i dare say he said but i am managing this affair not you  now you go round tomorrow afternoon and tell them youre off  dye hear  dye think im made of money  and what do you mean by making such a fuss of that fool charlie hills  you know he is after bella  he walked the rest of the way home in indignant silence and after giving minute instructions to mr kemp next morning at breakfast went off to work in a more cheerful frame of mind  mr kemp was out when he returned and after making his toilet he followed him to mrs bradshaws  to his annoyance he found mr hills there again and moreover it soon became clear to him that mr kemp had said nothing about his approaching departure  coughs and scowls passed unheeded and at last in a hesitating voice he broached the subject himself  there was a general chorus of lamentation  i hadnt got the heart to tell you said mr kemp  i dont know when ive been so happy  but you havent got to go back immediate said mrs bradshaw  tomorrow said mr wright before the old man could reply business  must you go said mrs bradshaw  mr kemp smiled feebly  i suppose i ought to he replied in a hesitating voice  take my tip and give yourself a bit of a holiday before you go back urged mr hills  just for a few days pleaded bella  to please us said mrs bradshaw  think ow georgell miss you  lay hold of him and dont let him go said mr hills  he took mr kemp round the waist and the laughing bella and her mother each secured an arm  an appeal to mr wright to secure his legs passed unheeded  we dont let you go till you promise said mrs bradshaw  mr kemp smiled and shook his head  promise  said bella  well well said mr kemp praps  he must go back shouted the alarmed  mr wright  let him speak for himself exclaimed bella indignantly  just another week then said mr kemp  its no good having money if i cant please myself  a week shouted mr wright almost beside himself with rage and dismay a week  another week  why you told me  oh dont listen to him said mrs bradshaw  croaker  its his own business aint it  and he knows best dont he  whats it got to do with you  she patted mr kemps hand mr kemp patted back and with his disengaged hand helped himself to a glass of beerthe fourthand beamed in a friendly fashion upon the company  george  he said suddenly  yes said mr wright in a harsh voice  did you think to bring my pocketbook along with you  no said mr wright sharply i didnt  tttt said the old man with a gesture of annoyance  well lend me a couple of pounds then or else run back and fetch my pocketbook he added with a sly grin  mr wrights face worked with impotent fury  whatwhatdo youwant it for  he gasped  mrs bradshaws well well seemed to sum up the general feeling mr kemp shaking his head eyed him with gentle reproach  me and mrs bradshaw are going to gave another evening out he said quietly  ive only got a few more days and i must make hay while the sun shines  to mr wright the room seemed to revolve slowly on its axis but regaining his selfpossession by a supreme effort he took out his purse and produced the amount  mrs bradshaw after a few feminine protestations went upstairs to put her bonnet on  and you can go and fetch a hansomcab george while shes adoing of it said mr kemp  pick out a good orsespottedgrey if you can  mr wright arose and departing with a suddenness that was almost startling exploded harmlessly in front of the barbers next door but one  then with lagging steps he went in search of the shabbiest cab and oldest horse he could find  thankee my boy said mr kemp bluffly as he helped mrs bradshaw in and stood with his foot on the step  by the way you had better go back and lock my pocketbook up  i left it on the washstand and theres best part of a thousand pounds in it  you can take fifty for yourself to buy smokes with  there was a murmur of admiration and mr wright with a frantic attempt to keep up appearances tried to thank him but in vain  long after the cab had rolled away he stood on the pavement trying to think out a position which was rapidly becoming unendurable  still keeping up appearances he had to pretend to go home to look after the pocketbook leaving the jubilant mr hills to improve the shining hour with miss bradshaw  mr kemp returning home at midnightin a cabfound the young man waiting up for him and taking a seat on the edge of the table listened unmoved to a wordpicture of himself which seemed interminable  he was only moved to speech when mr wright described him as a whitewhiskered jezebel who was a disgrace to his sex and then merely in the interests of natural science  dont you worry he said as the other paused from exhaustion  it wont be for long now  long  said mr wright panting  first thing tomorrow morning you have a telegram calling you backa telegram that must be minded  dye see  no i dont said mr kemp plainly  im not going back never no morenever  im going to stop here and court mrs bradshaw  mr wright fought for breath  youyou cant he gasped  im going to have a try said the old man  im sick of going to sea and itll be a nice comfortable home for my old age  you marry bella and ill marry her mother  happy family  mr wright trembling with rage sat down to recover and regaining his composure after a time pointed out almost calmly the various difficulties in the way  ive thought it all out said mr kemp nodding  she mustnt know im not rich till after were married then i ave a letter from new zealand saying ive lost all my money  its just as easy to have that letter as the one you spoke of  and im to find you money to play the rich uncle with till youre married i suppose said mr wright in a grating voice and then lose bella when mrs bradshaw finds youve lost your money  mr kemp scratched his ear  thats your lookout he said at last  now look here said mr wright with great determination  either you go and tell them that youve been telegraphed forcabled is the proper wordor i tell them the truth  thatll settle you then said mr kemp  no more than the other would retorted the young man and itll come cheaper  one thing ill take my oath of and that is i wont give you another farthing but if you do as i tell you ill give you a quid for luck  now think it over  mr kemp thought it over and after a vain attempt to raise the promised reward to five pounds finally compounded for two and went off to bed after a few stormy words on selfishness and ingratitude  he declined to speak to his host at breakfast next morning and accompanied him in the evening with the air of a martyr going to the stake  he listened in stony silence to the young mans instructions and only spoke when the latter refused to pay the two pounds in advance  the news communicated in halting accents by mr kemp was received with flattering dismay  mrs bradshaw refused to believe her ears and it was only after the information had been repeated and confirmed by mr wright that she understood  i must go said mr kemp  ive spent over eleven pounds cabling today but its all no good  but youre coming back  said mr hills  o course i am was the reply  george is the only relation ive got and ive got to look after him i suppose  after all blood is thicker than water  hear hear said mrs bradshaw piously  and theres you and bella continued mr kemp two of the best that ever breathed  the ladies looked down  and charlie hills i dont knowi dont know when ive took such a fancy to anybody as i have to im  if i was a young gala single young galhesthe other half he said slowly as he pausedjust the one i should fancy  hes a goodarted goodlooking  draw it mild interrupted the blushing mr hills as mr wright bestowed a ferocious glance upon the speaker  clever lively young fellow concluded mr kemp  george  yes said mr wright  im going now  ive got to catch the train for southampton but i dont want you to come with me  i prefer to be alone  you stay here and cheer them up  oh and before i forget it lend me a couple o pounds out o that fifty i gave you last night  ive given all my small change away  he looked up and met mr wrights eye the latter too affected to speak took out the money and passed it over  we never know what may happen to us said the old man solemnly as he rose and buttoned his coat  im an old man and i like to have things shipshape  ive spent nearly the whole day with my lawyer and if anything appens to my old carcass it wont make any difference  i have left half my money to george half of all i have is to be his  in the midst of an awed silence he went round and shook hands  the other half with his hand on the doorthe other half and my best gold watch and chain i have left to my dear young pal charlie hills goodbye georgie      manners makyth man  the nightwatchman appeared to be out of sorts  his movements were even slower than usual and when he sat the soapbox seemed to be unable to give satisfaction  his face bore an expression of deep melancholy but a smouldering gleam in his eye betokened feelings deeply moved  playacting i dont hold with he burst out with sudden ferocity never did  i dont say i aint been to a theayter once or twice in my life but i always come away with the idea that anybody could act if they liked to try  its a kids game a silly kids game dressing up and pretending to be somebody else  he cut off a piece of tobacco and stowing it in his left cheek sat chewing with his lacklustre eyes fixed on the wharves across the river the offensive antics of a lighterman in midstream who nearly fell overboard in his efforts to attract his attention he ignored  i might ha known it too he said after a long silence  if id only stopped to think instead o being in such a hurry to do good to others i should ha been all right and the pack o monkeyfaced swabs on the lizzie and annie wot calls themselves sailormen would ave had to ave got something else to laugh about  theyve told it in every pub for arf a mile round and last night when i went into the town of margate to get a drink three chaps climbed over the partition to ave a look at me  it all began with young ted sawyer the mate o the lizzie and annie he calls himself a mate but if it wasnt for aving the skipper for a brotherinlaw ed be called something else very quick  two or three times weve ad words over one thing and another and the last time i called im something that i can see now was a mistake  it was one o these ere clever things that a man dont forget let alone a lopsided monkey like im  that was when they was up time afore last and when they made fast ere last week i could see as he adnt forgotten it  for one thing he pretended not to see me and arter i ad told him wot id do to him if e ran into me agin he said e thought i was a sack o potatoes taking a airing on a pair of legs wot somebody ad throwed away  nasty tongue es got not clever but nasty  arter that i took no notice of im and o course that annoyed im more than anything  all i could do i done and e was ringing the gatebell that night from five minutes to twelve till hapast afore i heard it  many a nightwatchman gets a name for going to sleep when es only getting a bit of is own back  we stood there talking for over arfanhour arter i ad letim in leastways he did  and whenever i see as he was getting tired i just said hsh and ed start agin as fresh as ever  he tumbled to it at last and went aboard shaking is little fist at me and telling me wot hed do to me if it wasnt for the lor  i kept by the gate as soon as i came on dooty next evening just to give im a little smile as e went out  there is nothing more aggravating than a smile when it is properly done but there was no signs o my lord and arter practising it on a carman by mistake i ad to go inside for a bit and wait till he ad gorn  the coast was clear by the time i went back and i ad just stepped outside with my back up agin the gatepost to ave a pipe when i see a boy coming along with a bag  goodlooking lad of about fifteen e was nicely dressed in a serge suit and he no sooner gets up to me than e puts down the bag and looks up at me with a timid sort o little smile  good evening capn he ses  he wasnt the fust that has made that mistake older people than im have done it  good evening my lad i ses  i spose he ses in a trembling voice i suppose you aint looking out for a cabinboy sir  cabinboy i ses  no i aint  ive run away from ome to go to sea he ses and im afraid of being pursued  can i come inside  afore i could say no he ad come bag and all and afore i could say anything else he ad nipped into the office and stood there with his and on his chest panting  i know i can trust you he ses i can see it by your face  wot ave you run away from ome for i ses  have they been illtreating of you  illtreating me he ses with a laugh  not much  why i expect my father is running about all over the place offering rewards for me  he wouldnt lose me for a thousand pounds  i pricked up my ears at that i dont deny it  anybody would  besides i knew it would be doing him a kindness to hand im back to is father and then i did a bit o thinking to see ow it was to be done  sit down i ses putting three or four ledgers on the floor behind one of the desks  sit down and lets talk it over  we talked away for ever so long but do all i would i couldnt persuade im  his ead was stuffed full of coral islands and smugglers and pirates and foreign ports  he said e wanted to see the world and flyingfish  i love the blue billers he ses the heaving blue billers is wot i want  i tried to explain to im who would be doing the heaving but e wouldnt listen to me  he sat on them ledgers like a little wooden image looking up at me and shaking his ead and when i told im of storms and shipwrecks he just smacked is lips and his blue eyes shone with joy  arter a time i saw it was no good trying to persuade im and i pretended to give way  i think i can get you a ship with a friend o mine i ses but mind ive got to relieve your pore fathers mindi must let im know wots become of you  not before ive sailed he ses very quick  certingly not i ses  but you must give me is name and address and arter the blue sharkthats the name of your shipis clear of the land ill send im a letter with no name to it saying where you ave gorn  he didnt seem to like it at fust and said e would write imself but arter i ad pointed out that e might forget and that i was responsible e gave way and told me that is father was named mr watson and he kept a big drapers shop in the commercial road  we talked a bit arter that just to stop is suspicions and then i told im to stay where e was on the floor out of sight of the window while i went to see my friend the captain  i stood outside for a moment trying to make up my mind wot to do ocourse i ad no business strictly speaking to leave the wharf but on the other and there was a fathers art to relieve  i edged along bit by bit while i was thinking and then arter looking back once or twice to make sure that the boy wasnt watching me i set off for the commercial road as hard as i could go  im not so young as i was  it was a warm evening and i adnt got even a bus fare on me  i ad to walk all the way and by the time i got there i was arf melted  it was a tidysized shop with three or four nicelooking gals behind the counter and things like babies high chairs for the customers to sit onlong in the leg and ridikerlously small in the seat  i went up to one of the gals and told per i wanted to see mr watson  on private business i ses  very important  she looked at me for a moment and then she went away and fetched a tall baldheaded man with grey sidewhiskers and a large nose  wot dyou want  he ses coming up to me  i want a word with you in private i ses  this is private enough for me he ses  say wot you ave to say and be quick about it  i drawed myself up a bit and looked at him  praps you aint missed im yet i ses  missed im he ses with a growl  missed who  yourson  your blueeyed son i ses looking im straight in the eye  look here he ses spluttering  you be off  ow dare you come here with your games  wot dye mean by it  i mean i ses getting a bit out o temper that your boy has run away to go to sea and ive come to take you to im  he seemed so upset that i thought e was going to ave a fit at fust and it seemed only natural too  then i see that the bestlooking girl and another was having a fit although trying ard not to  if you dont get out o my shop he ses at last ill ave you locked up  very good i ses in a quiet way  very good but mark my words if hes drownded youll never forgive yourself as long as you live for letting your temper get the better of youyoull never know a good nights rest agin  besides wot about is mother  one o them silly gals went off agin just like a damp firework and mr watson arter nearly choking imself with temper shoved me out o the way and marched out o the shop  i didnt know wot to make of im at fust and then one o the gals told me that e was a bachelor and adnt got no son and that somebody ad been taking advantage of what she called my innercence to pull my leg  you toddle off ome she ses before mr watson comes back  its a shame to let im come out alone ses one o the other gals where do you live granpa  i see then that i ad been done and i was just walking out o the shop pretending to be deaf when mr watson come back with a silly young policeman wot asked me wot i meant by it  he told me to get off ome quick and actually put his and on my shoulder but it ud take more than a thing like that to push me and arter trying his ardest he could only rock me a bit  i went at last because i wanted to see that boy agin and the young policeman follered me quite a long way shaking his silly ead at me and telling me to be careful  i got a ride part o the way from commercial road to aldgate by getting on the wrong bus but it wasnt much good and i was quite tired by the time i got back to the wharf  i waited outside for a minute or two to get my wind back agin and then i went inboiling  you might ha knocked me down with a feather as the saying is and i just stood inside the office speechless  the boy ad disappeared and sitting on the floor where i ad left im was a very nicelooking gal of about eighteen with short air and a white blouse  good evening sir she ses jumping up and giving me a pretty little frightened look  im so sorry that my brother has been deceiving you hes a bad wicked ungrateful boy  the idea of telling you that mr watson was is father  have you been there  i do ope youre not tired  where is he i ses  hes gorn she ses shaking her ead  i begged and prayed of im to stop but e wouldnt  he said e thought you might be offended with im  give my love to old roleypoley and tell him i dont trust im he ses  she stood there looking so scared that i didnt know wot to say  by and by she took out er little pocketankercher and began to cry  oh get im back she ses  dont let it be said i follered im ere all the way for nothing  have another try  for my sake  ow can i get im back when i dont know where hes gorn i ses  hehes gorn to

to sea she ses shaking er little head  hes just gorn to try and boboborrow some money to go away with  she bust out sobbing and it was all i could do to get the godfathers address out of er  when i think of the trouble i took to get it i come over quite faint  at last she told me between er sobs that is name was mr kiddem and that he lived at 27 bridge street  hes one o the kindestarted and most generous men that ever lived she ses thats why my brother harry as gone to im  and you neednt mind taking anything e likes to give you hes rolling in money  i took it a bit easier going to bridge street but the evening seemed otter than ever and by the time i got to the ouse i was pretty near done up  a nice tidylooking woman opened the door but she was a most stone deaf and i ad to shout the name pretty near a dozen times afore she eard it  he dont live ere she ses  as he moved i ses  or wot  she shook her cad and arter telling me to wait went in and fetched her usband  never eard of him he ses and weve been ere seventeen years  are you sure it was twentyseven  sartain i ses  well he dont live ere he ses  why not try thirtyseven and fortyseven  i triedem thirtyseven was empty and a pastyfaced chap at fortyseven nearly made imself ill over the name of kiddem  it adnt struck me before but its a hard matter to deceive me and all in a flash it come over me that i ad been done agin and that the gal was as bad as er brother  i was so done up i could ardly crawl back and my ead was all in a maze  three or four times i stopped and tried to think but couldnt but at last i got back and dragged myself into the office  as i arf expected it was empty  there was no sign of either the gal or the boy and i dropped into a chair and tried to think wot it all meant  then appening to look out of the winder i see somebody running up and down the jetty  i couldnt see plain owing to the things in the way but as soon as i got outside and saw who it was i nearly dropped  it was the boy and he was running up and down wringing his ands and crying like a wild thing and instead o running away as soon as e saw me he rushed right up to me and threw is grubby little paws round my neck  save her e ses  save er  help  help  look ere i ses shoving im off  she fell overboard he ses dancing about  oh my pore sister quick  quick  i cant swim  he ran to the side and pointed at the water which was just about at arftide  then e caught old of me agin  make aste he ses giving me a shove behind  jump in  wot are you waiting for  i stood there for a moment arf dazed looking down at the water  then i pulled down a lifebelt from the wall ere and threw it in and arter another moments thought ran back to the lizzie and annie wot was in the inside berth and gave them a hail  ive always ad a good voice and in a flash the skipper and ted sawyer came tumbling up out of the cabin and the ands out of the focsle  gal overboard i ses shouting  the skipper just asked where and then im and the mate and a couple of ands tumbled into their boat and pulled under the jetty for all they was worth  me and the boy ran back and stood with the others watching  point out the exact spot ses the skipper  the boy pointed and the skipper stood up in the boat and felt round with a boathook  twice e said he thought e touched something but it turned out as e was mistaken  his face got longer and longer and e shook his ead and said he was afraid it was no good  dont stand cryin ere he ses to the boy kindly  jem run round for the thames police and get them and the drags  take the boy with you  itll occupy is mind  he ad another go with the boathook arter they ad gone then e gave it up and sat in the boat waiting  thisll be a bad job for you watchman he ses shaking his ead where was you when it appened  hes been missing all the evening ses the cook wot was standing beside me  if hed been doing is dooty the pore gal wouldnt ave been drownded  wot was she doing on the wharf  skylarkin i spose ses the mate  its a wonder there aint more drownded  wot can you expect when the watchman is sitting in a pub all the evening  the cook said i ought to be ung and a young ordinary seaman wot was standing beside im said he would sooner i was boiled  i believe they ad words about it but i was feeling too upset to take much notice  looking miserable wont bring er back to life agin ses the skipper looking up at me and shaking his ead  youd better go down to my cabin and get yourself a drop o whisky theres a bottle on the table  youll want all your wits about you when the police come  and wotever you do dont say nothing to criminate yourself  well do the criminating for im all right ses the cook  if i was the pore gal id haunt im ses the ordinary seaman every night of is life id stand afore im dripping with water and moaning  praps she will ses the cook lets ope so at any rate  i didnt answer em i was too deadbeat  besides which ive got a orror of ghosts and the idea of being on the wharf alone of a night arter such a thing was amost too much for me  i went on board the lizzie and annie and down in the cabin i found a bottle o whisky as the skipper ad said  i sat down on the locker and ad a glass and then i sat worrying and wondering wot was to be the end of it all  the whisky warmed me up a bit and i ad just taken up the bottle to elp myself agin when i eard a faint sort o sound in the skippers stateroom  i put the bottle down and listened but everything seemed deathly still  i took it up agin and ad just poured out a drop o whisky when i distinctly eard a hissing noise and then a little moan  for a moment i sat turned to stone  then i put the bottle down quiet and ad just got up to go when the door of the stateroom opened and i saw the drownded gal with er little face and hair all wet and dripping standing before me  ted sawyer as been telling everybody that i came up the companionway like a foghorn that ad lost its ma i wonder how hed ave come up if hed ad the evening i had ad  they were all on the jetty as i got there and tumbled into the skippers arms and all asking at once wot was the matter  when i got my breath back a bit and told em they laughed  all except the cook and e said it was only wot i might expect  then like a man in a dream i see the gal come out of the companion and walk slowly to the side  look i ses  look  there she is  youre dreaming ses the skipper theres nothing there  they all said the same even when the gal stepped on to the side and climbed on to the wharf  she came along towards me with er arms held close to er sides and making the most orrible faces at me and it took five ofem all their time to old me  the wharf and everything seemed to me to spin round and round  then she came straight up to me and patted me on the cheek  pore old gentleman she ses  wot a shame it is ted  its too bad  they let go o me then and stamped up and down the jetty laughing fit to kill themselves  if they ad only known wot a exhibition they was making of themselves and ow i pitied them they wouldnt ha done it and by and by ted wiped his eyes and put his arm round the gals waist and ses  this is my intended miss florrie price he ses  aint she a little wonder  wot dye think of er  ill keep my own opinion i ses  i aint got nothing to say against gals but if i only lay my hands on that young brother of ers  they went off agin then worse than ever and at last the cook came and put is skinny arm round my neck and started spluttering in my ear  i shoved im off hard because i see it all then and i should ha seen it afore only i didnt ave time to think  i dont bear no malice and all i can say is that i dont wish er any harder punishment than to be married to ted sawyer
