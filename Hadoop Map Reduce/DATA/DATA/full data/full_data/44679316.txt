young man from the west had arrived in new york only that afternoon and his cousin town born and bred had already embarked upon the task of showing him the great city they occupied a table in a somewhat insignificant corner of one of new yorks most famous roofgarden restaurants the place was crowded with diners there were many notabilities to be pointed out the town young man was very busy  see that bunch of girls on the right he asked they are all from the chorus in the new musical comedyopens tomorrow theyve been rehearsing every day for a month some show its going to be too i dont know whether ill be able to get you a seat but ill try ive had mine for a month the fair girl who is leaning back laughing now is elsie havers shes the star you see the old fellow with the girl just in a line behind thats dudley worth the multimillionaire and at the next table there is mrs atkinsonyou remember her divorce case  it was all vastly interesting to the young man from the west and he looked from table to table with everincreasing interest  say its fine to be here he declared we have this sort of thing back home but we are only twelve stories up and there is nothing to look at makes you kind of giddy here to look past the people down at the city  the new yorker glanced almost indifferently at the one sight which to a stranger is perhaps the most impressive in the new world twentyfive stories below the cable cars clanging and clashing their way through the narrowed streets seemed like little fireflies childrens toys pulled by an invisible string of fire further afield the flare of the city painted the murky sky the line of the river scintillated with rising and falling stars the tall buildings stabbed the blackness fingers of fire here midway to the clouds was another world a world of luxury of brilliant toilettes of light laughter the popping of corks the joy of living with everywhere the vague perfume and flavour of femininity  the young man from the country touched his cousins arm suddenly  tell me he enquired who is the man at a table by himself the waiters speak to him as though he were a little god is he a millionaire or a judge or what  the new yorker turned his head for the first time his own face showed some signs of interest his voice dropped a little he himself was impressed  youre in luck alfred he declared thats the most interesting man in new yorkone of the most interesting in the world thats sanford quest  whos he  you havent heard of sanford quest  never in my life  the young man whose privilege it was to have been born and lived all his days in new york drank half a glassful of wine and leaned back in his chair words for a few moments were an impossibility  sanford quest he pronounced at last is the greatest master in criminology the world has ever known he is a magician a scientist the pierpont morgan of his profession  say do you mean that he is a detective  the new yorker steadied himself with an effort such ignorance was hard to realiseharder still to deal with  yes he said simply you could call him thatjust in the same way you could call napoleon a soldier or lincoln a statesman he is a detective if you like to call him that the master detective of the world he has a great house in one of the backwater squares of new york for his office he has wireless telegraphy private chemists a little troop of spies private telegraph and cable and agents in every city of the world if he moves against any gang they break up no one can really understand him sometimes he seems to be on the side of the law sometimes on the side of the criminal he takes just what cases he pleases and a million dollars wouldnt tempt him to touch one he doesnt care about watch him go out they say that you can almost tell the lives of the people he passes from the way they look at him there isnt a crook here or in the street who doesnt know that if sanford quest chose his career would be ended  the country cousin was impressed at last with staring eyes and opened mouth he watched the man who had been sitting only a few tables away from them push back the plate on which lay his bill and rise to his feet one of the chief maîtres dhôtel handed him his straw hat and cane two waiters stood behind his chair the manager hurried forward to see that the way was clear for him yet there was nothing about the appearance of the man himself which seemed to suggest his demanding any of these things he was of little over medium height broadshouldered but with a body somewhat loosely built he wore quiet grey clothes with a black tie a pearl pin and a neat coloured shirt his complexion was a little pale his features welldefined his eyes dark and penetrating but hidden underneath rather bushy eyebrows his deportment was quite unassuming and he left the place as though entirely ignorant of the impression he created the little cluster of chorus girls looked at him almost with awe only one of them ventured to laugh into his face as though anxious to attract his notice another dropped her veil significantly as he drew near the millionaire seemed to become a smaller man as he glanced over his shoulder the lady who had been recently divorced bent over her plate a group of noisy young fellows talking together about a stock exchange deal suddenly ceased their clamour of voices as he passed a man sitting alone with a drawn face deliberately concealed himself behind a newspaper and an aldermaniclooking gentleman who was entertaining a fluffyhaired young lady from a wellknown typewriting office looked for a moment like an errant schoolboy not one of these people did sanford quest seem to see he passed out to the elevator tipped the man who sycophantly took him the whole of the way down without a stop walked through the crowded hall of the hotel and entered a closed motorcar without having exchanged greetings with a soul yet there was scarcely a person there who could feel absolutely sure that he had not been noticed                                       sanford quest descended about ten minutes later before a large and gloomylooking house in georgia square the neighbourhood was in its way unique the roar and hubbub of the city broke like a restless sea only a block or so away on every side this square of dark silent houses seemed to be assailed by the clamour of the encroaching city for some reason or other however it remained a little oasis of oldfashioned buildings residences most of them of a generation passed away sanford quest entered the house with a latchkey he glanced into two of the rooms on the groundfloor in which telegraph and telephone operators sat at their instruments then by means of a small elevator he ascended to the top story and using another key entered a large apartment wrapped in gloom until as he crossed the threshold he touched the switches of the electric lights one realised then that this was a man of taste the furniture and appointments of the room were of dark oak the panelled walls were hung with a few choice engravings there were books and papers about a piano in the corner a door at the further end led into what seemed to be a sleepingapartment quest drew up an easychair to the wideflung window touching a bell as he crossed the room in a few moments the door was opened and closed noiselessly a young woman entered with a little bundle of papers in her hand  anything for me laura he asked  i dont believe you will think so mr quest she answered calmly  she drew a small table and a reading lamp to his side and stood quietly waiting her eyes followed quests as he glanced through the letters her expression matched his she was tall dark goodlooking in a massive way with a splendid almost unfeminine strength in her firm shapely mouth and brilliant eyes her manner was a little brusque but her voice pleasant she was one of those who had learnt the art of silence  the criminologist glanced through the papers quickly and sorted them into two little heaps  send these he directed to the policestation there is nothing in them which calls for outside intervention they are all matters which had better take their normal course to the others simply reply that the matter they refer to does not interest me no further enquiries  nothing mr quest  she left the room almost noiselessly quest took down a volume from the swinging bookcase by his side and drew the reading lamp a little closer to his right shoulder before he opened the volume however he looked for a few moments steadfastly out across the sea of roofs the network of telephone and telegraph wires to where the lights of broadway seemed to eat their way into the sky around him the night life of the great city spread itself out in waves of gilded vice and black and sordid crime its many voices fell upon deaf ears until long past midnight he sat engrossed in a scientific volume     chapter ii  the apartmenthouse mystery   1  this habit of becoming late for breakfast lady ashleigh remarked as she set down the coffeepot is growing upon your father  ella glanced up from a pile of correspondence through which she had been looking a little negligently  when he comes she said i shall tell him what clyde says in his new playthat unpunctuality for breakfast and overpunctuality for dinner are two of the signs of advancing age  i shouldnt her mother advised he hates anything that sounds like an epigram and i noticed that he avoided any allusion to his birthday last month any news dear  none at all mother my correspondence is just the usual sort of rubbishinvitations and gossip such a lot of invitations bythebye  at your age lady ashleigh declared that is the sort of correspondence which you should find interesting  ella shook her head she was a very beautiful young woman but her expression was a little more serious than her twentytwo years warranted  you know i am not like that mother she protested i have found one thing in life which interests me more than all this frivolous business of amusing oneself i shall never be happynot really happyuntil i have settled down to study hard my music is really the only part of life which absolutely appeals to me  lady ashleigh sighed  it seems so unnecessary she murmured since esther was married you are practically an only daughter you are quite well off and there are so many young men who want to marry you  ella laughed gaily  that sort of thing may come later on mother she declaredi suppose i am only human like the rest of usbut to me the greatest thing in the whole world just now is music my music it is a little wonderful isnt it to have a gift a real gift and to know it oh why doesnt delarey make up his mind and let father know as he promised here comes daddy mum bother hes going to shoot and i hoped hed play golf with me  lord ashleigh who had stepped through some french windows at the farther end of the terrace paused for a few minutes to look around him there was certainly some excuse for his momentary absorption the morning although it was late september was perfectly fine and warm the cattle in the park which surrounded the house were already gathered under the trees in the far distance the stubble fields stretched like patches of gold to ridges of pinetopped hills and beyond to the distant sea the breakfast table at which his wife and daughter were seated was arranged on the broad grey stone terrace and as he slowly approached it seemed like an oasis of flowers and fruit and silver a footman stood discreetly in the background half a dozen dogs of various breeds came trotting forward to meet him his wife still beautiful notwithstanding her fortyfive years had turned her pleasant face towards him and ella whom a great many society papers had singled out as being one of the most beautiful débutantes of the season was welcoming him with her usual lazy but wholly goodhumoured smile  daddy your habits are getting positively disgraceful she exclaimed mother and i have nearly finishedand our share of the postbag is most uninteresting please come and sit down tell us where you are going to shoot and whether youve had any letters this morning  lord ashleigh loitered for a moment to raise the covers from the dishes upon a side table afterwards he seated himself in the chair which the servant was holding for him  i am going out for an hour or two with fitzgerald he announced partridges are scarcely worth shooting yet but he has arranged a few drives over the hills as for my being latewell that has something to do with you young lady  ella looked at him with a sudden seriousness in her great eyes  daddy youve heard something  lord ashleigh pulled a bundle of letters from his pocket  i have he admitted  quick ella begged tell us all about it dont sit there dad looking so stolid cant you see i am dying to hear quick please  her father smiled glanced for a moment at the plate which had been passed to him from the side table approved of it and stretched out his hand for his cup  i heard this morning he said from your friend delarey he went into the matter very fully you shall read his letter presently the sum and substance of it all however is that for the first year of your musical training he adviseswhere do you think  dresden lady ashleigh suggested  munich paris ella put in breathlessly  all wrong lord ashleigh declared new york  there was a momentary silence ellas eyes were sparkling her mothers face had fallen  new york ella murmured there is wonderful music there and mr delarey knows it so well  lord ashleigh nodded portentously  i have not finished yet mr delarey wound up his letter by promising to cable me his final decision in the course of a few days this cablegram he went on drawing a little slip of blue paper from his pocket was brought to me this morning whilst i was shaving i found it a most inconvenient time as the lather  oh bother the lather father ella exclaimed read the cablegram or let me  her father smoothed it out before him and read      to lord ashleigh hamblin house dorset england      i find a magnificent programme arranged for at metropolitan     opera house this year have taken box for your daughter engaged     the best professor in the world and secured an apartment at the     leeland our most select and comfortable residential hotel     understand your brother is still in south america returning     early spring but will do our best to make your daughters year     of study as pleasant as possible advise her sail on saturday by     mauretania  on saturday ella almost screamed  new york lady ashleigh murmured disconsolately how impossible george  her husband handed over the letter and cablegram which ella at once pounced upon he then unfolded the local newspaper and proceeded to make an excellent breakfast when he had quite finished he lit a cigarette and rose a little abruptly to his feet as a car glided out of the stable yard and slowly approached the front door  i shall now he said leave you to talk over and discuss this matter for the rest of the day i believe you said dear he added turning to his wife that we were dining alone tonight  quite alone george lady ashleigh admitted we were to have gone to annerley castle but the duke is laid up somewhere in scotland  i remember her husband assented very well then at dinnertime tonight you can tell me your decision or rather we will discuss it together james he added turning to the footman tell robert i want my sixteenbore guns put in the car and tell him to be very careful about the cartridges  he disappeared through the french windows lady ashleigh was studying the letter stretched out before her her brows a little knitted her expression distressed ella had turned and was looking out westwards across the park towards the sea for a moment she dreamed of all the wonderful things that lay on the other side of that silver streak she saw inside the crowded opera house she felt the tense hush the thrill of excitement she heard the low sobbing of the violins she saw the stagesetting she heard the low notes of music creeping and growing till every pulse in her body thrilled with her one great enthusiasm when she turned back to the table her eyes were bright and there was a little flush upon her cheeks  youre not sorry mother she exclaimed  not really dear lady ashleigh answered resignedly   2  lord ashleigh who in many respects was a typical englishman of his class had a constitutional affection for small ceremonies an affection nurtured by his position as chairman of the county magistrates and president of the local unionist association after dinner that evening a meal which was served in the smaller library he cleared his throat and filled his glass with wine his manner as he addressed his wife and daughter was almost official  i am to take it i believe he began that you have finally decided ella to embrace our friend delareys suggestion and to leave us on saturday for new york  if you please ella murmured with glowing eyes i cant tell you how grateful i am to you both for letting me go  it is naturally a wrench to us lord ashleigh confessed especially as circumstances which you already know of prevent either your mother or myself from being with you during the first few months of your stay there you have very many friends in new york however and your mother tells me that there will be no difficulty about your chaperonage at the various social functions to which you will of course be bidden  i think that will be all right dad ella ventured  you will take your own maid with you of course lord ashleigh continued lenora is a good girl and i am sure she will look after you quite well but i have decided although it is a somewhat unusual step to supplement lenoras surveillance over your comfort by sending with you also as a sort of courier and general attendantwhom do you think well macdougal  lady ashleigh looked across the table with knitted brows  macdougal george why however will you spare him  we can easily lord ashleigh declared find a temporary butler macdougal has lived in new york for some years and you will doubtless find this a great advantage ella i hope that my suggestion pleases you  ella glanced over her shoulder at the two servants who were standing discreetly in the background her eyes rested upon the pale expressionless face of the man who during the last few years had enjoyed her fathers absolute confidence like many others of his class there seemed to be so little upon which to comment in his appearance so little room for surmise or analysis in his quiet negative features his studiously low voice his unexceptionable deportment yet for a moment a queer sense of apprehension troubled her was it true she wondered that she did not like the man she banished the thought almost as soon as it was conceived the very idea was absurd his manner towards her had always been perfectly respectful he seemed equally devoid of sex or character she withdrew her gaze and turned once more towards her father  do you think that you can really spare him daddy she asked and that it will be necessary  not altogether necessary i dare say lord ashleigh admitted on the other hand i feel sure that you will find him a comfort and it would be rather a relief to me to know that there is some one in touch with you all the time in whom i place absolute confidence i dare say i shall be very glad to see him back again at the end of the year but that is neither here nor there mr delarey has sent me the name of some bankers in new york who will honour your cheques for whatever money you may require  you are spoiling me daddy ella sighed  lord ashleigh smiled his hand had disappeared into the pocket of his dinnercoat  if you think so now he remarked i do not know what you will say to me presently what i am doing now ella i am doing with your mothers sanction and you must associate her with the gift which i am going to place in your keeping  the hand was slowly withdrawn from his pocket he laid upon the table a very familiar morocco case stamped with a coronet even before he touched the spring and the top flew open ella knew what was coming  our diamonds she exclaimed the ashleigh diamonds  the necklace lay exposed to view the wonderful stones flashing in the subdued light ella gazed at it speechless  in new york lord ashleigh continued it is the custom to wear jewellery in public more even than in this country the family pearls which i myself should have thought more suitable went as you know to your elder sister upon her marriage i am not rich enough to invest large sums of money in the purchase of precious stones yet on the other hand your mother and i feel that if you are to wear jewels at all we should like you to wear something of historic value jewels which are associated with the history of your own house allow me  he leaned forward with long capable fingers he fastened the necklace around his daughters neck it fell upon her bosom sparkling a little circular stream of fire against the background of her smooth white skin ella could scarcely speak her fingers caressed the jewels  it is our farewell present to you lord ashleigh declared i need not beg you to take care of them i do not wish to dwell upon their value money means naturally little to you and when i tell you that a firm in london offered me sixty thousand pounds for them for an american client i only mention it so that you may understand that they are likely to be appreciated in the country to which you are going  she clasped his hands  father she cried you are too good to me it is all too wonderful i shall be afraid to wear them  lord ashleigh smiled reassuringly  my dear he said you will be quite safe i should advise you to keep them as a rule in the strong box which you will doubtless find in the hotel to which you are going but for all ordinary occasions you need feel i am convinced no apprehension you can understand now i dare say another reason why i am sending macdougal with you as well as lenora  ella impelled by some curious impulse which she could not quite understand glanced quickly around to where the manservant was standing for once she had caught him unawares for once she saw something besides the perfect automaton his eyes instead of being fixed at the back of his masters chair were simply riveted upon the stones his mouth was a little indrawn to her there was a curious change in his expression his cheekbones seemed to have become higher the pupils of his eyes had narrowed even while she looked at him he moistened a little his dry lips with the tip of his tongue then as though conscious of her observation all these things vanished he advanced to the table respectfully refilled his masters glass from the decanter of port and retreated again ella withdrew her eyes a queer little feeling of uneasiness disturbed her for the moment it passed however as in glancing away her attention was once more attracted by the sparkle of the jewels upon her bosom lord ashleigh raised his glass  our love to you dear he said take care of the jewels but take more care of yourself your mother and i will come to new york as soon as we can in the meantime dont forget us amidst the hosts of your new friends and the joy of your new life  she gave them each a hand she stooped first to one side and then to the other kissing them both tenderly  i shall never forget she exclaimed her voice breaking a little there could never be any one else in the world like you twoand please may i go to the lookingglass   3  the streets of new york were covered with a thin powdery snow as the very luxurious car of mrs delarey drew up outside the front of the leeland hotel a little after midnight ella leaned over and kissed her hostess  thank you dear ever so much for your delightful dinner she exclaimed and for bringing me home as for the music well i cant talk about it i am just going upstairs into my room to sit and think  dont sit up too late and spoil your pretty colour dear mrs delarey advised goodbye dont forget i am coming in to lunch with you tomorrow  the car rolled off ella a large umbrella held over her head by the doorkeeper stepped up the little strip of drugget which led into the softlywarmed hall of the leeland behind her came her maid lenora and macdougal who had been riding on the box with the chauffeur he paused for a moment to wipe the snow from his clothes as ella crossed the hall to the lift lenora turned towards him he whispered something in her ear for a moment she shook then she turned away and followed her mistress upstairs  arrived in her apartment ella threw herself with a little sigh of content into a big easychair before the fire her sittingroom was the last word in comfort and luxury a great bowl of pink roses arrived during her absence stood on the small table by her side lenora had just brought her chocolate and was busy making preparations in the bedroom adjoining ella gave herself up for a few moments to reverie the magic of the music was still in her blood she had made progress that very afternoon her master van haydn had spoken to her of her progressvan haydn who had never flattered a pupil in his life in a few weeks time her mother and father were coming out to her meanwhile she had made hosts of pleasant friends attentions of all sorts had been showered upon her she curled herself up in her chair it was good to be alive  a log stirred upon the fire she leaned forward lazily to replace it and then stopped short exactly opposite to her was a door which opened on to a back hall it was used only by the servants connected with the hotel and was usually kept locked just as she was in the act of leaning forward ella became conscious of a curious hallucination she sat looking at the handle with fascinated eyes then she called aloud to lenora  lenora come here at once  the maid hurried in from the next room ella pointed to the door  lenora look outside see if any one is on that landing i fancied that the door opened  the maid shook her head incredulously  i dont think so my lady she said no one but the waiter and the chambermaid who comes in to clean the apartment ever comes that way  she crossed the room and tried the handle then she turned towards her mistress in triumph  it is locked my lady she reported  ella rose to her feet and herself tried the handle it was as the maid had reported she however was not altogether reassured she was a young woman whose nerves were in a thoroughly healthy state and by no means given to imaginative fears she stood a little away looking at the handle it was almost impossible that she could have been mistaken her hands clasped for a moment the necklace which hung from her neck a queer presentiment of evil crept like a grey shadow over her  she looked at herself in the glassthe colour had left her cheeks she tried to laugh at her self  this is absurd she exclaimed lenora go down and ask macdougal to come up for a minute i am going to have this thing explained hurry theres a good girl  you are sure your ladyship doesnt mind being left the maid asked a little doubtfully  of course not ella replied with a laugh which was not altogether natural hurry along theres a good girl ill drink my chocolate while you are gone and get ready for bed but i must see macdougal before i undress  something of her mistresss agitation seemed to have become communicated to lenora her voice shook a little as she stepped into the elevator  where are you off to young lady the boy enquired  i want to go round to our quarters lenora explained her ladyship wants to speak to mr macdougal  hes gone out sure the elevator boy remarked shall i wait for you miss lenora he asked as they descended into the hall  do she begged i shant be more than a minute or two  she walked quickly to the back part of the hotel and ascended in another elevator to the wing in which the servants quarters were situated here she made her way along a corridor until she reached macdougals room she knocked and knocked again there was no answer she tried the door and found it was locked then she returned to the elevator and descended once more to the floor upon which her mistresss apartments were situated she opened the door of the suite without knocking and turned at once to the sittingroom  i am sorry my lady she began  then she stopped short the elevator boy who had had a little trouble with his starting apparatus and had not as yet descended heard the scream which broke from her lips and a fireman in an adjacent corridor came running up almost at the same moment lenora was on her knees by her mistresss side ella was still lying in the easychair in which she had been seated but her head was thrown back in an unnatural fashion there was a red mark just across her throat the small table by her side had been overturned and the chocolate was running in a little stream across the floor the elevator boy was the first to speak  holy shakes he exclaimed whats happened  cant you see lenora shrieked shes fainted and the diamondsthe diamonds have gone  the fireman was already at the telephone in less than a minute one of the managers from the office came running in lenora was dashing water into ellas still cold face  shes fainted she shrieked fetch a doctor some one the diamonds have gone  the young man was already at the telephone his hand shook as he took up the receiver he turned to the elevator boy  run across to number seventythreedoctor mortons he ordered dont you let any one come in fireman dont either of you say a word about this here exchange urgent call give me the policestationyes policestation dont be a fool girl he added under his breath you wont do any good throwing water on her like that let her alone for a moment yes manager leeland hotel speaking a murder and robbery have taken place in this hotel suite number fortythree i am there now nothing shall be touched send round this moment  the young man hung up the receiver lenora was filling the room with her shrieks he took her by the shoulder and pushed her back into a chair  shut up you fool he exclaimed you cant do any good making a noise like that  she said she saw the door handle turn lenora sobbed i went to fetch macdougal hed gone out when i came back she was therelike that  what door handle the manager asked  lenora pointed the young man crossed the room the lock was still in its place the door refused to yield as he turned around the doctor arrived he hurried at once to ellas side  hands still warm he muttered as he felt them my god its the double knot strangle  he bent over ella for several moments then he rose to his feet the door from outside had been opened once more a police inspector followed by a detective had entered  this is your affair gentlemen not mine the doctor said gravely the young lady is dead she has been cruelly strangled within the last five or ten minutes  the inspector turned around  lock the outside door he ordered his man has any one left the room mr marsham  no one the manager declared  who discovered her  the maid  lenora rose to her feet she seemed a little calmer but the healthy colour had all gone from her cheeks and her lips were twitching  her ladyship had just come in from the opera she said she was sitting in her easychair i was in the bedroom she looked toward the handle of that door she thought it moved she called me i tried it and found it fast locked she sent for mr macdougal  macdougal mr marsham explained is a confidential servant of lord ashleighs he was sent over here with lady ella  the inspector nodded  go on  i found mr macdougals door locked he must have gone out when i came back here i found this  the inspector made a careful examination of the room  tell me he enquired is this the young lady who owned the wonderful ashleigh diamonds  theyve gone lenora shrieked theyve been stolen she was wearing them when i left the room  the inspector turned to the telephone  mr marsham he said i am afraid this will be a difficult affair i am going to take the liberty of calling in an expert hello i want number one new york citymr sanford quest   4  there seemed to be nothing at all original in the methods pursued by the great criminologist when confronted with this tableau of death and robbery his remarks to the inspector were few and perfunctory he asked only a few languid questions of macdougal and lenora who were summoned to his presence  you had left the hotel i understand at the time when the crime occurred he asked the latter  macdougal grave and respectful made his answers with difficulty his voice was choked with emotion  i brought my mistress home from the opera sir i rode on the box with mrs delareys chauffeur after i had seen her safely in the hotel i went up to my room for two minutes and left the hotel by the back entrance  any one see you go  the doorkeeper sir and i passed a page upon the stairs  wasnt it rather late for you to go out  my days are a little dull here sir macdougal replied and my attendance is not required early in the morning i have made some friends in the city and i usually go out to a restaurant and have some supper  quite natural mr quest agreed that will do thanks  macdougal turned towards the door lenora was about to follow him but quest signed to her to remain  i should like to have a little conversation with you about your mistress he said to her pleasantly if you dont mind i will ask you to accompany me in my car i will send the man back with you  for a moment the girl stood quite still her face was already ghastly pale her eyes alone seemed to indicate some fresh fear  i will go to my rooms and put on my hat she said  quest pointed through the halfopen door  that will be your hat and coat upon the bed there wont it he remarked i am sorry to hurry you off but i have another appointment you will send of course for the young ladys friends he added turning to mr marsham and cable her people  there is nothing more you can do mr quest the hotel manager asked a little querulously this affair must be cleared up for the credit of my hotel  quest shrugged his shoulders he glanced through the open door to where lenora was arranging her coat with trembling fingers  there will be very little difficulty about that he said calmly if you are quite ready miss lenora is that your name  lenora is my name sir the girl replied  they descended in the elevator together and quest handed the girl into his car they drove quickly through the silent streets the snow had ceased to fall and the stars were shining brightly lenora shivered as she leaned back in her corner  you are cold i am afraid quest remarked never mind there will be a good fire in my study i shall only keep you for a few moments i dare not be away long just now as i have a very important case on  there is nothing more that i can tell you lenora ventured a little fearfully cant you ask me what you want to now as we go along  we have already arrived quest told her do you mind following me  she crossed the pavement and passed through the front door which quest was holding open for her they stepped into the little elevator and a moment or two later lenora was installed in an easychair in quests sittingroom in front of a roaring fire  lean back and make yourself comfortable quest invited as he took a chair opposite to her i must just look through these papers  the girl did as she was told she opened her coat the room was delightfully warm almost overheated a sense of rest crept over her for the first moment since the awful shock her nerves seemed quieter gradually she began to feel almost as though she were passing into sleep she started up but sank back again almost immediately she was conscious that quest had laid down the letters which he had been pretending to read his eyes were fixed upon her there was a queer new look in them a strange new feeling creeping through her veins was she going to sleep  quests voice broke an unnatural silence  you are anxious to telephone some one he said  you looked at both of the booths as we came through the hotel then you remembered i think that he would not be there yet telephone now the telephone is at your right hand you know the number  she obeyed almost at once she took the receiver from the instrument by her side  number 700 new york city  you will ask quest continued whether he is all right whether the jewels are safe  there was a brief silence then the girls voice  are you there james yes i am lenora are you safe have you the jewels where you are sure that you are safe no nothing fresh has happened  you are at the hotel quest said softly you are going to him  i cannot sleep she continued i am coming to you  she set down the receiver quest leaned a little more closely over her  you know where the jewels are hidden he said tell me where  her lips quivered she made no answer she turned uneasily in her chair  tell me the place quest persisted  there was still no response from the girl there were drops of perspiration on her forehead quest shrugged his shoulders slightly  very good he concluded you need not tell me only remember this at nine oclock tomorrow morning you will bring those jewels to this apartment rest quietly now i want you to go to sleep  she obeyed without hesitation quest watched for a moment her regular breathing then he touched a bell by his side laura entered almost at once  open the laboratory quest ordered then come back  without a word or a glance towards the sleeping figure she obeyed him it was a matter of seconds before she returned together they lifted and carried the sleeping girl out of the room across the landing into a larger apartment the contents of which were wrapped in gloom and mystery a single electric light was burning on the top of a square mirror fixed upon an easel towards this they carried the girl and laid her in an easychair almost opposite to it  the battery is just on the left laura whispered  quest nodded  give me the band  she turned away for a moment and disappeared in the shadows when she returned she carried a curved band of flexible steel quest took it from her attached it by means of a coil of wire to the battery and with firm soft fingers slipped it on to lenoras forehead then he stepped back a rare emotion quivered in his tone  shes a subject lauraim sure of it now for our great experiment  they watched lenora intently her face twitched uneasily but she did not open her eyes and her breathing continued regular quest bent over her  lenora he said slowly and firmly your mind is full of one subject you see your mistress in her chair by the fireside she is toying with her diamonds look again she lies there dead who was it entered the room lenora look look gaze into that mirror what do you see there  the girls eyes had opened they were fixed now upon the mirrordistended full of unholy things quest wiped a drop of perspiration from his forehead  try harder lenora he muttered his own breath labouring it is there in your brain look  laura for the first time showed signs of emotion she pointed towards the mirror quest was suddenly silent he seemed to have turned into a figure of stone for a single second the smooth surface of the mirror was obscured a room crept dimly like a picture into being a fire upon the hearth a girl leaning back in her chair a door in the background opened a man stole out he crept nearer to the girlhis eyes fixed upon the diamonds a thin silken cord twisted round his wrist suddenly she saw himtoo late his hand was upon her lipshis face seemed to start almost from the mirrorthen blackness                                       lenora opened her eyes she was still in the easychair before the fire  mr quest she faltered  he looked up from some letters which he had been studying  i am so sorry he said politely i really had forgotten that you were here but you knowthat you have been to sleep  she half rose to her feet she was perplexed uneasy  asleep she murmured have i and i dreamed a horrible dream have i been ringing anyone up on the telephone  not that i know of quest assured her as a matter of fact i was called downstairs to see one of my men soon after we got here  can i go now she asked  certainly quest replied to tell you the truth i find that i shall not need to ask you those questions after all a messenger from the policestation has been here he says they have come to the conclusion that a very wellknown gang of new york criminals are in this thing we know how to track them down all right  illustration sanford quest is called upon to clear the mystery of the murder of lord ashleighs daughter  illustration under the hypnotic influence of quest lenora reveals the strange disappearance of the jewels and the murder  i may go now then she repeated with immense relief  quest escorted the girl downstairs opened the front door blew his whistle and his car pulled up at the door  take this young lady he ordered wherever she wishes good night  the girl drove off quest watched the car disappear around the corner then he turned slowly back and made preparations for his adventure  number 700 new york he muttered half an hour later as he left his house beyond fourteenth streeta tough neighbourhood  he hesitated for a moment feeling the articles in his overcoat pocketa revolver in one a small piece of hard substance in the other then he stepped into his car which had just returned  where did you leave the young lady he asked the chauffeur  in broadway sir she left me and boarded a crosstown car  quest nodded approvingly  no finesse he sighed   5  sanford quest was naturally a person unaffected by presentiments or nervous fears of any sort yet having advanced a couple of yards along the hallway of the house which he had just entered without difficulty he came to a standstill oppressed with the sense of impending danger with his electric torch he carefully surveyed the dilapidated staircase in front of him the walls from which the paper hung down in depressinglooking strips the house was to all appearances uninhabited the door had yielded easily to his masterkey yet this was the house connected with number 700 new york the house to which lenora had come furthermore from the street outside he had seen a light upon the first floor instantly extinguished as he had climbed the steps  any one here he asked raising his voice a little  there was no direct response yet from somewhere upstairs he heard the half smothered cry of a woman he gripped his revolver in his fingers he was a fatalist and although for a moment he regretted having come singlehanded to such an obvious trap he prepared for his task he took a quick step forward the ground seemed to slip from beneath his feet he staggered wildly to recover himself and failed the floor had given from beneath him he was falling into blackness  the fall itself was scarcely a dozen feet he picked himself up his shoulder bruised his head swimming a little his electric torch was broken to pieces upon the stone floor he was simply in a black gulf of darkness suddenly a gleam of light shone down a trapdoor above his head was slid a few inches back the flare of an electric torch shone upon his face a mans mocking voice addressed him  not the great sanford quest this surely cannot be the greatest detective in the world walking so easily into the spiders web  any chance of getting out quest asked laconically  none was the bitter reply youve done enough mischief youre there to rot  why this animus against me my friend macdougal quest demanded you and i have never come up against one another before i didnt like the life you led in new york ten years ago or your friends but youve suffered nothing through me  if i let you go once more came the mans voice i know very well in what chair i shall be sitting before a month has passed i am james macdougal mr sanford quest and i have got the ashleigh diamonds and i have settled an old grudge if not of my own of one greater than you thats all a pleasant night to you  the door went down with a bang faintly as though indeed the footsteps belonged to some other world sanford quest heard the two leave the house then silence  a perfect oubliette he remarked to himself as he held a match over his head a moment or two later built for the purpose it must be the house we failed to find which bill taylor used to keep before he was shot smooth brick walls smooth brick floor only exit twelve feet above ones head human means apparently are useless science you have been my mistress all my days you must save my life now or lose an earnest disciple  he felt in his overcoat pocket and drew out the small hard pellet he gripped it in his fingers stood as nearly as possible underneath the spot from which he had been projected coolly swung his arm back and flung the black pebble against the sliding door the explosion which followed shook the very ground under his feet the walls cracked about him blue fire seemed to be playing around the blackness he jumped on one side barely in time to escape a shower of bricks for minutes afterwards everything around him seemed to rock he struck another match the whole of the roof of the place was gone by building a few bricks together he was easily able to climb high enough to swing himself on to the fragments of the hallway even as he accomplished this the door was thrown open and a crowd of people rushed in sanford quest emerged dusty but unhurt and touched a constable on his arm  arrest me he ordered i am sanford quest i must be taken at once to headquarters  that so mr quest stand on one side you loafers the man ordered pushing his way out  well have a taxicab quest decided  is there any one else in the house the policeman asked  not a soul quest answered  they found a cab without much difficulty it was five oclock when they reached the central policestation inspector french happened to be just going off duty he recognized quest with a little exclamation  got your man to bring me here quest explained so as to get away from the mob  say youve been in trouble the inspector remarked leading the way into his room  bit of an explosion thats all quest replied i shall be all right when youve lent me a clothesbrush  the ashleigh diamonds eh the inspector asked eagerly  i shall have them at nine oclock this morning sanford quest promised and hand you over the murderer somewhere around midnight  the inspector scratched his chin  from what i can hear about the young ladys friends he said its the murderer they are most anxious to see nabbed  theyll have him quest promised come round about halfpast nine and ill hand over the diamonds to start with  quest slept for a couple of hours had a bath and made a leisurely toilet at a quarter to nine he sat down to breakfast in his rooms  at nine oclock he told his servant a young lady will call bring her up  the door was suddenly opened lenora walked in quest glanced in surprise at the clock  my fault he exclaimed we are slow good morning miss lenora  she came straight to the table the servant at a sign from quest disappeared there were black rims around her eyes she seemed exhausted she laid a little packet upon the table quest opened it coolly the ashleigh diamonds flashed up at him he led lenora to a chair and rang the bell  prepare a bedroom upstairs he ordered ask miss roche to come here laura he added as his secretary entered will you look after this young lady she is in a state of nervous exhaustion  the girl nodded she understood she led lenora from the room quest resumed his breakfast a few minutes later inspector french was announced quest nodded in friendly manner  some coffee inspector  id rather have those diamonds the inspector replied  quest threw them lightly across the table  catch hold then  the inspector whistled  say thats bright work he acknowledged i believe i could have laid my hands on the man but it was the jewels that i was afraid of losing  just so quest remarked and now french will you be here please at midnight with three men armed  here the inspector repeated  quest nodded  our friend he said is going to be mad enough to walk into hell even when he finds out what he thinks has happened  it wasnt any of jimmys lot the inspector asked  sanford quest shook his head  french he said keep mum but it was the elderly family retainer macdougal i felt restless about him he has lost the girlhe was married to her bythebyeand the jewels no fear of his slipping away i shall have him here at the time i told you  youve a way of your own of doing these things mr quest the inspector admitted grudgingly  mostly luck quest replied take a cigar and so long inspector they want me to talk to chicago on another little piece of business                                       it was a few minutes before midnight when quest parted the curtains of a room on the ground floor of his house in georgia square and looked out into the snowwhite street then he turned around and addressed the figure lying as though asleep upon the sofa by the fire  lenora he said i am going out stay here if you please until i return  he left the room for a few moments there was a profound silence then a white face was pressed against the window there was a crash of glass a man covered with snow sprang into the apartment he moved swiftly to the sofa and something black and ugly swayed in his hand  so youve deceived me have you he panted handed over the jewels chucked me and given me the double cross anything to say  a piece of coal fell on to the grate not a sound came from the sofa macdougal leaned forward his white face distorted with passion the lifepreserver bent and quivered behind him cut the air with a swish and crashed full upon the head  the man staggered back the weapon fell from his fingers for a moment he was paralysed there was no blood upon his hand no crysilence inhuman unnatural he looked again then the lights flashed out all around him there were two detectives in the doorway their revolvers covering himsanford quest with lenora in the background in the sudden illumination macdougals horror turned almost to hysterical rage he had wasted his fury upon a dummy it was sawdust not blood which littered the couch  take him men quest ordered hands up macdougal your numbers up better take it quietly  the handcuffs were upon him before he could move he was trying to speak but the words somehow choked in his mouth  you can send a wireless to lord ashleigh quest continued turning to french tell him that the diamonds have been recovered and that his daughters murderer is arrested  what about the young woman the inspector asked  lenora stood in an attitude of despair her head downcast she had turned a little away from macdougal her hands were outstretched it was as though she were expecting the handcuffs  you can let her alone sanford quest said quietly a wife cannot give evidence against her husband and besides i need her she is going to work for me  macdougal was already at the door between the two detectives he swung around his voice was calm almost clearcalm with the concentration of hatred  you are a wonderful man mr sanford quest he said make the most of your triumph your time is nearly up  keep him for a moment sanford quest ordered you have friends then macdougal who will avenge you eh  i have no friends macdougal replied but there is one coming whose wit and cunning science and skill are allconquering he will brush you away sanford quest like a fly wait a few weeks  you interest me quest murmured tell me some more about this great master  i shall tell you nothing macdougal replied you will hear nothing you will know nothing suddenly you will find yourself opposed you will struggleand then the end it is certain  they led him away only lenora remained sobbing quest went up to her laid his hand upon her shoulder  youve had a rough time lenora he said with strange gentleness perhaps the brighter days are coming  illustration lord ashleigh accuses lenora of being implicated in the crime but quest decides to the contrary  illustration ian macdougal is given a life sentence for the murder of the daughter of lord ashleigh     chapter iii  the hidden hands   1  sanford quest and lenora stood side by side upon the steps of the courthouse waiting for the automobile which had become momentarily entangled in a string of vehicles a little crowd of people were elbowing their way out on to the sidewalk the faces of most of them were still shadowed by the three hours of tense drama from which they had just emerged quest who had lit a cigar watched them curiously  no need to go into court he remarked i could have told you from the look of these people that macdougal had escaped the death sentence they have paid their moneyor rather their time and they have been cheated of the one supreme thrill  imprisonment for life seems terrible enough lenora whispered shuddering  cant see the sense of keeping such a man alive myself quest declared with purposeful brutality it was a cruel murder fiendishly committed  lenora shivered quest laid his fingers for a moment upon her wrist his voice though still firm became almost kind  never be afraid lenora he said to admit the truth come we have finished with macdougal now imprisonment for life will keep him from crossing your path again  lenora sighed she was almost ashamed of her feeling of immense relief  i am very sorry for him she murmured i wish there were something one could do  there is nothing quest replied shortly and if there were you would not be allowed to undertake it you didnt happen to notice the way he looked at you once or twice did you  once more the terror shone out of lenoras eyes  you are right she faltered i had forgotten  they were on the point of crossing the pavement towards the automobile when quest felt a touch upon his shoulder he turned and found lord ashleigh standing by his side quest glanced towards lenora  run and get in the car he whispered i will be there in a moment  she dropped her veil and hastened across the pavement the englishmans face grew sterner as he watched her  macdougals accomplice he muttered we used to trust that girl too  she had nothing whatever to do with the actual crime believe me quest assured him besides you must remember that it was really through her that the man was brought to justice  i harbour no illfeelings towards the girl lord ashleigh replied nevertheless the sight of her for a moment was disconcerting i would not have stopped you just now mr quest but my brother is very anxious to renew his acquaintance with you i think you met years ago  sanford quest held out his hand to the man who had been standing a little in the background lord ashleigh turned towards him  this is mr quest edgar you may remember my brotherprofessor ashleighas a man of science quest he has just returned from south america  the two shook hands curiously diverse in type in expression in all the appurtenances of manhood quest was dark with no sign of greyness in his closelytrimmed black hair his face was an epitome of forcefulness his lips hard his eyes brilliant he was dressed with the utmost care his manner was selfpossessed almost to a fault the professor on the other hand though his shoulders were broad lost much of his height and presence through a very pronounced stoop his face was pale his mouth sensitive his smile almost womanly in its sweetness his clothes and a general air of abstraction seemed rather to indicate the clerical profession his forehead however disclosed as he lifted his hat was the forehead of a scholar  i am very proud to make your acquaintance again professor quest said glad to know too that you hadnt quite forgotten me  my dear sir the professor declared as he released the others hand with seeming reluctance i have thought about you many times your doings have always been of interest to me though i have been lost to the world of civilisation for so long i have correspondents here in new york to keep me in touch with all that is interesting you have made a great name for yourself mr quest you are one of those who have made science your handmaiden in a wonderful profession  you are very kind professor quest observed flicking the ash from his cigar  not at all the other insisted not at all i have the greatest admiration for your methods  i am sorry quest remarked that our first meeting here should be under such distressing circumstances  the professor nodded gravely he glanced towards his brother who was talking to an acquaintance a few feet away  it has been a most melancholy occasion he admitted his voice shaking with emotion still i felt it my duty to support my brother through the trial apart from that you know mr quest a scene such as we have just witnessed has a peculiari might almost say fascination for me the professor continued with a little glint in his eyes you as a man of science can realise i am sure that the criminal side of human nature is always of interest to an anthropologist  that must be so of course quest agreed glancing towards the automobile in which lenora was seated if youll excuse me professor i think i must be getting along we shall meet again i trust  one moment the professor begged eagerly tell me mr questi want your honest opinion what do you think of my ape  of your what quest enquired dubiously  of my anthropoid ape which i have just sent to the museum you know my claim but perhaps you would prefer to postpone your final decision until after you have examined the skeleton itself  a light broke in upon the criminologist  of course he exclaimed for the moment professor i couldnt follow you you are talking about the skeleton of the ape which you brought home from south america and which you have presented to the museum here  naturally the professor assented with mild surprise to what else i am stating my case mr quest in the north american review next month i may tell you however as a fellow scientist the great and absolute truth my claim is incontestable my skeleton will prove to the world without a doubt the absolute truth of darwins great theory  that so  you must go and see it the professor insisted keeping by quests side as the latter moved towards the automobile you must go and see it mr quest it will be on view to the public next week but in the meantime i will telephone to the curator you must mention my name you shall be permitted a special examination  very kind of you quest murmured  we shall meet again soon i hope the professor concluded cordially good morning mr quest  the two men shook hands and quest took his seat by lenoras side in the automobile the professor rejoined his brother  george he exclaimed as they walked off together i am disappointed in mr quest i am very disappointed indeed you will not believe what i am going to tell you but it is the truth he could not conceal it from me he takes no interest whatever in my anthropoid ape  neither do i the other replied grimly  the professor sighed as he hailed a taxicab  you my dear fellow he said gravely are naturally not in the frame of mind for the consideration of these great subjects besides you have no scientific tendencies but in sanford quest i am disappointed i expected his enthusiasmi may say that i counted upon it  i dont think that quest has much of that quality to spare his brother remarked for anything outside his own criminal hunting  they entered the taxicab and were driven almost in silence to the professors homea large rambling old house situated in somewhat extensive but illkept grounds on the outskirts of new york the englishman glanced around him as they passed up the drive with an expression of disapproval  a more untidylooking place than yours edgar i never saw he declared your grounds have become a jungle dont you keep any gardeners  the professor smiled  i keep other things he said serenely there is something in my garden which would terrify your nice scotch gardeners into fits if they found their way here to do a little tidying up come into the library and ill give you one of my choice cigars heres craig waiting to let us in any news craig  the manservant in plain clothes who admitted them shook his head  nothing has happened sir he replied the telephone is ringing in the study now though  i will answer it myself the professor declared bustling off  he hurried across the bare landing and into an apartment which seemed to be half museum half library there were skeletons leaning in unexpected corners strange charts upon the walls a wilderness of books and pamphlets in all manner of unexpected places mingled with quaintlycarved curios gods from west african temples implements of savage warfare butterfly nets it was a room which lord ashleigh was never able to enter without a shudder  the professor took up the receiver from the telephone his hello was mild and enquiring he had no doubt that the call was from some admiring disciple the change in his face as he listened however was amazing his lips began to twitch an expression of horrified dismay overspread his features his first reply was almost incoherent he held the receiver away from him and turned towards his brother  george he gasped the greatest tragedy in the world has happened my ape is stolen  his brother looked at him blankly  your ape is stolen he repeated  the skeleton of my anthropoid ape the professor continued his voice growing alike in sadness and firmness it is the curator of the museum who is speaking they have just opened the box it has lain for two days in an anteroom it is empty  lord ashleigh muttered something a little vague the theft of a skeleton scarcely appeared to his unscientific mind to be a realisable thing the professor turned back to the telephone  mr francis he said i cannot talk to you i can say nothing i shall come to you at once i am on the point of starting your news has overwhelmed me  he laid down the receiver he looked around him like a man in a nightmare  the taxicab is still waiting sir craig reminded him  that is most fortunate the professor pronounced i remember now that i had no change with which to pay him i must go back look after my brother and craig telephone at once to mr sanford quest ask him to meet me at the museum in twenty minutes tell him that nothing must stand in the way do you hear  the man hesitated there was protest in his face  mr sanford quest sir he muttered as he followed his master down the hall  the great criminologist the professor explained eagerly certainly why do you hesitate  i was wondering sir craig began  the professor waved his servant on one side  do as you are told he ordered do as you are told craig you othersyou do not realise you cannot understand what this means tell the taxi man to drive to the museum i am overcome  the taxicab man drove off glad enough to have a return fare in about halfanhours time the professor strode up the steps of the museum and hurried into the office there was a little crowd of officials there whom the curator at once dismissed he rose slowly to his feet his manner was grave but bewildered  professor he said we will waste no time in words look here  he threw open the door of an anteroom behind his office the apartment was unfurnished except for one or two chairs in the middle of the uncarpeted floor was a long wooden box from which the lid had just been pried  yesterday as you know from my note the curator proceeded i was away i gave orders that your case should be placed here and i myself should enjoy the distinction of opening it an hour ago i commenced the task that is what i found  the professor gazed blankly at the empty box  nothing left except the smell a voice from the open doorway remarked  they glanced around quest was standing there and behind him lenora the professor welcomed them eagerly  this is mr quest the great criminologist he explained to the curator come in mr quest let me introduce you to mr francis the curator of the museum ask him what questions you will mr quest you have the opportunity of earning the undying gratitude of a brother scientist if my skeleton cannot be recovered the work of years is undone  quest strolled thoughtfully around the room glancing out of each of the windows in turn he kept close to the wall and when he had finished he drew out a magnifyingglass from his pocket and made a brief examination of the box then he asked a few questions of the curator pointed out one of the windows to lenora and whispered a few directions to her she at once produced what seemed to be a footrule from the bag which she was carrying and hurried into the garden  a little invention of my own for measuring footprints quest explained not much use here i am afraid  what do you think of the affair so far mr quest the professor asked eagerly  the criminologist shook his head  incomprehensible he confessed can you think bythebye of any other motive for the theft besides scientific jealousy  there could be no other the professor declared sadly and it is alas too prevalent i have had to suffer from it all my life  quest stood over the box for a moment or two and looked once more out of the window presently lenora returned she carried in her hand a small object which she brought silently to quest he glanced at it in perplexity the professor peered over his shoulder  it is the little finger he criedthe little finger of my ape  quest held it away from him critically  from which hand he asked  the right hand  quest examined the fastenings of the window before which he had paused during his previous examination he turned away with a shrug of the shoulders  see you later mr ashleigh he concluded laconically nothing more to be done at present  the professor followed him to the door  mr quest he said his voice broken with emotion it is the work of my lifetime of which i am being robbed you will use your best efforts you will spare no expense i am rich your fee you shall name yourself  i shall do my best quest promised to find the skeleton come lenora good morning gentlemen                                       with his new assistant quest walked slowly from the museum and turned towards his home  make anything of this lenora he asked her  she smiled  of course not she answered it looks as though the skeleton had been taken away through that window  quest nodded  marvellous he murmured  you are making fun of me she protested  not i but you see my young friend the point is this who in their senses would want to steal an anthropoid skeleton except a scientific man and if a scientific man stole it out of sheer jealousy why in thunder couldnt he be content with just mutilating it which would have destroyed its value just as wellwhats that  he stopped short a newsboy thrust the paper at them quest glanced at the headlines lenora clutched at his arm together they read in great black type        escape of convicted prisoner      macdougal on his way to prison       grapples with sheriff and jumps         from train still at large           though searched for by             posse of police   2  the windows of mrs rheinholdts town house were ablaze with light a crimson drugget stretched down the steps to the curbstone a long row of automobiles stood waiting through the wideflung doors was visible a pleasant impression of flowers and light and luxury in the nearer of the two large reception rooms mrs rheinholdt herself a woman dark handsome and in the prime of life was standing receiving her guests by her side was her son whose twentyfirst birthday was being celebrated  i wonder whether that professor of yours will come she remarked as the stream of incoming guests slackened for a moment id love to have him here if it were only for a moment every ones talking about him and his work in south america  he hates receptions the boy replied but he promised hed come i never thought when he used to drill science into us at the lectures that he was going to be such a tremendous big pot  mrs rheinholdts plump fingers toyed for a moment complacently with the diamonds which hung from her neck  you can never tell in a world like this she murmured thats why i make a point of being civil to everybody your laundry woman may become a multimillionaire or your singing master a caruso and then just while their months on every one is crazy to meet them its the professors month just now  here he is mother the young man exclaimed suddenly good old boy i thought hed keep his word  mrs rheinholdt assumed her most encouraging and condescending smile as she held out both hands to the professor he came towards her stooping a little more than usual his mouth had drooped a little and there were signs of fatigue in his face nevertheless his answering smile was as delightful as ever  this is perfectly sweet of you professor mrs rheinholdt declared we scarcely ventured to hope that you would break through your rule but philip was so looking forward to have you come you were his favourite master at lectures you know and nowwell of course you have the scientific world at your feet later on in the evening professor she added watching some very important newcomers you will tell me all about your anthropoid ape wont you philip look after mr ashleigh dont let him go far away  mrs rheinholdt breathed a sigh of relief as she greeted her new arrivals  professor ashleigh brother of lord ashleigh you know she explained this is the first house he has been to since his return from south america youve heard all about those wonderful discoveries of course  the professor made himself universally agreeable in a mild way and his presence created even more than the sensation which mrs rheinholdt had hoped for in her desire to show him ample honour she seldom left his side  i am going to take you into my husbands study she suggested later on in the evening he has some specimens of beetles  beetles the professor declared with some excitement occupied precisely two months of my time while abroad by all means mrs rheinholdt  we shall have to go quite to the back of the house she explained as she led him along the darkened passage  the professor smiled acquiescently his eyes rested for a moment upon her necklace  you must really permit me mrs rheinholdt he exclaimed to admire your wonderful stones i am a judge of diamonds and those three or four in the centre are i should imagine unique  she held them out to him the professor laid the end of the necklace gently in the palm of his hand and examined them through a hornrimmed eyeglass  they are wonderful he murmuredwonderful why  he turned away a little abruptly they had reached the back of the house and a door from the outside had just been opened a man had crossed the threshold with a coat over his arm and was standing now looking at them  how extraordinary the professor remarked is that you craig  for a moment there was no answer the servant was standing in the gloom of an unlit portion of the passage his eyes were fixed curiously upon the diamonds which the professor had just been examining he seemed paler even than usual  yes sir he replied there is a rain storm so i ventured to bring your mackintosh  very thoughtful the professor murmured approvingly i have a weakness he went on turning to his hostess for always walking home after an evening like this in the daytime i am content to ride at night i have the fancy always to walk  we dont walk half enough mrs rheinholdt sighed glancing down at her somewhat portly figure dixon she added turning to the footman who had admitted craig take professor ashleighs servant into the kitchen and see that he has something before he leaves for home now professor if you will come this way  they reached a little room in the far corner of the house mrs rheinholdt apologised as she switched on the electric lights  it is a queer little place to bring you to she said but my husband used to spend many hours here and he would never allow anything to be moved you see the specimens are in these cases  the professor nodded his general attitude towards the forthcoming exhibition was merely one of politeness as the first case was opened however his manner completely changed without taking the slightest further notice of his hostess he adjusted a pair of hornrimmed spectacles and commenced to mumble eagerly to himself mrs rheinholdt who did not understand a word strolled around the apartment yawned and finally interrupted a little stream of eulogies not a word of which she understood concerning a green beetle with yellow spots  i am so glad you are interested professor she said if you dont mind i will rejoin my guests you will find a shorter way back if you keep along the passage straight ahead and come through the conservatory  certainly with pleasure the professor agreed without glancing up  his hostess sighed as she turned to leave the room she left the door ajar the professors face was almost touching the glass case in which reposed the green beetle with yellow spots                                       mrs rheinholdts reception notwithstanding the temporary absence of its presiding spirit was without doubt an unqualified success in one of the distant rooms the younger people were dancing there were bridge tables all of which were occupied and for those who preferred the more oldfashioned pastime of conversation amongst luxurious surroundings there was still ample space and opportunity philip rheinholdt with a pretty young débutante upon his arm came out from the dancing room and looked around amongst the little knots of people  i wonder where mother is he remarked  looking after some guests somewhere for certain the girl replied your mother is so wonderful at entertaining philip  its the hobby of her life he declared never so happy as when she can get hold of somebody every ones talking about and show him off cant think what shes done with herself now though she told me  the young man broke off in the middle of his sentence he too like many others in the room felt a sudden thrill almost of horror at the sound which rang without warning upon their earsa womans cry a cry of fear and horror repeated again and again there was a little rush towards the curtained space which led into the conservatories before even however the quickest could reach the spot the curtains were thrown back and mrs rheinholdt her hands clasping her neck her splendid composure a thing of the past a panicstricken terrified woman stumbled into the room she seemed on the point of collapse somehow or other they got her into an easychair  my jewels she cried my diamonds  what do you mean mother philip rheinholdt asked quickly have you lost them  stolen mrs rheinholdt shrieked stolen there in the conservatory  they gazed at her openmouthed incredulous then a still quiet voice from the outside of the little circle intervened  instruct your servants mr rheinholdt to lock and bar all the doors of the house the professor suggested no one must leave it until we have heard your mothers story  the young man obeyed almost mechanically there was a general exodus of servants from the room some one had brought mrs rheinholdt a glass of champagne she sipped it and gradually recovered her voice  i had just taken the professor into the little room my husband used to call the museum she explained her voice still shaking with agitation i left him there to examine some specimens of beetles i thought that i would come back through the conservatory which is the quickest way i was about halfway across it when suddenly i heard the switch go behind me and all the electric lights were turned out i couldnt imagine what had happened while i hesitated i sawi saw  she broke down again there was no doubt about the genuineness of her terror she seemed somehow to have shrunken into the semblance of a smaller woman the pupils of her eyes were distended she was white almost to the lips when she recommenced her story her voice was fainter  i saw a pair of handsjust handsno armsnothing but handscome out of the darkness they gripped me by the throat i suppose it was just for a second i thinki lost consciousness for a moment although i was still standing up the next thing i remember is that i found myself shrieking and running hereand the jewels had gone  you saw no one her son asked incredulously you heard nothing  i heard no footsteps i saw no one mrs rheinholdt repeated  the professor turned away  if you will allow me he begged i am going to telephone to my friend mr sanford quest the criminologist an affair so unusual as this might attract him you will excuse me  the professor hurried from the room they brought mrs rheinholdt more champagne and she gradually struggled back to something like her normal self the dancing had stopped every one was standing about in little groups discussing the affair the men had trooped towards the conservatory but the professor met them on the portals  illustration confess thy sins my good man  illustration the black box is introduced into the story  i suggest he said courteously that we leave the conservatory exactly as it is until the arrival of mr sanford quest it will doubtless aid him in his investigations if nothing is disturbed all the remaining doors are locked so that no one can escape if by any chance they should be hiding  they all agreed without dissent and there was a general movement towards the buffet to pass the time until the coming of mr sanford quest the professor met the great criminologist and his assistant in the hall upon their arrival he took the former at once by the arm  mr quest he began in a sense i must apologise for my peremptory message i am well aware that an ordinary jewel robbery does not interest you but in this case the circumstances are extraordinary i ventured therefore to summon your aid  sanford quest nodded shortly  as a rule he said i do not care to take up one affair until i have a clean slate theres your skeleton still bothering me professor however wheres the lady who was robbed  i will take you to her the professor replied mrs rheinholdts story by frequent repetition had become a little more coherent a trifle more circumstantial the perfection of simplicity and utterly incomprehensible quest listened to it without remark and finally made his way to the conservatory he requested mrs rheinholdt to walk with him through the door by which she had entered and stop at the precise spot where the assault had been made upon her there were one or two plants knocked down from the tiers on the righthand side and some disturbance in the mould where some large palms were growing quest and lenora together made a close investigation of the spot afterwards quest walked several times to each of the doors leading into the gardens  there are four entrances altogether he remarked as he lit a cigar and glanced around the place two lead into the gardensone is locked and the other isntone connects with the back of the housethe one through which you came mrs rheinholdt and the other leads into your reception room into which you passed after the assault i shall now be glad if you will permit me to examine the gardens outside for a few minutes alone with my assistant if you please  for almost a quarter of an hour quest and lenora disappeared they all looked eagerly at the criminologist on his return but his face was sphinxlike he turned to mrs rheinholdt who with her son the butler and the professor were the only occupants of the conservatory  it seems to me he remarked that from the back part of the house the quickest way to reach mayton avenue would be through this conservatory and out of that door there is a path leading from just outside straight to a gate in the wall does any one that you know of use this means of exit  mrs rheinholdt shook her head  the servants might occasionally she remarked doubtfully but not on nights when i am receiving  the butler stepped forward he was looking a little grave  i ought perhaps to inform you madam and mr quest he said that i did only a short time ago suggest to the professors servantthe man who brought your mackintosh sir he added turning to the professorthat he could if he chose make use of this means of leaving the house mr craig is a personal friend of mine and a member of a very select little club we have for social purposes  did he follow your suggestion sanford quest asked  of that i am not aware sir the butler replied i left mr craig with some refreshment expecting that he would remain until my return but a few minutes later i discovered that he had left i will enquire in the kitchen if anything is known as to his movements  he hurried off quest turned to the professor  has he been with you long this man craig professor he asked  the professors smile was illuminating his manner simple but convincing  craig he asserted is the best servant the most honest mortal who ever breathed he would go any distance out of his way to avoid harming a fly i cannot even trust him to procure for me the simplest specimens of insect or animal life apart from this he is a man of some property which he has no idea what to do with he is i think i may say too devoted to me to dream of ever leaving my service  you think it would be out of the question then quest asked to associate him with the crime  the professors confidence was sublime  i could more readily associate you myself or young mr rheinholdt here with the affair he declared  his words carried weight the little breath of suspicion against the professors servant faded away in a moment or two the butler returned  it appears madam he announced that mr craig left when there was only one person in the kitchen he said goodnight and closed the door behind him it is impossible to say therefore by which exit he left the house but personally i am convinced that knowing of the reception here tonight he would not think of using the conservatory  most unlikely i should say the professor murmured craig is a very shy man he is at all times at your disposal mr quest if you should desire to question him  quest nodded absently  my assistant and i he announced would be glad to make a further examination of the conservatory if you will kindly leave us alone  they obeyed without demur quest took a seat and smoked calmly with his eyes fixed upon the roof lenora went back to her examination of the overturned plants the mould and the whole ground within the immediate environs of the assault she abandoned the search at last however and came back to quests side he threw away his cigar and rose  nothing there he asked laconically  not a thing lenora admitted  quest led the way towards the door  lenora he decided we are up against something big theres a new hand at work somewhere  no theories yet mr quest she asked smiling  not the ghost of one he admitted gloomily                                       along the rainswept causeway of mayton avenue keeping close to the shelter of the houses his mackintosh turned up to his ears his hands buried in his pockets a man walked swiftly along at every block he hesitated and looked around him his manner was cautious almost furtive once the glare of an electric light fell upon his face a face pallid with fear almost hopeless with despair he walked quickly yet he seemed to have little idea as to his direction suddenly he paused he was passing a great building brilliantly lit for a moment he thought that it was some place of entertainment the thought of entering seemed to occur to him then he felt a firm touch upon his arm a man in uniform spoke to him  step inside brother he invited earnestly almost eagerly notwithstanding his monotonous nasal twang step inside and find peace step inside and the lord will help you throw your burden away on the threshold  the mans first impulse at being addressed had seemed to be one of terror then he recognised the uniform and hesitated the light which streamed out from the building seemed warm and pleasant the rain was coming down in sheets they were singing a hymn unmusical unaccompanied yet something in the unison of those human voices one qualitythe quality of earnestness of faithseemed to make an irresistible appeal to the terrified wanderer slowly he moved towards the steps the man took him by the arm and led him in there were the best part of a hundred people taking their places after the singing of the hymn a girl was standing up before them on a platform she was commencing to speak but suddenly broke off she held out her arms towards where the professors confidential servant stood hesitating  come and tell us your sins she called out come and have them forgiven come and start a new life in a new world there is no one here who thinks of the past come and seek forgiveness  for a moment this waif from the rainswamped world hesitated the light of an infinite desire flashed in his eyes then he dropped his head these things might be for others for him there was no hope he shook his head to the girl but sank into the nearest seat and on to his knees  he repents the girl called out some day he will come brothers and sisters we will pray for him  the rain dashed against the windows the only other sound from outside was the clanging of the street cars the girls voice frenzied exhorting almost hysterical pealed out to the roof at every pause the little gathering of men and women groaned in sympathy the mans frame was shaken with sobs     chapter iv  the pocket wireless   1  mr sanford quest sat in his favourite easychair his cigar inclined towards the left hand corner of his mouth his attention riveted upon a small instrument which he was supporting upon his knee so far as his immobile features were capable of expression they betrayed now in the slight parting of his lips and the added brightness of his eyes symptoms of a lively satisfaction he glanced across the room to where lenora was bending over her desk  weve done it this time young woman he declared triumphantly its all ok working like a little peach  lenora rose and came towards him she glanced at the instrument which quest was fitting into a small leather case  is that the pocket wireless  he nodded  ive had morrison out at harlem all the morning to test it he told her ive sent him at least halfadozen messages from this easychair and got the replies how are you getting on with the code  not so badly for a stupid person lenora replied im not nearly so quick as laura of course but i could make a message out if i took time over it  laura who had been busy with some papers at the further end of the room came over and joined them  say its a dandy little affair that mr quest she exclaimed i had a try with it a day or so ago jim spoke to me from fifth avenue  weve got it tuned to a shade now quest declared equipped with this simple little device you can speak to me from anywhere up to ten or a dozen miles what are you working on this morning laura  same old stunt the girl replied i have been reading up the records of the savants of new york from what i can make out about them it doesnt seem to me that theres one amongst the whole bunch likely to have pluck enough to tamper with the professors skeleton  quest frowned a little gloomily he rose to his feet and moved restlessly about the room  say girls he confessed this is the first time in my life i have been in a fix like this two cases on hand and nothing doing with either of them criminologist indeed i guess id better go over to england and take a job at scotland yard thats about what im fit for whose box is this  quest had paused suddenly in front of an oak sideboard which stood against the wall occupying a position upon it of some prominence was a small black box whose presence there seemed to him unfamiliar laura came over to his side and looked at it also in puzzled fashion  never saw it before in my life she answered say kid is this yours she added turning to lenora  lenora shook her head she too examined it a little wonderingly  it wasnt there a short time ago i brought a duster and went over the sideboard myself  quest grunted  hm no one else has been in the room and it hasnt been empty for more than ten minutes he remarked well lets see whats inside any way  just be careful mr quest laura advised i dont get that box at all  quest pushed it with his forefinger  no bomb inside any way he remarked here goes  he lifted off the lid there was nothing in the interior but a sheet of paper folded up quest smoothed it out with his hand they all leaned over and read the following words written in an obviously disguised hand      you have embarked on a new studyanthropology what     characteristic strikes you most forcibly in connection with it     cunning the necklace might be where the skeleton is why not     begin at the beginning  the note was unsigned but in the spot where a signature might have been there was a rough pen drawing of two hands with fingers extended talon fashion menacingly as though poised to strike at some unseen enemy quest after their first moment of stupefaction whistled softly  the hands he muttered  what hands lenora asked  the hands that gripped mrs rheinholdt by the throat he reminded them dont you remember hands without any arms  there was another brief almost stupefied silence then laura broke into speech  what i want to know is she demanded who brought the thing here  a most daring exploit any way quest declared if we could answer your question laura we could solve the whole riddle we are up against something and no mistake  lenora shivered a little the mystery of the thing terrified her the mystery which only stimulated her two companions  the hand which placed that box here quest continued slowly is capable of even more wonderful things we must be cautious hello  the door had opened the professor stood upon the threshold he carried his soft felt hat in his hand he bowed to the two young women courteously  i trust that i have done right in coming up he enquired  quite right professor quest assured him they know well enough downstairs that i am always at liberty to you come in  i am so anxious to learn the professor continued eagerly whether there is any newsof my skeleton  not yet professor i am sorry to say quest replied come in and shut the door  the professor was obviously struggling with his disappointment he did not however at once close the door  there is a young lady here he said who caught me up upon the landing she too i believe wishes to see you my manners suffered i fear from my eagerness to hear from your own lips if there was anything fresh i should have allowed her to precede me  he threw open the door and stood on one side a young woman came a little hesitatingly into the room her hair was plainly brushed back and she wore the severe dress of the salvation army nothing however could conceal the fact that she was a remarkably sweet and attractivelooking young person  want to see me young lady quest asked  she held out a book  my name is miss quigg she said i want to ask you for a subscription to our funds  quest frowned a little  i dont care about this housetohouse visitation he remarked  it is only once a year that we come the girl pleaded and we only go to people who we know can afford to help us and who we believe can appreciate our work you know so much of the darker side of new york mr quest wherever you go you must find signs of our labours even if i put on one side for a moment the bare religious question think how much we do for the good and the welfare of the poor people  quest nodded  thats all right he admitted you reach the outcasts all right theres many a one you save whom you had better leave to die but here and there no doubt you set one of them on their legs again whos had bad luck very well miss quigg you shall have a donation i am busy today but call at the same hour tomorrow and my secretary here shall have a cheque ready for you  the girl smiled her gratitude  you are very kind indeed mr quest she said simply i will be here  the professor laid his hand upon her arm as she passed he had been watching her with curious intentness  young lady he observed you seem very much in earnest about your work  it is only the people in earnest sir she answered who can do any good in the world my work is worth being in earnest about  will you forgive an old mans question the professor continued i am one of the men of the world who are in earnest my life is dedicated to science science is at once my religion and my life it seems to me that you and i have something in common you too move in the unusual ways your life is dedicated to doing good amongst the unworthy of your sex whether my brain approves of your efforts or not you compel my admirationmy most respectful admiration may i too be permitted  he drew out a pocketbook and passed over towards her a little wad of notes she took them without a moments hesitation her eyes as she thanked him were filled with gratitude  it is so kind of you she murmured we never have any hesitation in accepting money may i know your name  it is not necessary the professor answered you can enter me he added as he held open the door for her as a friendor would you prefer a pseudonym  a pseudonym if you please she begged we have so many who send us sums of money as friends anything will do  the professor glanced around the room  what pseudonym shall i adopt he ruminated shall i say that an oak sideboard gives you five hundred dollars or a chippendale sofa or he added his eyes resting for a moment upon the little box a black box  the two girls from the other side of the table started even quest swung suddenly around the professor as though pleased with his fancy nodded as his fingers played with the lid  yes that will do very nicely he decided put me downblack box five hundred dollars  the girl took out her book and began to write the professor with a little farewell bow crossed the room towards quest lenora moved towards the door  let me see you out she said to the girl pleasantly dont you find this collecting sometimes very hard work  days like today the girl replied atone for everything when i think of the good that five hundred dollars will do i feel perfectly happy  lenora opened the door both girls started only a few feet away craig was standing his head a little thrust forward for a moment the quiet selfrespect of his manner seemed to have deserted him he seemed at a loss for words  what do you want lenora demanded  craig hesitated his eyes were fixed upon the salvation army girl the changes in his face were remarkable she however beyond smiling pleasantly at him gave no sign of any recognition  i was waiting for my master craig explained  why not downstairs lenora asked suspiciously you did not come up with him  i am driving the professor in his automobile craig explained it occurred to me that if he were going to be long here i should have time to go and order another tire it is of no consequence though i will go down and wait in the car  lenora stood at the top of the stairs and watched him disappear then she went thoughtfully back to her work the professor and quest were talking at the farther end of the room  i was in hopes in great hopes the professor admitted that you might have heard something i promised to call at mrs rheinholdts this afternoon  quest shook his head  there is nothing to report at present mr ashleigh he announced  dear me the professor murmured this is very disappointing is there no clue mr questno clue at all  not the ghost of one quest acknowledged i am as far from solving the mystery of the disappearance of your skeleton and mrs rheinholdts necklace as i have ever been  the professor failed entirely to conceal his disappointment his tone in fact was almost peevish  i should have expected this from the regular officials of the law mr quest he admitted but i must say that in your hands i had hopedbut there there excuse me i am an old man mr quest i am getting a little irritable disappointments affect me quickly i must be patient i will be patient  there are certain evidences quest remarked with his eyes upon the black box which seem to point to a new arrival in the criminal world of new york more than that i cannot tell you i will simply ask you to believe that i am doing my best  and with that mr quest i will be content the professor promised i will now pay my promised call upon mrs rheinholdt i shall convey to her your assurance that everything that is possible is being done good morning young ladies he concluded good morning mr quest  he took a courteous leave of them all and departed lenora crossed the room to where quest was seated at the table  mr quest she asked do you believe in inspiration  i attribute a large amount of my success quest replied to my profound belief in it  then let me tell you lenora continued that i have one and a very strong one do you know that when i went to the door a few minutes ago the professors servant craig was there listening  craig quest repeated let me see that was the man who was at the rheinholdts house the night of the robbery and who might have left through the conservatory  he did leave by it lenora declared he is in a state of panic at the present moment what else do you suppose he was out there listening for  the professor speaks very highly of him quest reminded her  the professor is just one of those amiable old idiots absorbed in his mouldy old work who would never notice anything lenora persisted he is just the man to be completely hoodwinked by a clever servant  there is some sense in what the kid says laura remarked strolling up the fact remains that craig was one of the few men who could have got at the necklace that night and he is also one of the few who knew about the skeleton  quest sighed as he lit a cigar  it is a miserably obvious solution he said to tell you the truth girls our friend inspector french has had his men watching craig ever since the night of the robbery whats that answer the telephone lenora  lenora obeyed  its inspector french she announced he wants to speak to you  quest nodded and held out his hand for the receiver  hullo french he exclaimed anything fresh  nothing much was the answer one of my men though who has been up mayton avenue way brought in something i found rather interesting this morning i want you to come round and see it  go right ahead and tell me about it quest invited  you know weve been shadowing craig the inspector continued not much luck up till now fellow seems never to leave his masters side we have had a couple of men up there though and one of them brought in a curiouslooking object he picked up just outside the back of the professors grounds its an untidy sort of neighbourhood you knowkind of waste ground they commenced to build over and then the real estate man who had it in hand went smash  what is the thing quest asked  well i want to see whether you agree with me french went on if you cant come round ill come to you  no necessity quest replied weve got over little difficulties of that sort laura just tack on the phototelesme he added holding the receiver away for a moment one moment french there thats right he added as laura with deft fingers arranged what seemed to be a sensitised mirror to the instrument now french hold up the article just in front of the receiver  frenchs reply was a little brusque  what are you getting at quest he demanded you are not going to pretend that you can see from your room into this are you  if youll hold the object where i told you quest replied i can see it i promise you that there thats right hold it steady ive got the focus of it now say french where did you say that was found  just outside the professors back gates french grunted but youre not kidding me  its a finger from the professors skeleton youve got there quest interrupted  how the blazes did you guess that the inspector demanded  im not kidding quest assured him ive got a phototelesme at work here ive seen the bone all right french this is interesting i must think it over  quest hung up the receiver and rang off then he turned towards his two assistants  another finger from the professors skeleton he announced has been found just outside his grounds what do you suppose that means  craig lenora declared confidently  craig on your life laura echoed say mr quest ive got an idea  quest nodded  get right ahead with it  didnt the butler at mrs rheinholdts say that craig belonged to a servants club up town i know the place well let me go and see if i cant join and pick up a little information about the man he must have a night out sometimes lets find out what he does hows that  capital quest agreed get along laura and you lenora he added put on your hat well take a ride towards mayton avenue   2  the exact spot where the bone of the missing skeleton was discovered was easily located it was about twenty yards from a gate which led into the back part of the professors grounds the neighbourhood was dreary in the extreme there were halffinished houses little piles of building materials heaps of stones a watchmans shed and all the dreary paraphernalia of an abandoned building enterprise quest wasted very little time before arriving at a decision  the discovery of the bone so near the professors house he decided cannot be coincidence only we will waste no time out here lenora we will search the grounds come on  they advanced towards the gate but found it locked the wall was unusually high as though to obscure a view of anything that lay on the other side quest noticed with interest that in places where it had shown signs of crumbling away it had been repaired he contemplated the lock thoughtfully and drew a little instrument from his pocket an instrument which had the appearance of a manysided key  looks like storming the fortress eh he remarked here goes any way  the gate swung open with a single turn of the wrist quest glanced for a moment at the lock and replaced the instrument in his pocket  the professors not looking for visitors he muttered gee what a wilderness  it was hard to know which way to turn every path was choked with tangled weeds and bushes here and there remained one or two wonderful old trees but the vegetation for the greater part consisted of laurel and other shrubs which from lack of attention had grown almost into a jungle they wandered about almost aimlessly for nearly halfanhour then quest came to a sudden standstill lenora gripped his arm they had both heard the same sounda queer crooning little cry half plaintive half angry quest looked over his right shoulder along a narrow overgrown path which seemed to end abruptly in an evergreen hedge  whats that he exclaimed  lenora still clung to his arm  i hate this place she whispered it terrifies me what are we looking for mr quest  cant say that i know exactly the latter answered but i guess well find out where that cry came from sounded to me uncommonly like a human effort  they made their way up as far as the hedge which they skirted for a few yards until they found an opening then quest gave vent to a little exclamation immediately in front of them was a small hut built apparently of sticks and bamboos with a stronger framework behind the sloping roof was grassgrown and entwined with rushes the only apology for a window was a queer little hole set quite close to the roof  the sort of place where the professor might keep some of his pets quest observed thoughtfully well have a look inside any way  there was a rudelooking door but quest on trying it found it locked they walked around the place but found no other opening all the time from inside they could hear queer scuffling sounds lenoras cheeks grew paler  must we stay she murmured i dont think i want to see whats inside mr quest mr quest  she clung to his arm they were opposite the little aperture which served as a window and at that moment it suddenly framed the face of a creature human in features diabolical in expression long hair drooped over one cheek the closeset eyes were filled with fury the white teeth gleamed menacingly quest felt in his pocket for his revolver  say thats some face he remarked id hate to spoil it  even as he spoke it disappeared quest took out the little gate opening apparatus from his pocket  weve got to get inside there lenora he announced stepping forward  she followed him silently a few turns of the wrist and the door yielded keeping lenora a little behind him quest gazed around eagerly exactly in front of him clad only in a loin cloth with hunchedup shoulders a necklace around his neck with blazing eyes and ugly gleaming teeth crouched some unrecognisable creature human yet inhuman a monkey and yet a man there were a couple of monkeys swinging by their tails from a bar and a leopard chained to a staple in the ground walking round and round in the far corner snapping and snarling every time he glanced towards the newcomers the creature in front of him stretched out a hairy hand towards a club and gripped it quest drew a long breath his eyes were set hard  drop that club he ordered  the creature suddenly sprang up the club was waved around his head  drop it quest repeated firmly you will sit down in your corner you will take no more notice of us do you hear you will drop the club you will sit down in your corner you will sleep  the club slipped from the hairy fingers the tense frame which had been already crouched for the spring was suddenly relaxed the knees trembled  back to that corner quest ordered pointing  slowly and dejectedly the apeman crept to where he had been ordered and sat there with dull noncomprehending stare it was a new force this a note of which he had feltthe superman raising the voice of authority quest touched his forehead and found it damp the strain of those few seconds had been intolerable  i dont think these other animals will hurt he said lets have a look around the place  the search took only a few moments the monkeys ran and jumped around them gibbering as though with pleasure the leopard watched them always with a snarl and an evil light in his eye they found nothing unusual until they came to the distant corner where a huge piano box lay on its side with the opening turned to the wall  this is where the brute sleeps i suppose quest remarked well turn it round any way  they dragged it a few feet away from the wall so that the opening faced them then lenora gave a little cry and quest stood suddenly still  the skeleton lenora shrieked its the skeleton  quest stooped down and drew away the matting which concealed some portion of this strangelooking object it was a skeleton so old that the bones had turned to a dull grey yet so far as regards its limbs it was almost complete quest glanced towards the hands  little fingers both missing he muttered thats the skeleton all right lenora  remember the message she exclaimed where the skeleton is the necklace may be also  quest nodded shortly  well search  they turned over everything in the place fruitlessly there was no sign of the necklace at last they gave it up  you get outside lenora quest directed ill just bring this beast round again and then well tackle the professor  lenora stepped back into the fresh air with a little murmur of relief quest turned towards the creature which crouched still huddled up in its corner its eyes halfclosed rolling a little from side to side  look at me he ordered  the creature obeyed once more its frame seemed to grow more virile and natural  you need sleep no longer quest said wake up and be yourself  the effect of his words was instantaneous almost as he spoke the creature crouched for a spring there was wild hatred in its closeset eyes the snarl of something fiendlike in its contorted mouth quest slipped quickly through the door  any one may have that for a pet he remarked grimly come lenora theres a word or two to be said to the professor theres something here will need a little explanation  he lit a cigar as they struggled back along the path presently they reached the untidylooking avenue and a few minutes later arrived at the house quest looked around him in something like bewilderment  say fancy keeping a big place like this all overgrown and like a wilderness he exclaimed if the professor cant afford a few gardeners why doesnt he take a comfortable flat down town  i think its a horrible place lenora agreed i hope i never come here again  pretty well obsessed these scientific men get quest muttered i suppose this is the front door  they passed under the portico and knocked there was no reply quest searched in vain for a bell they walked round the piazza there were no signs of any human life the windows were curtainless and displayed vistas of rooms practically devoid of furniture they came back to the front door quest tried the handle and found it open they passed into the hall  hospitable sort of place any way he remarked well go in and wait lenora  they found their way to the study which seemed to be the only habitable room lenora glanced around at its strange contents with an expression almost of awe  fancy a man living in a muddle like this she exclaimed not a picture scarcely a carpet uncomfortable chairsnothing but bones and skeletons and mummies and driedup animals a man with tastes like this mr quest must have a very different outlook upon life from ordinary human beings  quest nodded  he generally has he admitted here comes our host any way  a small motorcar passed the window driven by craig the professor descended a moment or two later he entered the room he gazed from quest to lenora at first in blank surprise then he held out his hands  you have good news for me my friends he exclaimed i am sure of it how unfortunate that i was not at home to receive you tell medont keep me in suspense if you pleaseyou have discovered my skeleton  we have found the skeleton quest announced  for a single moment the newcomer stood as though turned to stone there was a silence which was not without its curious dramatic significance then a light broke across the professors face he gave a great gulp of relief  my skeleton he murmured mr quest i knew it you are the greatest man alive now tell me quicklyi want to know everything but this first of allwhere did you find the skeleton who was the thief  we found the skeleton professor quest replied within a hundred yards of this house  the professors mouth was wide open he looked like a bewildered child it was several seconds before he spoke  within a hundred yards of this house then it wasnt stolen by one of my rivals  i should say not quest admitted  where where exactly did you find it the other insisted  quest was standing very still his manner more reserved even than usual his eyes studying the professor weighing every spoken word  i found it in a hut he said hidden in a piano box i found there also a creaturea human being i must call himin a state of captivity  hidden in a piano box the professor repeated wonderingly why you mean in hartoos sleeping box then  if mr hartoo is the gentleman who tried to club me you are right quest admitted mr ashleigh before we go any further i must ask you for an explanation as to the presence of that person in your grounds  the professor hesitated for a moment then he slowly crossed the room opened the drawer of a small escritoire and drew out a letter  you have heard of sir william raysmore the president of the royal society he asked  quest nodded  this letter is from him the professor continued you had better read it  the criminologist read it aloud lenora looked over his shoulder      to professor edgar ashleigh new york      my dear professor      your communication gratifies and amazes me i can say no more     it fell to your lot to discover the skeleton of the anthropoid     a marvellous thing in its way and needing only its corollary     to form the greatest discovery since the dark ages now you tell     me that in the person of hartoo the last of the inyamo race of     south america you have found that corollary you have supplied     the missing link you are in a position to give to the world a     definite and logical explanation of the evolution of man let me     give you one word of warning professor before i write you at     greater length on this matter anthropologists are afflicted     more even than any other race of scientific men with     jealousy guard your secret well lest the honour of this     discovery should be stolen from you      william raysmore  illustration quest and lenora receive the message from laura  illustration quest is surprised at finding the stolen necklace in the black box  the professor nodded deliberately as quest finished the letter  now perhaps you can understand he said why it was necessary to keep hartoo absolutely hidden in a months time my papers will be ready then i shall electrify the world i shall write not a new page but a new volume across the history of science i shall  the door was suddenly thrown open craig sprang in no longer the selfcontained perfect manservant but with the face of some wild creature his shout was one almost of agony  the hut professor the hut is on fire he cried  his appearance on the threshold was like a flash they heard his flying feet down the hall and without a moments hesitation they all followed the professor led the way down a narrow and concealed path but when they reached the little clearing in which the hut was situated they were unable to approach any nearer the place was a whirlwind of flame the smell of kerosene was almost overpowering the wild yell of the leopard rose above the strange halfhuman gibbering of the monkeys and the hoarse bass calling of another voice at the sound of which lenora and even quest shuddered then as they came breathless to a standstill they saw a strange thing one side of the hut fell in and almost immediately the leopard with a mighty spring leapt from the place and ran howling into the undergrowth the monkeys followed but they came straight for the professor wringing their hands they fawned at his feet as though trying to show him their scorched bodies then for a single moment they saw the form of the apeman as he struggled to follow the others his strength failed him however he fell backwards into the burning chasm                                       the professor bade them farewell an hour later on the steps of the house he seemed suddenly to have aged  you have done your best mr quest he said but fate has been too strong remember this though it is quite true that the cunning of hartoo may have made it possible for him to have stolen the skeleton and to have brought it back to its hidingplace but it was jealousycruel brutal foul jealousy which smeared the walls of that hut with kerosene and set a light to it the work of a lifetime my dreams of scientific immortality have vanished in those flames  he turned slowly away from them and reentered the house quest and lenora made their way down the avenue and entered the automobile which was waiting for them almost in silence the latter glanced towards his companion as they drove off  say this has been a bit tough for you he remarked ill have to call somewhere and get you a glass of wine  she tried to smile but her strength was almost gone they drove to a restaurant and sat there for a some little time lenora soon recovered her colour she even had courage to speak of the events of the afternoon when they reentered the automobile  mr quest she murmured who do you suppose burned the hut down  if i dont say craig i suppose you will he remarked i wonder whether lauras had any luck  they were greeted as they entered quests room by a familiar little ticking quest smiled with pleasure  its the pocket wireless he declared let me take down the message  he spelt it out to lenora who stood by his side      have joined servants club disguised as your butler craig     frequent visitor here ten years ago comes now occasionally     thursday evenings most likely time shall wait here on chance of     seeing him  good girl that quest remarked shes a rare sticker too  he turned away from the instrument and was crossing the room towards his cigar cabinet suddenly he stopped he looked intently towards the sideboard  what is it lenora asked  he did not answer she followed the direction of his gaze exactly in the same spot as before reposed another but somewhat larger black box of the same shape and material as the previous one  say who put that there he demanded  lenora shook her head  i locked the door when we went out she assured him  quest took the box into his hands and removed the lid it seemed half full of cottonwool on the top were a few lines of writing and beneath them the signature of the parted hands he read the form out slowly      drop all investigation the hands that return these jewels     command it  quest raised the cottonwool beneath lay mrs rheinholdts necklace     chapter v  an old grudge   1  sanford quest was smoking his after breakfast cigar with a relish somewhat affected by the measure of his perplexities early though it was lenora was already in her place bending over her desk and laura who had just arrived was busy divesting herself of her coat and hat quest watched the latter impatiently  well he asked  laura came forward straightening her hair with her hands  no go she answered i spent the evening in the club and i talked with two men who knew craig but i couldnt get on to anything from all i could hear of the man respectability is his middle name  thats the professors own idea quest remarked grimly i merely ventured to drop a hint that craig might not be quite so immaculate as he seemed and i never saw a man so horrified in my life he assured me that craig was seldom out of his sight that he hadnt a friend in the world nor a single vicious taste  were fairly up against it boss laura sighed the best thing we can do is to get on to another job the rheinholdt woman has got her jewels back or will have at noon today i bet she wont worry about the thief then the professors mouldy old skeleton was returned to him even if it was burnt up afterwards i should take on something fresh  cant be done quest replied shortly look here girls your average intellects are often apt to hit upon the truth when a man who sees too far ahead goes wrong rule craig out any other possible person occur to youspeak out lenora youve something on your mind i can see  the girl swung around in her chair there was a vague look of trouble upon her face  im afraid youll laugh at me she began tentatively  wont hurt you if i do quest replied  i cant help thinking of macdougal lenora continued falteringly he has never been recaptured and i dont know whether hes dead or alive he had a perfect passion for jewels if he is alive he would be desperate and would attempt anything  quest smoked in silence for a moment  i guess the return of the jewels squelches the macdougal theory he remarked he wouldnt be likely to part with the stuff when hed once got his hands on it however i always meant when we had a moments spare time to look into that fellows whereabouts well take it on straight away cant do any harm  i know the section boss on the railway at the spot where he disappeared laura announced  then just take the train down to mountwaysthats the nearest spotand get busy with him quest directed try and persuade him to loan us the gangs handcar to go down the line lenora and i will come on in the automobile  take you longer lenora remarked as she moved off to put on her jacket the cars do it in half an hour  cant help that quest replied mrs rheinholdts coming here to identify her jewels at twelve oclock and i cant run any risk of there being no train back youd better be making good with the section boss take plenty of bills with you  sure thats easy enough laura promised him ill be waiting for you  she hurried off and quest commenced his own preparations from his safe he took one of the small black lumps of explosive to which he had once before owed his life and fitted it carefully in a small case with a coil of wire and an electric lighter he looked at his revolver and recharged it finally he rang the bell for his confidential valet  ross he asked who else is here today besides you  no one today sir  just as well perhaps quest observed listen ross i am going out now for an hour or two but i shall be back at midday remember that mrs rheinholdt and inspector french are to be here at twelve oclock if by any chance i should be a few moments late ask them to wait and ross a young woman from the salvation army will call too you can give her this cheque  ross brown who was quests secretaryvalet and general factotum accepted the slip of paper and placed it in an envelope  there are no other instructions sir he enquired  none quest replied youll look out for the wireless and you had better switch the through cable and telegraph communication on to headquarters come along lenora  they left the house entered the waiting automobile and drove rapidly towards the confines of the city quest was unusually thoughtful lenora on the other hand seemed to have lost a great deal of her usual self composure she seldom sat still for more than a moment or two together she was obviously nervous and excited  whats got hold of you lenora quest asked her once you seem all fidgets  she glanced at him apologetically  i cant help it she confessed if you knew of the many sleepless nights i have had of how i have racked my brain wondering what could have become of james you wouldnt really wonder that i am excited now that there is some chance of really finding out often i have been too terrified to sleep  we very likely shant find out a thing quest reminded her french and his lot have had a try and come to grief  inspector french isnt like you mr quest lenora ventured  quest laughed bitterly  just now at any rate we dont seem to be any great shakes he remarked however im glad were on this job much better to find out what has become of the fellow really if we can  lenoras voice suddenly grew steady she turned round in her place and faced her companion  mr quest she said i like my work with you you saved me from despair sometimes it seems to me that life now opens out an entirely new vista yet since this matter has been mentioned between us let me tell you one thing i have known no rest night or day since we heard ofof jamess escape i live in terror if i have concealed it it has been at the expense of my nerves and my strength i think that very soon i could have gone on no longer  quests only reply was a little nod yet notwithstanding his imperturbability of expression that little nod was wonderfully sympathetic lenora leaned back in her place well satisfied she felt that she was understood  by quests directions the automobile was brought to a standstill at a point where it skirted the main railway line and close to the section house which he had appointed for his rendezvous with laura she had apparently seen their approach and she came out to meet them at once accompanied by a short thickset man whom she introduced as mr horan  this is mr horan the section boss she explained  mr horan shook hands  say ive heard of you mr quest he announced the young lady tells me you are some interested in that prisoner they lost off the cars near here  thats so quest admitted wed like to go to the spot if we could  thats dead easy the boss replied ill take you along in the hand car ive been expecting you mr quest some time ago  hows that the criminologist asked  mr horan expelled a fragment of chewing tobacco and held out his hand for the cigar which quest was offering  theyve been going the wrong way to work these new york police he declared just because there was a train on the other track moving slowly they got it into their heads that macdougal had boarded it and was back in new york somewhere that aint my theory if i were looking for james macdougal id search the hillsides there ill show you what i mean when we get alongside  you may be right quest admitted anyway well start on the job  the section boss turned around and whistled from a little side track two men jumped on to a handcar and brought it round to where they were standing a few yards away the man who was propelling ita great redheaded irishmansuddenly ceased his efforts leaning over his pole he gazed at quest a sudden ferocity darkened his coarse face he gripped his mate by the arm  see that bloke there he asked pointing at quest  the guy with the linen collar the other answered i see him  thats quest the detective the irishman went on hoarsely thats the man who got me five years in the pen the beast thats the man ive been looking for youre my mate jim eh  i guess so the other grunted are you going to try and do him in  you wait  now then you fellows horan shouted what are you hanging about there for red gallagher bring the carriage up you fellows can go and have a smoke for an hour im going to take her down the line a bit  the two men obeyed and disappeared in the direction of the section house quest looked after them curiously  thats a big fellow he remarked what did you call him red gallagher i seem to have seen him before  he was the most troublesome fellow on the line once although he was the biggest worker the boss replied he got five years in the penitentiary and that seems to have taken the spirit out of him  i believe i was in the case quest observed carelessly  that so now then young ladies mr horan advised hold tight and here goes  they ambled down the line for about half a mile then horan brought them to a standstill  this is the spot he declared now if you want my impressions you are welcome to them all the search has been made on the righthand side here and in new york ive had my eye on that hill for a long time my impression is that he hid there  ill take your advice quest decided well spread out and take a little exercise in hill climbing  good luck to you the boss exclaimed youll excuse my waiting it aint a quarter of a mile back by the road and im going a bit farther on inspecting  quest slipped something into his hand and the little party left the track crossed the road scrambled down a bank and spread out in front of them was a slope some hundreds of feet high closely overgrown with dwarf trees and mountain shrubs it was waste land uncultivated and uninhabited quest made a careful search of the shrubs and ground close to the spot which horan had indicated he pointed out to his two companions the spot where the grass was beaten down and a few yards farther off where a twig had been broken off from some overhanging trees as though a man had pushed his way through  this may have been done by the police search he remarked or it may not dont spread out too far girls and go slowly if we find any trace of james macdougal on this hillside we are going to find it within fifty yards of this spot  they searched carefully and deliberately for more than half an hour then lenora suddenly called out they looked around to find only her head visible she scrambled up muddy and with wet leaves clinging to her skirt  say that guy of a section boss told me to look out for caves ive been in one sure enough just saved myself  they hurried to where she was quest peered into the declivity down which she had slipped suddenly he gave vent to a little exclamation at the same time laura called out an inch or two of tweed was clearly visible through the strewn leaves quest flat on his stomach crawled a little way down took out his electric torch from his pocket and brushed the stuff away then he clambered to his feet  our search is over he declared gravely and your troubles lenora that is macdougals body he may have slipped in as you did laura or he may have crept there to hide and starved anyhow it is he  lenoras face sank into her hands for a moment quest stood on one side while laura passed her arm around the other girls waist presently he returned  we can do no more he pointed out we must send for help to bring the body up  i shall stay here please lenora begged dont think im foolish please i cant pretend i am sorry but ill stay till some one comes and takesit away  she is quite right laura declared and i will stay with her  quest glanced at his watch  thats all right he declared ill have to get but ill send some one along cheer up lenora he added kindly look after her laura  you bet that young woman declared brusquely  quest hastened along the road to the spot where he had left the car the chauffeur who saw him coming started up and climbed to his seat quest took his place  drive to the office he ordered  the man slipped in his clutch they were in the act of gliding off when there was a tremendous report they stopped short the man jumped down and looked at the back tire  blowout he remarked laconically  quest frowned  how long will it take  four minutes the man replied ive got another wheel ready thats the queerest blowout i ever saw though  the two men leaned over the tire suddenly quests expression changed his hand stole into his hip pocket  tom he explained that wasnt a blowout at all look here  he pointed to the small level hole almost at once he stood back and the sunshine flashed upon the revolver clutched in his right hand  that was a bullet he continued some one fired at that tire tom theres trouble about  the man looked nervously around  thats a rifle bullet sure he muttered  the car was drawn up by the side of the road a few yards past the section house a little way farther up was the tool shed and beyond the tower house there was no one in sight at either of these places on the other side of the road were clumps of bushes any one of which would prove sufficient for a man in hiding  get on the wheel as quick as you can quest directed here ill give you a hand  he stooped down to unfasten the straps which held the spare wheel it was one of his rare lapses realised a moment too late almost in his ears came the hoarse cry  hands up guvnor hands up this second or ill blow you to hell  quest glanced over his shoulder and looked into the face of red gallagher raised a little above the level of the road he had evidently been hiding at the foot of the perpendicular bank which divided the road from the track level a very ugly little revolver was pointed directly at quests heart  my mates got you covered on the other side of the road too hands up both of you or well make a quick job of it  quest shrugged his shoulders threw his revolver into the road and obeyed as he did so the other man stole out from behind a bush and sprang for the chauffeur who under cover of the car was stealing off there was a brief struggle then the dull thud of the railway mans rifle falling on the formers head the chauffeur rolled over and lay in the road  pitch him off in the bushes red gallagher ordered you dont want any one who comes by to see now lend me a hand with this chap  what do you propose to do with me quest asked  youll know soon enough red gallagher answered a matter of five minutes talk to start with you see that handcar house  perfectly well quest assented my eyesight is quite normal  get there then im a yard behind you and my revolvers pointing for the middle of your back  quest looked at it anxiously  you have the air my red friend he remarked of being unaccustomed to those delicate weapons do keep your fingers off the trigger i will walk to the handcar house and talk to you with pleasure  he sprang lightly down from the road crossed the few intervening yards and stepped into the handcar house  gallagher and his mate followed close behind quest paused on the threshold  its a filthy dirty hole he remarked cant we have our little chat out here is it money you want  gallagher glanced around then with an ugly push of the shoulder he sent quest reeling into the shed his great form blocked the doorway  no he cried fiercely its not money i want this time quest you brute you dirty bloodhound you sent me to the pen for five yearsyou with your cursed prying into other peoples affairs dont you remember me eh red gallagher  of course i do quest replied coolly you garrotted and robbed an old man and had the spree of your life the old man happened to be a friend of mine so i took the trouble to see that you paid for it well  five years of hell thats what i had the man continued his eyes flashing his face twitching with anger well youre going to have a little bit more than five years this sheds been burnt down twicesparks from passing engines its going to be burnt down for the third time  going to make a bonfire of me eh quest remarked  you can sneer my fine friend the man growled youve had a good many comfortable years of wearing fine clothes and smoking twentyfivecent cigars swaggering about and hunting poor guys that never did you any harm this is where we are going to get a bit of our own back see here we are locking this doorlike that its a lonely bit of the line the man in the tower never takes his eyes off the signals and there aint a soul in sight me and my mate are off to the section house two minutes will see us there and back were going to bring a can of oil and an armful of waste can you tell what for eh were going to burn the place to a cinder in less than three minutes and if youre alive when the walls come down well try a little rifle practise at you see  sounds remarkably unpleasant quest admitted youd better hurry or the boss will be back  gallagher finally slammed the door quest heard the heavy footsteps of the two men as they turned towards the section house he drew a little case from his coat pocket  just as well perhaps he said softly to himself that i perfected this instrument its rather close quarters here  he opened what seemed to be a little mahogany box looked at the ball of black substance inside closed it up placed it against the far wall untwisted the coil stood back near the door and pressed the button the result was extraordinary the whole of the far wall was blown out and for some distance in front the ground was furrowed up by the explosion quest replaced the instrument in his pocket sprang through the opening and ran for the tower house behind him on its way to new york he could see a freight train coming along he could hear too red gallaghers roar of anger it was less than fifty yards yet already as he reached the shelter of the tower the thunder of the freight sounded in quests ears he glanced around red gallagher and his mate were racing almost beside it towards him he rushed up the narrow stairs into the signal room tearing open his coat to show his official badge  stop the freight he shouted to the operator quick im sanford quest detectivespecial powers from the chief commissioner  the man moved to the signal another voice thundered in his ears he turned swiftly around the irishmans red head had appeared at the top of the staircase  drop that signal and ill blow you into bits he shouted  the operator hesitated dazed  walk towards me gallagher shouted look here you guy thisll show you whether im in earnest or not  a bullet passed within a few inches of the operators head he came slowly across the room below they could hear the roar of the freight  this aint your job the irishman continued savagely we want the cop and were going to have him  quest had stolen a yard or two nearer during this brief colloquy gallaghers mate from behind shouted out a warning just a second too late with a sudden kick quest sent the revolver flying across the room and before the irishman could recover he struck him full in the face notwithstanding his huge size and strength gallagher reeled the operator who had just begun to realize what was happening flung himself bodily against the two thugs a shot from the tangled mass of struggling limbs whistled past quests head as he sprang to the window which overlooked the track the freight had already almost passed quest steadied himself for a supreme effort crawled out on to the little steel bridge and poised himself for a moment the last car was just beneath the gap between it and the previous one was slipping by he set his teeth and jumped on to the smooth top for several seconds he struggled madly to keep his balance he felt himself slipping every minute down to the ground which was spinning by then his right heel caught a bare ledge scarcely an inch high it checked his fall he set his teeth carefully stretched out his hand and gripped the back of the car then his knee touched somethinga chain he caught it with his other hand he lay there crouching gripping wherever he could his fingernails breaking an intolerable pain in his knee death spinning on either side of him                                       back behind the tower red gallagher and his mate bent with horrified faces over the body of the signalman  what the hell did you want to plug him for the latter muttered he aint in the show at all youve done us red hes cooked  red gallagher staggered to his feet already the horror of the murderer was in his eyes as he glanced furtively around  illustration quest jumps from the signal tower on to the fast moving train  illustration a pair of mysterious hands place the black box on quests table  i never meant to drop him he muttered i got mad at seeing quest get off that mans a devil  what are we going to do the other demanded hoarsely its a quiet spot this but therell be some one round before long there goes the damned signals already he exclaimed as the gong sounded in the tower  theres the auto gallagher shouted come on come on man i can fix the tire if weve got to swing for this job well have something of our own back first  they crawled to the side of the road gallaghers rough hairy fingers were still trembling but they knew their job in a few minutes the tire was fixed clumsily but successfully the great irishman turned the car round away from the city  shes a hummer he muttered ill make her go when we get the hang of it sit tight  they drove clumsily off gathering speed at every yard behind in the shadow of the tower the signalman lay dead quest half way to new york stretched flat on his stomach was struggling for life with knees and hands and feet   2  mrs rheinholdt welcomed the inspector with a beaming smile as he stepped out of his office and approached her automobile  how nice of you to be so punctual mr french she exclaimed making room for him by her side will you tell the man to drive to mr quests house in georgia square  the inspector obeyed and took his place in the luxurious limousine  how beautifully punctual we are she continued glancing at the clock inspector i am so excited at the idea of getting my jewels back isnt mr quest a wonderful man  hes a clever chap all right the inspector admitted all the same im rather sorry he wasnt able to lay his hands on the thief  thats your point of view of course mrs rheinholdt remarked i can think of nothing but having my diamonds back i feel i ought to go and thank the professor for recommending mr quest  the inspector made no reply mrs rheinholdt was suddenly aware that she was becoming a little tactless  of course she sighed it is disappointing not to be able to lay your hands upon the thief that is where i suppose you must find the interference of an amateur like mr quest a little troublesome sometimes he gets back the property which is what the private individual wants but he doesnt secure the thief which is of course the real end of the case from your point of view  its a queer affair about these jewels the inspector remarked quest hasnt told me the whole story yet here we are on the stroke of time  the car drew up outside quests house the inspector assisted his companion to alight and rang the bell at the front door there was a somewhat prolonged pause he rang again  never knew this to happen before he remarked that sort of secretaryvalet of mr questsross brown i think he calls himis always on the spot  they waited for some time there was still no answer to their summons the inspector placed his ear to the keyhole there was not a sound to be heard he drew back a little puzzled at that moment his attention was caught by the fluttering of a little piece of white material caught in the door he pulled it out it was a fragment of white embroidery and on it were several small stains the inspector looked at them and looked at his fingers his face grew suddenly grave  seems to me he muttered that theres been some trouble here i shall have to take a liberty if youll excuse me mrs rheinholdt i think it would be better if you waited in the car until i send out for you  you dont think the jewels have been stolen again she gasped  the inspector made no reply he had drawn from his pocket a little passkey and was fitting it into the lock the door swung open once more they were both conscious of that peculiar silence which seemed to have in it some unnamable quality he moved to the foot of the stairs and shouted  hello any one there  there was no reply he opened the doors of the two rooms on the right hand side where quest when he was engaged in any widespread affair kept a stenographer and a telegraph operator both rooms were empty then he turned towards quests study on the left hand side french was a man of iron nerve he had served his time in the roughest quarters of new york he had found himself face to face with every sort of crime yet as he opened that door he seemed to feel some premonition of what was to come he stepped across the threshold no power on earth could have kept back the cry which broke from his lips  the curtains of the window which looked out on to the street were drawn and the light was none too good it was sufficient for him however to see without difficulty the details of a ghastly tragedy a few feet away from the door was stretched the body of the secretaryvalet on the other side of the room lying as though she had slipped from the sofa her head fallen on one side in hideous fashion was the body of miss quigg the salvation army young woman french set his teeth and drew back the curtains in the clearer light the disorder of the room was fully revealed there had been a terrible struggle between whom how  there was suddenly a piercing shriek the inspector turned quickly around mrs rheinholdt who had disregarded his advice was standing on the threshold  inspector she cried what has happened oh my god  she covered her face with her hands french gripped her by the arm at that moment there was the sound of an automobile stopping outside  keep quiet for a moment the inspector whispered in her ear pull yourself together madam go to the other end of the room dont look stay there for a few moments and then get home as quick as you can  she obeyed him mutely pressing her hands to her eyes shivering in every limb french stood back inside the room he heard the front door open he heard quests voice outside  ross where the devil are you ross  there was no reply the door was pushed open quest entered followed by the professor and craig the inspector stood watching their faces quest came to a standstill before he had passed the threshold he looked upon the floor and he looked across to the sofa then he looked at french  my god he muttered  the professor pushed past he too looked around the room and gazed at the two bodies with an expression of blank and absolute terror then he fell back into craigs arms  the poor girl he cried horrible horrible horrible  craig led him for a moment to one side the professor was overcome and almost hysterical quest and french were left face to face  know anything about this quest asked quickly  not a thing the inspector replied we arrived mrs rheinholdt and i at five minutes past twelve there was no answer to our ring i used my passkey and entered this is what i found  quest stood over the body of his valet for a moment the man was obviously dead the inspector took his handkerchief and covered up the head a few feet away was a heavy paperweight  killed by a blow from behind french remarked grimly with that little affair look here  they glanced down at the girl quests eyebrows came together quickly there were two blue marks upon her throat where a mans thumbs might have been  the hands again he muttered  the inspector nodded  can you make anything of it  not yet quest confessed i must think  the inspector glanced at him curiously  where on earth have you been to he demanded  been to quest repeated  look in the mirror french suggested  quest glanced at himself his collar had given way his tie was torn a button and some of the cloth had been wrenched from his coat his trousers were torn he was covered with dust  ill tell you about my trouble a little later on he replied say cant we keep those girls out  they were too late laura and lenora were already upon the threshold quest swung round towards them  girls he said there has been some trouble here go and wait upstairs lenora or sit in the hall laura you had better telephone to the police station and for a doctor thats right isnt it inspector  yes the latter assented thoughtfully  lenora white to the lips staggered a few feet back into the hall laura set her teeth and lingered  is that ross she asked  its his body quest replied hes been murdered here he and the salvation army girl who was to come this morning for her cheque  laura turned away half dazed  id have trusted ross with my life quest continued but he must have been alone in the house when the girl came do you suppose it was the usual sort of trouble  inspector french stooped down and picked up the paperweight across it was stamped the name of sanford quest  this yours quest  of course it is quest answered everything in the room is mine  the girl would fight to defend herself the inspector remarked slowly but she could never strike a man such a blow as your valet died from  once more he stooped and picked up a small clock it had stopped at elevenfifteen he looked at it thoughtfully  quest he said ill have to ask you a question  why not quest replied looking quickly up  where were you at elevenfifteen  on tower number 10 of the new york central scrapping for my life quest answered grimly ive reason to remember it  something in the inspectors steady gaze seemed to inspire the criminologist suddenly with a new idea he came a step forward a little frown upon his forehead  say french he exclaimed you dontyou dont suspect me of this  french was unmoved he looked quest in the eyes  i dont know he said     chapter vi  on the rack   1  for the moment a new element had been introduced into the horror of the little tableau all eyes were fixed upon quest who had listened to the inspectors dubious words with a supercilious smile upon his lips  perhaps he suggested you would like to ask me a few questions  perhaps i may feel it my duty to do so the inspector replied gravely in the first place then mr quest will you kindly explain the condition of your clothes  quest looked down at himself quickly more than ever he realised the significance of his dishevelled appearance  i travelled from number ten tower just outside new york on top of a freight car he said grimly it wasnt a very comfortable ride  perhaps you will explain what made you take it then the inspector continued  quest shrugged his shoulders  here you are then he replied this morning i decided to make an attempt to clear up the mystery of macdougals disappearance i sent on my secretary miss laura to make friends with the section boss and lenora and i went out by automobile a little later we instituted a search on a new principle and before very long we found macdougals body thats one up against you i think inspector  very likely the inspector observed go on please  i left the two young ladies at miss lenoras wish to superintend the removal of the body i myself had an engagement to deliver over her jewels to mrs rheinholdt here at midday i returned to where my automobile was waiting started for the city and was attacked by two thugs near the section house i got away from them ran to the tower house to try and stop the freight was followed by the thugs and jumped out on to the last car from the signal arm  there was a dead silence quest began quietly to dust his clothes the inspector stopped him  dont do that he said  quest paused in his task and laid down the brush  any more questions  where is your automobile  no idea quest replied i left it in the road when i jumped from the freight car i took a taxicab to the professors and called for him as arranged  that is perfectly true the professor intervened mr quest called for us as arranged previously at ten minutes to twelve  the inspector nodded  i shall have to ask you to excuse me for a moment he said while i ring up number 10 signal tower if mr quests story receives corroboration the matter is at an end where shall i find a telephone  in every room in the house quest answered shortly there is one outside in the passage  the inspector left the room almost immediately the professor crossed to quests side a kindly smile parted his lips  my dear mr quest he exclaimed our friend the inspectors head has been turned a little beyond doubt by these horrible happenings permit me to assure you for one that i look upon his insinuations as absurd  illustration mr quest your alibi has been found with a bullet in his brain i must put you under arrest  illustration when quest goes to the safe to produce the jewels he finds them missing  the man has gone off his head laura declared angrily  it will be all right directly he comes back lenora whispered laying her hand upon quests arm  if only some one would give me my jewels and let me go mrs rheinholdt moaned  the door opened and the inspector reappeared he was looking graver than ever  quest he announced your alibi is uselessin fact a little worse than useless the operator at number 10 has been found murdered at the back of his tower  quest started  i ought not to have left him to those thugs he murmured regretfully  there is no automobile of yours in the vicinity the inspector continued nor any news of it i think it will be as well now quest for this matter to take its obvious course will you first of all hand over her jewels to mrs rheinholdt  quest drew the keys of the safe from his pocket crossed the room and swung open the safe door for a moment afterwards he stood transfixed his arm half outstretched remained motionless then he turned slowly around  the jewels have been stolen he announced with unnatural calm  mrs rheinholdt pushed her way forward wringing her hands  stolen again she said mr quest inspector  they were there quest declared when i left the house this morning it seems probable he added that the same person who is responsible for this double tragedy has also taken the jewels  the inspector laid his hand heavily upon quests shoulder  it does seem as though that might be so he assented grimly you will kindly consider yourself under arrest quest ladies and gentlemen will you clear the room now if you please the ambulance i telephoned for is outside  the professor who had been looking on as though dazed suddenly intervened  mr french he said earnestly i am convinced that you are making a great mistake in arresting and taking away mr quest you are removing from us the one man who is likely to be able to clear up this mystery  the inspector pushed him gently on one side  you will excuse me professor he said but this is no matter for argument if mr quest can clear himself no one will be more glad than i  quest shrugged his shoulders  the inspector will have his little joke he observed drily its all right girls keep cool he went on as he saw the tears in lenoras eyes come round and see me in the tombs one of you  if i can be of any assistance the professor exclaimed i trust that you will not fail to call upon me mr quest i repeat inspector he added i am convinced that you are making a very grave mistake mrs rheinholdt you must let me take you home  she gave him her arm  my jewels she sobbed just as they had been recovered too  my dear lady the professor reminded her with a faint air of reproach in his tone i think we must remember that we are in the presence of a graver tragedy than the loss of a few jewels  the ambulance men came and departed with their grim burden the room on the ground floor was locked and sealed and the house was soon empty except for the two girls towards three oclock lenora went out and returned with a newspaper she opened it out upon the table and they both pored over it      wellknown criminologist arrested for double tragedy      sanford quest the famous new york criminologist was arrested     at noon today charged with the murder of his valet ross     brown and miss quigg salvation army canvasser the crime seems     to be mixed up in some mysterious fashion with others john d     martin of signal tower number 10 offered by quest as an alibi     was found dead behind his tower quest claimed that he travelled     from the signal tower to new york on a freight train leaving     his automobile behind but neither machine nor chauffeur have     been discovered      justice thorpe has refused to consider bail  hes a guy that justice thorpe and sos the idiot who wrote this stuff laura exclaimed thrusting the paper away from her i guess the professor was dead right when he told french he was locking up the one man who could clear up the whole show  lenora nodded thoughtfully  the professor spoke up like a man she agreed but laura i want to ask you something did you notice his servantthat man craig  cant say i did particularly laura admitted  twice lenora continued i thought he was going to faint i tell you he was scared the whole of the time  what are you getting at kid laura demanded  at craig if i can lenora replied moving towards the telephone please give me the phototelesme i am going to talk to the professor  laura adjusted the mirror to the instrument and lenora rang up the professor himself answered the call  have you seen the three oclock edition professor lenora asked  i never read newspapers young lady the professor replied  let me tell you what they say about mr quest  lenora commenced a rambling account of what she had read in the newspaper all the time the eyes of the two girls were fixed upon the mirror they could see the professor seated in his chair with two huge volumes by his side a pile of manuscript and a pen in his hand they could even catch the look of sympathy on his face as he listened attentively suddenly lenora almost broke off she gripped laura by the arm the door of the study had been opened slowly and craig carrying a bundle paused for a moment on the threshold he glanced nervously towards the professor who seemed unaware of his entrance then he moved stealthily towards the fireplace stooped down and committed something to the flames the relief on his face as he stood up was obvious  all i can do for mr quest young lady i will the professor promised if you will forgive my saying so you are a little overexcited just now take my advice and rest for a short time call round and see me whenever you wish  he laid the receiver down and the reflection on the mirror faded away lenora started up and hastily put on her coat and hat which were still lying on the chair  i am going right down to the professors she announced  what do you think you can do there laura asked  i am going to see if i can find out what that man burnt she replied i will be back in an hour  laura walked with her as far as the street car and very soon afterwards lenora found herself knocking at the professors front door craig admitted her almost at once for a moment he seemed to shiver as he recognised her the weakness however was only momentary he showed her into the study with grave deference the professor was still immersed in his work he greeted her kindly and with a little sigh laid down his pen  well young lady he said have you thought of something i can do  she took no notice of the chair to which he pointed and rested her hand upon his shoulder  professor she begged go and see mr quest he is in the tombs prison it would be the kindest thing any one could possibly do  the professor glanced regretfully at his manuscript but he did not hesitate he rose promptly to his feet  if you think he would appreciate it i will go at once he decided  her face shone with gratitude  that is really very kind of you professor she declared  i will send for my coat and we will go together if you like he suggested  she smiled  i am going the other way back to georgia square she explained no please dont ring i can find my own way out  she hurried from the room outside in the hall she paused for a moment listening with beating heart by the side wall was a hat rack with branching pegs from which several coats were hanging she slipped quietly behind their shelter presently the professor came out of the room  my coat please craig she heard him say  her heart sank craig was coming in her direction her discovery seemed certain then as his hand was half stretched out to remove one of the garments she heard the professors voice  i think that i shall walk craig i have been so much upset today that the exercise will do me good i will have the light coat from my bedroom  for a moment the shock of relief was so great that she almost lost consciousness a moment or two later she heard the professor leave the house very cautiously she stole out from her hiding place the hall was empty she crossed it with noiseless footsteps slipped into the study and moved stealthily to the fireplace there was a little heap of ashes in one distinct spot she gathered them up in her handkerchief and secreted it in her dress then she moved hurriedly towards the door and stepped quietly behind the curtain she stood there listening intently craig was doing something in the hall even while she was hesitating the door was opened he came in and moved towards his masters table through a chink in the curtain she could see that he was stooping down collecting some letters she stole out ran down the hall opened the front door and hastened down the avenue her heart was beating quickly the front door handle had slipped from her fingers and it seemed to her that she could hear even now the slam with which it had swung to at the gates she looked back there were no signs of life the house still bore its customary appearance gloomy and deserted with a sigh of relief she hailed a taxicab and sank back into the corner  she found laura waiting for her and a few minutes afterwards the two girls were examining the ashes with the aid of quests microscope among the little pile was one fragment at the sight of which they both exclaimed it was distinctly a shred of charred muslin embroidery lenora pointed towards it triumphantly  isnt that evidence she demanded lets ring up inspector french  laura shook her head doubtfully  not so fast she advised french is a good sort in his way but hes prejudiced just now against the boss im not sure that this evidence would go far by itself  its evidence enough for us to go for craig though what we have got to do is to get a confession out of him somehow  laura studied her companion for a moment curiously  taking some interest in mr quest kid aint you  lenora looked up then her head suddenly sank into her hands she knew quite well that her secret had escaped her laura patted her shoulder  thats all right child she said soothingly well see him through this somehow or other  you dont mind lenora faltered without raising her eyes  not i she replied promptly im not looking for trouble of that sort  lenora raised her head there was an immense relief in her face  i am so glad she said i was afraid sometimesliving here with him you know  laura interrupted her with an easy laugh  you dont need to worry she assured her  lenora rose to her feet she was quite herself again there was a new look of determination in her face  laura she exclaimed we will save mr quest and we will get hold of craig i have a plan listen   2  craigs surprise was real enough as he opened the back door of the professors house on the following morning and found lenora standing on the threshold  i am very sorry miss lenora he apologised the front door bell must be out of order i certainly didnt hear it ring mr ashleigh is in his study if you wish to see him  lenora smiled pleasantly  to tell you the truth she said i really do not want to see himat least not just yet i came to this door because i wanted a little talk with you  craigs attitude was perfect he was mystified but he remained respectful  will you come inside he invited  she shook her head  i am afraid she confided of what i am going to say being overheard come with me down to the garage for a moment  she pointed to the wooden building which stood about fifty yards away from the house craig hesitated  if you wish it miss he assented doubtfully i will get the keys  he disappeared for a moment and came out again almost immediately afterwards with a bunch of keys in his hand he seemed a little disturbed  i am doing as you wish miss lenora he said but there is nobody about here likely to overhear and i have no secrets from my master  perhaps not lenora replied but i have the professor is a dear she added hastily but he is too wrapped up in his scientific work to be able to see things like men of ordinary commonsense  that is quite true craig admitted mr ashleigh has only one idea in his life this way then if you please miss  he opened the door of the garage leaving the keys in the lock and they both passed inside the place was gloomy and lit only by a single narrow window near the roof the only vehicle it contained was the professors little car  you can say what you please here without the slightest fear of being overheard miss craig remarked  lenora nodded and breathed a prayer to herself she was nearer the door than craig by about halfadozen paces her hand groped in the little bag she was carrying and gripped something hard she clenched her teeth for a moment then the automatic pistol flashed out through the gloom  craig she threatened if you move i shall shoot you  it seemed as though the man were a coward he began to tremble his lips twitched his eyes grew larger and rounder  what is it he faltered what do you want  just this lenora said firmly i suspect you to be guilty of the crime for which sanford quest is in prison i am going to have you questioned if you are innocent you have nothing to fear if you are guilty there will be some one here before long who will extract the truth from you  the mans face was an epitome of terror even his knees shook lenora felt herself grow calmer with every moment  i am going outside to send a message she told him i shall return presently  dont go he begged suddenly dont leave me  she turned around  why not  he drew a step nearer once more the few inches of blue steel flashed out between them  none of your games she warned him i am in earnest and i am not afraid to shoot  i wont come any nearer he promised but listen i am innocenti have done nothing wrong if you keep me here you will do more harm than you can dream of  it is for other people to decide about your innocence lenora said calmly i have nothing to do with that if you are wise you will stop here quietly  have you said anything to mr ashleigh miss the man asked piteously  not a word  an expression of relief shone for a moment upon his face lenora pointed to a stool  sit down there and wait quietly she ordered  he obeyed without a word she left the place locked the door securely and made her way round to the other side of the garagethe side hidden from the house here at the far corner she drew a little pocket wireless from her bag and set it on the windowsill very slowly she sent her message      i have craig here in the professors garage locked up if our     plan has succeeded come at once i am waiting here for you  there was no reply she sent the message again and again suddenly during a pause there was a little flash upon the plate a message was coming to her she transcribed it with beating heart      ok coming  the guard swung open the wicket in front of quests cell  young woman to see you quest he announced ten minutes and no loud talking please  quest moved to the bars it was laura who stood there she wasted very little time in preliminaries having satisfied herself that the guard was out of hearing she leaned as close as she could to quest  look here she said lenoras crazy with the idea that craig has done these jobscraig the professors servant you know we used the phototelesme yesterday afternoon and saw him burn something in the professors study lenora went up straight away and got hold of the ashes  smart girl quest murmured nodding approvingly well  there are distinct fragments laura continued of embroidered stuff such as the salvation army girl might have been wearing we put them on one side but they arent enough evidence lenoras idea is that you should try and get hold of craig and hypnotise him into a confession  thats all right quest replied but how am i to get hold of him  laura glanced once more carelessly around to where the guard stood  lenoras gone up to the professors again this afternoon she is going to try and get hold of craig and lock him in the garage if she succeeds she will send a message by wireless at three oclock it is halfpast two now  well quest exclaimed well  you can work this guard if you want to laura went on i have seen you tackle much worse cases he seems dead easy then let me in the cell take my clothes and leave me here you did it before when you were trying to hunt down those men in chicago and not a soul recognised you  quest followed the scheme in his mind quickly  it is all right he decided but i am not at all sure that they can really hold me on the evidence they have got if they cant i shall be doing myself more harm than good this way  its no use unless you can get hold of craig quickly laura said he is getting the scares as it is  ill do it quest decided call the guard laura  she obeyed the man came goodnaturedly towards them  well young people not quarrelling i hope he remarked  quest looked at him steadfastly through the bars  i want you to come inside for a moment he said  what for the man demanded  i want you to come inside for a moment quest repeated softly unlock the door please take the key off your bunch and come inside  the man hesitated but all the time his fingers were fumbling with the keys quests lips continued to move the warder opened the door and entered a few minutes later quest passed the key through the window to laura who was standing on guard  come in he whispered dont step over him he is sitting with his back to the wall just inside  laura obeyed and entered the cell for a moment they were breathless with alarm a passing warder looked down their avenue eventually however he turned in the other direction  off with your coat and skirt like lightning laura quest ordered this has got to be done quickly or not at all  without a word and with marvellous rapidity the change was effected laura produced from her handbag a wig which she pinned inside her hat and passed over to quest then she flung herself on to the bed and drew the blanket up to her chin  how long will he stay like that she whispered pointing to the warder who was sitting on the floor with his arms folded and his eyes closed  half an hour or so quest answered dont bother about him i shall drop the key back through the window  a moment or two later quest walked deliberately down the corridor of the prison crossed the pavement and stepped into a taxicab he reached georgia square at five minutes to three a glance up and down assured him that the house was unwatched he let himself in with his own key and laughed softly as he caught sight of his reflection in the mirror the house was strangely quiet and deserted but he wasted no time in looking around he ran quickly upstairs paused in his sittingroom only to take a cigar from the cabinet passed on to the bedroom threw lauras clothes off and after a few moments hesitation selected from the wardrobe a rough tweed suit with a thick lining and lapels just as he was tying his tie the little wireless which he had laid on the table at his side began to record the message he glanced at the clock it was exactly three      i have craig here in the professors garage locked up if our     plan has succeeded come at once i am waiting here for you  quests eyes shone for a moment with satisfaction then he sent off his answering message put on a duster and slouch hat and left the house by the side entrance in a few moments he was in broadway and a quarter of an hour later a taxicab deposited him at the entrance to the professors house he walked swiftly up the drive and turned towards the garage hoping every moment to see something of lenora the door of the place stood open he entered and walked around it was empty there was no sign of either craig or lenora                                       quest recovered from his first disappointment stole carefully out and made a minute examination of the place close to the corner from which lenora had sent her wireless message to him he stooped and picked up a handkerchief which from the marking he recognised at once a few feet away the gravel was disturbed as though by the trampling of several feet he set his teeth for a single moment his own danger was forgotten a feeling which he utterly failed to recognise robbed him of his indomitable nerve he realised with vivid but scarcely displeasing potency a weakness in the armour of his complete selfcontrol  ive got to find that girl he muttered craig can go to hell  he turned away and approached the house the front door stood open and he made his way at once to the library the professor who was sitting at his desk surrounded by a pile of books and papers addressed him as he entered without looking up  where on earth have you been craig he enquired petulantly i have rung for you six times have i not told you never to leave the place without orders  it is not craig quest replied quietly it is i professorsanford quest  the professor swung round in his chair and eyed his visitor in blank astonishment  quest he exclaimed god bless my soul have they let you out already then  i came out quest replied grimly sit down and listen to me for a moment will you  you came out the professor repeated looking a little dazed you mean that you escaped  quest nodded  perhaps i made a mistake he admitted but here i am now listen professor i know this will be painful to you but give me your best attention for a few minutes these young women assistants of mine have formed a theory of their own about the murder in my flat and the robbery of the jewels hold on to your chair professor they believe that the guilty person was craig  the professors face was almost pitiful in its blank amazement his mouth was wide open like a childs words seemed absolutely denied to him  thats their theory quest went on they may be right or they may be wronglenora at any rate has collected some shreds of evidence they hatched a scheme between them clever enough in its way they locked craig up in your garage and got me out of the tombs in lauras clothes i have come straight up to find your garage open and lenora missing  the professor rose to his feet obviously making a tremendous effort to adjust his ideas  craig locked up in my garage he murmured craig guilty of those murders why my dear mr quest a more harmless a more inoffensive peaceloving and devoted servant than john craig never trod this earth  maybe quest replied but come out here mr ashleigh  the professor followed his companion out to the garage quest showed him the open door and the marks of footsteps around where he had picked up the handkerchief  now he said what has become of your man craig and what has become of my assistant lenora  perhaps we had better search the house the professor suggested craig my dear mr quest you little know  where is he then quest interrupted  the professor could do nothing but look around him a little vaguely together they went back to the house and searched it without result then they returned once more to the garage  i am going back quest announced my only chance is the wireless if lenora is alive or at liberty she will communicate with me  may i come too the professor asked timidly this matter has upset me thoroughly i cannot stay here without craig  come by all means quest assented i will drive you down in your car if you like  the professor hurried away to get his coat and hat and a few minutes later they started off in broadway they left the car at a garage and made their way up a back street which enabled them to enter the house at the side entrance they passed upstairs into the sittingroom quest fetched the pocket wireless and laid it down on the table the professor examined it with interest  you are marvellous my friend he declared with all these resources of science at your command it seems incredible that you should be in the position you are  quest nodded coolly  ill get out of that all right he asserted confidently the only trouble is that while i am dodging about like this i cannot devote myself properly to the task of running down this fiend of the hands just one moment professor while i send off a message he continued opening the little instrument where are you lenora he signalled send me word and i will fetch you i am in my own house for the present let me know that you are safe  the professor leaned back smoking one of quests excellent cigars he was beginning to show signs of the liveliest interest  illustration quest and laura change clothes so that quest may make his escape  illustration one of the clubs butlers turns in a fire alarm  quest he said i wish i could induce you to dismiss this extraordinary supposition of yours concerning my servant craig the man has been with me for the best part of twenty years he saved my life in south america we have travelled in all parts of the world he has proved himself to be exemplary a faithful and devoted servant i thought it absurd mr quest when you were suspected of these crimes i should think it even more ridiculous to associate craig with them in any way whatever  then perhaps you will tell me quest suggested where he is now and why he has gone away that does not look like complete innocence does it  the professor sighed  appearances are nothing he declared craig is a man of highly nervous susceptibilities the very idea of being suspected of anything so terrible would be enough to drive him almost out of his mind i am convinced that we shall find him at home presently with some reasonable explanation of his absence  quest paced the room for a few moments moodily  there was a certain amount of reason in the professors point of view  anyway i cannot stay here much longer unless i mean to go back to the tombs he declared  surely the professor suggested your innocence will very soon be established  there is one thing which will happen without a doubt quest replied my auto and the chauffeur will be discovered i have insisted upon enquiries being sent out throughout the state of connecticut they tell me too that the police are hard on the scent of red gallagher and the other man unless they get wind of this and sell me purposely their arrest will be the end of my troubles to tell you the truth professor quest concluded it is not of myself i am thinking at all just now it is lenora  the professor nodded sympathetically  the young lady who shut craig up in the garage you mean a plucky young woman she must be  she has a great many other good qualities besides courage quest declared women have not counted for much with me professor up till now any more than they have done i should think with you but i tell you frankly if any one has hurt a hair of that girls head i will have their lives whatever the penalty may be it is for her saketo find herthat i broke out of prison and that i am trying to keep free the wisest thing to do from my own point of view would be to give myself up i cant bring myself to do that without knowing what has become of her  the professor nodded again  a charming and wellbred young woman she seems he admitted i fear that i should only be a bungler in your profession mr quest but if there is anything i can do to help you to discover her whereabouts you can count upon me personally i am convinced that craig will return to me with some plausible explanation as to what has happened in that case he will doubtless bring news of the young lady  quest for the third or fourth time moved cautiously towards the window his expression suddenly changed he glanced downwards frowning slightly an alert light flashed into his eyes  theyre after me he exclaimed sit still professor  he darted into his room and reappeared again almost immediately the professor gave a gasp of astonishment at his altered appearance his tweed suit seemed to have been turned inside out there were no lapels now and it was buttoned up to his neck he wore a long white apron a peaked cap and a chinpiece of astonishing naturalness had transformed him into the semblance of a dutch grocers boy  im off professor quest whispered you shall hear from me soon i have not been here remember  he ran lightly down the steps and into the kitchen picked up a basket filled it haphazard with vegetables and threw a cloth over the top then he made his way to the front door peered out for a moment swung through it on to the step and turning round commenced to belabour it with his fist two plainclothes men stood at the end of the street a police automobile drew up outside the gate inspector french attended by a policeman stepped out the former looked searchingly at quest  well my boy what are you doing here he asked  i cannot answer get quest replied in broken english ten minutes already have i wasted i have knocked at all the doors  french smiled  you can hop it dutchie he advised bythebye when was that order for vegetables given he added frowning for a moment  it is three times a week the same quest explained whipping the cloth from the basket no word has been sent to alter anything  the inspector pushed him hurriedly in the direction of the street  you run along home he said and tell your master that he had better leave off delivering goods here for the present  quest went off grumbling he walked with the peculiar waddle affected by young dutchmen of a certain class and was soon out of sight round the corner of the street french opened the door with a masterkey and secured it carefully leaving one of his men to guard it he searched the rooms on the ground floor and finally ascended to quests study the professor was still enjoying his cigar  say wheres quest the inspector asked promptly  have you let him out already the professor replied in a tone of mild surprise i thought he was in the tombs prison  the inspector pressed on without answering every room in the house was ransacked presently he came back to the room where the professor was still sitting his usually goodhumoured face was a little clouded  professor he beganwhats that miles  a plainclothes man from the street had come hurrying into the room  say mr french he reported our fellows have got hold of a newsie down in the street who was coming along way round the back and saw two men enter this house by the side entrance halfanhour ago one he described exactly as the professor here the other without a doubt was quest  french turned swiftly towards the professor  you hear what this man says he exclaimed mr ashleigh youre fooling me you entered this house with sanford quest you must tell us where he is hiding  the professor knocked the ash from his cigar and replaced it in his mouth his clasped hands rested in front of him there was a twinkle of something almost like mirth in his eyes as he glanced up at the inspector  mr french he said mr sanford quest is my friend i am here in charge of his house believing as i do that his arrest was an egregious blunder i shall say or do nothing likely to afford you any information  french turned impatiently away suddenly a light broke in upon him he rushed towards the door  that damned dutchie he exclaimed  the professor smiled benignly     chapter vii  the unseen terror   1  with a little gesture of despair quest turned away from the instrument which seemed suddenly to have become so terribly unresponsive and looked across the vista of square roofs and tangled masses of telephone wires to where the lights of larger new york flared up against the sky from his attic chamber the roar of the city a few blocks away was always in his ears he had forgotten in those hours of frenzied solitude to fear for his own safety he thought only of lenora under which one of those thousands of roofs was she being concealed what was the reason for this continued silence perhaps they had taken her instrument awayperhaps she was being illused the bare thought opened the door to a thousand grim and torturing surmises he paced restlessly up and down the room inaction had never seemed to him so wearisome from sheer craving to be doing something he paused once more before the little instrument  lenora where are you he signalled i have taken a lodging in the servants club i am still in hiding hoping that craig may come here i am very anxious about you  still no reply quest drew a chair up to the window and sat there with folded arms looking down into the street suddenly he sprang to his feet the instrument quiveredthere was a message at last he took it down with a little choke of relief  i dont know where i am i am terrified i was outside the garage when i was seized from behind the hands held me i was unconscious until i found myself here i am now in an attic room with no window except the skylight which i cannot reach i can see nothinghear nothing no one has hurt me no one comes near food is pushed through a door which is locked again immediately the house seems empty yet i fancy that i am being watched all the time i am terrified  quest drew the instrument towards him  i have your message he signalled be brave i am watching for craig through him i shall reach you before long send me a message every now and then  then there was a silence  quest was conscious of an enormous feeling of relief and yet an almost maddening sense of helplessness she was imprisoned by the hands she was in their power and up till now they had shown themselves ruthless enough a room with a roof window only how could she define her whereabouts his first impulse was to rush madly out into the street and search for her then his common sense intervened his one hope was through craig again he took up his vigil in front of the window once more his eyes swept the narrow street with its constant stream of passersby each time a man stopped and entered the building he leaned a little further forward and at each disappointment he seemed to realise a little more completely the slenderness of the chance upon which he was staking so much then suddenly he found himself gripping the windowsill in a momentary thrill of rare excitement his vigil was rewarded at last the man for whom he was waiting was there quest watched him cross the street glance furtively to the right and to the left then enter the club he turned back to the little wireless and his fingers worked as though inspired  i am on craigs track he signalled be brave  he waited for no reply but opened the door and stealing softly out of the room leaned over the banisters his apartment was on the fourth story the floor below was almost entirely occupied by the kitchen and other offices the mens club room was on the second floor from where he stood he heard the steward of the club greeting craig he was a big man with a hearty voice and the sound of his words reached quest distinctly  say mr craig youre an authority on south america arent you i bought some beans in the market this morning which they told me were grown down there and my chef dont seem to know what to make of em i wonder whether you would mind stepping up and giving him your advice  craigs much lower voice was inaudible but it was evident that he had consented for the two men ascended to the third floor together quest watched them enter the kitchen a moment or two later the steward was summoned by a messenger and descended alone quest ran quickly down the stairs and planted himself behind the kitchen door he had hardly taken up his position before the handle was turned he heard craigs last words spoken as he looked over his shoulder  you want to just soak them for two hours longer than any other beans in the world thats all there is about it  craig appeared and the door swung back behind him before he could utter a cry quests left hand was over his mouth and the cold muzzle of an automatic pistol was pressed to his ribs  turn round and mount those stairs craig quest ordered  the man shrunk away trembling the pistol pressed a little further into his side  upstairs quest repeated firmly if you utter a cry i shall shoot you  craig turned slowly round and obeyed he mounted the stairs with reluctant footsteps followed by quest  through the door to your right the latter directed thats right now sit down in that chair facing me  quest closed the door carefully craig sat where he had been ordered his fingers gripping the arms of the chair in his eyes shone the furtive terrified light of the trapped criminal  quest looked him over a little scornfully it was queer that a man with apparently so little nerve should have the art and the daring to plan such exploits  what do you want with me craig asked doggedly  first of all quest replied i want to know what you have done with my assistant the girl whom you carried off from the professors garage  craig shook his head  i know nothing about her  she locked you in the garage quest continued and sent for me when i arrived i found the garage door open lenora gone and you a fugitive  bewilderment struggled for a moment with blank terror in craigs expression  how do you know that she locked me in the garage  quest smiled stretched out his right arm and his long fingers played softly with the pocket wireless  in just the same way he explained that i am sending her this message at the present momenta message which she will receive and understand wherever she is hidden would you like to know what i am telling her  the man shivered his eyes as though fascinated watched the little instrument  i am saying this craig quest continued craig is here and in my power he is sitting within a few feet of me and will not leave this room alive until he has told me your whereabouts keep up your courage lenora you shall be free in an hour  the trapped man looked away from the instrument into quests face there was a momentary flicker of something that might have passed for courage in his tone  mr quest he said you are a wonderful man but there are limits to your power you can tear my tongue from my mouth but you cannot force me to speak a word  quest leaned a little further forward in his chair his gaze became more concentrated  that is where you are wrong craig that is where you make a mistake in a very few minutes you will be telling me all the secrets of your heart  craig shivered drew back a little in his chair tried to rise and fell back again helpless  my god he cried leave me alone  when you have told me the truth quest answered swiftly and you will tell me all i want to know in a few moments your eyelids are getting a little heavy craig dont resist something which is like sleep is coming over you you see my will has yours by the throat  craig seemed suddenly to collapse altogether he fell over on one side every atom of colour had faded from his cheeks quest leaned over him with a frown the man was in a stupor without a doubt but it was a physical state of unconsciousness into which he had subsided he felt his pulse unbuttoned his coat and listened for a moment to the beating of his heart then he crossed the room fetched the pitcher of water and dashed some of its contents in craigs face in a few moments the man opened his eyes and regained consciousness his appearance however was still ghastly  where am i he murmured  you are here in my room at the servants club quest replied you are just about to tell me where i shall find lenora  craig shook his head a very weak smile of triumph flickered for a moment at the corners of his lips  your torture chamber trick wont work on me he exclaimed you can never  the whole gamut of emotions seemed already to have spent themselves in the mans face but at that moment there was a new element an element of terrified curiosity in the expression of his eyes as he stared towards the door  is this another trick of yours he muttered  quest too turned his head and sprang instantly to his feet from underneath the door came a little puff of smoke there was a queer sense of heat of which both men were simultaneously conscious down in the street arose a chorus of warning shouts increasing momentarily in volume quest threw open the door and closed it again at once  the place is on fire he announced briefly pull yourself together man we shall have all we can do to get out of this  craig turned to the door but staggered back almost immediately  the stairs are going he shrieked it is the kitchen that is on fire we are cut off we cannot get down  quest was on his hands and knees fumbling under his truckle bed he pulled out a crude form of fire escape a rough sort of cradle with a rope attached  know how to use this he asked craig quickly here catch hold put your arms inside this strap  you are going to send me down first craig exclaimed incredulously  quest smiled then he drew the rope round the table and tied it  you would like to have a chance of cutting the rope wouldnt you when i was half way down he asked grimly now then dont waste time get on to the windowsill dont brake too much off you go  yard by yard swinging a little in the air craig made his descent when he arrived in the street there were a hundred willing hands to release him quest drew up the rope quickly warned by a roar of anxious voices the walls of the room were crumbling volumes of smoke were now pouring in underneath the door and through the yawning fissures of the wall little tongues of flame were leaping out dangerously close to the spot where he must pass he let fall the slack of the rope and leaned from the window to watch it anxiously then he commenced to descend letting himself down hand over hand always with one eye upon that length of rope that swung below suddenly as he reached the second floor a little cry from the crowd warned him of what had happened tongues of flame curling out from the blazing building had caught the rope which was being burned through not a dozen feet away from him he descended a little further and paused in midair  a shout from the crowd reached him  the cables try the cables  he glanced round seven or eight feet away and almost level with him was a double row of telegraph wires almost as he saw them the rope below him burned through and fell to the ground he swung a little towards the side of the house pushed himself vigorously away from it with his feet and at the farthest point of the outward swing jumped his hands gripped the telegraph wires safely even in that tense moment he heard a little sob of relief from the people below  hand over hand he made his way to the nearest pole and slipped easily to the ground the crowd immediately surged around him some one forced a drink into his hand a chorus of congratulations fell upon his deafened ears then the coming of the fire engines and the approach of a police automobile diverted the attention of the onlookers quest slipped about amongst them searching for craig  where is the man who came down before me he asked a bystander  talking to the police in the car over yonder was the hoarse reply say guvnor you only just made that  quest pushed his way through the crowd to where craig was speaking eagerly to inspector french he stopped short and stooped down he was near enough to hear the formers words  mr french you saw that man come down the rope and swing on to the cables that was quest sanford quest the man who escaped from the tombs prison he cant have got away yet  quest drew off his coat turned it inside out and replaced it swiftly he coolly picked up a hat some one had lost in the crowd and pulled it over his eyes he passed within a few feet of where craig and the inspector were talking  he was hiding in the servants club craig continued he had just threatened to shoot me when the fire broke out  ill send the word round french declared well have him found right enough  for a single moment quest hesitated he had a wild impulse to take craig by the neck and throw him back into the burning house then he heard french shout to his men  say boys sanford quest is in the crowd here somewhere hes the man who jumped on to the cable lines a hundred dollars for his arrest  quest turned reluctantly away men were rushing about in all directions looking for him he forced a passage through the crowd and in the general confusion he passed the little line of police without difficulty his face darkened as he looked behind at the burning block a peculiar sense of helplessness oppressed him his pocket wireless was by now a charred heap of ashes his one means of communication with lenora was gone and the only man who knew her whereabouts was safe under the protection of the police   2  the professor swung round in his chair and greeted quest with some surprise but also a little disappointment  no news of craig he asked  quest sank into a chair he was fresh from the turkish baths and was enjoying the luxury of clean linen and the flavour of an excellent cigar  i got craig all right he replied he came to the servants club where i was waiting for him my lucks out though the place was burnt to the ground last night i saved his life and then the brute gave me away to the police i had to make my escape as best i could  the professor tapped the table peevishly  this is insufferable he declared i have had no shaving water my coffee was undrinkable i can find nothing i have a most important lecture to prepare and i cannot find any of the notes i made upon the subject  quest stared at the professor for a moment and then laughed softly  well he remarked you are rather an egoist professor arent you  perhaps i am the latter confessed still you must remember that the scientific world on those few occasions when i do appear in public expects much of me my sense of proportion may perhaps be disarranged by this knowledge all that i can realise at the present moment is this you seem to have frightened away the one man in the world who is indispensable to me  quest smoked in silence for a moment  any mail for me professor he asked abruptly  the professor opened a drawer and handed him a telegram  only this  quest opened it and read it through it was from the sheriff of a small town in connecticut      the men you enquired for are both here they have sold an     automobile and seem to be spending the proceeds shall i     arrest  quest studied the message for a moment  say this is rather interesting professor he remarked  really the latter replied tartly you must forgive me if i cannot follow the complications of yourpardon me for saying munchausenlike affairs how does the arrest of these two men help you  dont you see quest explained these are the two thugs who set upon me up at the section house they killed the signalman who could have been my alibi and swiped my car in which as it cannot be found french supposes that i returned to new york with their arrest the case against me collapses i tell you frankly professor quest continued frowning i hate to leave the city without having found that girl but i am not sure that the quickest way to set things right would not be to go down arrest these men and bring them back here clear myself and then go tooth and nail for craig  i agree with you most heartily the professor declared i recommend any course which will ensure the return of my man craig  i cannot promise you that you will ever have craig here again quest observed grimly i rather fancy singsing will be his next home  dont be foolish mr quest the professor advised dont let me lose confidence in you craig would not hurt a fly and as to abducting your assistantif my sense of humour were developed upon normal lineswell i should laugh what you have really done you and that young lady assistant of yours is to terrify the poor fellow into such a state of nerves that he scarcely knows what he is doing as a matter of fact how do you know that that young woman has been abducted at all such things are most unlikely especially in this part of the city  what reason do you suggest then for her disappearance quest enquired  at my age the professor replied drily i naturally know nothing of these things but she is a young woman of considerable personal attractionsi should think it not unlikely that she is engaged in some amorous adventure  quest laughed derisively  you do not know lenora mr ashleigh he remarked however if it interests you i will tell you why i know she has been abducted only a few hours ago i was talking to her  the professor turned his head swiftly towards quest there was a queer sort of surprise in his face  talking to her  quest nodded  our pocket wireless he explained lenora has even described to me the room in which she is hidden  and the neighbourhood also the professor demanded  of that she knows nothing quest replied she is in a room apparently at the top of a house and the only window is in the roof she can see nothing hear nothing when i get hold of the man who put her there quest continued slowly it will be my ambition to supplement personally any punishment the law may be able to inflict  the professors manner had lost all its petulance he looked at quest almost with admiration  the idea of yours is wonderful he confessed i am beginning to believe in your infallibility mr quest i am beginning to believe that on this occasion at any rate you will triumph over your enemies  quest rose to his feet  well he said if i can keep out of my friend frenchs way for a few hours longer i think i can promise you that i shall be a free man when i return from bethel im off now professor wish me good luck  my friend the professor replied i wish you the best of luck but more than anything else in the world he added a little peevishly i hope you may bring me back my servant craig and leave us both in peace  quest stepped off the cars at bethel a little before noon that morning the sheriff met him at the depot and greeted him cordially but with obvious surprise  say mr quest he exclaimed as they turned away i know these men are wanted on your charge but i thoughtyoull excuse my saying sothat you were in some trouble yourself  quest nodded  im out of thatcame out yesterday  very glad to hear it the sheriff assured him heartily i never thought that theyd be able to hold you  they hadnt a chance quest admitted things turned out a little awkwardly at first but this affair is going to put me on my feet again the moment my car is identified and red gallagher and his mate arrested every scrap of evidence against me goes  well heres the garage and the man who bought the car the sheriff remarked and theres the car itself in the road its for you to say whether it can be identified  quest drew a sigh of relief  thats mine right enough he declared now for the men  say i want to tell you something the sheriff began dubiously these two are real thugs they aint going to take it lying down  where are they quest demanded  in the worst saloon here the sheriff replied theyve been there pretty well all night drinking and theyre there again this morning hard at it theyve both got firearms and though i aint exactly a nervous man mr quest  you leave it to me quest interrupted this is my job and i want to take the men myself  youll never do it the sheriff declared  look here quest explained if i let you and your men go in there will be a free fight and as likely as not you will kill one if not both of the men i want them alive  well its your show the sheriff admitted stopping before a disreputablelooking building this is the saloon theyve turned the place upside down since theyve been here you can hear the row theyre making now free drinks to all the toughs in the town theyre pouring the stuff down all the time  well quest decided im going in and im going in unarmed you can bring your men in later if i call for help or if you hear any shooting  youre asking for trouble the sheriff warned him  ive got to do this my own way quest insisted stand by now  he pushed open the door of the saloon there were a dozen men drinking around the bar and in the centre of them red gallagher and his mate they seemed to be all shouting together and the air was thick with tobacco smoke quest walked right up to the two men  gallagher he said youre my prisoner are you coming quietly  gallaghers mate who was half drunk swung round and fired a wild shot in quests direction the result was a general stampede red gallagher alone remained motionless grim and dangerously silent he held a pistol within a few inches of quests forehead  if my numbers up he exclaimed ferociously it wont be you wholl take me  i think it will quest answered put that gun away  gallagher hesitated quests influence over him was indomitable  put it away quest repeated firmly you know you darent use it your accounts pretty full up as it is  gallaghers hand wavered from outside came the shouts of the sheriff and his men struggling to fight their way in through the little crowd who were rushing for safety suddenly quest backed jerked the pistol up with his right elbow and with almost the same movement struck red gallagher under the jaw the man went over with a crash his mate who had been staggering about cursing viciously fired another wild shot at quest who swayed and fell forward  ive done him the man shouted get up red ive done him all right finish yer drink well get out of this  he bent unsteadily over quest suddenly the latter sprang up seized him by the leg and sent him sprawling the gun fell from his hand quest picked it up and held it firmly out covering both men gallagher was on his knees groping for his own weapon  get the handcuffs on them quest directed the sheriff who with his men had at last succeeded in forcing his way into the saloon  the sheriff wasted no words till the two thugs now nerveless and cowed were handcuffed then he turned to quest there was a note of genuine admiration in his tone  mr quest he declared youve got the biggest nerve of any man i have ever known  the criminologist smiled  this sort of bully is always a coward when it comes to the pinch he remarked                                       crouching in her chair her pale terrorstricken face supported between her hands lenora her eyes filled with hopeless misery gazed at the dumb instrument upon the table her last gleam of hope seemed to be passing her little friend was silent once more her weary fingers spelt out a final despairing message  what has happened to you i am waiting to hear all the time has craig told you where i am i am afraid  there was still no reply her head sank a little lower on to her folded arms even the luxury of tears seemed denied her fear the fear which dwelt with her day and night had her in its grip suddenly she leaped screaming from her place splinters of glass fell all around her her first wild thought was of release she gazed upwards at the broken pane then very faintly from the street below she heard the shout of a boys angry voice  youve done it now jimmy youre a fine pitcher aint you lost it thats what youve gone and done  the thoughts formed themselves mechanically in her mind her eyes sought the ball which had come crashing into the room there was life once more in her pulses she found a scrap of paper and a pencil in her pocket with trembling fingers she wrote a few words      police headquarters i am sanford quests assistant abducted     and imprisoned here in the room where the ball has fallen help     i am going mad  she twisted the paper looked around the room vainly for string and finally tore a thin piece of ribbon from her dress she tied the message around the ball set her teeth and threw it at the empty skylight the first time she was not successful and the ball came back the second time it passed through the centre of the opening she heard it strike the sound portion of the glass outside heard it rumble down the roof a few seconds of breathless silence her heart almost stopped beating had it rested in some ledge or fallen into the street below then she heard the boys voice  gee heres the ball come back again  a new light shone into the room she seemed to be breathing a different atmospherethe atmosphere of hope she listened no longer with horror for a creaking upon the stairs she walked back and forth until she was exhausted curiously enough when the end came she was asleep crouched upon the bed and dreaming wildly she sprang up to find inspector french with a policeman behind him standing upon the threshold  inspector she cried rushing towards him mr french oh thank god  her feelings carried her away she threw herself at his feet she was laughing and crying and talking incoherently all at the same time the inspector assisted her to a chair  say whats all this mean he demanded  she told him her story incoherently in broken phrases french listened with puzzled frown  say what about quest he asked he aint been here at all then  she looked at him wonderingly  of course not mr quest  she hesitated the inspector laid his hand upon her wrist then he realised that she was on the point of a nervous breakdown and in no condition for interrogations  thatll do he said ill take care of you for a time young lady and ill ask you a few questions later on my men are searching the house you and i will be getting on if you can tear yourself away  she laughed hysterically and hurried him towards the door as they passed down the gloomy stairs she clung to his arm the first breath of air seemed wonderful to her as they passed out into the street it was freedom                                       the plainclothes man who was lounging in quests most comfortable easychair and smoking one of his best cigars suddenly laid down his paper he moved to the window a large empty automobile stood in the street outside from which the occupants had presumably just descended he hastened towards the door which was opened however before he was halfway across the room the cigar slipped from his fingers it was sanford quest who stood there followed by the sheriff of bethel two country policemen and red gallagher and his mate heavily handcuffed quest glanced at the cigar  say do you mind picking that up he exclaimed that carpet cost me money  the plainclothes man obeyed at once then he edged a little towards the telephone quest had opened his cigar cabinet  glad youve left me one or two he remarked drily  say arent you wanted down yonder mr quest the man enquired  thats all right now quest told him im ringing up inspector french myself youd better stand by the other fellows there and keep your eye on red gallagher and his mate  i guess mr quest is all right the sheriff intervened were ringing up headquarters ourselves anyway  the plainclothes man did as he was told quest took up the receiver from his telephone instrument and arranged the phototelesme  policestation number one central he saidthrough to mr frenchs office if you please mr quest wants to speak to him yes sanford quest no need to get excited all right im through am i hullo inspector  a rare expression of joy suddenly transfigured quests face he was gazing downward into the little mirror  youve found lenora then inspector he exclaimed bully for you what do i mean what i say you forget that i am a scientific man french no end of appliances here you havent had time to look at i can see you sitting there and lenora and laura looking as though you had them on the rack you can drop that french ive got red gallagher and his mate got them here with the sheriff of bethel they went off with my auto and sold it weve got that also in less than five minutes my chauffeur will be here hes been lying in a farmhouse unconscious since that scrap he can tell you what time he saw me last bring the girls along frenchand hurry  quest hung up the receiver  ive given inspector french something to think about he remarked as he turned away now mr sheriff if you can make yourself at home for a quarter of an hour or so french will be here and take these fellows off your hands ive still a little more telephoning to do  you go right ahead the sheriff acquiesced  quest rang up the professor his response to the call was a little languid and his reception of the news of quests successful enterprise was almost querulous  my friend the professor said your news gratifies me of course your rehabilitation however was a matter of certainty with me life has become a chaos you can have no idea with your independent nature what it means to entirely rely upon the ministrations of one person and to be suddenly deprived of their help  no news of craig then quest demanded  none at all was the weary reply what about your young lady assistant  shell be here in five minutes quest told him you had better come along and hear her story it ought to interest you  dear me the professor exclaimed i will certainly comecertainly  quest set down the receiver and paced the room thoughtfully for a moment or two although his own troubles were almost over the main problem before him was as yet unsolved the affair with the gallaghers was after all only an offshoot it was the mystery of lenoras abduction the mystery of the black box which still called for the exercise of all his ingenuity  inspector french was as good even better than his word in a surprisingly short time he entered the room followed by laura and lenora quest gave them a hand each but it was into lenoras eyes that he looked her coming her few words of greeting timid though they were brought him an immense sense of relief  well girls he said both full of adventures eh what did they do with you in the tombs laura  pshaw what could they do laura replied if theyre guys enough to be tricked by a girl the best thing they can do is to keep mum about it and let her go thats about what they did to me  inspector french who was standing a little aloof regarded laura with an air of unwilling admiration  thats some girl that miss laura he muttered in an undertone to quest she roasted us nicely  i mustnt stop to hear your story lenora quest said youre safethats the great thing  found her in an empty house french reported out gayson avenue way now mr quest i dont want to come the official over you too much but if youll kindly remember that youre an escaped prisoner  there was a knock at the door a young man entered in chauffeurs livery with his head still bandaged quest motioned him to come in  ill just repeat my story of that morning french quest said we went out to find macdougal and succeeded as you know just as i was starting for home those two thugs set upon me they nearly did me up you know how i made my escape they went off in my automobile and sold it in bethel i arrested them there myself this morning heres the sheriff who will bear out what i say also that they arrived at the place in my automobile  sure the sheriff murmured  further quest continued theres my chauffeur he knows exactly what time it was when the tire of my car blew out just as we were starting for new york  it was eleventen sir the chauffeur declared mr quest and i both took out our watches to see if we could make new york by midday then one of those fellows hit me over the head and ive been laid up ever since a man who keeps a store a little way along the road picked me up and looked after me  inspector french held out his hand  mr quest he said i reckon well have to withdraw the case against you no hard feeling i hope  none at all quest replied promptly taking his hand  thats all right then french declared ive brought two more men with me perhaps mr sheriff you wouldnt mind escorting your prisoners around to headquarters ill be there before long  and you girls quest insisted go right to your room and rest ill come upstairs presently and have a talk look after her laura he added glancing a little anxiously at lenora she has had about as much as she can bear i think  the two girls left the room quest stood upon the threshold watching the sheriff and his prisoners leave the house the former turned round to wave his adieux to them  theres an elderly josser out here he shouted seems to want to come in  quest leaned forward and saw the professor  come right in mr ashleigh he invited  the professor promptly made his appearance his coat was illbrushed and in place of a hat he was wearing a tweed cap which had seen better days his expression was almost pathetic  my dear quest he exclaimed as he wrung his hand my heartiest congratulations as you know i always believed in your innocence i am delighted that it has been proved  come in and sit down mr ashleigh quest invited you know the inspector  the professor shook hands with french and then feeling that his appearance required some explanation he took off his cap and looked at it ruefully  i am aware he said that this is not a becoming headgear but i am lostabsolutely lost without my servant if you would earn my undying gratitude mr quest you would clear up the mystery about craig and restore him to me  quest was helping the inspector to the whisky at the sideboard he paused to light a cigar before he replied  i very much fear professor he observed that you will never have craig back again  the professor sank wearily into an easychair  i will take a little whisky and one of your excellent cigars quest he said i must ask you to bear with me if i seem upset after more than twenty years service from one whom i have always treated as a friend this sudden separation to a man of my age is somewhat trying my small comforts are all interfered with the business of my everyday life is completely upset i do not allude as you perceive mr quest to the horrible suspicions you seem to have formed of craig my own theory is that you have simply frightened him to death  all the same the inspector remarked thoughtfully some one who is still at large committed those murders and stole those jewels what is your theory about the jewels mr quest  i havent had time to frame one yet the criminologist replied youve been keeping me too busy looking after myself however he added its time something was done  he took a magnifying glass from his pocket and examined very closely the whole of the front of the safe  no sign of fingerprints he muttered the person who opened it probably wore gloves  he fitted the combination and swung open the door he stood there for a moment speechless something in his attitude attracted the inspectors attention  what is it mr quest he asked eagerly  quest drew a little breath exactly facing him in the spot where the jewels had been was a small black box he brought it to the table and removed the lid inside was a sheet of paper which he quickly unfolded they all three read the few lines together      pitted against the inherited cunning of the ages you have no     chance i will take compassion upon you look in the righthand     drawer of your desk  underneath appeared the signature of the hands quest moved like a dream to his cabinet and pulled open the righthand drawer he turned around and faced the other two men in his hand was mrs rheinholdts necklace     chapter viii  the house of mystery   1  something in the nature of a conference was proceeding in quests study the professor was there seated in the most comfortable easychair smoking without relish one of his hosts best cigars watching with nervous impatience the closed door laura and lenora were seated at the table dressed for the street they had the air of being prepared for some excursion quest realising the professors highlystrung state had left him alone for a few moments and was studying a map of new york the latter however was too ill at ease to keep silent for long  our friend french he remarked gave you no clue i suppose as to the direction in which his investigations are leading him  quest glanced up from the map  none at all i know however that the house in which lenora here was confined is being watched closely  the professor glanced towards the table before which lenora was seated  it seems strange he continued that the young lady should have so little to tell us about her incarceration  lenora shivered for a moment  what could there be to tell she asked except that it was all horrible and that i felt thingsfelt dangerswhich i couldnt describe  the professor gave vent to an impatient little exclamation  i am not speaking of fancies he persisted you had food brought to you for instance could you never see the hand which placed it inside your room could you hear nothing of the footsteps of the person who brought it could you not even surmise whether it was a man or a woman  lenora answered him with an evident effort she had barely as yet recovered from the shock of those awful hours  the person who brought me the food she said came at nightnever in the daytime i never heard anything the most i ever saw was oncei happened to be looking towards the door and i saw a pair of handsnothing moresetting down a tray i shrieked and called out i think that i almost fainted when i found courage enough to look there was nothing there but the tray upon the floor  you never heard for instance the rustling of a gown or the sound of a footstep the professor asked you could not even say whether your jailer were man or woman  lenora shook her head  all that i ever heard was the opening of the door all that i ever saw was that pair of hands one night i fanciedbut that must have been a dream  you fancied what the professor persisted  that i saw a pair of eyes glaring at me lenora replied eyes without any human body i know that i ran round the room calling out when i dared to look again there was nothing there  the professor sighed as he turned away  it is evident i am afraid he said that miss lenoras evidence will help no one as an expert in these affairs mr quest does it not seem to you that her imprisonment was just a little purposeless there seems to have been no attempt to harm her in any way whatever that i can see  whoever took the risk of abducting her quest pointed out grimly did it for a purpose that purpose would probably have become developed in course of time however we look at it mr ashleigh there was only one man who must have been anxious to get her out of the way and that man was craig  the professors manner betrayed some excitement  then will you tell me this he demanded the young lady is confident that she locked craig up in the coachhouse and that the key was on the outside of the door a fact which would prevent the lock being picked from inside even if such a thing were possible the window is small and up almost in the roof will you tell me how craig escaped from the coachhouse in order to carry out this abductionall within a few minutes mind of his having been left there will you tell me that mr sanford quest the professor concluded with a note of triumph in his tone  thats one of the troubles we are up against quest admitted we have to remember this though the brain that planned the two murders here that stole and restored mrs rheinholdts jewels that sends us those little billetsdoux from time to time is quite capable of finding a way out of a jerrybuilt garage  the professor sniffed he turned once more to lenora  young lady he said i will ask you this i do not wish to seem obstinate in my refusal to accept craigs guilt as proved but i would like to put this simple question to you did craigs demeanour during your conversation seem to you to indicate the master criminal did he seem to you to be possessed of supreme courage of marvellous intelligence  lenora smiled very faintly  i am afraid she replied that this time ill have to satisfy the professor he was white and trembling all the time i thought him an arrant coward  the professor smiled beatifically as he glanced around he had the air of one propounding an unanswerable problem  you hear what miss lenora says i ask you whether a man who even knew the meaning of the word fear could have carried out these ghastly crimes  i have known cases quest observed where the most coldblooded criminals in the world have been stricken with the most deadly fear when it has come to a question of any personal danger however he added here comes our friend french i have an idea that he has something to tell us  they glanced expectantly towards the door as french entered the inspector who was looking very spruce and wellbrushed wished them a general goodmorning his eyes rested last and longest upon laura who seemed however unconscious of his presence  now then french quest began as he returned his greeting take a cigar make yourself comfortable in that chair and let us have your news as you see we have obeyed orders we are all ready to follow you anywhere you say  it wont be to the end of the world anyway the inspector remarked as he lit his cigar i am going to propose a little excursion down gayson avenue way  back to that house lenora exclaimed with a grimace  the inspector nodded  we have had those boys at the station he went on and we have questioned them carefully it seems that after they had picked up the ball a man came out of the side entrance of the house saw them reading miss lenoras message and shouted after them the boys had sense enough to scoot the man ran after them but had to give it up here is their description of him  the inspector took a piece of paper from his pocket they all waited breathlessly  had to drag this out of the boys bit by bit the inspector proceeded but boiled down and put into reasonable language this is what it comes to the man was of medium height rather thin pale and dressed in black clothes he had what they call anxious eyes and after running a short distance he put his hand to his heart as though out of breath one of the boys thought his nose was a little hooked and they both remarked upon the fact that although he shouted after them he used no swear words but simply tried to induce them to stop this description suggest anything to you gentlemen  craig lenora said firmly  it is a very accurate description of craig sanford quest agreed  the professor looked troubled also a little perplexed he said nothing however  under these circumstances the inspector continued i have had the house watched and i propose that we now search it systematically it is very possible that something may transpire to help us of course my men went through it roughly when we brought miss lenora away but that wasnt anything of a search to count if the place really has become a haunt of criminals  what about the ownership of the house quest asked as he took up his hat  the inspector nodded approvingly  i am making a few enquiries in that direction he announced i expect to have something to report very shortly  the professor stood drawing on his gloves the vague look of trouble still lingered in his face  tell me again he begged the name of the avenue in which this residence is situated  gayson avenue the inspector replied its a bit out of the way but its not a bad neighbourhood  the professor repeated the address to himself softly for a moment he stood quite still his manner showed signs of growing anxiety he seemed to be trying to remember something  the name he admitted finally as they moved towards the door suggests to me i must confesswe are going to see the house inspector  we are on our way there now sirthat is if the young ladies are willing he added glancing at laura  weve been waiting here with our hats on for the last halfhour laura replied promptly youve stretched your ten minutes out some mr french  the inspector manoeuvred to let the others pass on and descended the stairs by lauras side  couldnt help it he confided lowering his tone a little had some information come in about that house i couldnt quite size up youre looking well this morning miss laura  say who are you guying she replied  i mean it the inspector persisted that hat seems to suit you  laura laughed at the top of her voice  say kid she exclaimed to lenora the inspector heres setting up as a judge of millinery  lenora turned and looked at them both with an air of blank astonishment the inspector was a little embarrassed  no need to give me away like that he muttered as they reached the hall now then ladies and gentlemen if you are ready  they took their places in the automobile and drove off as they neared the vicinity of gayson avenue the professor began to show signs of renewed uneasiness when they drew up at last outside the house he gave a little exclamation his face was grave almost haggard  mr quest he said inspector french i deeply regret that i have a statement to make  they both turned quickly towards him the inspector smiled in a confidential manner at laura it was obvious that he knew what was coming  some years ago the professor continued i bought this house and made a present of it to  to whom quest asked quickly  to my servant craig the professor admitted with a groan  lenora gave a little cry she turned triumphantly towards the inspector  all recollection as to its locality had escaped me the professor continued sorrowfully i remember that it was on the anniversary of his having been with me for some fifteen years that i decided to show him some substantial mark of my appreciation i knew that he was looking for a domicile for his father and mother who are since both dead and i requested a house agent to send me in a list of suitable residences this alas was the one i purchased  quest glanced around the place  i think he said that the professors statement now removes any doubt as to craigs guilt you are sure the house has been closely watched inspector  since i received certain information french replied i have had halfadozen of my best men in the vicinity i can assure you that no one has entered or left it during the last twentyfour hours  they made their way to the piazza steps and entered by the front door the house was an ordinary framework one of moderate size in poor repair and showing signs of great neglect the rooms were barely furnished and their first cursory search revealed no traces of habitation there was still the broken skylight in the room which lenora had occupied and the bed upon which she had slept was still crumpled french who had been tapping the walls downstairs called to them they trooped down into the hall the inspector was standing before what appeared to be an ordinary panel  look here he said glancing out of the corner of his eye to be sure that laura was there let me show you what i have just discovered  he felt with his thumb for a spring in a moment or two a portion of the wall about two feet in extent slowly revolved disclosing a small cupboard fitted with a telephone instrument  a telephone the inspector remarked pointing to it in an unoccupied house and a concealed cupboard what do you think of that  the professor shook his head  dont ask me he groaned  french took the receiver from its rest and called up the exchange  inspector french speaking he announced kindly tell me what is the number of the telephone from which i am speaking and who is the subscriber  he listened to the reply and asked another question  can you tell me when this instrument was last used when thank you  the inspector hung up the receiver  the subscribers name he told them drily is brown the number is not entered in the book by request the telephone was used an hour ago from a call office and connection was established that is to say that some one spoke from this telephone  then if your men have maintained their search properly that some one quest said slowly must be in the house at the present moment  without a doubt the inspector agreed i should like to suggest he went on that the two young ladies wait for us now in the automobile if this man turns out as desperate as he has shown himself ingenious there may be a little trouble  they both protested vigorously quest shrugged his shoulders  they must decide for themselves he said personally i like lenora who has had less experience of such adventures to grow accustomed to danger with your permission inspector i am going to search the front room on the first floor before we do anything else i think that if you wait here i may be able to show you something directly  quest ascended the stairs and entered a wholly unfurnished room on the lefthand side he looked for a minute contemplatively at a large but rather shallow cupboard the door of which stood open and tapped lightly with his forefinger upon the back part of it then he withdrew a few feet and drawing out his revolver deliberately fired into the floor a few inches inside there was a half stifled cry the false back suddenly swung open and a man rushed out quests revolver covered him but there was no necessity for its use craig smothered with dust his face white as a piece of marble even his jaw shaking with fear was wholly unarmed he seemed in fact incapable of any form of resistance he threw himself upon his knees before quest  save me he begged help me to get away from this house you dont belong to the police ill give you every penny i have in the world to let me go  quest smiled at him derisively  get up he ordered  very slowly craig obeyed him he was a pitifullooking object but a single look into quests face showed him the folly of any sort of appeal  walk out of the room quest ordered in front of meso now then turn to the right and go down the stairs  they all gave a little cry as they saw him appear a trembling pitiful creature glancing around like a trapped animal he commenced to descend the stairs holding tightly to the banisters quest remained on the landing above his revolver in his hand french waited in the hall below also armed laura gripped lenoras arm in excitement  theyve got him now she exclaimed got him sure  on the fourth or fifth stair craig hesitated he suddenly saw the professor standing below he gripped the banisters with one hand the other he flung out in a threatening gesture  youve given me away to these bloodhounds he criedyou for whom i have toiled and slaved whom i have followed all over the world whom i have served faithfully with the last breath of my body and the last drop of blood in my veins you have brought them heretracked me down you  the professor shook his head sorrowfully  craig he said you have been the best servant man ever had if you are innocent of these crimes you can clear yourself if you are guilty a dogs death is none too good for you  craig seemed to sway for a moment upon his feet only lenora from the hall saw that he was fitting his right foot into what seemed to be a leather loop hanging from the banisters then a wild shout of surprise broke from the lips of all of them followed by a moment of stupefied wonder the whole staircase suddenly began to revolve craig clinging to the banisters disappeared in a moment or two there was a fresh click another set of stairs almost identical to the first had taken their place  the cellar quest shouted as he rushed down the stairs quick  they wrenched open the wooden door and hurried down the dark steps into the gloomy unlit cellar the place was crowded with packingcases and two large wine barrels stood in the corner at the farther end was a door quest rushed for it and stood on guard a moment later however he called to laura and pressed his revolver into her hand  stand here he ordered shoot him if he tries to run out ill search in the packingcases he might be dangerous  the professor out of breath was leaning against one of the pillars his arm passed around it for support lenora with quest and french searched hastily amongst the packingcases suddenly there was a loud crack the sound of falling masonry followed by a scream from laura french with a roar of anger rushed towards her she was lying on her side already half covered by falling bricks and masonry he dragged her away just in time  my god shes fainted he exclaimed  i havent laura faltered trying to open her eyes and im not going to but i think my arms broken and my side hurts  the fellows not down here anyway quest declared lets help her upstairs and get her out of this devils house  they supported her up the steps and found a chair for her in the hall she was white almost to the lips but she struggled bravely to keep consciousness  dont you bother about me she begged dont let that blackguard go you find him i shall be all right  the inspector swung open the telephone cupboard and called for an ambulance then quest who had been examining the staircase suddenly gave a little exclamation  hes done us he cried look here french this is the original staircase theres the leather loop i know it because there was a crack on the fourth stair when we rushed down the cellar after him he swung the thing round again and simply walked out of the front door damn it man its open  they hurried outside french blew his whistle one of the plainclothes men came running up from the avenue he was looking a little sheepish  whats wrong french demanded  hes gone off was the unwilling reply i guess that chaps given us the slip  speak up french insisted  the only place the man went on we hadnt our eyes glued on was the front door he must have come out through that theres been a motor truck with one or two queerlooking chaps in it at the corner of the avenue there for the last ten minutes id just made up my mind to stroll round and see what it was up to when jim who was on the other side shouted out a man jumped up into it and they made off at once  could he have come from this house french asked sternly  i guess if hed come out from the front door he might just have done it the man admitted  quest and the inspector exchanged glances  hes done us quest muttereddone us like a couple of greenhorns  the inspectors rubicund countenance was white with fury his head kept turning in the direction of laura to whom the professor was busy rendering first aid  if i never take another job on as long as i live he declared ill have that fellow before im through   2  the professor roused himself from what had apparently been a very gloomy reverie  well he announced i must go home it has been very kind of you mr quest to keep me here for so long  quest glanced at the clock  dont hurry mr ashleigh he said we may get some news at any moment french has a dozen men out on the search and he has promised to ring me up immediately he hears anything  the professor sighed  a man he declared who for twenty years can deceive his master as utterly and completely as craig has done me who is capable of such diabolical outrages and who when capture stares him in the face is capable of an escape such as he made today is outside the laws of probability personally i do not believe that i shall ever again see the face of my servant any more than that you quest will entirely solve the mystery of these murders and the theft of the rheinholdt jewels  lenora who with her hat on was packing a small bag at the other end of the room glanced up for a moment  illustration quest is mystified at finding the jewels in the black box which was on the floor  illustration sure an me names not craigits marty otoole sir they had fooled the criminologist  the man is a demon she exclaimed he would have sacrificed us all if he could when i think of poor laura lying there in the hospital crushed almost to death so that he could save his miserable carcass and realise that he is free i feel  she stopped short quest looked at her and nodded  dont mind hurting our feelings lenora he said french and i are up against it all right were second best at the present momentill admit thatbut the end hasnt come yet  i am sorry she murmured i was led away for a moment but mr quest she went on piteously cant we do something lauras so brave she tried to laugh when i left her an hour ago but i could see all the time that she was suffering agony fancy a man doing that to a woman it makes me feel that i cant rest or sleep i think that when i have left the hospital i shall just walk up and down the streets and watch and search  quest shook his head  that sort of thing wont do any good he declared it isnt any use lenora working without a plan thats why im here now waiting i want to formulate a plan first  who are we the professor asked drearily to make plans against a fiend like that what can we do against men who have revolving staircases and trolleyloads of river pirates waiting for them you may be a scientific criminologist quest but that fellow craig is a scientific criminal if ever there was one  quest crossed the room towards his cigar cabinet and opened it his little start was apparent to both of them lenora laid down the bag which she had just lifted up the professor leaned forward in his chair  what is it quest he demanded  quest stretched out his hand and picked up from the top of the cigars a small black box he laid it on the table  unless i am very much mistaken he said it is another communication from our mysterious friend  impossible the professor exclaimed hoarsely  how can he have been here lenora cried  quest removed the lid from the box and drew out a circular card around the outside edge was a very clever pen and ink sketch of a lifebuoy and inside the margin were several sentences of clear handwriting in the middle was the signaturethe clenched hands quest read the message aloud      in the great scheme of things the supreme ruler of the     universe divided an inheritance amongst his children to one he     gave power to another strength to another beauty but to his     favourites he gave cunning  they all looked at one another  what does it mean lenora gasped  a lifebuoy the professor murmured  they both stared at quest who remained silent chewing hard at the end of his cigar  every message he said speaking half to himself has had some significance what does this meana lifebuoy  he was silent for a moment then he turned suddenly to the professor  what did you call those men in the motortruck professorriver pirates and a lifebuoy wait  he crossed the room towards his desk and returned with a list in his hand he ran his finger down it stopped and glanced at the date  the durham he muttered cargo cotton destination southampton sails at high tide on the 16th lenora is that calendar right  its the 16th mr quest she answered  quest crossed the room to the telephone  i want number one central exchange he said thank you put me through to mr frenchs office hullo french ive got an idea can you come round here at once and bring an automobile i want to get down to the docksnot where the passenger steamers start fromlower down good well wait  quest hung up the receiver  see here professor he continued that fellow wouldnt dare to send this message if he wasnt pretty sure of getting off hes made all his plans beforehand but its my belief we shall just get our hands upon him after all lenora youd better get along round to the hospital you dont come in this time its bad enough to have laura laid upcant risk you therell be a little trouble too before were through im afraid  lenora sighed as she picked up her bag  if it werent for laura she said youd find it pretty hard to keep me away i think that if i could see the handcuffs put on that man it would be the happiest moment of my life  well get him all right quest promised remember me to laura  and present my compliments also the professor begged  lenora left them the professor his spirits apparently a little improved by the prospect of action accepted some whisky and a cigar presently they heard the automobile stop outside and french appeared  anything doing he asked  quest showed him the card and the sailing list the inspector nodded  say that fellows some sport he remarked admiringly you wouldnt believe it just to look at him that staircase this afternoon though kind of teaches one not to trust to appearances so you think hes getting a move on him mr quest  i think he had a truck waiting for him at the corner of gayson avenue quest replied it was the machine my men went after the men looked like river thugs although i shouldnt have thought of it if the professor hadnt used the word river pirates its quite clear that they took craig down to the river theres only one likely ship sailing tonight and thats the durham its my belief craigs on her  the inspector glanced at the clock  then weve got to make tracks he declared and pretty quick too shell be starting from somewhere about number twentyeight dock a long way down come along gentlemen  they hurried out to the automobile and started off for the docks the latter part of their journey was accomplished under difficulties for the street was packed with drays and heavy vehicles they reached dock number twentyeight at last however and hurried through the shed on to the wharf there were no signs of a steamer there  wheres the durham quest asked one of the carters who was just getting his team together  the man pointed out to the middle of the river where a small steamer was lying  there she is he replied shell be off in a few minutes youll hear the sirens directly when they begin to move down  quest led the way quickly to the edge of the wharf there was a small tug there the crew of which were just making her fast for the night  fifty dollars if youll take us out to the durham and catch her before she sails quest shouted to the man who seemed to be the captain what do you say  the man spat out a plug of tobacco from his mouth  id take you to hell for fifty dollars he answered tersely step in well make it if you look quick  they clambered down the iron ladder and jumped on to the deck of the tug the captain seized the wheel the two men who formed the crew took off their coats and waistcoats  give it her jim the former ordered now then here goes well just miss the ferry  they swung around and commenced their journey quest stood with his watch in his hand they were getting up the anchor of the durham and from higher up the river came the screech of steamers beginning to move on their outward way  well make it all right the captain assured them  they were within a hundred yards of the durham when quest gave a little exclamation from the other side of the steamer another tug shot away turning back towards new york huddled up in the stern half concealed in a tarpaulin was a man in a plain black suit quest with a little shout recognised the man at the helm from his long brown beard  thats one of those fellows who was in the truck he declared and thats craig in the stern weve got him this time say captain its that tug i want never mind about the steamer catch it and ill make it a hundred dollars  the man swung round the wheel but he glanced at quest a little doubtfully  say what is this show he asked  quest opened his coat and displayed his badge he pointed to the inspector  police job this is inspector french i am sanford quest  good enough the man replied whats the bloke wanted for  murder quest answered shortly  that so the other remarked well youll get him sure hes looking pretty scared too youd better keep your eyes open though i dont know how many men there are on board but that tug belongs to the toughest crew up the river got anything handy in the way of firearms  quest nodded  you dont need to worry he said weve automatics here but as long as were heading them this way theyll know the games up  weve got her the captain exclaimed theres the ferry and the first of the steamers coming down in the middle theyll have to chuck it  right ahead of them blazing with lights a huge ferry came churning the river up and sending great waves in their direction on the other side unnaturally large loomed up the great bows of an oceangoing steamer the tug was swung round and they ran up alongside the man with the beard leaned over  say whats your trouble he demanded  the inspector stepped forward  i want that man youve got under the tarpaulin he announced  say you aint the river police  im inspector french from headquarters was the curt reply the sooner you hand him over the better for you  do you hear that otoole the other remarked swinging round on his heel get up you blackguard  a man rose from underneath the oilskin he was wearing craigs clothes but his face was the face of a stranger as quick as lightning quest swung round in his place  hes fooled us again he exclaimed head her round captainback to the durham  the sailor shook his head  weve lost our chance guvnor he pointed out look  quest set his teeth and gripped the inspectors arm the place where the durham had been anchored was empty already half a mile down the river with a trail of light behind and her siren shrieking the durham was standing out seawards     chapter ix  the inherited sin   1  getting kind of used to these courthouse shows arent you lenora quest remarked as they stepped from the automobile and entered the house in georgia square  lenora shrugged her shoulders she was certainly a very differentlooking person from the tired trembling girl who had heard macdougal sentenced not many weeks ago  could anyone feel much sympathy she asked with those men red gallagher as they all called him is more like a great brute animal than a human being i think that even if they had sentenced him to death i should have felt that it was quite the proper thing to have done  too much sentiment about those things quest agreed clipping the end off a cigar men like that are better off the face of the earth they did their best to send me there  heres a cablegram for you lenora exclaimed bringing it over to him mr quest i wonder if its from scotland yard  quest tore it open they read it together lenora standing on tiptoe to peer over his shoulder      stowaway answering in every respect your description of craig     found on durham has been arrested as desired and will be     taken to hamblin house for identification by lord ashleigh     reply whether you are coming over and full details as to     charge  good for scotland yard quest declared so theyve got him eh all the same that fellows as slippery as an eel lenora how should you like a trip across the ocean eh  i should love it lenora replied do you mean it really  quest nodded  the fellows fooled me pretty well he continued but somehow i feel that if i get my hands on him this time theyll stay there till he stands where red gallagher did today i dont feel content to let anyone else finish off the job got any relatives over there  i have an aunt in london lenora told him the dearest old lady you ever knew shed give anything to have me make her a visit  quest moved across to his desk and took up a sailing list he studied it for a few moments and turned back to lenora  send a cable off at once to scotland yard he directed sayam sailing on lusitania tomorrow hold prisoner charge very serious have full warrants  lenora wrote down the message and went to the telephone to send it off as soon as she had finished quest took up his hat again  come on he invited the machines outside well just go and look in on the professor and tell him the news poor old chap im afraid hell never be the same man again  he must miss craig terribly lenora observed as they took their places in the automobile and yet mr quest it does seem to me a most amazing thing that a man so utterly callous and cruel as craig must be should have been a devoted and faithful servant to anyone through all these years  quest nodded  i am beginning to frame a theory about that you see all the time craig has lived with the professor he has been a sort of dabbler with him in his studies where the professors gone right into a thing and understood it craig you see hasnt managed to get past the first crust his brain wasnt educated enough for the subjects into the consideration of which the professor may have led him see what im driving at  you mean that he may have been mad lenora suggested  something of that sort quest assented seems to me the only feasible explanation the professors a bit of a terror you know there are some queer stories about the way he got some of his earlier specimens in south america science is his god what he has gone through in some of those foreign countries no one knows quite enough to unbalance any man of ordinary nerves and temperament  the professor himself is remarkably sane lenora observed  precisely quest agreed but then you see his brain was big enough to start with it could hold all there was for it to hold its like pouring stuff into the wrong receptacle when a man like craig tries to follow him however thats only a theory here we are and the front door wide open i wonder how our friends feeling today  they found the professor on his hands and knees upon a dusty floor carefully arranged before him were the bones of a skeleton each laid in some appointed place he had a chart on either side of him and a third one on an easel he looked up a little impatiently at the sound of the opening of the door but when he recognised quest and his companion the annoyance passed from his face  are we disturbing you mr ashleigh quest enquired  the professor rose to his feet and brushed the dust from his knees  i shall be glad of a rest he said simply you see what i am doing i am trying to reconstruct from memoryand a little imagination perhapsthe important part of my missing skeleton its a wonderful problem which those bones might have solved if i had been able to place them fairly before the scientists of the world do you understand much about the human frame mr quest  quest shook his head promptly  still life doesnt interest me he declared bones are bones after all you know i dont even care who my grandfather was much less who my grandfather a million times removed might have been lets step into the study for a moment professor if you dont mind he went on lenora here is a little sensitive to smell and a spray of lavender water on some of your bones wouldnt do them any harm  the professor ambled amiably towards the door  i never notice it myself he said very likely that is because i see beyond these withered fragments into the prehistoric worlds whence they came i sit here alone sometimes and the curtain rolls up and i find myself back in one of those far corners of south america or even in a certain spot in east africa and i can almost fancy that time rolls back like an unwinding reel and there are no secrets into which i may not look and then the moment passes and i remember that this dryasdust world is shrieking always for proofsthis extraordinary conglomeration of human animals in weird attire with monstrous tastes and extraordinary habits who make up what they call the civilized world civilized  they reached the study and quest produced his cigar case  cant imagine any world that existed before tobacco he remarked cheerfully help yourself professor it does me good to see you human enough to enjoy a cigar  the professor smiled  i never remember to buy any for myself he said but one of yours is always a treat miss lenora i am glad to see is completely recovered  i am quite well thank you mr ashleigh lenora replied i am even forgetting that i ever had nerves i have been in the courthouse all the morning and i even looked curiously at your garage as we drove up  very goodvery good my dear the professor murmured at the courthouse eh were those charming friends of yours from bethel being tried quest  quest nodded  red gallagher and his mate yes they got it in the neck too  personally the professor exclaimed his eyes sparkling with appreciation of his own wit i think that they ought to have got it round the neck however let us be thankful that they are disposed of their attack upon you mr quest introduced rather a curious factor into our troubles even now i find it a little difficult to follow the workings of our friend frenchs mind it seems hard to believe that he could really have imagined you guilty  french is all right quest declared he fell into the common error of the detective without imagination  what about that unhappy man craig the professor asked gloomily isnt the durham almost due now  quest took out the cablegram from his pocket and passed it over the professors fingers trembled a little as he read it he passed it back however without immediate comment  you see they have been cleverer over there than we were quest remarked  perhaps the professor assented they seem at least to have arrested the man even now i can scarcely believe that it is craigmy servant craigwho is lying in an english prison do you know that his people have been servants in the ashleigh family for some hundreds of years  quest was clearly interested say id like to hear about that he exclaimed you know im rather great on heredity professor what class did he come from then were his people just domestic servants always  the professors face was for a moment troubled he moved to his desk rummaged about for a time and finally produced an ancient volume  this really belongs to my brother lord ashleigh he explained he brought it over with him to show me some entries concerning which i was interested it contains a history of the hamblin estate since the days of cromwell and here in the back you see is a list of our farmers bailiffs and domestic servants there was a craig who was a tenant of the first lord ashleigh and fought with him in the cromwellian wars as a trooper and since those days so far as i can see there has never been a time when there hasnt been a craig in the service of our family a fine race they seem to have been until  until when quest demanded  the look of trouble had once more clouded the professors face he shrugged his shoulders slightly  until craigs father he admitted i am afraid i must admit that we come upon a bad piece of family history here silas craig entered the service of my father in 1858 as under gamekeeper here we come upon the first black mark against the name he appears to have lived reputably for some years and then after a quarrel with a neighbour about some trivial matter he deliberately murdered him a crime for which he was tried and executed in 1867 john craig his only son entered our service in 1880 and when i left england accompanied me as my valet  there was a moments silence quest shook his head a little reproachfully  professor he said you are a scientific man you appreciate the significance of heredity yet during all this time when you must have seen for yourself the evidence culminating against craig you never mentioned thisthisdamning piece of evidence  the professor closed the book with a sigh  i did not mention it mr quest he acknowledged because i did not believe in craigs guilt and i did not wish to further prejudice you against him that is the whole and simple truth now tell me what you are going to do about his arrest  lenora and i are sailing tomorrow quest replied we are taking over the necessary warrants and shall bring craig back here for trial  the professor smoked thoughtfully for some moments then he rose deliberately to his feet he had come to a decision he announced it calmly but irrevocably  i shall come with you he announced i shall be glad of a visit to england but apart from that i feel it to be my duty i owe it to craig to see that he has a fair chance and i owe it to the law to see that he pays the penalty if indeed he is guilty of these crimes is miss laura accompanying you too  quest shook his head  from what the surgeons tell us he said it will be some weeks before she is able to travel at the same time i must tell you that i am glad of your decision professor  it is my duty the latter declared i cannot rest in this state of uncertainty if craig is lost to me the sooner i face the fact the better at the same time i will be frank with you notwithstanding all this accumulated pile of evidence i feel in my heart the urgent necessity of seeing him face to face of holding him by the shoulders and asking him whether these things are true we have faced death together craig and i we have done more than thatwe have courted it there is nothing about him i can accept from hearsay i shall go with you to england mr quest   2  the professor rose from his seat in some excitement as the carriage passed through the great gates of hamblin park he acknowledged with a smile the respectful curtsey of the woman who held it open  you have now an opportunity my dear mr quest he said of appreciating one feature of english life not entirely reproducible in your own wonderful country i mean the home life and surroundings of our aristocracy you see these oak trees he went on with a little wave of his hand they were planted by my ancestors in the days of henry the eighth i have been a student of tree life in south america and in the dense forests of central africa but for real character for splendour of growth and hardiness there is nothing in the world to touch the ashleigh oaks  theyre some trees the criminologist admitted  you notice perhaps the smaller ones which seem dwarfed their tops were cut off by the lord of ashleigh on the day that lady jane grey was beheaded queen elizabeth heard of it and threatened to confiscate the estate look at the turf my friend ages have gone to the making of that mossy velvet carpet  wheres the house quest enquired  a mile farther on yet the woods part and make a natural avenue past the bend of the river there the professor pointed out full of trout that river quest how i used to whip that stream when i was a boy  they swept presently round a bend in the avenue before them on the hillside surrounded by trees and with a great walled garden behind was hamblin house quest gave vent to a little exclamation of wonder as he looked at it the older part and the whole of the west front was elizabethan but the georgian architect entrusted with the task of building a great extension had carried out his work in a manner almost inspired lines and curves sweeping everywhere towards the same constructive purpose had been harmonised by the hand of time into a most surprising and effectual unity the criminologist notwithstanding his unemotional temperament repeated his exclamation as he resumed his place in the carriage  this is where youve got us beaten he admitted our country places are like gewgaw palaces compared to this makes me kind of sorry he went on regretfully that i didnt bring lenora along  the professor shook his head  you were very wise he said my brother and lady ashleigh have recovered from the shock of poor lenas death in a marvellous manner i believe but the sight of the girl might have brought it back to them you have left her with friends i hope mr quest  illustration lord ashleigh identifies the captured man as craig  illustration craig disappeared about here sirsaid the gamekeeper  she has an aunt in hampstead the latter explained i should have liked to have seen her safely there myself but we should have been an hour or two later down here and i tell you he went on his voice gathering a note almost of ferocity im wanting to get my hands on that fellow craig i wonder where theyre holding him  at the local policestation i expect the professor replied my brother is a magistrate of course and he would see that proper arrangements were made there he is at the hall door  the carriage drew up before the great front a moment or two later lord ashleigh came forward with outstretched hands the genial smile of the welcoming host upon his lips in his manner however there was a distinct note of anxiety  edgar my dear fellow he exclaimed i am delighted welcome back to your home mr quest i am very happy to see you here you have heard the news of course  we have heard nothing the professor replied  you didnt go to scotland yard lord ashleigh asked  we havent been to london at all quest explained we got on the boat train at plymouth and your brother managed to induce one of the directors whom he saw on the platform to stop the train for us at hamblin road we only left the boat two hours ago theres nothing wrong with craig is there  lord ashleigh motioned them to follow him  please come this way he invited  he led them across the hallwhich dimlylit and with its stainedglass windows was almost like the nave of a cathedralinto the library beyond he closed the door and turned around  i have bad news for you both he announced craig has escaped  neither the professor nor quest betrayed any unusual surprise so far as the latter was concerned his first glimpse at lord ashleighs face had warned him of what was coming  dear me the professor murmured sinking into an easychair this is most unexpected  well get him again quest declared quickly can you let us have the particulars of his escape lord ashleigh the sooner we get the hang of things the better  their host turned towards the butler who was arranging a tray upon the sideboard  you must permit me to offer you some refreshments after your journey he begged then i will tell you the whole story i think you will agree when you hear it that no particular blame can be said to rest upon any ones shoulders it was simply an extraordinary interposition of chance there is tea whisky and soda and wine here mr quest edgar i know youll take some tea  english tea for me the professor remarked watching the cream  whisky and soda here quest decided  lord ashleigh himself attended to the wants of his guests then at his instigation they made themselves comfortable in easychairs and he commenced his narration  you know of course he began that craig was arrested at liverpool in consequence of communications from the new york police i understand that it was with great difficulty he was discovered and it is quite clear that some one on the ship had been heavily bribed however he was arrested brought to london and then down here for purposes of identification i would have gone to london myself and in fact offered to do so but on the other hand as there are many others on the estate to whom he was wellknown i thought that it would be better to have more evidence than mine alone accordingly they left london one afternoon and i sent a dogcart to the station to meet them they arrived quite safely and started for here craig handcuffed to one of the scotland yard men on the back seat and the other in front with the driver about half a mile from the south entrance to the park the road runs across a rather desolate strip of country with a lot of low undergrowth on one side we have had a little trouble with poachers as there is a sort of gipsy camp on some common land a short distance away my headkeeper to whom the very idea of a poacher is intolerable was patrolling this ground himself that afternoon and caught sight of one of these gipsy fellows setting a trap he chased him and more i am sure to frighten him than anything else when he saw that the fellow was getting away he fired his gun just as the dogcart was passing the horse shied the wheel caught a great stone by the side of the road and all four men were thrown out the man to whom craig was handcuffed was stunned but craig himself appears to have been unhurt he jumped up took the key of the handcuffs from the pocket of the officer undid them and slipped off into the undergrowth before either the groom or the other scotland yard man had recovered their senses to cut a long story short that was last thursday and up till now not a single trace of the fellow has been discovered  quest rose abruptly to his feet  id like to take this matter up right on the spot where craig disappeared he suggested couldnt we do that  by all means lord ashleigh agreed touching a bell we have several hours before we change for dinner i will have a car round and take you to the spot  the professor acquiesced readily and very soon they stepped out of the automobile on to the side of a narrow road looking very much as it had been described further on beyond a stretch of open common they could see the smoke from the gipsy encampment on their lefthand side was a stretch of absolutely wild country bounded in the far distance by the grey stone wall of the park lord ashleigh led the way through the thicket talking as he went  craig came along through here he explained the groom and the scotland yard man who had been sitting by his side followed him they searched for an hour but found no trace of him at all then they returned to the house to make a report and get help i will now show you how craig first eluded them  he led the way along a tangled path doubled back plunged into a little spinney and came suddenly to a small shed  this is an ancient gamekeepers shelter he explained built a long time ago and almost forgotten now what craig did without a doubt was to hide in this the scotland yard man who took the affair in hand found distinct traces here of recent occupation that is how he made his first escape  quest nodded  sure he murmured well now what about your more extended search  i was coming to that lord ashleigh replied as edgar will remember no doubt i have always kept a few bloodhounds in my kennels and as soon as we could get together one or two of the keepers and a few of the local constabulary we started off again from here the dogs brought us without a check to this shed and started off again in this way  they walked another half a mile across a reedy swamp every now and then they had to jump across a small dyke and once they had to make a detour to avoid an osier bed they came at last to the river  now i can show you exactly how that fellow put us off the scent here their guide proceeded he seems to have picked up something edgar in those south american trips of yours for a cleverer thing i never saw you see all these bullrushes everywhereclouds of them all along the river  we call them tules quest muttered well  when craig arrived here lord ashleigh continued he must have heard the baying of the dogs in the distance and he knew that the game was up unless he could put them off the scent he cut a quantity of these bullrushes from a place a little further behind those trees there stepped boldly into the middle of the water waded down to that spot where as you see the trees hang over stood stock still and leaned them all around him it was dusk when the chase reached the river bank and i have no doubt the bullrushes presented quite a natural appearance at any rate although the dogs came without a check to the edge of the river where he stepped off they never picked the scent up again either on this side or the other we tried them for four or five hours before we took them home the next morning while the place was being thoroughly searched we came upon the spot where these bullrushes had been cut down and we found them caught in the low boughs of a tree drifting down the river  the professors tone was filled with something almost like admiration  i must confess he declared i never realised for a single moment that craig was a person of such gifts in all the small ways of life in campaigning camping out dealing with natural difficulties incidental to our expeditions i have found him invariably a person of resource readywitted and full of useful suggestions but that he should be able to apply his gifts with such infinite cunning to a suddenly conceived career of crime i must admit amazes me  quest had lit a fresh cigar and was smoking vigorously  what astonishes me more than anything he pronounced as he stood looking over the desolate expanse of country is that when one comes face to face with the fellow he presents all the appearance of a nerveless and brokendown coward then all of a sudden there spring up these evidences of the most amazing the most diabolical resource whos this lord ashleigh  the latter turned his head an elderly man in a brown velveteen suit with gaiters and thick boots raised his hat respectfully  this is my headkeeper middleton his master explained he was with us on the chase  the professor shook hands heartily with the newcomer  not a day older middleton he exclaimed so you are the man who has given us all this trouble eh this gentleman and i have come over from new york on purpose to lay hands on craig  i am very sorry sir the man replied i wouldnt have fired my gun if i had known what the consequences were going to be but them poaching devils that come round here rabbiting fairly send me furious and thats a fact it aint that one grudges them a few rabbits but my tame pheasants all run out here from the home wood and ive seen feathers at the side of the road there that no fox nor stoat had nothing to do with all the same sir im very sorry he added to have been the cause of any inconvenience  it is rather worse than inconvenience middleton the professor said gravely the man who has escaped is one of the worst criminals of these days  he wont get far sir the gamekeeper remarked with a little smile its a wild bit of country this and i admit that men might search it for weeks without finding anything but those gentlemen from scotland yard sir if youll excuse my making the remark and hoping that this gentleman he added looking at quest is in no way connected with themwell they dont know everything and thats a fact  this gentleman is from the united states lord ashleigh reminded him so your criticism doesnt affect him bytheby middleton i heard this morning that youd been airing your opinions down in the village you seem to rather fancy yourself as a thiefcatcher  i wouldnt go so far as that my lord the man replied respectfully but still i hope i may say that ive as much common sense as most people you see sir he went on turning to quest the spots where he could emerge from this track of country are pretty well guarded and hell be in a fine mess when he does put in an appearance to show himself upon a public road yet by this time i should say he must be nigh starved sooner or later hell have to come out for food ive a little scheme of my own sir i dont mind admitting the man concluded with a twinkle in his keen brown eyes im not giving it away if i catch him for you thats all thats wanted i imagine and we shant be any the nearer to it for letting any one into my little secret  his master smiled  you shall have your rise out of the police if you can middleton he observed it seems queer though to believe that the fellows still in hiding round here  as though by common consent they all stood for a moment perfectly still looking across the stretch of marshland with its boggy places its scrubby plantations its clustering masses of tall grasses and bullrushes the grey twilight had become even more pronounced during the last few minutes little wreaths of white mist hung over the damp places everywhere was a queer silence the very air seemed breathless the professor shivered and turned away  my nerves he declared are scarcely what they were i have listened in a primeval forest listened for the soft rustling of a snake in the undergrowth or the distant roar of some beast of prey i have listened then with curiosity i have not known fear it seems to me somehow that in this place there is something different afoot i dont like it georgei dont like it we will go home if you please  they made their way single file to the road and up to the house lord ashleigh did his best to dispel a queer little sensation of uneasiness which seemed to have arisen in the minds of all of them  come he said we must put aside our disappointment for the present and remember that after all the chances are that craig will never make his escape alive let us forget him for a little while mr quest he added a few minutes later as they reached the hall moreton here will show you to your room and look after you please let me know if you will take an aperitif i can recommend my sherry we dine at eight oclock edgar you know your way the blue room of course i am coming up with you myself her ladyship back yet moreton  not yet my lord  lady ashleigh her husband explained has gone to the other side of the county to open a bazaar she is looking forward to the pleasure of welcoming you at dinnertime                                       dinner served out of compliment to their transatlantic visitor in the great banqueting hall was to quest especially a most impressive meal they sat at a small round table lit by shaded lights in the centre of an apartment which was large in reality and which seemed vast by reason of the shadows which hovered around the unlit spaces from the walls frowned down a long succession of family portraitsashleighs in the queer tudor costume of henry the seventh ashleighs in chain armour sword in hand a charger waiting regardless of perspective in the near distance ashleighs befrilled and bewigged ashleighs in the court dress of the georgesjudges sailors statesmen and soldiers a collection of armour which would have gladdened the eye of many an antiquarian was ranged along the blackpanelled walls everything was in harmony even the grave precision of the solemnfaced butler and the powdered hair of the two footmen quest perhaps for the first time in his life felt almost lost hopelessly out of touch with his surroundings an alien and a struggling figure nevertheless he entertained the little party with many stories he struggled all the time against that queer sensation of anachronism which now and then became almost oppressive  the professors pleasure at finding himself once more amongst these familiar surroundings was obvious and intense the conversation between him and his brother never flagged there were tenants and neighbours to be asked after matters concerning the estate on which he demanded information even the very servants names he remembered  it was a queer turn of fate george he declared as he held out before him a wonderfully chased glass filled with amber wine which sent you into the world a few seconds before me and made you lord of ashleigh and me a struggling scientific man  the world has benefited by it lord ashleigh remarked with more than fraternal courtesy we hear great things of you over here edgar we hear that you have been on the point of proving most unpleasant things with regard to our origin  oh there is no doubt about that the professor observed where we came from and where we are going to are questions which no longer afford room for the slightest doubt to the really scientific mind what sometimes does elude us is the nature of our tendencies while we are here on earth  mine i fancy are obvious enough lord ashleigh interposed  superficially i grant it his brother acknowledged as a matter of scientific fact i recognize the probability of your actually being a person utterly different from what you appear man becomes what he is according to the circumstances by which he is assailed now your life here george must be a singularly uneventful one  not during the last six months lord ashleigh remarked with a sigh even these last few days have been exciting enough i must confess that they have left me with a queer sort of nervousness i find myself listening intently sometimesconscious as it were of the influence or presence of some indefinite danger  very interesting the professor murmured spiritualism as an exact science has always interested me very much  lady ashleigh made a little grimace  dont encourage george she begged he is much too superstitious as it is  there was a brief silence the port had been placed upon the table and coffee served the servants according to the custom of the house had departed the great apartment was empty even quest was impressed by some peculiar significance in the longdrawnout silence he looked around him uneasily the frowning regard of that long line of painted warriors seemed somehow to be full of menace there was something grim too in the sight of those empty suits of armour  i may be superstitious lord ashleigh said but there are times especially just lately when i seem to find a new and hateful quality in silence what is it i wonder i ask you but i think i know it is the conviction that there is some alien presence something disturbing lurking close at hand  he suddenly rose to his feet pushed his chair back and walked to the window which opened level with the ground he threw it up and listened the others came over and joined him there was nothing to be heard but the distant hooting of an owl and farther away the barking of some farmhouse dog lord ashleigh stood there with straining eyes gazing out across the park  there was something here he muttered something which has gone whats that quest your eyes are younger than mine can you see anything underneath that tree  quest peered out into the grey darkness  i fancied i saw something moving in the shadow of that oak he muttered wait  he crossed the terrace swung down on to the path across a lawn over a wire fence and into the park itself all the time he kept his eyes fixed on a certain spot when at last he reached the tree there was nothing there he looked all around him he stood and listened for several moments a more utterly peaceful night it would be hard to imagine slowly he made his way back to the house  i imagine we are all a little nervous tonight he remarked theres nothing doing out there  they strolled about for an hour or more looking into different rooms showing their guest the finest pictures even taking him down into the wonderful cellars they parted early but quest stood for a few moments before retiring gazing about him with an air almost of awe his great room as large as an apartment in an italian palace was lit by a dozen wax candles in silver candlesticks his fourposter was supported by pillars of black oak carved into strange forms and surmounted by the ashleigh coronet and coat of arms he threw his windows open wide and stood for a moment looking out across the park more clearly visible now by the light of the slowly rising moon there was scarcely a breeze stirring scarcely a sound even from the animal world nevertheless quest too as reluctantly he made his preparations for retiring for the night was conscious of that queer sensation of unimagined and impalpable danger     chapter x  lost in london   1  quest notwithstanding the unusual nature of his surroundings slept that night as only a tired and healthy man can he was awakened the next morning by the quiet movements of a manservant who had brought back his clothes carefully brushed and pressed he sat up in bed and discovered a small china tea equipage by his side  whats this he enquired  your tea sir  quest drank half a cupful without protest  your bath is ready at any time sir  im coming right along quest replied jumping out of bed  the man held up a dressinggown and escorted him to an unexpectedly modern bathroom at the end of the corridor when quest returned his toilet articles were all laid out for him with prim precision the window was wide open the blinds drawn and a soft breeze was stealing through into the room below him the park looking more beautiful than ever in the morning sunshine stretched away to a vista of distant meadowlands and cornfields with here and there a little farmhouse and outbuildings gathered snugly together the servant who had heard him leave the bathroom reappeared  is there anything further i can do for you sir he enquired  nothing at all thanks quest assured him what times breakfast  breakfast is served at nine oclock sir it is now halfpast eight  the man withdrew and quest made a brisk toilet the nameless fears of the previous night had altogether disappeared to his saner morning imagination the atmosphere seemed somehow to have become cleared of that cloud of mysterious depression he was whistling to himself from sheer lightheartedness as he turned to leave the room then the shock came at the last moment he stretched out his hand to take a handkerchief from his satchel a sudden exclamation broke from his lips he stood for a moment as though turned to stone before him on the top of the little pile of white cambric was a small black box with a movement of the fingers which was almost mechanical he removed the lid and drew out the customary little scrap of paper he smoothed it out before him on the dressingcase and read the message      you will fail here as you have failed before better go back     there is more danger for you in this country than you dream of  his teeth came fiercely together and his hands were clenched his thoughts had gone like a flash to lenora was it possible that harm was intended to her he put the idea away from him almost as soon as conceived the thing was unimaginable craig was here must be here in the close vicinity of the house he could have had no time to communicate with confederates in london lenora at any rate was safe then he glanced around the room and thought for a moment of his own danger in the dead of the night as he had slept mysterious feet had stolen across his room mysterious hands had placed those few words of half mocking warning in that simple hidingplace it would have been just as easy he reflected with a grim little smile for those hands to have stretched their deathdealing fingers over the bed where he had lain asleep he looked once more out over the park somehow its sunny peace seemed to have become disturbed the strange sense of foreboding which he in common with the others had carried about with him last night had returned  the atmosphere of the pleasant breakfastroom to which in due course he descended was cheerful enough lady ashleigh had already taken her place at the head of the table before a glittering array of silver tea and coffee equipage the professor with a plate in his hand was making an approving survey of the contents of the dishes ranged upon the sideboard  an english breakfast my dear quest he remarked after they had exchanged the usual greetings will i am sure appeal to you i am not i confess given to the pleasures of the table but if anything could move me to enthusiasm in dietary matters the sight of your sideboard my dear sisterinlaw would do so i commend the bacon and eggs to you quest or if you prefer sausages those long thin ones are homemade and delicious does mrs bland still cure our hams julia  her daughter does lady ashleigh replied smiling we are almost selfsupporting here all our daily produce of course comes from the home farm tea or coffee mr quest  coffee if you please quest decided returning from his visit to the sideboard is lord ashleigh a late riser  not by any means his wife declared he very often gets up and rides in the park before breakfast i dont know where he is this morning he didnt even come in to see me i think we must send up  she touched an electric bell under her foot and a moment or two later the butler appeared  go up and see how long your master will be lady ashleigh directed  very good your ladyship  the man was backing through the doorway in his usual dignified manner when he was suddenly pushed to one side the valet who had waited upon quest and who was lord ashleighs own servant rushed into the room his face was white he had forgotten all decorum he almost shouted to lady ashleigh  your ladyshipthe master something has happened he wont move hehe  they all rose to their feet quest groaned to himself the black box  what do you mean lady ashleigh faltered what do you mean williams  the man shook his head he seemed almost incapable of speech  something has happened to the master  they all trooped out of the room and up the stairs the professor leading the way they pushed open the door of lord ashleighs bedchamber in the far corner of the large room was the fourposter and underneath the clothes a silent figure the professor turned down the sheets then he held out his hand his face too was blanched  julia dont come he begged  i must know she almost shrieked i must know  george is dead the professor said slowly  there was a moments awful silence broken by a piercing scream from lady ashleigh she sank down upon the sofa and the professor leaned over her quest turned to the little group of frightened servants who were gathering round the doorway  telephone for a doctor he ordered also to the local policestation  illustration for gods sake come my master has been strangled to death  illustration lady ashleigh i will find and bring to justice the criminal  he too approached the bed and reverently lifted the covering lord ashleigh was lying there his body a little doubled up his arms wide outstretched on his throat were two black marks  where is the valetwilliams quest asked as he turned away  the man came forward  tell us at once what you know quest demanded  i came in as usual to call his lordship before i called you the man replied he did not answer but i thought perhaps that he was sleepy i filled his bath which as you see opens out of the room and then came to attend on you when you went down to breakfast i returned to his lordships room expecting to find him dressed instead of that the room was silent the bath still unused i spoke to himthere was no answer then i lifted the sheet  they had led lady ashleigh from the room the professor and quest stood face to face the formers expression however had lost all his amiable serenity his face was white and pinched he looked shrivelled up it was as though some physical stroke had fallen upon him  quest quest he almost sobbed my brothergeorge whom i loved like nobody else on earth is he really dead  absolutely  the professor gripped the oak pillar of the bedstead he seemed on the point of collapse  the mark of the hands is upon his throat quest pointed out  the hands oh my god the professor groaned  we must not eat or drink or sleep quest declared fiercely until we have brought this matter to an end craig must be found this is the supreme horror of all pull yourself together mr ashleigh we shall need every particle of intelligence we possess i begin to think that we are fighting against something superhuman  the butler made an apologetic appearance he spoke in a hushed whisper  you are wanted downstairs gentlemen middleton the headkeeper is there  as though inspired with a common idea both quest and the professor hurried out of the room and down the broad stairs their inspiration was a true one the gamekeeper welcomed them with a smile of triumph by his side the picture of abject misery his clothes torn and muddy was craig  ive managed this little job sir middleton announced with a smile of slow triumph  how did you get him quest demanded  little idea of my own the gamekeeper continued i guessed pretty well what hed be up to hed tumbled to it that the usual way off the moor was pretty well guarded and hed doubled back through the thin line of woods close to the house i dug one of my poachers pits sir and covered it over with a lot of loose stuff that got him all right when i went to look this morning i saw where hed fallen through and there he was walking round and round at the bottom like a caged animal your servants have telephoned for the police mr ashleigh he went on turning to the professor but id like you just to point out to the scotland yard gentlemancalled us yokels he did when he first came downthat weve a few ideas of our own down here  quest suddenly whispered to the professor then he turned to the keeper  bring him upstairs middleton for a moment he directed follow us please  the professor gripped quests arm as they ascended the stairs  what is this he asked hoarsely what is it you wish to do  its just an idea of my own quest replied i rather believe in that sort of thing i want to confront him with the result of his crime  the professor stopped short his eyes were halfclosed  it is too horrible he muttered  nothing could be too horrible for an inhuman being like this quest answered tersely i want to see whether hell commit himself  they passed into the bedchamber quest signed to the keeper to bring craig to the side of the fourposter then he drew down the sheet  is that your work he asked sternly  craig up till then had spoken no word he had shambled to the bedside a broken yet in a sense a stolid figure the sight of the dead man however seemed to galvanise him into sudden and awful vitality he threw up his arms his eyes were horrible as they glared at those small black marks his lips moved helplessly at first then at last he spoke  strangled he cried one more  that is your work the criminologist said firmly  craig collapsed he would have fallen bodily to the ground if middletons grip had not kept him up quest bent over him it was clear that he had fainted they led him from the room  wed better lock him up until the police arrive quest suggested i suppose there is a safe place somewhere  the professor awoke from his stupor  let me show you he begged i know the way weve a subterranean hidingplace which no criminal on this earth could escape from  they led him down to the back part of the house a miserable dejected procession holding candles over their heads they descended two sets of winding stone steps passed along a gloomy corridor till they came to a heavy oak door which moreton the butler who carried the keys opened with some difficulty it led into a dry cellar which had the appearance of a prison cell there was a single bench set against the wall quest looked around quickly  this place has been used before now in the old days for malefactors the professor remarked hell be safe there craig he added his voice trembling craigii cant speak to you how could you  there was no answer craigs face was buried in his hands they left him there and turned the key   2  quest stood frowning upon the pavement gazing at the obviously empty house he looked once more at the slip of paper which lenora had given him there was no possibility of any mistake      mrs willet     157 elsmere road     hampstead  this was 157 and the house was empty after a moments hesitation he rang the bell at the adjoining door a woman who had been watching him from the front room answered the summons at once  can you tell me he enquired what has become of the lady who used to live at 157mrs willet  shes moved was the uncompromising reply  do you know where to quest asked eagerly  west kensingtonnumber 17 princes court road there was a young lady here yesterday afternoon enquiring for her  quest raised his hat it was a relief at any rate to have news of lenora  i am very much obliged to you madam  youre welcome was the terse reply  quest gave the new address to the taxidriver and was scarcely able to restrain his impatience during the long drive they pulled up at last before a somewhat dingylooking house he rang the bell which was answered by a trimlooking little maidservant  is mrs willet in he enquired  the maidservant stood on one side to let him pass almost at the same moment the door of the front room opened and a pleasantlooking elderly lady appeared  i am mrs willet she announced  i am mr quest the criminologist told her quickly you may have heard your niece lenora speak of me  then perhaps you can tell me what has become of her mrs willet observed  isnt she here  mrs willet shook her head  i had a telegram from her from new york to say that she was coming but ive seen nothing of her as yet  youve changed your address you know quest reminded her after a moments reflection  i wrote and told her mrs willet began after all though she went on thoughtfully i am not sure whether she could have had the letter but if she went up to hampstead any one would tell her where i had moved to theres no secret about me  lenora did go up to 157 elsmere road yesterday quest told her they gave her your address here as they have just given it to me  then whats become of the child mrs willet demanded  quest whose brain was working quickly scribbled upon one of his cards the address of the hotel where he had taken rooms and passed it over  why lenora didnt come on to you here i cant imagine he said however ill go back to the hotel where she was to spend the night after she arrived she may have gone back there thats my address mrs willet if you hear anything i wish youd let me know lenoras quite a particular friend of mine and i am a little anxious  mrs willet smiled knowingly  ill let you know certainly sir she promised and glad i shall be to hear of lenoras being comfortably settled after that first unfortunate affair of hers youll excuse me a moment im a little slower in my wits than you did you say that lenora was at hampstead yesterday afternoon and they told her my address  thats so quest admitted  the womans face grew troubled  i dont like it she said simply  neither do i quest agreed  londons no place nowadays mrs willet continued for girls as pretty as lenora to be wandering about in such tales as there have been lately in the sunday papers as makes ones blood run cold if one can believe them all  you dont have anywhat we call the white slave trafficover here do you quest asked quickly  i cant say that ive ever come across any case of it myself sir the old lady replied i was housekeeper to the duke of merioneth for fifty years and where we lived we didnt hear much about london and london ways you see i never came to the town house but since i retired and came up here and took to reading the sunday papers i begin to be thankful that my ways have been country ways all my life  no need to alarm ourselves im sure quest intervened making his way towards the door lenora is a particularly capable young lady i feel sure shed look after herself i am going right back to the hotel mrs willet and ill let you know directly i hear anything  i shall be very anxious mr quest she reminded him earnestly very anxious indeed lenora was my sisters favourite child and my sister  quest had already opened the front door for himself and passed out he sprang into the taxi which he had kept waiting  cliffords hotel in payne street he told the man sharply  he lit a cigar and smoked furiously all the way throwing it on to the pavement as he hurried into the quiet private hotel which a fellowpassenger on the steamer had recommended as being suitable for lenoras one night alone in town  can you tell me if miss lenora macdougal is staying here he asked at the office  the woman shook her head  miss macdougal stayed here the night before last she said and her luggage is waiting for orders she left here yesterday afternoon to go to her aunts and promised to send for her things later on during the day there they stand all ready for her  quest followed the direction of the womans finger lenoras familiar little belongings were there standing in a corner of the hall  you havent heard from her then since she went out yesterday afternoon he asked with sinking heart  no sir  what time did she go  directly after an early lunch it must have been about two oclock  quest hurried away so after all there was some foundation for this queer sense of depression which had been hovering about him for the last few days  scotland yard he told the taxidriver  he thrust another cigar between his teeth but forgot to light it he was amazed at his own sensations conscious of fears and emotions of which he would never have believed himself capable he gave in his card and after a few moments delay he was shown into the presence of one of the chiefs of the detective department who greeted him warmly  my name is hardaway the latter announced glad to meet you mr quest weve heard of you over here take a chair  to tell you the truth quest replied my business is a little urgent  glad to hear youve got that fellow craig mr hardaway continued ridiculous the way he managed to slip through our fingers i understand youve got him all right now though  he is safe enough quest declared but to tell you the truth im worried about another little affair  go on the other invited  my assistant a young lady miss lenora macdougal has disappeared she and i and professor ashleigh left the steamer at plymouth and travelled up in the boat train it was stopped at hamblin road for the professor and myself and miss macdougal came on to london she was staying at cliffords hotel in payne street for the night and then going on to an aunt well ive found that aunt she was expecting the girl but the girl never appeared i have been to the hotel where she spent the night before last and i find that she left there at two oclock and left word that she would send for her luggage she didnt arrive at her aunts and the luggage is still uncalled for  illustration quest fights his way to the girl he loves  illustration as the professor explained the cellars history to quest the stone cross closed on the frightened servant  the inspector was at first only politely interested it probably occurred to him that young ladies have been known before now to disappear from their guardians for a few hours without serious results  where did this aunt live he enquired  number 17 princes court road west kensington quest replied she had just moved there from elsmere road hampstead i went first to hampstead lenora had been there and learnt her aunts correct address in west kensington i followed on to west kensington and found that her aunt was still awaiting her  a new interest seemed suddenly to have crept into hardaways manner  let me see he said if she left cliffords hotel about two she would have been at hampstead about halfpast two she would waste a few minutes in making enquiries then she probably left hampstead for west kensington say at a quarter to three  somewhere between those two points quest pointed out she has disappeared  give me at once a description of the young lady mr hardaway demanded  quest drew a photograph from his pocket and passed it silently over the official glanced at it and down at some papers which lay before him then he looked at the clock  mr quest he said it is just possible that your visit here has been an exceedingly opportune one  he snatched his hat from a rack and took quest by the arm  come along with me he continued well talk as we go  they entered a taxi and drove off westwards  mr quest he went on for two months we have been on the track of a man and a woman whom we strongly suspect of having decoyed half a dozen perfectly respectable young women and shipped them out to south america  the white slave traffic quest gasped  something of the sort hardaway admitted well weve been closing the net around this interesting couple and last night i had information brought to me upon which we are acting this afternoon weve had them watched and it seems that they were sitting in a tea place about three oclock yesterday afternoon when a young woman entered who was obviously a stranger to london you see the time fits in exactly if your assistant decided to stop on her way to kensington and get some tea she asked the woman at the desk the best means of getting to west kensington without taking a taxicab her description tallies exactly with the photograph you have shown me the woman whom my men were watching addressed her and offered to show her the way they left the place together my men followed them the house has been watched ever since and we are raiding it this afternoon you and i will just be in time  youve left her there since yesterday afternoon youve left her there all night quest exclaimed my god  hardaway touched his arm soothingly  dont worry mr quest he said we dont want the woman alone we want the man too now the man was away he only visits the house occasionally and i am given to understand that he is a member of several west end clubs when the two women entered that house yesterday afternoon there wasnt a soul in it except servants the woman telephoned for the man he never turned up last night nor this morning he arrived at that house twenty minutes ago  quest drew a little breath  it gave me a turn he admitted say this is a slow taxi  the inspector glanced out of the window  if this is the young lady youre looking for he said youll be in plenty of time never fear what i am hoping is that we may be able to catch my fellows before they try to rush the place you understand with your experience mr quest that there are two things weve got to think of we not only want to put our hand upon the guilty persons but we want to bring the crime home to them  i see that quest assented how much farther is this place  were there hardaway told him  he stopped the cab and they got out a man who seemed to be strolling aimlessly along reading a newspaper suddenly joined them  well dixon his chief exclaimed  the man glanced around  ive got three men round at the back mr hardaway he said its impossible for any one to leave the place  anything fresh to tell me  there are two men in the place besides the governorbutler and footman dressed in livery they sleep out and only come after lunch  hardaway paused to consider for a moment  look here quest suggested they know all you of course and theyll never let you in until theyre forced to im a stranger let me go ill get in all right  hardaway peered around the corner of the street  all right he assented we shall follow you up pretty closely though  quest stepped back into the taxi and gave the driver a direction when he emerged in front of the handsome grey stone house he seemed to have become completely transformed there was a fatuous smile upon his lips he crossed the pavement with difficulty stumbled up the steps and held on to the knocker with one hand while he consulted a slip of paper he had scarcely rung the bell before a slightly parted curtain in the front room fell together and a moment later the door was opened by a man in the livery of a butler but with the face and physique of a prizefighter  lady of the house quest demanded want to see the lady of the house  almost immediately he was conscious of a woman standing in the hall before him she was quietly but handsomely dressed her hair was grey her smile although a little peculiar was benevolent  you had better come in she invited please do not stand in the doorway  quest however who heard the footsteps of the others behind him loitered there for a moment  youre the lady whose name is on this piece of paper he demanded this place is all right eh  i really do not know what you mean the woman replied coldly but if you will come inside i will talk to you in the drawingroom  quest as though stumbling against the frontdoor had it now wide open and in a moment the hall seemed full the woman shrieked the butler suddenly sprang upon the last man to enter and sent him spinning down the steps almost at that instant there was a scream from upstairs quest took a running jump and went up the stairs four at a time the butler suddenly snatched the revolver from hardaways hand and fired blindly in front of him missing quest only by an inch or two  dont be a fool karl the woman called out the games up take it quietly  once more the shriek rang through the house quest rushed to the door of the room from whence it came tried the handle and found it locked he ran back a little way and charged it from inside he could hear a turmoil of voices white with rage and passion he pushed and kicked madly there was the sound of a shot from inside a bullet came through the door within an inch of his head then the crash of broken crockery and a mans groan with a final effort quest dashed the door in and staggered into the room lenora was standing in the far corner the front of her dress torn and blood upon her lip she held a revolver in her hand and was covering a man whose head and hands were bleeding around him were the debris of a broken jug  mr quest she screamed dont go near himive got him covered im all right  quest drew a long breath the man who stood glaring at him was welldressed and still young he was unarmed however and quest secured him in a moment  the girls mad he said sullenly no one wanted to do her any harm  hardaway and his men came trooping up the stairs quest relinquished his prisoner and went over to lenora  ive been so frightened she sobbed they got me in herethey told me that this was the street in which my aunt livedand they wouldnt let me go the woman was horrible and this afternoon this man came the brute  he hasnt hurt you quest demanded fiercely as he passed his arm around her  she shook her head  he would never have done that she murmured i had my hatpin in my gown and i should have killed myself first  quest turned to hardaway  ill take the young lady away he said you know where to find us  hardaway nodded and quest supported lenora down the stairs and into the taxicab which was still waiting she leaned back and he passed his arm around her  are you faint he asked anxiously as they drove towards the hotel  a little she admitted not very but oh i am so thankfulso thankful  he leaned a little nearer towards her she looked at him wonderingly suddenly the colour flushed into her cheeks  i couldnt have done without you lenora he whispered as he kissed her  lenora had almost recovered when they reached the hotel walking up and down they found the professor his face as he came towards them was almost pitiful he scarcely noticed lenoras deshabille which was in a measure concealed by the cloak which quest had thrown around her  my friend he exclaimedmr quest it is the devil incarnate against whom we fight  what do you mean quest demanded  the professor wrung his hands  i put him in our james the second prison he declared why should i think of the secret passage no one has used it for a hundred years he found it learnt the trick  you mean quest cried  he has escaped the professor broke in craig has escaped again they are searching for him high and low but he has gone  quests arm tightened for a moment in lenoras it was curious how he seemed to have lost at that moment all sense of proportion lenora was safethe relief of that one thought overshadowed everything else in the world  the fellow cant get far he muttered  who knows the professor replied dolefully the passageill show it you some day and youll see how wonderful his escape has beenleads on to the first floor of the house he must have got into my dressingroom for his old clothes are there and he went away in a suit of mine no one has seen him or knows anything about him all that the local police can find out is that a man answering somewhat his description caught the morning train for southampton from hamblin roads  they had been standing together in a little recess of the hall suddenly lenora whose face was turned towards the entrance doors gave a little cry she took a quick step forward  laura she exclaimed wonderingly why its laura  they all turned around a young woman had just entered the hotel followed by a porter carrying some luggage her arm was in a sling and there was a bandage around her forehead she walked too with the help of a stick she recognized them at once and waved it gaily  hullo you people she cried soon run you to earth eh  they were for a moment dumbfounded lenora was the first to find words but when did you start laura she asked i thought you were too ill to move for weeks  the girl smiled contemptuously  i left three days after you on the kaiser frederic she replied there was some trouble at plymouth and we came into southampton early this morning and here i am but before we go any farther tell me about craig  weve had him quest confessed and lost him again he escaped last night  where from laura asked  hamblin house  is that anywhere near the south coast the girl demanded excitedly  its not far away quest replied quickly why  ill tell you why laura explained i was as sure of it as any one could be craig passed me in southampton water this morning being rowed out to a steamer not only that but he recognized me i saw him draw back and hide his face but somehow i couldnt believe that it was really he i was just coming down the gangway and i nearly fell into the sea i was so surprised  quest was already turning over the pages of a timetable  what was the steamer he demanded  i found out laura told him i tell you i was so sure of its being craig that i made no end of enquiries it was the barton bound for india with first stop at port said  when does she sail quest asked  tonightsomewhere about seven laura replied  quest glanced at the clock and threw down the timetable he turned towards the door they all followed him  im for southampton he announced im going to try to get on board that steamer before she sails lenora youd better go upstairs and lie down theyll give you a room here dont you stir out till i come back professor what about you  i shall accompany you the professor declared the discomforts of travelling without luggage are nothing compared with the importance of discovering this human fiend  luggagepshaw laura exclaimed who cares about that  and nothing lenora declared firmly as she caught at quests arm would keep me away  ill telephone to scotland yard in case they care to send a man down quest decided we must remember though he reminded them that it will very likely be a wildgoose chase  it wont be the first laura observed grimly but craigs on board that ship all right  they caught a train to southampton where they were joined by a man from scotland yard the little party drove as quickly as possible to the docks  where does the barton start from quest asked the piermaster  the man pointed a little way down the harbor  shes not in dock sir he said shes lying out yonder youll barely catch her im afraid he added glancing at the clock  they hurried to the edge of the quay  look here quest cried raising his voice ill give a ten pound note to any one who gets me out to the barton before she sails  the little party were almost thrown into a tug and in a few minutes they were skimming across the smooth water just as they reached the steamer however she began to move  run up alongside quest ordered  she wont stop sir the captain of the tug replied doubtfully she is an hour late as it is  do as i tell you quest insisted  they raced along by the side of the great steamer an officer came to the rail and shouted down to them  what do you want  the captain quest replied  the captain came down from the bridge where he had been conferring with the pilot  keep away from the side there he shouted who are you  we are in search of a desperate criminal whom we believe to be on board your steamer quest explained please take us on board  the captain shook his head  are you from scotland yard he asked have you got your warrant  we are from america quest answered but weve got a scotland yard man with us and a warrant right enough  any extradition papers  no time to get them yet quest replied but the mans wanted for murder  are you from the new york police  quest shook his head  i am a private detective he announced i am working in conjunction with the new york police  the captain shook his head  i am over an hour late he said and its costing me fifty pounds a minute if i take you on board youll have to come right along with me unless you find the fellow before weve left your tug behind  quest turned around  will you risk it he asked  yes they all replied  were coming captain quest decided  a rope ladder was let down the steamer began to slow  can you girls manage it quest asked doubtfully  laura smiled  i should say so she replied i can go up that with only one arm you watch me  they cheered her on board the steamer as she hobbled up the others followed the tug the crew of which had been already well paid raced along by the side the captain spoke once more to the pilot and came down from the bridge  im forced to go full speed ahead to cross the bar he told quest im sorry but the tides just on the turn  they looked at one another a little blankly  the professor however beamed upon them all  i have always understood he said that port said is a most interesting place     chapter xi  the ship of horror   quest leaned a little forward and gazed down the line of steamer chairs the professor in a borrowed overcoat and cap was reclining at full length studying a book on seagulls which he had found in the library laura and lenora were both dozing tranquilly mr harris of scotland yard was deep in a volume of detective stories  as a pleasure cruise quest remarked grimly this little excursion seems to be a complete success  laura opened her eyes at once  trying to get my goat again eh she retorted i suppose thats what youre after going to tell me i suppose that it wasnt craig i saw board this steamer  we are all liable to make mistakes quest observed and i am inclined to believe that this is one of yours  lauras expression was a little dogged  if hes too clever for you and mr harris she said i cant help that i only know that he came on board my eyes are the one thing in life i do believe  if youll excuse my saying so miss laura harris ventured leaning deferentially towards her there isnt a passenger on board this ship or a servant or one of the crew whom we havent seen weve been into every stateroom and weve even searched the hold weve been over the ship backwards and forwards the captains own steward has been our guide and weve conducted an extra search on our own account personally i must say i have come to the same conclusion as mr quest at the present moment there is no such person as the man we are looking for on board this steamer  then he either changed on to another one laura declared obstinately or else he jumped overboard  harris who was a very polite man gazed thoughtfully seaward quest smiled  when lauras set on a thing he remarked she takes a little moving what do you think about it professor  the professor laid down his book keeping his finger in the place he had the air of a man perfectly content with himself and his surroundings  my friend he said i boarded this steamer with only one thought in my mindcraig at the present moment i feel myself compelled to plead guilty to a complete change of outlook the horrors of the last few months seem to have passed from my brain like a dream i lie here i watch these whitewinged birds wheeling around us i watch the sunshine make jewels of the spray i breathe this wonderful air i relax my body to the slow soothing movements of the boat and i feel a new life stealing through me is craig really on board was it really he whom miss laura here saw at the present moment i really do not care i learn from the steward who arranged my bath this morning that we are bound for india i am very glad to hear it it is some time since i saw bombay and the thought of these long days of complete peace fills me with a most indescribable satisfaction  quest grunted a little as he knocked the ash from his cigar  not much of the bloodhound about the professor he remarked what about you lenora  she smiled at him  i agree entirely with the professor she murmured except that i am not quite so sure that i appreciate the rhythmical movement of the boat as he seems to for the rest i have just that feeling that i would like to go on and on and forget all the horrible things that have happened to live in a sort of dream and wake up in a world from which craig had vanished altogether  enervating effect this voyage seems to be having upon you all quest grumbled even harris there looks far too well contented with life  the detective smiled he was young and freshcoloured with a shrewd but pleasant face he glanced involuntarily at laura as he spoke  well mr quest he said i didnt bring you on the steamer so i dont feel any responsibility about it but i must confess that i am enjoying the trip i havent had a holiday this year  quest struggled to his feet and threw back the rug in his chair  if you all persist in turning this into a pleasure cruise he remarked i suppose ill have to alter my own point of view come on harris you and i promised to report to the captain this morning i dont suppose hell be any too pleased with us lets get through with it  the two men walked down the deck together they found the captain alone in his room with a chart spread out in front of him and a pair of compasses in his hand he turned round and greeted them  well  no luck sir quest announced your steward has given us every assistance possible and we have searched the ship thoroughly unless he has found a hiding place unknown to your steward and not apparent to us the man is not on board  the captain frowned slightly  you are not suggesting that that is possible i suppose  quest did not at once reply he was thinking of lauras obstinacy  personally he admitted i should not have believed it possible the young lady of our party however who declares that she saw craig board the steamer is quite immovable  the captain rose to his feet he was a man of medium height strongly built with short brown beard and keen blue eyes  this matter must be cleared up entirely he declared brusquely if you will excuse me for a moment i will talk to the young lady myself  he walked firmly down the deck to where the two girls were seated and paused in front of laura  so youre the young lady he remarked touching his cap who thinks that i come to sea with criminals stowed away on my ship  i dont know what your habits are captain laura replied but this particular criminal boarded your ship all right in southampton harbour  anything wrong with your eyesight the captain enquired blandly  no laura assured him i saw the man saw him just as plainly as i see you now  do you know the captain persisted that mr quest and mr harris have searched every nook and corner of the ship they have had an absolutely free hand and my own steward has been their guide they have seen every man boy woman and animal amongst my crew or passengers  theyve been fooled somehow laura muttered  the captain frowned he was on the point of a sharp rejoinder when he met lauras eyes she was smiling very faintly and there was something in her expression which changed his whole point of view  ill go and make a few enquiries myself he declared see you at dinnertime i hope young ladies  if you keep her as steady as this laura promised there are hopes  he disappeared along the deck and presently reentered his room where harris and quest were waiting for him he was followed by his steward an undersized man with pallid complexion and nervous manner he closed the door behind him  brown he said turning to the steward i understand you to say that you have taken these gentlemen into every corner of the ship that you have ransacked every possible hidingplace that you have given them every possible opportunity of searching for themselves  that is quite true sir the man acknowledged  you agree with me that it is impossible for any one to remain hidden in this ship  absolutely sir  you hear gentlemen the captain continued i really can do no more it is perfectly clear to me that the man you are seeking is not on my ship your very charming young lady friend seems to think it impossible that she could have been mistaken but as a matter of fact she was if i might take the liberty mr quest i would suggest that you ask her at any rate to keep her suspicions to herself  ill see she doesnt talk quest promised very sorry to have given you all this trouble im sure  its no trouble the captain replied and apart from the disagreeable nature of your business i am delighted to have you on board if you can forget your suspicions about this fellow craig i shall do my best to make your trip a pleasant one as far as port said or on to india if you decide to take the trip with me  very good of you captain im sure quest pronounced we shall go on keeping our eyes open of course but apart from that well forget the fellow  the captain nodded  i am coming down to dinner tonight he announced and shall hope to find you in your places what the mischief are you hanging about for brown he asked turning to the steward who was standing by with a carpetsweeper in his hand  room wants cleaning out badly sir  the captain glanced distastefully at the carpetsweeper  do it when i am at dinner then he ordered and take that damned thing away  the steward obeyed promptly quest and harris followed him down the deck  queerlooking fellow that the latter remarked doesnt seem quite at his ease does he  seemed a trifle overanxious i thought when he was showing us round the ship quest agreed  mm harris murmured softly as the gentleman who wrote the volume of detective stories i am reading puts it wed better keep our eye on brown  the captain who was down to dinner unusually early rose to welcome quests little party and himself arranged the seats  you miss lenora he said will please sit on my left and you miss laura on my right mr quest will you sit on the other side of miss laura and mr harris two places down on my left there is an old lady who expects to be at the table but the steward tells me she hasnt been in yet  they settled down into the places arranged for them harris was looking a little glum lenora and quest exchanged a meaning glance  im not sure that i appreciate this arrangement harris whispered to his neighbour  you may be candid lenora replied but you arent very polite are you  harris almost blushed as he realized his slip  i am sorry he said but to tell you the truth he added glancing towards quest i fancied that you were feeling about the same  we women are poor dissemblers lenora murmured do look how angry this old woman seems  an elderly lady dressed in somewhat oppressive black with a big cameo brooch at her throat and a black satin bag in her hand was being shown by the steward to a seat by quests side she acknowledged the captains greeting acidly  good evening captain she said i understood from the second steward that the seat on your right hand would be reserved for me i am mrs foston rowe  the captain received the announcement calmly  very pleased to have you at the table madam he replied as to the seating i leave that entirely to the steward i never interfere myself  laura pinched his arm and lenora glanced away to hide a smile mrs foston rowe studied the menu disapprovingly  hors doeuvres she declared i never touch no one knows how long theyve been opened bouilloni will have some bouillon steward  in one moment madam  the professor just then came ambling along towards the table  i fear that i am a few moments late he remarked as he took the chair next to mrs foston rowe i offer you my apologies captain i congratulate you upon your library i have discovered a most interesting book upon the habits of seagulls it kept me engrossed until the very last moment  very disagreeable habits those ive noticed mrs foston rowe sniffed  madam the professor assured her yours is but a superficial view for myself i must confess that the days upon which i learn something new in life are days of happiness for me today is an example i have learnt something new about seagulls and i am hungry  well youll have to stay hungry a long time at this table then mrs foston rowe snapped seems to me that the service is going to be abominable  the steward who had just arrived presented a cup of bouillon to quest the others had all been served quest stirred it thoughtfully  and as to the custom mrs foston rowe continued of serving gentlemen before ladies it is i suppose peculiar to this steamer  quest hastily laid down his spoon raised the cup of bouillon and presented it with a little bow to his neighbour  pray allow me madam he begged the steward was to blame  mrs foston rowe did not hesitate for a moment she broke up some toast in the bouillon and commenced to sip it  your politeness will at least teach them a lesson she said i am used to travel by the p  o and from what i have seen of this steamer  the spoon suddenly went clattering from her fingers she caught at the sides of the table there was a strange look in her face with scarcely a murmur she fell back in her seat quest leaned hurriedly forward  captain he exclaimed steward mrs foston rowe is ill  there was a slight commotion the doctor came hurrying up from the other side of the salon he bent over her and his face grew grave  what is it the captain demanded  the doctor glanced at him meaningly  she had better be carried out he whispered  it was all done in a moment there was nothing but mrs foston rowes empty place at the table and the cup of bouillon to remind them of what had happened  was it a faint lenora asked  we shall know directly the captain replied better keep our places i think steward serve the dinner as usual  the man held out his hand to withdraw the cup of bouillon but quest drew it towards him  let it wait for a moment he ordered  he glanced at the captain who nodded back in a few moments the doctor reappeared he leaned down and whispered to the captain  dead  the captain gave no sign  better call it heart failure the doctor continued ill let the people know quietly i dont in the least understand the symptoms though  quest turned around  doctor he said i happen to have my chemical chest with me and some special testing tubes if youll allow me id like to examine this cup of bouillon you might come round too if you will  the captain nodded  id better stay here for a time he decided ill follow you presently  the service of dinner was resumed laura however sent plate after plate away the captain watched her anxiously  i cant help it she explained i dont know whether youve had any talk with mr quest but weve been through some queer times lately i guess this death business is getting on my nerves  the captain was startled  you dont for a moment connect mrs foston rowes death with the criminal you are in search of he exclaimed  laura sat quite still for a moment  the bouillon was offered first to mr quest she murmured  the captain called his steward  where did you get the bouillon you servedthat last cup especially he asked  from the pantry just as usual sir the man answered it was all served out from the same cauldron  any chance of any one getting at it  quite impossible sir  laura rose to her feet  sorry she apologized i cant eat anything im off on deck  the captain rose promptly  ill escort you if i may he suggested  harris too rose from his place after a final and regretful glance at the menu and joined the others the captain however drew lauras arm through his as they reached the stairs and harris with a little shrug of the shoulders made his way to quests stateroom the doctor the professor quest and lenora were all gathered around two little tubes which the criminologist was examining with an electric torch  no reaction at all the latter muttered this isnt an ordinary poison any way  the professor who had been standing on one side suddenly gave vent to a soft exclamation  wait he whispered wait i have an idea  he hurried off to his stateroom the doctor was poring over a volume of tabulated poisons quest was still watching his tubes lenora sat upon the couch suddenly the professor reappeared he was carrying a small notebook in his hand his manner betrayed some excitement he closed the door carefully behind him  i want you all he begged to listen very carefully to me you will discover the application of what i am going to read when i am finished now if you please  they looked at him wonderingly it was evident that the professor was very much in earnest he held the book a little way away from him and read slowly and distinctly  this he began is the diary of a tour made by craig and myself in northern egypt some fourteen years ago here is the first entry of import      monday twentynine miles southeast of port said we have     stayed for two days at a little mongar village i have today     come to the definite conclusion that anthropoid apes were at one     time denizens of this country      tuesday both craig and i have been a little uneasy today     these mongars into whose encampment we have found our way are     one of the strangest and fiercest of the nomad tribes they are     descended without a doubt from the ancient mongolians who     invaded this country some seven hundred years before christ     they have interbred with the arabs to some extent but have     preserved in a marvellous way their individuality as a race     they have the narrow eyes and the thick nose base of the pure     oriental also much of his cunning one of their special     weaknesses seems to be the invention of the most hideous forms     of torture which they apply remorselessly to their enemies  pleasant sort of people quest muttered  we escaped with our lives the professor explained earnestly from these people only on account of an incident which you will find in this next paragraph      wednesday this has been a wonderful day for as chiefly     owing to what i must place on record as an act of great bravery     by craig my servant early this morning a maneating lion     found his way into the encampment the mongars behaved like     arrant cowards they fled right and left leaving the chiefs     little daughter feerda at the brutes mercy craig who is by     no means an adept in the use of firearms chased the animal as     he was making off with the child and more by good luck than     anything else managed to wound it mortally he brought the     child back to the encampment just as the chief and the warriors     of the tribe returned from a hunting expedition our position     here is now absolutely secure we are treated like gods and     appreciating my weakness for all matters of science the chief     has today explained to me many of the secret mysteries of the     tribe amongst other things he has shown me a wonderful secret     poison known only to this tribe which they call veedemzoo it     brings almost instant death and is exceedingly difficult to     trace the addition of sugar causes a curious condensation and     resolves it almost to a white paste the only antidote is a     substance which they use here freely and which is exactly     equivalent to our camphor  the professor closed his book quest promptly rang the bell  some sugar he ordered turning to the steward  they waited in absolute silence the suggestion which the professors disclosure had brought to them was stupefying even quests fingers as a moment or two later he rubbed two knobs of sugar together so that the particles should fall into the tubes of bouillon shook the result was magical the bouillon turned to a strange shade of grey and began slowly to thicken  it is the mongar poison the professor cried with breaking voice  they all looked at one another  craig must be here amongst us quest muttered  and the bouillon lenora cried clasping quests arm the bouillon was meant for you  there seemed to be somehow amongst all of them a curious indisposition to discuss this matter suddenly lenora who was sitting on the lounge underneath the porthole put out her hand and picked up a card which was lying by her side she glanced at it at first curiously then she shrieked  a message she cried a message from the hands look  they crowded around her in that same familiar handwriting was scrawled across the face of the card these few words      to sanford quest      you have escaped this time by a chance of fortune not because     your wits are keen not because of your own shrewdness simply     because fate willed it it will not be for long  underneath was the drawing of the clenched hands  there is no longer any doubt lenora said calmly craig is on board he must have been on deck a few minutes ago it was his hand which placed this card in the porthole listen whats that  there was a scream from the deck they all recognised lauras voice harris was out of the stateroom first but they were all on deck within ten seconds laura was standing with one hand clasping the rail her hand fiercely outstretched towards the lower part of the promenade deck through the darkness they heard the sound of angry voices  what is it laura lenora cried  she swung round upon them  craig she cried craig i saw his face as i sat in my chair there talking to the captain i saw a mans white facenothing else he must have been leaning over the rail he heard me call out and he disappeared  the captain came slowly out of the shadows limping a little and followed by his steward who was murmuring profuse apologies  did you find him laura demanded eagerly  i did not the captain replied a little tersely i ran into brown here and we both had a shakeup  but he was therea second ago laura cried out  i beg your pardon miss brown ventured but the decks closed at the end as you can see with sailcloth and i was leaning over the rail myself when you shrieked there wasnt any one else near me and no one can possibly have passed round the deck as you can see plainly for yourself  laura stood quite still  what doors are there on the side she asked  the doors of my room only the captain replied a little shortly it was brown you saw of course he was standing exactly where you thought you saw craig  laura walked to the end of the deck and back  very well then she said you people had better get a straitwaistcoat ready for me if i didnt see craig there im going off my head  quest had disappeared some seconds ago he came thoughtfully back a little later  captain he asked what shall you say if i tell you that i have proof that craig is on board  the captain glanced at laura and restrained himself  i should probably say a great many things which i should regret afterwards he replied grimly  sit down and well tell you what has happened in my room quest continued  he told the story calmly and without remark the captain held his head  of course im convinced that i am a sane man he said but this sounds more like a munchausen story than anything ive ever heard i suppose you people are all real you are in earnest about this arent you it isnt a gigantic joke  we are in deadly earnest the professor pronounced gravely  i have been down to the pantry quest went on the porthole has been open all day it was just possible for a man to have reached the cups of bouillon as they were prepared that isnt the point however craig is cunning and clever enough for any devilish scheme on earth and that card proves that he is on board  the ship shall be searched the captain declared once more well look into every crack and every cupboard  lenora turned away with a little shiver it was one of her rare moments of weakness  you wont find him you wont ever find him she murmured and i am afraid  lenora grasped the rails of the steamer and glanced downwards at the great barge full of arab sailors and merchandise in the near background were the docks of port said it was their first glimpse of eastern atmosphere and colour  i cant tell you how happy i am she declared to quest to think that this voyage is over every night i have gone to bed terrified  he smiled grimly  things have been quiet enough the last few days he said theres harris on this barge look at laura waving to him  the scotland yard man only glanced up at them he was occupied in leaning over towards laura who was on the deck below  if you said the word he called out i wouldnt be going back miss laura id stick to the ship fast enough  she laughed at him gaily  not you youre longing for your smoky old london already you cut it out my friend youre a good sort and i hope well meet again some day but  she shook her head at him goodhumouredly he turned away disappointed and waved his hand to lenora and quest on the upper deck  coming on shore any of you he enquired  we may when the boat moves up quest replied the professor went off on the first barge here he is coming back  a little boat had shot out from the docks manned by a couple of arabs they could see the professor seated in the stern he was poring over a small document which he held in his hand he waved to them excitedly  hes got news quest muttered  with much shouting the boat was brought to the side of the barge the professor was hauled up he stumbled blindly across towards the gangway and came up the steps with amazing speed he came straight to quest and lenora and gripped the former by the arm  look he cried look  he held out a card quest read it aloud      there is not one amongst you with the wit of a mongar child     goodbye      the hands  where did you get it quest demanded  thats the pointthe whole point the professor exclaimed excitedly hes done us hes landed that paper was pushed into my hand by a tall arab who mumbled something and hurried off across the docks on the landingstage mind  the captain came and put his head out of the door  mr quest he said can you spare me a moment you can all come if you like  they moved up towards him the captain closed the door of his cabin he pointed to a carpetsweeper which lay against the wall  look at that he invited  they lifted the top inside were several sandwiches and a small can of tea  what on earth is this quest demanded  the captain without a word led them into his inner room a huge lounge stood in one corner he lifted the valance underneath were some crumbs  you see he pointed out theres room there for a man to have hidden especially if he could crawl out on deck at night i couldnt make out why the dickens brown was always sweeping out my room and i took up this thing a little time ago and looked at it this is what i found  wheres brown quest asked quickly  i rang down for the chief steward the captain continued and ordered brown to be sent up at once the chief steward came himself instead it seems brown went off without his wages but with a huge parcel of bedding on the first barge this morning before any one was about  quest groaned as he turned away  captain he declared i am ashamed he has been here all the time and weve let him slip through our fingers girls he went on briskly turning towards laura who had just come up indias off well catch this barge if theres time our luggage can be put on shore when the boat docks  the captain walked gloomily with them to the gangway  i shall miss you all he told laura  she laughed in his face  if you ask me i think youll be glad to be rid of us  not of you miss laura he insisted  she made a little grimace  youre as bad as mr harris she declared well come for another trip with you some day  they left him leaning disconsolately over the rails the professor and quest sat side by side on one of the trunks which was piled up on the barge  professor quest asked how long would it take us to get to this mongar village you spoke about  two or three days if we can get camels the other replied i see you agree with me then as to craigs probable destination  quest nodded  what sort of fellows are they any way he asked will it be safe for us to push on alone  with me the professor assured him you will be safe anywhere i speak a little of their language i have lived with them they are far more civilized than some of the interior tribes  well find a comfortable hotel where we can leave the girls quest began  you can cut that out laura interrupted i dont know about the kid here but if you think im going to miss a camel ride across the desert youre dead wrong so thats all there is to it  quest glanced towards lenora she leaned over and took his arm  i simply couldnt be left behind she pleaded ive had quite enough of that  the journey will not be an unpleasant one the professor declared amiably and the riding of a camel is an accomplishment easily acquired so far as i am aware too the district which we shall have to traverse is entirely peaceable  they disembarked and were driven to the hotel still discussing their project afterwards they all wandered into the bazaars along the narrow streets where dusky children pulled at their clothes and ran by their side where every now and then a brownskinned arab on a slowmoving camel made his way through the throngs of veiled turkish women syrians arabs and egyptians laura and lenora at any rate attracted by the curious novelty of the scene forgot the heat the street smells and the filthy clothes of the mendicants and loafers who pressed against them they bought strange jewellery shawls beads and perfumes the professor had disappeared for some time but rejoined them later  it is all arranged he announced i found a dragoman whom i know we shall have four of the best camels and a small escort ready to start tomorrow morning furthermore i have news an englishman whose description precisely tallies with craigs started off only an hour ago in the same direction this time at any rate craig cannot escape us  he might go on past the mongar camp quest suggested  the professor shook his head  the mongar village he explained is placed practically at a culdesac so far as regards further progress southwards without making a detour it is flanked by a strip of jungle and desert on either side in which there are no wells for many miles we shall find craig with the mongars  they made their way back to the hotel dined in a cool bare room and sauntered out again into the streets the professor led the way to a little building outside which a man was volubly inviting all to enter  you shall see one of the sights of port said he promised this is a real egyptian dancing girl  they took their seats in the front row of a dimlylit barelooking room the stage was dark and empty from some unseen place came the monotonous rhythm of a single instrument they waited for some time in vain at last one or two lights in front were lit the music grew more insistent a girl who seemed to be dressed in little more than a winding veil glided on to the stage swaying and moving slowly to the rhythm of the monotonous music she danced a measure which none of them except the professor had ever seen before coming now and then so close that they could almost feel her hot breath and lenora felt somehow vaguely disturbed by the glitter of her eyes an odd perfume was shaken into the air around them from her one flowing garment through which her limbs continually flashed lenora looked away  i dont like it she said to quest simply  suddenly laura leaned forward  look at the professor she whispered  they all turned their heads a queer change seemed to have come into the professors face his teeth were gleaming between his parted lips his head was a little thrust forward his eyes were filled with a strange hard light he was a transformed being unrecognisable perturbing even while they watched the girl floated close to where he sat and leaned towards him with a queer mocking smile his hand suddenly descended upon her foot she laughed still more there was a little exclamation from lenora the professors whole frame quivered he snatched the anklet from the girls ankle and bent over it she leaned towards him a torrent of words streaming from her lips the professor answered her in her own language she listened to him in amazement the anger passed she held out both her hands the professor still argued she shook her head finally he placed some gold in her palms she patted him on the cheek laughed into his eyes pointed behind and resumed her dancing the anklet remained in the professors hand  say well get out of this quest said the girls have had enough  the professor made no objection he led the way holding the anklet all the time close to his eyes and turning it round they none of them spoke to him yet they were all conscious of an immense sense of relief when after they had passed into the street he commenced to talk in his natural voice  congratulate me he said i have been a collector of assyrian gold ornaments all my life this is the one anklet i needed to complete my collection it has the double mark of the pharaohs i recognised it at once there are a thousand like it you would think in the bazaars there in reality there may be perhaps a dozen more in all egypt which are genuine  they all looked at one another their relief had grown too poignant for words  early start tomorrow quest reminded them  home and bed for me this moment laura declared  the camels the professor assented will be round at daybreak  lenora a few nights later looked down from the starstrewn sky which seemed suddenly to have dropped so much nearer to them to the shadows thrown across the desert by the dancing flames of their fire  it is the same world i suppose she murmured  a queer little place out of the same world quest agreed listen to those fellows how they chatter  the camel drivers and guides were sitting together in a little group some distance away they had finished their supper and were chattering together now swaying back and forth two of them at least in a state of wild excitement  whatever can they be talking about laura asked they sound as though they were going to fight every second  the professor smiled  the last one was talking about the beauty of his fat lady friend he remarked drily just before they were discussing whether they would be given any backsheesh in addition to their pay we are quite off the ordinary routes here and these fellows arent much used to europeans  laura rose to her feet  im going to get a drink she announced  the dragoman who had been hovering around bowed gravely and pointed towards the waterbottles lenora also rose  im coming too she decided it seems a sin to think of going to sleep though the whole place is like a great silent sea i suppose this isnt a dream is it laura  theres no dream about my thirst any way laura declared  she took the horn cup from the dragoman  have some yourself if you want to hassan she invited  hassan bowed gravely filled a cup and drank it off he stood for a moment perfectly still as though something were coming over him which he failed to understand then his lips parted his eyes for a moment seemed to shoot from out of his dusky skin he threw up his arms and fell over on his side laura who had only sipped her cup threw it from her she too reeled for a moment the professor and quest came running up attracted by lenoras shriek  theyre poisoned she cried  the veedemzoo quest shouted my god pull yourself together laura hold up for a minute  he dashed back to their little encampment and reappeared almost immediately he threw lauras head back and forced some liquid down her throat  its camphor he cried youll be all right laura hold on to yourself  he swung round to where the dragoman was lying forced his mouth open but it was too latethe man was dead he returned to laura she stumbled to her feet she was pale and drops of perspiration were standing on her forehead she was able to rise to her feet however without assistance  i am all right now she declared  quest felt her pulse and her forehead they moved back to the fire  we are within a dozen miles or so of the mongar village quest said grimly do you suppose that fellow could have been watching  they all talked together for a time in low voices the professor was inclined to scout the theory of craig having approached them  you must remember he pointed out that the mongars hate these fellows it was part of my arrangement with hassan that they should leave us when we got in sight of the mongar encampment it may have been meant for hassan the mongars hate the dragomen who bring tourists in this direction at all  they talked a little while longer and finally stole away to their tents to sleep outside the camel drivers talked still chattering away walking now and then around hassans body in solemn procession finally one of them who seemed to have taken the lead broke into an impassioned stream of words the others listened when he had finished there was a low murmur of fierce approval silentfooted as though shod in velvet they ran to the tethered camels stacked the provisions once more upon their backs lashed the guns across their own shoulders soon they stole awaya long ghostly processioninto the night  those fellows seem to have left off their infernal chattering all of a sudden quest remarked lazily from inside the tent  the professor made no answer he was asleep     chapter xii  a desert vengeance   1  quest was the first the next morning to open his eyes to grope his way through the tent opening and stand for a moment alone watching the alabaster skies away eastwards the faint curve of the bloodred sun seemed to be rising out of the limitless sea of sand the light around him was pearly almost opalescent fading eastwards into pink the shadows had passed away though the sands were still hot beneath his feet the silent air was deliciously cool he turned lazily around meaning to summon the arab who had volunteered to take hassans place his armshe had been in the act of stretchingfell to his sides he stared incredulously at the spot where the camels had been tethered there were no camels no drivers no arabs there was not a soul nor an object in sight except the stark body of hassan which they had dragged half out of sight behind a slight knoll high up in the sky above were two little black specks wheeling lower and lower quest shivered as he suddenly realised that for the first time in his life he was looking upon the winged ghouls of the desert lower and lower they came he turned away with a shiver  the professor was still sleeping when quest reentered the tent he woke him up and beckoned him to come outside  dear me the former exclaimed genially as he adjusted his glasses i am not sure that my toilethowever the young ladies i imagine are not yet astir you did well to call me quest this is the rose dawn of egypt i have watched it from solitudes such as you have never dreamed of after all we are here scarcely past the outskirts of civilisation  youll find we are far enough quest remarked grimly what do you make of this professor  he pointed to the little sandy knoll with its sparse covering of grass desertedwith scarcely a sign even that it had been the resting place of the caravan the professor gave vent to a little exclamation  our guides he demanded and the camels what has become of them  i woke you up to ask you that question quest replied but i guess its pretty obvious we might have saved the money we gave for those rifles in port said  the professor hurried off towards the spot where the encampment had been made suddenly he stood still and pointed with his finger in the clearer almost crystalline light of the coming day they saw the track of the camels in one long unbroken line stretching away northwards  no river near where they could have gone to water the camels or anything of that sort i suppose quest asked  the professor smiled  nothing nearer than a little stream you may have heard of in the days when you studied geography he observed derisivelythe nile i never liked the look of those fellows quest they sat and talked and crooned together after hassans death i felt that they were up to some mischief  he glanced around a little helplessly quest took a cigar from his case and lit it  to think that an old campaigner like i am the professor continued in a tone of abasement should be placed in a position like this there have been times when for weeks together i have slept literally with my finger upon the trigger of my rifle when i have laid warning traps in case the natives tried to desert in the night i have even had our pack ponies hobbled i have learnt the secret of no end of devices and here with a shifty lot of arabs picked up in the slums of port said and hassan the dragoman dying in that mysterious fashion i permit myself to lie down and go to sleep i do not even secure my rifle quest i shall never forgive myself  no good worrying quest sighed the question is how best to get out of the mess whats the next move anyway  the professor glanced towards the sun and took a small compass from his pocket he pointed across the desert  thats exactly our route he said but i reckon we still must be two days from the mongars and how we are going to get there ourselves much more get the women there without camels i dont know there are no wells and i dont believe those fellows have left us a single tin of water  any chance of falling in with a caravan quest enquired  not one in a hundred the professor replied gloomily if we were only this short distance out of port said and on one of the recognised trade routes we should probably meet halfadozen before midday here we are simply in the wilds the way we are going leads to nowhere and finishes in an utterly uninhabitable jungle  think wed better turn round and try and bisect one of the trade routes quest suggested  the professor shook his head  we should never know when wed struck it there are no milestones or telegraph wires we shall have to put as brave a face on it as possible and push on  laura put her head out of the tent in which the two women had slept  say wheres breakfast she exclaimed i cant smell the coffee  they turned and approached her silently the two girls fully dressed came out of the tent as they approached  young ladies the professor announced i regret to say that a misfortune has befallen us a misfortune which we shall be able without a doubt to surmount but which will mean a day of hardship and much inconvenience  where are the camels lenora asked breathlessly  gone quest replied  and the arabs  gone with themwe are left high and dry quest explained those fellows are as superstitious as they can be and hassans death has given them the scares they have gone back to port said  and what is worse the professor added with a groan they have taken with them all our stores our rifles and our water  how far are we from the mongar camp lenora asked  about a days tramp quest replied quickly we may reach there by nightfall  then lets start walking at once before it gets any hotter lenora suggested  quest patted her on the back they made a close search of the tents but found that the arabs had taken everything in the way of food and drink except a single halffilled tin of drinking water they moistened their lips with this carefully quest with the camphor in his hand they found it good however though lukewarm laura produced a packet of sweet chocolate from her pocket  its some breakfast this she remarked as she handed it round lets get a move on  and if i may be permitted to make the suggestion the professor advised not too much chocolate it is sustaining i know but this sweetened concoction encourages thirst and it is thirst which we have most tofrom which we may suffer most inconvenience  one two threemarch laura sung out come on everybody  they started bravely enough but by midday their little stock of water was gone and their feet were sorely blistered no one complained however and the professor especially did his best to revive their spirits  we have come further than i had dared to hope in the time he announced fortunately i know the exact direction we must take keep up your spirits young ladies at any time now we may see signs of our destination  makes one sad to think of the drinks we could have had quest muttered whats that  the whole party stopped short before them was a distant vision of white houses of little stunted groves of trees the masts of ships in the distance  its port said quest exclaimed what the mischiefhave we turned round say professor has your compass got the jimjams  i dont care where it is lenora faltered with tears in her eyes i thought port said was a horrible place but just now i believe its heaven  the professor turned towards them and shook his head  cant you see he pointed out its a miragea desert mirage they are quite common at dusk  lenora for a moment was hysterical and even laura gave a little sob quest set his teeth and glanced at the professor  illustration while we are waiting lets go in and be shocked  illustration you must thank him for your livesthe mongars never take prisoners  always water near where theres a mirage isnt there professor  thats so the professor agreed we are coming to something all right  they struggled on once more night came and brought with it a half soothing half torturing coolness that vain straining of the eyes upon the horizon at any rate was spared to them they slept in a fashion but soon after dawn they were on their feet again they were silent now for their tongues were swollen and talk had become painful their walk had become a shamble but there was one expression in their haggard faces common to all of themthe brave dogged desire to struggle on to the last suddenly quest who had gone a little out of his way to mount a low ridge of sandhills waved his arm furiously he was holding his fieldglasses to his eyes it was wonderful how that ray of hope transformed them they hurried to where he was he passed the glasses to the professor  a caravan he exclaimed i can see the camels and horses  the professor almost snatched the glasses  it is quite true he agreed it is a caravan crossing at right angles to our direction come they will see us before long  lenora began to sob and laura to laugh both were struggling with a tendency towards hysterics the professor and quest marched grimly side by side with every step they took the caravan became more distinct presently three or four horsemen detached themselves from the main body and came galloping towards them the eyes of the little party glistened as they saw that the foremost had a waterbottle slung around his neck he came dashing up waving his arms  you lost people he asked want water  they almost snatched the bottle from him it was like pouring life into their veins they all at the professors instigation drank sparingly quest with a great sigh of relief lit a cigar  some adventure this he declared  the professor who had been talking to the men in their own language turned back towards the two girls  it is a caravan he explained of peaceful merchants on their way to jaffa they are halting for us and we shall be able without a doubt to arrange for water and food and a camel or two horses the man here asks if the ladies will take the horses and ride  they started off gaily to where the caravan had come to a standstill they had scarcely traversed a hundred yards however before the arab who was leading lenoras horse came to a sudden standstill he pointed with his arm and commenced to talk in an excited fashion to his two companions from across the desert facing them came a little company of horsemen galloping fast and with the sunlight flashing upon their rifles  the mongars the arab cried pointing wildly they attack the caravan  the three arabs talked together for a moment in an excited fashion then without excuse or warning they swung the two women to the ground leapt on their horses and turning northwards galloped away already the crack of the rifles and little puffs of white smoke showed them where the mongars advancing cautiously were commencing their attack the professor looked on anxiously  i am not at all sure he said in an undertone to quest about our position with the mongars craig has a peculiar hold upon them but as a rule they hate white men and their blood will be up see the fight is all over those fellows were no match for the mongars most of them have fled and left the caravan  the fight was indeed over four of the mongars had galloped away in pursuit of the arabs who had been the temporary escort of quest and his companions they passed about a hundred yards away waving their arms and shouting furiously one of them even fired a shot which missed quest by only a few inches  they say they are coming back the professor muttered whos this its the chief and  our search is over at any rate quest interrupted its craig  they came galloping up craig in white linen clothes and an arab cloak the chief by his sidea fine upright man with long grey beard behind three mongars their rifles already to their shoulders the chief wheeled up his horse as he came within twenty paces of the little party  white english he shouted why do you seek death here  he waited for no reply but turned to his men three of them dashed forward their rifles which were fitted with an odd sort of bayonet drawn back for the plunge quest snatching his fieldglasses from his shoulders swung them by the strap above his head and brought them down upon the head of his assailant the man reeled and his rifle fell from his hand quest picked it up and stood on guard the other two mongars swung round towards him raising their rifles to their shoulders quest held lenora to him it seemed as though their last second had come suddenly craig who had been a little in the rear galloped shouting into the line of fire  stop he ordered chief these people are my friends chief the word  the chief raised his arm promptly the men lowered their rifles and craig galloped back to his hosts side the chief listened to him nodding gravely presently he rode up to the little party he saluted the professor and talked to him in his own language the professor turned to the others  the chief apologises for not recognising me he announced it seems that craig had told him that he had come to the desert for shelter and he imagined at once when he gave the order for the attack upon us that we were his enemies he says that we are welcome to go with him to his encampment  quest stood for a moment irresolute  seems to me were in a pretty fix he muttered weve got to owe our lives to that fellow craig anyway and how shall we be able to get him away from them goodness only knows  that is for later the professor said gravely at present i think we cannot do better than accept the hospitality of the chief even now the chief is suspicious i heard him ask craig why if these were his friends he did not greet them  craig turned slowly towards them it was a strange meeting his face was thin and worn there were hollows in his cheeks a dull light in his sunken eyes he had the look of the hunted animal he spoke to them in a low tone  it is necessary he told them that you should pretend to be my friends the chief has ordered two of his men to dismount their ponies are for the young ladies there will be horses for you amongst the captured ones from the caravan yonder  so we meet at last craig the professor said sternly  craig raised his eyes and dropped them again he said nothing he turned instead once more towards quest  whatever there may be between us he said your lives are mine at this moment if i chose to take them for the sake of the women do as i advise the chief invites you to his encampment as his guests  they all turned towards the chief who remained a little on the outside of the circle the professor raised his hat and spoke a few words in his own language then he turned to the others  i have accepted the invitation of the chief he announced we had better start                                       this may not be delmonicos laura remarked a few hours later with a little sigh of contentment but believe me that goatstew and sherbet tasted better than any chicken and champagne i ever tasted  and i dont quite know what tobacco this is quest added helping himself to one of a little pile of cigarettes which had been brought in to them but it tastes good  they moved to the opening of the tent and sat looking out across the silent desert laura took the flap of the canvas in her hand  what do all these marks mean she asked  they are cabalistic signs the professor replied part of the language of the tribe they indicate that this is the guest tent and there are a few little maxims traced upon it extolling the virtues of hospitality out in the desert there we met the mongars as foes and we had i can assure you a very narrow escape of our lives here under the shelter of their encampment it is a very different matter we have eaten their salt  its a strange position quest remarked moodily  lenora leaned forward to where a little group of mongars were talking together  i wish that beautiful girl would come and let us see her again she murmured  she the professor explained is the chiefs daughter feerda whose life craig saved  and from the way she looks at him laura observed i should say she hadnt forgotten it either  the professor held up a warning finger the girl herself had glided to their side out of the shadows she faced the professor the rest of the party she seemed to ignore she spoke very slowly and in halting english  my father wishes to know that you are satisfied she said you have no further wants  none the professor assured her we are very grateful for this hospitality feerda  wont you talk to us for a little time lenora begged leaning forward  the girl made no responsive movement she seemed if anything to shrink a little away her head was thrown back her dark eyes were filled with dislike she turned suddenly to the professor and spoke to him in her own language she pointed to the signs upon the tent drew her finger along one of the sentences flashed a fierce glance at them all and disappeared  seems to me we are not exactly popular with the young lady quest remarked what was she saying professor  she suspects us the professor said slowly of wishing to bring evil to craig she pointed to a sentence upon the tent roughly it means gratitude is the debt of hospitality i am very much afraid that the young lady must have been listening to our conversation a while ago  lenora shivered  to think of any girl she murmured caring for a fiend like craig  before they knew it she was there again her eyes on fire her tone shaking  you call him evil he who saved your lives who saved you from the swords of my soldiers she cried i wish that you had all died before you came here i hope that you yet may die  she passed away into the night the professor looked anxiously after her  it is a humiliating reflection he said but we are most certainly in craigs power until we have been able to evolve some scheme for liberating ourselves and taking him with us if possible i think that we had better avoid any reference to him as much as possible that young woman is quite capable of stirring up the whole tribe against us the whole onus of hospitality would pass if they suspected we meant evil to craig and they have an ugly way of dealing with their enemies ah listen  the professor suddenly leaned forward there was a queer change in his face from somewhere on the other side of that soft bank of violet darkness came what seemed to be the clear low cry of some animal  it is the mongar cry of warning he said hoarsely something is going to happen  the whole encampment was suddenly in a state of activity the mongars ran hither and thither getting together their horses the chief with craig by his side was standing on the outskirts of the camp the cry came again this time much louder and nearer soon they caught the muffled trampling of a horses hoofs galloping across the soft sands then the gleam of his white garments as he came suddenly into sight in the edge of the little circle of light thrown by the fire they saw him leap from his horse run to the chief bend double in some form of salute then commence to talk rapidly the chief listened with no sign of emotion but in a moment or two he was giving rapid orders camels appeared from some invisible place men already on horseback were galloping hither and thither collecting firearms and spare ammunition packhorses were being loaded tents rolled up and every evidence of breaking camp  seems to me theres a move on quest muttered as they rose to their feet i wonder if we are in it  a moment or two later craig approached them he came with his shoulders stooped and his eyes fixed upon the ground he scarcely raised them as he spoke  word has been brought to the chief he announced that the arab who escaped from the caravan has fallen in with an outpost of british soldiers they have already started in pursuit of us the mongars will take refuge in the jungle where they have prepared hidingplaces we start at once  what about us the professor enquired  i endeavoured craig continued to persuade the chief to allow you to remain here when the care of you would devolve upon the english soldiers he and feerda however have absolutely refused my request feerda has overheard some of your conversation and the chief believes that you will betray us you will have to come along too  you mean laura exclaimed that weve got to tramp into what you call the jungle and hide there because these thieves are being chased  craig glanced uneasily around  young lady he said you will do well to speak little here they have long ears and quick understandings these men you may call them a race of robbers they only remember that they are the descendants of an imperial race and what they take by the right of conquest they believe allah sends them you must do the bidding of the chief  he turned away towards where the chief and feerda already on horseback were waiting for him quest leaned towards the professor  why not tackle the chief yourself he suggested here he comes now craig may be speaking the truth but on the other hand its all to his interests to keep us away from the soldiers  the professor rose at once to his feet and stepped out to where the chief was giving orders  chief he said my friends desire me to speak with you we are worn out with our adventures the young ladies who are with us are unused to and illprepared for this hard life we beg that you will allow us to remain here and await the arrival of the english soldiers  the chief turned his head there was little friendliness in his tone  wise man he replied i have sent you my bidding by him who is our honoured guest i tell you frankly that i am not satisfied with the explanations i have received of your presence here  feerda leaned forward her beautiful eyes flashing in the dim light  ah but i know she cried they would bring harm to the master i can read it in their hearts as i have heard it from their own lips  what my daughter says is truth the chief declared back wise man and tell your friends that you ride with us tonight either as guests or captives you may take your choice  the professor returned to where the others were eagerly awaiting him  it is useless he announced the girl who is clearly enamoured of craig suspects us so does the chief perhaps secretly craig himself is unwilling to leave us here the chief never changes his mind and he has spoken we go either as his captives or his guests i have heard it said the professor added grimly that the mongars never keep captives longer than twentyfour hours  they all rose at once to their feet and a few moments later horses were brought the little procession was already being formed in line craig approached them once more  you will mount now and ride in the middle of our caravan he directed the chief does not trust you if you value your lives you will do as you are bidden  i dont like the idea of the jungle lenora sighed  gives me the creeps laura admitted as she climbed upon her horse any wild animals there professor  the professor became more cheerful  the animal life of the region we are about to traverse he observed as they moved off is in some respects familiar to me twelve years ago i devoted some time to research a little to the westward of our present route i will if you choose as we ride give you a brief account of some of my discoveries  the two girls exchanged glances quest who had intercepted them turned his horse and rode in between the professor and lenora  go right ahead professor he invited fortunately the girls have got saddles like boxesi think they both mean to go to sleep  an intelligent listener of either sex the professor said amiably will be a stimulus to my memory   2  you can call this fairyland if you want laura remarked gazing around her i call it a nasty damp oozy spot  it seemed very beautiful when we first came lenora sighed but that was after the heat and glare of the desert there does seem something a little unhealthy about it  im just about fed up with mongars quest declared  we do nothing but lie about and they wont even let us fire a gun off  personally the professor confessed holding up a glass bottle in front of him from which a yellow beetle was making frantic efforts to escape i find this little patch of country unusually interesting the specimen which i have herei spare you the scientific name for himbelongs to a class of beetle which has for long eluded me  laura regarded the specimen with disfavour  so far as i am concerned she observed i shouldnt have cared if hed eluded you a little longer dont you dare let him out professor  my dear young lady the professor assured her the insect is perfectly secure through the cork as you see i have bored a couple of holes hoping to keep him alive until we reach port said when i can prepare him as a specimen  port said lenora murmured it sounds like heaven  quest motioned them to sit a little nearer  well he said i fancy we are all feeling about the same except the professor and even he wants to get some powder for his beetle i had a moments talk with craig this morning and from what he says i fancy they mean to make a move a little further in before long itll be all the more difficult to escape then  you think we could get away lenora whispered eagerly  quest glanced cautiously around they were surrounded by thick vegetation but they were only a very short distance from the camp  seems to me he continued we shall have to try it some day or other and im all for trying it soon even if they caught us i dont believe theyd dare to kill us with the english soldiers so close behind i am going to get hold of two or three rifles and some ammunition thats easy because they leave them about all the time and what you girls want to do is to hide some food and get a bottle of water  what about craig the professor asked  we are going to take him along quest declared grimly hes had the devils own luck so far but it cant last forever ill see to that part of the business if you others get ready and wait for me to give the signal whats that  they all looked around there had been a little rustling amongst the canopy of bushes quest peered through and returned frowning  feerda again he muttered she hangs around all the time trying to listen to what we are saying she couldnt have heard this though now girls remember when the food is about this evening see how much you can get hold of i know just where to find the guns and the horses lets separate now the professor and i will go on a beetle hunt  they dispersed in various directions it was not until late in the evening when the mongars had withdrawn a little to indulge in their customary orgy of crooning songs that they were absolutely alone quest looked out of the tent in which they had been sitting and came back again  well  laura lifted her skirt and showed an unusual projection underneath  lenora and i have pinned up our petticoats she announced weve got plenty of food and a bottle of water  quest threw open the white arab cloak which he had been wearing he had three rifles strapped around him  the professors got the ammunition he said and weve five horses tethered a hundred paces along the track we came by just behind the second tree turning to the left i want you all to go there now at once and take the rifles there isnt a soul in the camp and you can carry them wrapped in this cloak ill join you in ten minutes  what about craig the professor enquired  i am seeing to him quest replied  lenora hesitated  isnt it rather a risk she whispered fearfully  quests face was suddenly stern  craig is going back with us he said ill be careful lenora dont worry  he strolled out of the tent and came back again  the coasts clear he announced off you go one moment he added there are some papers in this little box of mine which one of you ought to take care of  he bent hastily over the little wallet which never left him suddenly a little exclamation broke from his lips the professor peered over his shoulder  what is it  quest never said a word from one of the spaces of the wallet he drew out a small black box removed the lid and held out the card they read it together      fools all of you the cunning of the ages defeats your puny     efforts at every turn      the hands  even the professors lips blanched a little as he read quest however seemed suddenly furious he tore the card and the box to pieces flung them into a corner of the tent and drew a revolver from his pocket  this time he exclaimed we are going to make an end of the hands out you go now girls you can leave me to finish things up  one by one they stole along the path quest came out and watched them disappear then he gripped his revolver firmly in his hand and turned towards craigs tent there was something in the breathless stillness of the place at that moment which seemed almost a presage of coming disaster without knowing exactly why quests fingers tightened on the butt of his weapon then from the thick growth by the side of the clearing he saw a dark shape steal out and vanish in the direction of craigs tent he came to a standstill puzzled there had been rumours of lions all day but the professor had been incredulous the nature of the country he thought scarcely favoured the probability of their presence then the still heavy air was suddenly rent by a wild scream of horror across the narrow opening the creature had reappeared carrying something in its mouth something which gave vent all the time to the most awful yells quest fired his revolver on chance and broke into a run already the mongars disturbed in their evening amusement were breaking into the undergrowth in chase quest came to a standstill it was from craigs tent that the beast had issued  he turned slowly around if craig had indeed paid for his crimes by so horrible a death there was all the more reason why they should make their escape in the general confusion and make it quickly he retraced his steps the sound of shouting voices grew less and less distinct when he reached the meeting place he found the professor standing at the corner with the rest his face showed signs of the most lively curiosity  from the commotion he announced i believe that after all a lion has visited the camp the cries which we have heard were distinctly the cries of a native  quest shook his head  a lions been here all right he said and he has finished our little job for us that was craig i saw him come out of craigs tent  the professor was dubious  my friend he said you are mistaken there is nothing more characteristic and distinct than the mongar cry of fear they seldom use it except in the face of death that was the cry of a native mongar as for craig well you see that tree that looks like a dwarfed aloe  quest nodded  what about it  craig was lying there ten minutes ago he sprang up when he heard the yells from the encampment but i believe he is there now  got the horses all right quest enquired  everything is waiting the professor replied  ill have one more try then quest declared  he made his way slowly through the undergrowth to the spot which the professor had indicated close to the trunk of a tree craig was standing feerda was on her knees before him she was speaking to him in broken english  dear master you shall listen to your slave these people are your enemies it would be all over in a few minutes you have but to say the word my father is eager for it no one would ever know  craig patted her head his tone was filled with the deepest despondency  it is impossible feerda he said you do not understand i cannot tell you everything sometimes i almost think that the best thing i could do would be to return with them to the countries you know nothing of  thats what you are going to do any way quest declared suddenly making his appearance hands up  he covered craig with his revolver but his arm was scarcely extended before feerda sprang at him like a little wildcat he gripped her with his left arm and held her away with difficulty  craig he continued youre coming with us you know the way to port said and we want youyou know why untie that sash from your waist quickly  craig obeyed he had the stupefied air of a man who has lost for the time his volition  tie it to the tree quest ordered leave room enough  craig did as he was told then he turned and held the loose ends up quest lowered his revolver for a moment as he pushed feerda toward it craig with a wonderful spring reached his side and kicked the revolver away before quest could even stoop to recover it he saw the glitter of the others knife pressed against his chest  listen craig declared ive made up my mind i wont go back to america ive had enough of being hunted all over the world this time i think ill rid myself of one of you at any rate  will you  the interruption was so unexpected that craig lost his nerve through an opening in the trees only a few feet away lenora had suddenly appeared she too held a revolver her hand was as steady as a rock  drop your knife she ordered craig  he obeyed without hesitation  now tie the sash around the girl  he obeyed mechanically feerda who had been fiercely resisting quests efforts to hold her yielded without a struggle as soon as craig touched her she looked at him however with bitter reproach  you would tie me here she murmured you would leave me  illustration feerda the chiefs daughter listens enraptured to craigs tales of faraway america  illustration craig frantically assisted in dragging people from the burning car  it is fate craig muttered i am worn out with trying to escape feerda they will come soon and release you  she opened her lips to shriek but quest who had made a gag of her linen headdress thrust it suddenly into her mouth he took craig by the collar and led him to the spot where the others were waiting they hoisted him on to a horse already behind them they could see the flare of the torches from the returning mongars  you know the way to port said quest whispered see that you lead us there there will be trouble mind if you dont  craig made no reply he rode off in front of the little troop covered all the time by quests revolver very soon they were out of the jungle and in the open desert quest looked behind him uneasily  to judge by the row those fellows are making he remarked i should think that theyve found feerda already  in that case the professor said gravely let me recommend you to push on as fast as possible we have had one escape from them but nothing in the world can save us now that you have laid hands upon feerda the chief would never forgive that  weve got a start any way quest observed and these are the five best horses in the camp girls a little faster weve got to trust craig for the direction but i believe he is right  so far as my instinct tells me the professor agreed i believe that we are heading in precisely the right direction  they galloped steadily on the moon rose higher and higher until it became almost as light as day often the professor raised himself in his saddle and peered forward  this column of soldiers would march at night he remarked i am hoping all the time that we may meet them  quest fell a little behind to his side although he never left off watching craig  look behind you professor he whispered  in the far distance were a number of little black specks growing every moment larger even at that moment they heard the low long call of the mongars  they are gaining on us quest muttered  the two girls white though they were bent over their horses  well stick to it till the last moment quest continued then well turn and let them have it  they raced on for another mile or more a bullet whistled over their heads quest tightened his reins  no good he sighed wed better stay and fight it out professor stick close to me lenora  they drew up and hastily dismounted the mongars closed in around them a cloud had drifted in front of the moon and in the darkness it was almost impossible to see their whereabouts they heard the chiefs voice  shoot first that dog of a craig  there was a shriek suddenly feerda breaking loose from the others raced across the little division she flung herself from her horse  tell my father that you were not faithless she pleaded they shall not kill you  she clung to craigs neck the bullets were beginning to whistle around them now all of a sudden she threw up her arms craig in a fury turned around and fired into the darkness then suddenly as though on the bidding of some unspoken word there was a queer silence every one was distinctly conscious of an alien soundthe soft thud of many horses feet galloping from the right then a sharp english voice of command  hold your fire men close into the left there steady  the cloud suddenly rolled away from the moon a long line of horsemen were immediately visible the officer in front rode forward  drop your arms and surrender he ordered sternly  the mongars who were outnumbered by twenty to one obeyed without hesitation their chief seemed unconscious even of what had happened he was on his knees bending over the body of feerda half supported in craigs arms the officer turned to quest  are you the party who left port said for the mongar camp he asked  quest nodded  they took us into the junglejust escaped theyd caught us here though and im afraid we were about finished if you hadnt come along we are not englishwere american  same thing the officer replied as he held out his hand stack up their arms men he ordered turning around tie them in twos dennis take the young ladies back to the commissariat camels  the professor drew a little sigh  commissariat he murmured that sounds most inviting     chapter xiii  neath iron wheels   1  side by side they leaned over the rail of the steamer and gazed shorewards at the slowly unfolding scene before them for some time they had all preserved an almost ecstatic silence  oh but its good to see home again laura sighed at last  im with you quest agreed emphatically its the wrong side of the continent perhaps but im aching to set my foot on american soil again  this the wrong side of the continent i should say not laura exclaimed pointing to where in the distance the buildings of the exposition gleamed almost snowwhite in the dazzling sunshine why i have never seen anything so beautiful in my life  the professor intervened amiably his face too shone with pleasure as he gazed landwards  i agree with the young lady he declared the blood and sinews of life may seem to throb more ponderously in new york but there is a big life here on this western side a great wideflung pulsating life there is room here room to breathe  and it is so beautiful lenora murmured  quest glanced a little way along the deck to where a palefaced man stood leaning upon his folded arms gazing upon the same scene there was no smile on craigs face no light of anticipation in his eyes  i guess theres one of us here quest observed who is none too pleased to see america again  lenora shivered a little they were all grave  we must i think admit the professor said that craigs deportment during the voyage has been everything that could be desired he has even voluntarily carried out certain small attentions to my person which i must confess that i had greatly missed  thats all right quest agreed at the same time i am afraid the moment has come now to remind him that the end is drawing near  quest moved slowly down the deck towards craigs side and touched him on the arm  give me your left wrist craig he said quietly  the man slunk away there was a sudden look of horror in his white face he started back but quest was too quick for him in a moment there was the click of a handcuff the mate of which was concealed under the criminologists cuff  youd better take things quietly the latter advised it will only hurt you to struggle step this way a little put your hand in your pocket so and no one will notice  craig obeyed silently they stepped along the deck towards the rest of the party lenora handed her glasses to quest  do look mr quest she begged there is inspector french standing in the front row on the dock with two enormous bunches of flowerscarnations for me i expect and poinsettias for laura theyre the larger bunch  quest took the glasses and nodded  thats french right enough he assented look at him standing straightening his tie in front of that advertisement mirror flowers too say hes got his eye on one of you girls not you by any chance is it lenora  lenora laughed across at laura who had turned a little pink  i guess french has got sense enough to know im not that sort the latter replied the doubleharness stuff doesnt appeal to me and he knows it  lenora made a little grimace as she turned away  well she said its brave talk  almost the professor pointed out amazonian yet in the ancient days even the amazons were sometimes tamed  oh nonsense laura exclaimed turning away i dont see why the man wants to make himself look like a walking conservatory though she added under her breath  and i think its sweet of him lenora insisted if theres anything im longing for its a breath of perfume from those flowers  slowly the great steamer drifted nearer and nearer to the dock hats were waved from the little line of spectators ropes were drawn taut the inspector was standing at the bottom of the gangway as they all passed down he shook hands with every one vigorously then he presented lenora with her carnations and laura with the poinsettias lenora was enthusiastic even laura murmured a few words of thanks  some flowers those poinsettias the inspector agreed  quest gripped him by the arm  french he said i tell you i shall make your hair curl when you hear all that weve been through do you feel like having me start in right away on our way to the cars  french withdrew his arm  nothing doing he replied i want to talk to miss laura you can stow that criminal stuff itll wait all right youve got the fellowthats what matters  quest exchanged an amused glance with lenora the inspector and laura fell a little behind the former took off his hat for a moment and fanned himself  say miss laura he began im a plain man and a poor hand at speeches ive been saying a few nice things over to myself on the dock here for the last hour but everythings gone right out of my head look here it sums up like this how do you feel about quitting this bunch right away and coming back to new york with me  what do i want to go to new york for laura demanded  oh come on miss laura you know what i mean french replied well slip off and get married here and then take this man craig to new york once get him safely in the tombs and well go off on a honeymoon anywhere you say  laura was on the point of laughing at him then the unwonted seriousness of his expression appealed suddenly to her sympathy she patted him kindly on the shoulder  youre a good sort inspector but youve picked the wrong girl ive run along on my own hook ever since i was born i guess and i cant switch my ideas over to this married stuff youd better get a move on and get craig back to new york before he slips us again im going to stay here with the others  the inspector sighed his face had grown long and the buoyancy had passed from his manner  this is some disappointment believe me miss laura he confessed  cheer up she laughed youll get over it all right  they found the others waiting for them at the end of the great wooden shed quest turned to french  look here french he said you know i dont want to hurry you off but i dont know what were going to do with this fellow about in san francisco we dont want to lodge two charges and we should have to put him in jail tonight why dont you take him on right away theres a limited goes by the southern route in an hours time  french assented gloomily  that suits me he agreed youll be glad to get rid of the fellow too he added  they drove straight to the depot found two vacant seats in the train and quest with a little sigh of relief handed over his charge craig who though still dumb had shown signs of intense nervousness since the landing sank back in his corner seat covering the upper part of his head with his hands suddenly lenora who had been chatting with french through the window happened to glance towards craig she gave a little cry and stepped back  look she exclaimed the eyes those are the eyes that haunted me all through those terrible days  she was suddenly white quest passed his arm through hers and glanced through the carriage window in the shaded light craigs eyes seemed indeed to have suddenly grown in power and intensity they shone fiercely from underneath the hands which clasped his forehead  well thats the last youll see of them quest reminded her soothingly come youre not going to break down now lenora weve been through it all and there he is safe and sound in frenchs keeping there is nothing more left in the world to frighten you  lenora pulled herself together with an effort  it was silly she confessed yet even now  dont you worry miss lenora french cried from out of the window you can take my word for it the jobs finished this time goodbye all of you goodbye miss laura  laura waved her hand gaily they all stood and watched the train depart then they turned away from the depot  now for a little holiday quest declared passing lenoras arm through his well just have a look round the city and then get down to san diego and take a look at the exposition there no responsibilities no one to look after nothing to do but enjoy ourselves  capital the professor agreed beaming upon them all there is a collection of fossilised remains in the museum here the study of which will afford me the greatest pleasure and interest  the girls laughed heartily  i think you and i quest suggested turning to them will part company with the professor                                       quest and lenora turned away from the window of the hotel out of which they had been gazing for the last quarter of an hour stretched out before them were the lights of the exposition a blur of twinkling diamonds against the black garb of night beyond the flashing of a lighthouse and a faint background of dark sea  its too beautiful lenora sighed  quest stood for a moment shaking his head the professor with a pile of newspapers stretched out before him was completely engrossed in their perusal laura who had been sitting in an armchair at the further end of the apartment was apparently deep in thought the newspaper which she had been reading had slipped unnoticed from her fingers  say you two are no sort of people for a holiday quest declared as for you laura i cant think whats come over you you never opened your mouth at dinnertime and you sit there now looking like nothing on earth  i am beginning to suspect her lenora chimed in too bad he had to hurry away dear  lauras indignation was not altogether convincing quest and lenora exchanged amused glances the former picked up the newspaper from the floor and calmly turned out the professors lamp  look here he explained this is the first night of our holiday im going to run the party and im going to make the rules no more newspapers tonight or for a fortnight you understand no reading nothing but frivolity and no lovesickness miss laura  lovesickness indeed she repeated scornfully  having arranged those minor details quest concluded on with your hats everybody i am going to take you out to a café where they play the best music in the city we are going to have supper drink one anothers health and try and forget the last few months altogether  lenora clapped her hands and laura rose at once to her feet the professor obediently crossed the room for his hat  i am convinced he said that our friend quests advice is good we will at any rate embark upon this particular frivolity which he suggests   2  quest took the dispatch which the hotel clerk handed to him one afternoon a fortnight later and read it through without change of expression lenora however who was by his side knew at once that it contained something startling  what is it she asked  he passed his arm through hers and led her down the hall to where the professor and laura were just waiting for the lift he beckoned them to follow him to a corner of the lounge  theres one thing i quite forgot a fortnight ago he said slowly when i suggested that we should none of us look at a newspaper all the time we were in california have you kept to our bargain professor  absolutely  and you girls  ive never even seen one lenora declared  nor i laura echoed  i made a mistake quest confessed something has happened which we ought to have known about you had better read this messageor wait ill read it aloud      to sanford quest garfield hotel san diego      injured in wreck of limited recovered consciousness today     craig reported burned in wreck but think you had better come     on      french samaritan hospital allguez  when can we start laura exclaimed excitedly  lenora clutched at quests arm  i knew it she declared simply i felt perfectly certain when they left san francisco that something would happen we havent seen the end of craig yet  quest who had been studying a timetable glanced once more at the dispatch  look here he said allguez isnt so far out of the way if we take the southern route to new york lets get a move on tonight  laura led the way to the lift she was in a state of rare discomposure  to think that all the time weve been giddying round she muttered that poor man has been lying in hospital makes one feel like a brute  hes been unconscious all the time quest reminded her  might have expected to find us there when he cameto any way laura insisted  lenora smiled faintly as she caught a glance from quest  lauras got a heart somewhere she murmured only it takes an awful lot of getting at  they found french already convalescent comfortably installed in the private ward of a small hospital in the picturesque new mexican town laura almost at once established herself by his side  youre going to lose your job here nurse quest told her smiling  the nurse glanced at french  the change seems to be doing him good any way she remarked i havent seen him look so bright yet  can you remember anything about the wreck french quest enquired  the inspector passed his hand wearily over his forehead  it seems more like a dreamor rather a nightmarethan anything he admitted i was sitting opposite craig when the crash came i was unconscious for a time when i came to i was simply pinned down by the side of the car i could see a man working hard to release me tugging and straining with all his might every now and then i got a glimpse of his face it seemed queer but i could have sworn it was craig then other people passed by i heard the shriek of a locomotive i could see a doctor bending over some bodies then it all faded away and came back again the second time i was nearly free the man who had been working so hard was just smashing the last bit of timber away and again i saw his face and that time i was sure that it was craig anyway he finished the job i suddenly felt i could move my limbs the man stood up as though exhausted looked at me called to the doctor and then he seemed to fade away it might have been because i was unconscious myself for i dont remember anything else until i found myself in bed  it would indeed the professor remarked be an interesting circumstancean interesting psychological circumstance if i might put it that wayif craig the archcriminal the man who has seemed to us so utterly devoid of all human feeling should really have toiled in this manner to set free his captor  interesting or not quest observed id like to know whether it was craig or not i understand there were about a dozen unrecognisable bodies found  the nurse who had left the room for a few minutes returned with a small package in her hand which she handed to french he looked at it in a puzzled manner  what can that be he muttered turning it over addressed to me all right but there isnt a soul knows im here except you people will you open it miss laura  she took it from him and untied the strings a little breathless cry escaped from her lips as she tore open the paper a small black box was disclosed she opened the lid with trembling fingers and drew out a scrap of paper they all leaned over and read together      you have all lost again why not give it up you can never win      the hands  lenora was perhaps the calmest she simply nodded with the melancholy air of satisfaction of one who finds her preconceived ideas confirmed  i knew it she exclaimed softly i knew it at the depot craigs time has not come yet he may be somewhere near us even now  she glanced uneasily around the ward quest who had been examining the postmark on the package threw the papers down  the postmarks all blurred out he remarked theres no doubt about it that fellow craig has the devils own luck but well get himwell get him yet ill just take a stroll up to police headquarters and make a few inquiries you might come with me lenora and laura can get busy with her amateur nursing  i shall make inquiries the professor announced briskly concerning the local museum there should be interesting relics hereabouts of the prehistoric indians   3  a man sat on the steps of the range cook wagon crouching as far back as possible to take advantage of its slight shelter from the burning sun he held before him a newspaper a certain paragraph of which he was eagerly devouring in the distance the mail boy was already disappearing in a cloud of dust      famous criminologist in allguez      sanford quest and his assistants accompanied by professor lord     ashleigh arrived in allguez a few days ago to look for john     craig formerly servant to the scientist craig has not been     seen since the accident to the limited a fortnight ago and by     many is supposed to have perished in the wreck he was in the     charge of inspector french and was on his way to new york to     stand his trial for homicide french was taken to the hospital     suffering from concussion of the brain but is now     convalescent  the man read the paragraph twice then he set down the paper and looked steadily across the rolling prairie land there was a queer bitter little smile upon his lips  so it begins again he muttered  there was a cloud of dust in the distance the man rose to his feet shaded his eyes with his hand and shambled round to the back of the wagon where a long table was set out with knives and forks hunches of bread and tin cups he walked a little further away to the fire and slowly stirred a pot of stew the little party of cowboys came thundering up there was a chorus of shouts and exclamations whistlings and goodnatured chaff as they threw themselves from their horses long jim stood slowly cracking his whip and looking down the table  say boys i think hes fixed things up all right he remarked come on with the grub cookie  silently the man filled each dish with the stew and laid it in its place then he retired to the background and the cowboys commenced their meal long jim winked at the others as he picked up a biscuit  cookie youre no good he called out the stews rotten here take this  he flicked the biscuit which caught the cook on the side of the head for a moment the man started with his hand upon his temple he flashed a look of hatred towards his assailant long jim laughed carelessly  say cookie the latter went on where did you get them eyes guess well have to tame you a bit  the meal was soon over and jim strolled across to where the others were saddling up he passed his left arm through the reins of his horse and turned once more to look at craig  say you mind you do better tonight young fellow eh  he stopped short with a cry of pain the horse had suddenly started wrenching at the reins jims arm hung helplessly down from the shoulder  gee boys hes broken it he groaned say this is hell  he swore in agony they all crowded around him  whats wrong jim  its broken sure  wrong you helpless sons of loons jim yelled cant any of you do something  the cook suddenly pushed his way through the little crowd he took jims shoulder firmly in one hand and his arm in the other the cowboy howled with pain  let go my arm he shouted kill him boys my god ill make holes in you for this  he snatched at his gun with his other hand and the cowboys scattered a little the cook stepped back the gun flashed out only to be suddenly lowered jim looked incredulously towards his left arm which hung no longer helplessly by his side he swung it backwards and forwards and a broad grin slowly lit up his lean brown face he thrust the gun in his holster and held out his hand  cookie youre all right he exclaimed youve done the trick this time say youre a miracle  the cook smiled  your arm was just out of joint he remarked it was rather a hard pull but its all right now  jim looked around at the others  and to think that i might have killed him he exclaimed cookie youre a white boy youll do were going to like you here  craig watched them ride off the bitterness had passed from his face slowly he began to clean up then he crept underneath the wagon and rested  illustration craig wins the cowpunchers admiration by his skill as a violinist  illustration the cowboys consult a map while arranging for craigs escape  evening came and with it a repetition of his labours when everything was ready to serve he stepped from behind the wagon and looked across the rolling stretch of open country there was no one in sight softly almost stealthily he crept up to the wagon fetched out from its wooden case a small violin made his way to the further side of the wagon sat down with his back to the wheel and began to play his eyes were closed sometimes the movements of his fingers were so slow that the melody seemed to die away then unexpectedly he picked it up carrying the same strain through quick convulsive passages lost it again wandered as though in search of it extemporising all the time yet playing always with the air of a man who feels and sees the hidden things suddenly the bow rested motionless a look of fear came into his face he sprang up the cowboys were all stealing from the other side of the wagon they had arrived and dismounted without his hearing them he sprang to his feet and began to stammer apologies long jims hand was laid firmly upon his shoulders  say cookie you dont need to look so scared you aint done nothing wrong me and the boys we like your music sing us another tune on that fiddle  i havent neglected anything craig faltered its all ready to serve  the grub can wait jim replied pull the bow partner pull the bow  the cook looked at him for a moment incredulously then he realised that the cowboy was in earnest he picked up the bow and commenced to play again they sat around him wondering absolutely absorbed no one even made a move towards the food it was craig who led them there at last himself still playing long jim threw his arm almost caressingly around his shoulder  say cookie he began there aint never no questions asked concerning the past history of the men who find their way out here just so long as they dont play the game yellow maybe youve fitted up a nice little hell for yourself somewhere but we aint none of us hankering to know the address youre white and youre one of us and any time any guy wants to charge you rent for that little hell where you got the furniture of your conscience stored why you just let us settle with him thats all now one more tune cookie  craig shook his head he had turned away to where the kettle was hissing on the range fire  it is time you had your food he said  long jim took up the violin and drew the bow across it there was a chorus of execrations craig snatched it from him he suddenly turned his back upon them all he had played before as though to amuse himself he played now with the complete almost passionate absorption of the artist his head was uplifted his eyes half closed he was no longer the menial the fugitive from justice he was playing himself into another world playing amidst a silence which considering his audience was amazing they crouched across the table and watched him long jim stood like a figure of stone the interruption which came was from outside  more of these damned tourists long jim muttered women too  craig had stopped playing he turned his head slowly quest was in the act of dismounting from his horse by his side was the professor just behind lenora and laura long jim greeted them with rough cordiality  say what are you folks looking for he demanded  quest pointed to craig  we want that man he announced this is inspector french from new york i am sanford quest  there was a tense silence craig covered his face with his hands then suddenly looked up  i wont come he cried fiercely youve hounded me all round the world i am innocent i wont come  quest shrugged his shoulders he took a step forward but long jim as though by accident sauntered in the way  got a warrant he asked tersely  we dont need it quest replied hes our man right enough  right this minute hes our cook drawled long jim and we aint exactly particular about going hungry to please a bunch of strangers cut it short mister if you aint got a warrant you aint got this man maybe we dont sport fingerbowls and silk socks but were civilised enough not to let no slim dude walk off with one of our boys without proper authority so you can just meander along back where you come from aint that right boys  there was a sullen murmur of assent quest turned back and whispered for a moment to the inspector then he turned to long jim  all right he agreed the inspector here and i will soon see to that well ride back to the township with your permission the ladies and our elderly friend will remain for a rest  youre welcome to anything weve got except our cook jim replied turning away  darkness came early and the little company grew closer and closer to the camp fire where craig had once more taken up the violin the professor had wandered off somewhere into the darkness and the girls were seated a little apart they had been treated hospitably but coldly  dont seem to cotton to us these boys laura remarked  they dont like us lenora replied because they think we are after craig i wonder what long jim has been whispering to him and what that paper is he has been showing craig do you know how far we are from the mexican border  not more than five or six miles i believe laura replied  lenora rose softly to her feet and strolled to the back of the range wagon in a few moments she reappeared carrying a piece of paper in her hand she stooped down  craigs saddling up she whispered look what he dropped  she held out the paper on which was traced a roughly drawn map  that lines the river that marks the mexican border she explained you see where long jims put the cross thats where the bridge is that other cross is the camp  she pointed away southwards  thats the line she continued laura wheres the professor  i dont know laura replied he rode off some time ago said he was going to meet mr quest  if only he were here lenora muttered i feel sure craig means to escape there he goes  they saw him ride off into the darkness lenora ran to where her horse was tethered  im going after him she announced listen laura if they arrive soon send them after me thats the line as near as i can tell you she added pointing  wait im coming too laura exclaimed  lenora shook her head  you must stay here and tell them about it she insisted i shall be all right  she galloped off while laura was still undecided almost at that moment she heard from behind the welcome sound of horses feet in the opposite direction and quest alone galloped up laura laid her hand upon his rein  where are the others she asked  french and two deputies from the township are about a mile behind quest replied theyve had trouble with their horses  dont get off laura continued quickly craig has escaped riding towards the mexican frontier lenora is following him hes gone in that direction she added pointing when you come to the river youll have to hunt for the bridge  quest frowned as he gathered up his reins  i was afraid theyd try something of the sort he muttered tell the others where ive gone laura  he galloped off into the darkness behind there were some growls from the little group of cowboys none of whom however attempted to interfere with him long jim stood up and gazed sullenly southwards  cookiell make the bridge all right he remarked if the girl catches him she cant do anything and that last guyll never make it whoop here come the rest of them  the inspector with two deputies rode suddenly into the camp the inspector paused to speak to laura long jims eyes sparkled as he saw them approach  its old harris and fat andy he whispered well have some fun with them  the older of the two deputies approached them frowning  been at your games again long jim he began i hear you declined to hand over a criminal whos been sheltering on your ranch youll get into trouble before youve finished  got the warrant jim asked  the deputy produced it long jim looked at it curiously and handed it back  guess the only other thing you want then is the man  better produce him quickly the deputy advised  jim turned away  cant do it hes beat it  you mean that youve let him go  let him go jim repeated i aint got no right to keep him he took the job on at a moments notice and he left at a moments notice theres some of your party after him all right  the deputies whispered to one another the elder of the two turned around  look here he said to the cowboys glancing around for long jim who had disappeared weve had about enough of your goingson i reckon well take one of you back and see what seven days bread and water will do towards civilising you  there was a little mutter the deputies stood side by side with an almost simultaneous movement they had drawn their guns  wheres long jim the older one asked  there was a sudden whirring about their heads a lariat thrown with unerring accuracy had gathered them both in its coil with a jerk they were drawn close together their hands pinned to their side two cowboys quickly disarmed them long jim came sauntering round from the other side of the range wagon tightening the rope as he walked  say youve got a hell of a nerve butting into a peaceable camp like this we aint broke no laws so youre agoing to civilise us eh well mister harris we can play that civilising game too hey boys all together tie em up against that wagon  a dozen willing hands secured them the two men spluttered wildly half in anger half in fear of their tormentors but in a few seconds they were secured firmly against the canvastopped wagon  now sit easy gentlemen sit easy nothings going to hurt you long jim shoved fresh cartridges into his fortyfive that is unless youre unlucky line up there boys one at a time now bud you and tim and doughhead give them guys a singe their hairs getting too long the rest of you boys just content yourselves doing a fancy decoration on the canvas all around em ill deevote my entire attenshun to trimming them lugshuriant whiskers mister harris is asporting all ready nowone two three let em whistle  the two deputies gave a simultaneous yell as several bullets sung by their ears  whoa old horses drawled long jim flies bothering you some eh sit easy sit easy too dangerous hopping around that way you might stick yourselves right in the way of one of them spitballs some nerve tonic this axx ranch brand ready to serve at all hours cheap at half the price ah ha pretty near shaved your upper lip that time didnt i mister harris my hands a bit unsteady what with all the excitement hereabouts say put a stem on that chrysanthemum youre doing cottontop  the two men racked with fury and terror ridiculous in their trussedup state motionless and strained crouched in terror while the bullets passed all around them inspector french tapped long jim on the shoulder  look here he remonstrated youre looking for trouble you cant treat the representatives of the law like this  long jim turned slowly around his politeness was ominous  say you got me scared he replied am i going to be hung  the law must be respected french said firmly untie those men  long jim scratched his head for a moment  say mr inspector he remarked youre a fine man in your way but you weigh too muchthats whats the matter with you boys he added turning around whats the best exercise for reducing flesh  dancing they shouted  long jim grinned he fell a little back suddenly he lowered his gun and shot into the ground barely an inch from frenchs feet the inspector leaped into the air  once more boys the cowboy went on keep it up inspector jump a little higher next time you barely cleared that one  the bullets buried themselves in the dust around the inspectors feet fuming with anger french found himself continually forced to jump the two deputies forgotten for the moment watched with something that was almost like a grin upon their faces laura protesting loudly was obliged more than once to look away to hide a smile jim at last slipped his gun into his holster  no more ammunition to waste boys he declared untie the guys with the warrant and bring out the bottle of rye say he went on addressing the deputies as they struggled to their feet and you mr newyorker is it to be friends and a drink or do you want a quarrel  the deputies were very thirsty the perspiration was streaming down frenchs forehead they all looked at one another laura whispered in frenchs ear and he nodded  well call it a drink he decided                                       the hunted man turned around with a little gasp before him was the rude mountain bridge and on the other sidefreedom scarcely a dozen lengths away was lenora and close behind her came quest he slackened speed as he walked his horse cautiously on to the planked bridge suddenly he gave a little cry the frail structure unexpectedly insecure seemed to sway beneath his weight lenora who had been riding fast was unable to stop herself she came on to the bridge at a half canter craig who had reached the other side in safety threw up his hands  look out he cried my god  the bridge suddenly collapsed as though it had been made of paper lenora grasping her horse was thrown into the stream quest galloping up was only able to check himself just in time he flung himself from his horse and plunged into the stream it was several moments before he was able to reach lenora from the opposite bank craig watched them glancing once or twice at the bridge one of the wooden pillars had been sawn completely through  are you hurt dear quest gasped as he drew lenora to the bank  she shook her head  just my side did craig get away  quest looked gloomily across the stream  craigs in mexico right enough he answered savagely but i am beginning to feel that i could fetch him back out of hell     chapter xiv  tongues of flame   1  from the shadows of the trees on the further side of the river craig with strained eyes watched quests struggle he saw him reach lenora watched him struggle to the bank with her waited until he had lifted her on to his horse then he turned slowly around and faced the one country in the world where freedom was still possible for him he looked into a wall of darkness penetrated only at one spot by a little blaze of light slowly with his arm through the bridle of his horse he limped towards it as he drew nearer and discovered its source he hesitated the light came through the uncurtained windows of a saloon three long yellow shafts illuminating the stunted shrubs and sandy places craig kept in the shadow between them and drew a little nearer from inside he could hear the thumping of a worn piano the twanging of a guitar the rattle of glasses the uproarious shouting of men the shrill laughter of women the tired man and the lame horse stole reluctantly a little nearer craig listened once more wearily it was home he longed for so muchand rest the very thought of the place sickened him even when he reached the door he hesitated and instead of entering stood back amongst the shadows if only he could find any other sort of shelter  inside the scene was ordinary enough there was a long bar against which were lounging halfadozen typical mexican cowpunchers there was a small space cleared for dancing at the further end of which two performers were making weird but vehement music three girls were dancing with cowboys not ungracefully considering the state of the floor and the frequent discords in the music one of themthe prettieststopped abruptly and pushed her partner away from her  you have drunk too much josé she exclaimed you cannot dance you tread on my feet and you lean against me i do not like it i will dance with you another night when you are sober go away please  her cavalier swayed for a moment on his feet then he looked down upon her with an evil glitter in his eyes he was tall and thin with a black moustache and yellow unpleasantlooking teeth  so you will not dance any longer with josé he muttered very well you shall drink with him then we will sit together at one of those little tables listen you shall drink wine  i do not want to drink wine with you all that i wish is to be left alone the girl insisted curtly go and play cards if you want to there is pietro over there and diego perhaps you may win some money they say that drunkards have all the luck  josé leered at her  presently i will play cards he said presently i will win all their money and i will buy jewelry for you martastones that look like diamonds and will sparkle in your neck and in your hair  she turned disdainfully away  i do not want your jewelry josé she declared  he caught her suddenly by the wrist  perhaps this is what you want he cried as he stooped down to kiss her  she swung her right hand round and struck him on the face he staggered back for a moment there was a red flush which showed through the tan of his cheek then he drew a little nearer to her and before she could escape he had passed his long arm around her body he drew her to the chair placed by the side of the wall his left hand played with the knife at his belt  marta little sweetheart he said mockingly you must pay for that blow dont be afraid he went on as he drew the knife across his leather breeches a little scratch across your cheek so it is but the brand of your master a lovetoken from josé steady now little maverick  the girl struggled violently but josé was strong such brawls were common and those of the company who noticed at all merely laughed at the girls futile struggles josés arm was already raised with the knife in his hand when a sudden blow brought a yell of pain to his lips the knife fell clattering to the floor he sprang up his eyes red with fury a man had entered the door from behind and was standing within a few feet of him a man with long pale face dark eyes travelstained and with the air of a fugitive a flood of incoherent abuse streamed from josés lips he stooped for the knife marta threw herself upon him the two cowboys who had been dancing suddenly intervened the girls screamed  it was josés fault marta cried josé was mad he would have killed me  craig faced them all with sudden courage  as i came in he explained that man had his knife raised to stab the girl you dont allow that sort of thing do you here  the two cowboys linked their arms through josés and led him off towards the door  the strangers right josé one of them insisted you cant carve a girl up in company  the girl clutched at craigs arm  sit down here please she begged wait  she disappeared for a moment and came back with a glass full of wine which she set down on the table  drink this she invited and thank you for saving me  craig emptied the glass eagerly he was beginning to be more than a little conscious of his fatigue  i just happened to be the first to see him he said they arent quite wild enough to allow that here are they  quien sabe the girls do not like me the men do not care she declared josé took me by surprise though or i would have killed him but who are you and where did you come from  i have just crossed the border he replied  she nodded understandingly  were they after you  yes with a warrant for my arrest  she patted his hand  you are safe now she whispered we care that much for a united states warrant and she snapped her slim fingers you shall stay with us for a time we will take care of you  he sighed wearily  if i do he said there will be trouble wherever i go there is trouble i have been round the world looking for peace i shall never find it in this world  her eyes filled with tears there was something hopelessly pathetic in his appearance  you shall find it here she promised                                       back in the camp a spirit of deviltry had entered once more into long jim and his mates a tactless remark on the part of one of the deputies had set alight once more the smouldering fire of resentment which the cowboys had all the time felt against them at a word from long jim they were taken by surprise and again tied to the wagon  these guys aint got a sufficiency yet boys limber up them guns again same order as before put a few more petals on them flowers and ill trim their eyelashes for them  the deputies spluttered with rage and fear shots rained about them and the canvas of the wagon was riddled french began to get restless  look here he said to laura i cant stand this any longer it dont seem right to have two officers of the law treated like that any way i guess ill have to butt in again  dont laura advised bluntly youll get yours if you do  a yell from one of the deputies clinched the matter french drew his revolver and advanced into the centre of the little group  say you fellows he exclaimed youve got to stop this those men came here on a legitimate errand and its your duty to respect them  long jim strolled up to the inspector  maybe youre right mr french he remarked but  with a swoop of his long arm he snatched frenchs gun away examined it for a moment looked at french and shook his head  youre too fat inspector he declared sorrowfully still too fat thats whats the matter with you another ten minutes exercise will do you all the good in the world  a bullet struck the dust a few inches from frenchs feet furious with rage he found himself once more forced to resort to undignified antics this time however laura intervened she walked straight up into the little circle and stood close to frenchs side regardless of the levelled guns  look here long jim or whatever your name is she protested you just call your crowd off and stop this undo those two deputies a jokes a joke but this has gone far enough if you dont untie them i will take your choice and get a move on  long jim scratched his chin for a moment  waal he said i guess that what the lady says goes we aint often favoured with ladies society boys and i guess when we are wed better do as we are told turn em loose boys  they abandoned the sport a little reluctantly suddenly they all paused to listen the sound of a horses slow footfall was heard close at hand presently quest appeared out of the shadows carrying lenora in his arms laura rushed forward  lenora she cried is she hurt  quest laid her tenderly upon the ground  we had a spill at the bridge he explained quickly i dont know whether craig loosened the supports he got over all right but it went down under lenora who was following and i had to get her out of the river wheres the professor  the professor came ambling down from the tent where he had been lying he stooped at once over lenoras still unconscious form  dear me he exclaimed dear me come come  he passed his hand over her side and made a brief examination  four ribs broken he pronounced it will be a week at any rate before we are able to move her nothing more serious so far as i can see mr quest but shell need rest and all the comfort we can give her  say thats too bad long jim declared if youve got to stay around for a time though you can have the tents we boys can double up anywhere or bunk on the ground thats right aint it he added turning around to the cowboys  there was a little grunt of acquiescence they carried lenora to the largest of the tents and made her as comfortable as possible she opened her eyes on the way  i am so sorry she faltered its just my side ithurts how did i get out of the stream  i fished you out quest whispered dont talk now we are going to make you comfortable  she pressed his hand and closed her eyes again the professor returned  well make the young lady comfortable all right he assured them cheerfully but theres one thing you can make up your minds to we are here for a week at the least  they all looked at one another the inspector was the only one who preserved an air of cheerfulness and he was glancing towards laura  guess well have to make the best of it he murmured   2  the girl drew a low stool over to craigs side he was sitting in a rough chair tilted back against the adobe wall of the saloon  as tired as ever she asked laying her hand upon his for a moment  he turned his head and looked at her  always tired he answered listlessly  she made a little grimace  but you are so strange she protested over the hills there are the steam cars they would take you to some of our beautiful cities where all is light and gaiety you are safe here whatever your troubles may have been you say that you have money and if you are lonely she added dropping her voice you need not go alone  illustration lenora knows that quest is in danger and goes to find him  illustration marta tries to make friends with craig  he patted her hand affectionately but there was something a little forced about the action  child he said it is so hard to make you understand i might lose myself for a few minutes it is true over yonder perhaps even he added you might help me to forget and then there would be the awakening that is always the same sometimes at night i sleep and when i sleep i rest and when my eyes are opened in the morning the weight comes back and sits upon my heart and the strength seems to pass from my limbs and the will from my brain  her eyes were soft and her voice shook a little as she leaned towards him something in his helplessness had kindled the protective spirit in her  has life been so terrible for you she whispered have you left behindbut no you never could have been really wicked you are not very old are you why do you not stand up and be a man if you have done wrong then very likely people have done wrong things to you why should you brood over these memories why what are you looking at who are these people  the professor with quest and long jim suddenly appeared round the corner of the building they walked towards craig he shrank back in his place  if these are your enemies the girl cried fiercely remember that they cannot touch you here ill have the boys out in a minute if they dare to try it  craig struggled to his feet he made no answer his eyes were fixed upon the professors the girl passed her arm through his and dragged him into the saloon they passed josé in the doorway he scoffed at them  say the boss will fire you marta if you waste all your time with that yankee he muttered  marta drew the red rose from the bosom of her dress and placed it in craigs buttonhole then she led him without a word to a seat  if these men try any tricks in here she said therell be trouble  almost at that moment they all three entered long jim nodded to craig in friendly fashion  its all right cookie he told them dont you look so scared this is just a bit of parleyvous business thats all  the professor held out a piece of paper he handed it over to craig  craig he announced this is a dispatch which i found in allguez with my letters it is addressed to you but under the circumstances you will scarcely wonder that i opened it you had better read it  craig accepted the cableform and read it through slowly to himself      to john craig co professor lord ashleigh yonkers new york      your sister died today her daughter mary sails on tuesday to     join you in new york please meet her      compton solicitor london  craig sat for a moment as though stunned the girl leaned over towards him  are they trying to take you on a warrant she whispered remember you dont need to go unless you want to  craig shook his head  this is something quite different he explained leave me for a moment marta i must talk to these people  she slipped regretfully away from his side and out into the darkness he sat with his eyes fixed upon the cablegram then he turned towards quest  fate seems to be too strong for me he admitted leave me alone and i promise you that ill go at once to new york settle marys future and then make a full disclosure  jim touched him on the shoulder  remember he told him you aint no call to leave here unless you want to those deputies dont go this side of the border youre safe as long as you like to stay  craig nodded gratefully  all the same he said i fear that i must go  the professor coughed  i am sure craig he declared that you have decided wisely  craig looked gloomily away  there is nothing else for me to do he said the child must be met and looked after besides i am sick of it all you may as well know the truth  why not now quest suggested softly  in new york craig replied and not before  quest and the professor exchanged meaning glances  very well the former decided turning away in a week from today craig i shall expect you to report at the professors house  they left the room together long jim lingered by craigs side  those guys have been scaring you some i guess he remarked forget em cookie they cant touch you here of course if you go to new york its your own show  i know that craig replied gloomily  one of the girls passed her arm through long jims  just one dance she whispered  he hesitated looking out of the window then he shrugged his shoulders  im tired of those guys he remarked to craig with a grin guess ill stay here for a bit  craig was left alone for a few minutes suddenly marta glided in and sat by his side her eyes were flashing with anger  you know what they said those two as they passed out she whispered hoarsely i heard them they are going to board the eightthirty train tomorrow morning the dark man turned and said to the otherif he is not on that well wait till we find him once we get him in new york hes our man  a little exclamation of anger broke from craigs lips the girl caught at his arm  dont go she begged dont go there are plenty of places near here where you can hide where we could go together and live quite simply id work for you take me away from this somewhere over the hills dont go to new york they are cruel those men they are hunting youi can see it in their faces  craig shook his head sadly  little girl he said i should like to go with you along that valley and over the hills and forget that i had ever lived in any other world but i cant do it theres a child there now on the ocean nearer to new york every day my sisters own child and no one to meet her andthere are the other things i have sinned and i must pay my god  the room suddenly rang with martas shriek through the open window by which they were sitting an arm wrapped in a serape had suddenly hovered over them craig in starting back had just escaped the downward blow of the knife which had buried itself in martas arm she fell back screaming  its josé she cried the brute the beast  craig swung to his feet furious long jim cursing fiercely drew his gun at that moment the door of the saloon was thrown open josé came reeling in his serape over his shoulder a drunken grin on his face he staggered towards them  josé you beast the girl called out and fell back fainting  there was the sound of a revolver shot and josé reeled backwards and fell with a cry across the sanded floor jim thrust his smoking gun into his belt and caught craig by the arm  say wed better get out of this cookie he muttered  they were hustled out apparently josé was unpopular for every one seemed only anxious to have them clear away  ill get you into the camp quietly long jim muttered youll be safer there for the night then you can make that eightythirty in the morning                                       lenora with her bed dragged to the opening of the tent eagerly greeted the little party on their return quest at once came and sat by her side  wheres laura he asked and the inspector  she smiled and pointed to the rising ground behind them in the faint moonlight two forms were just visible  the inspector isnt taking no for an answer lenora remarked cheerfully and honestly if you ask me i believe that laura is weakening a little she pretended she didnt want to go out for a walk and mumbled something about leaving me but she soon changed her mind when the inspector pressed her they have been up there for an hour or more  quest smiled  french has got it bad he declared almost as badly as i have lenora  she laughed at him her face was a little drawn with pain but her eyes were very soft  i wonder if you have it very badly she murmured  he held her hand for a moment  i think you know he said  as they talked they heard the coyotes barking in the distance presently laura and the inspector returned  nice sort of nurse i am the former grumbled its all the fault of this man he would keep me out there talking rubbish  we were watching you dear lenora said quietly somehow it didnt seem to us that you were particularly anxious to get away  the inspector chuckled  thats one for miss laura he declared with an air of satisfaction little bit hard on me generally  oh im all right if im left alone laura retorted bustling around come along you folks if we are going to have any supper tonight  they sat round the opening before lenoras tent till the moon was high in the heavens quest who had been on the outside of the circle for some little time suddenly rose to his feet and crossed over to the cook wagon long jim who was sitting on the steps glanced up a little surlily  whos inside there quest asked  long jim removed his pipe from his teeth  that dont sound none too civil a question for a guest he remarked but if you want to know our new chinese cookie is there  quest nodded  sorry if i seemed abrupt he apologised youve been very good to us and im sure we are uncommonly obliged to you jim the only reason i asked the question was that i saw a face in the door there and it gave me a start for a moment i thought it was craig back again  hes gone to new york or going tomorrow morning jim replied i dont think hes so powerful fond of your company that hed come round here looking for it  quest strolled off again and glanced at his watch as he rejoined the little group  well he said i think well turn in seven oclock tomorrow morning inspector jims sending one of the boys with us and we shall catch the eastern limited at the junction  the inspector yawned  this openair life makes me sleepy he confessed  to bed all of us quest concluded turning away   3  quest awoke the next morning stretched out his hand and glanced at the watch by the side of his bed it was barely six oclock he turned over and dozed again looked again at halfpast six and finally at a few minutes to seven rose and made a hasty toilet then in the act of placing his watch in his waistcoat pocket he gave a sudden start by its side half covered by the handkerchief which he had thrown upon the little table stood a small black box for a moment he was motionless then he stretched out his hand removed the lid and drew out the usual neatly folded piece of paper      even time fights you it loses that you may lose      the hands  quest for a moment was puzzled then he hurried into the next tent where the professor was sleeping peacefully  say professor whats the time by your watch quest asked shaking him gently  the professor sat up and drew his chronometer from under his pillow  seven oclock he replied five minutes past maybe  quest nodded  that seems all right he declared ill explain later professor  he hurried out into frenchs tent and found the inspector just drawing on his shoes  french whats the time he demanded  three minutes past seven or thereabouts french replied yawning im coming right along weve lots of time threequarters of an hour ought to do it the boys say  quest held out a strip of paper  this gave me a turn he said quietly i found it in a black box by the side of my bed  french gazed at it in a puzzled manner they walked outside to the camp where the cowboys were finishing their breakfast  say boss one of them called out youre not making that eightthirty train to new york  why not quest asked quickly its only three quarters of an hours ride is it  maybe not the other replied but as its eight now your chances aint looking lively kind of overslept havent you  both men glanced once more at their watches then quest thrust his back with a little oath  our watches have been set back he exclaimed the hands again  for a moment they looked at one another dumbfounded then quest moved towards the corral  say is there any quicker way to the depot he enquired of the cowboys  they heard his question indifferently  fifty dollars quest continued to any one who can take me by a quicker route  one of them rose slowly to his feet  waal he observed fifty dollars would come in kind of handy yes i reckon i can cut off a mile or two for you  fifty dollars for you then quest replied as they hurried towards the horses and an extra ten if we make the train  they galloped off into the distance the cowboys finished their breakfast and went off to their work laura stole out from her tent and started off in rather a shamefaced manner for a ride presently lenora opened her eyes she too stretched out her hand for her watch suddenly she sat up in bed with a little exclamation on the table by her side was a small black box she took off the lid with trembling fingers drew out a scrap of paper and read      fools tongues of flame will cross quests path he will never     reach the depot alive  lenora glanced at lauras empty bed then she staggered to the opening of the tent  laura she cried  there was no one there the cowboys had all gone to their work laura had passed out of sight across the ridge in the distance lenora staggered to the cook wagon where the chinese cook was sitting cleaning plates  listen she cried they are in danger the three men who have gone off to the depot if youll ride after them i will give you a hundred dollars give them this she added holding out the scrap of paper  the chinaman shook his head he glanced at the slip of paper indifferently and went on with his work  no can ride missee he said  lenora looked around helplessly the camp was empty she staggered across towards her own horse  come and help me she ordered  the chinaman came unwillingly they found her saddle but he only gazed at it in a stolid sort of fashion  no can fix he said missee no can ride better go back bed  lenora pushed him on one side with a great effort she managed to reach her place in the saddle then she turned and with her face to the depot galloped away the pain was excruciating she could only keep herself in the saddle with an effort yet all the time that one sentence was ringing in her mindtongues of flame she kept looking around anxiously suddenly the road dropped from a little decline she was conscious of a wave of heat in the distance she could see the smoke rolling across the open she touched her horse with the quirt the spot which she must pass to keep on the track to the depot was scarcely a hundred yards ahead but already the fire seemed to be running like quicksilver across the ground licking up the dry greasewood with indeed a flaming tongue she glanced once behind warned by the heat the fire was closing in upon her a puff of smoke suddenly enveloped her she coughed her head began to swim and a fit of giddiness assailed her she rocked in her saddle and the pony came to a sudden standstill faced by the mass of rolling smoke and flame  sanford lenora cried save me  the pony reared she slipped from the saddle and fell across the track     chapter xv  a bolt from the blue   1  there was a peculiar almost a foreboding silence about the camp that morning when laura returned from her early ride the only living person to be seen was the chinaman sitting on a stool in front of the wagon with a dish of potatoes between his knees  say wheres every one laura sung out after she had looked into lenoras tent and found it empty  the chinaman continued to peel potatoes he took no notice of the question laura touched her horse with the whip and cantered over to his side at the last moment the animal swerved a little the chinaman trying to draw back hastily let the bowl slip between his knees he gazed at the broken pieces of the dish in dismay  never mind your silly potatoes laura exclaimed tell me where every ones gone to cant you  the chinaman looked up at her malevolently he rose and made a stealthy movement forward laura backed her horse the purpose which had gleamed for a moment in the mans narrowed eyes seemed to fade away  all gone he announced cowboy gone workee missee gone hurry up find mr quest  laura hesitated puzzled just then the professor came cantering in with a bundle of grass in his hand he glanced down at the chinaman  good morning miss laura he said you dont seem to be getting on with our friend here he added in an undertone if you would permit me to offer you just a word of advice it really doesnt pay to annoy these chinese too much they never forget i didnt like the way that fellow was looking at you i was watching him all the way from the rise there  pshaw she answered who cares what a chink thinks the fellows an idiot im worried professor lenoras gone out after mr quest and the inspector she wasnt fit to ride a horse i cant make out why shes attempted it  the professor unslung some fieldglasses from his shoulder and gazed steadily southward  it is just possible he said softly that she may have received a warning of that  he pointed with his forefinger and laura peered forward something which seemed to be just a faint cloud hung over the horizon the professor handed her his glasses  why its a fire she cried  the professor nodded  just a prairie fire he repliedvery dangerous though these dry seasons the flames move so quickly that if you happen to be in a certain position you might easily get cut off  laura turned her horse round  come on professor she exclaimed thats what it is lenoras gone to try and warn the others  she is a very brave young lady the professor declared as he touched his pony with the spurs all the same miss laura you take my advice and leave that chinaman alone  they rode to the very edge of the tract of country which was temporarily enveloped with smoke and flame here they pulled in their horses and the professor looked thoughtfully through his fieldglasses  the road straight on is the ordinary way to the depot he said but as you can see at the bend there it is becoming almost impassable the thing is what did lenora do when she got as far as this she must have seen that further progress was dangerous  laura gave a little cry and pointed with her ridingwhip about twenty yards further on by the side of the road was a small white object she cantered on swung herself from her horse and picked it up  lenoras handkerchief she cried  the professor waved his arm westward  here come quest and the inspector they are making a circuit to avoid the fire the cowboy with them must have shown them the way wed better hurry up and find out if theyve seen anything of miss lenora  they galloped across the rough country towards the little party who were now clearly in sight  lenora isnt with them laura declared anxiously and lookwhats that  from the centre of one of the burning patches they saw a riderless horse gallop out stop for a moment with his head almost between its forelegs shake himself furiously and gallop blindly on again  its lenoras horse laura cried she must have been thrown come  laura would have turned her horse but the professor checked her  let us wait for quest he advised they are close here  the cowboy riding a little behind the two others had unlimbered his lariat and while they watched swung it over his head and secured the runaway quest galloped up to where laura and the professor were waving frantically  say thats some fire quest exclaimed did you people come out to see it  no we came to find lenora laura answered breathlessly thats her horse she started to meet you she must be somewhere  lenora quest interrupted fiercely what do you mean  when i got back to the camp laura continued rapidly there wasnt a soul there except the chinaman he told me that lenora had ridden off a few minutes before to find you we came to look for her we found her handkerchief on the road there and thats her horse  quest did not wait for another word he jumped a rough bush of scrub on the righthand side galloped over the ground which was already hot with the coming fire and followed along down the road by which lenora had passed when he came to the first bend he could hear the roar of flames in the trees a volume of smoke almost blinded him his horse became wholly unmanageable he slipped from the saddle and ran on staggering from right to left like a drunken man about forty yards along the road lenora was lying in the dust a volume of smoke rushed over her the tree under which she had collapsed was already afire a twig fell from it as quest staggered up and her skirt began to smoulder he tore off his coat wrapped it around her beat out the fire which was already blazing at her feet and snatched her into his arms she opened her eyes for a moment  where are we she whispered the fire  thats all right quest shouted well be out of it in a moment hold tight to my neck  he braced himself for a supreme effort and ran along the pathway his feet were blistered with the heat there was a great burn on one of his arms at last however he passed out of the danger zone and staggered up to where the professor the inspector and laura were waiting  say that was a close shave he faltered as he laid lenora upon the ground another five minuteswell we wont talk about it lets lift her on to your horse laura and get back to the camp   2  the professor laid down his book and gazed with an amiable smile towards quest and lenora  i fear he remarked dolefully that my little treatise on the fauna of the northern orinoco scarcely appeals to you mr quest  quest whose arm was in a sling but who was otherwise none the worse for his recent adventure pointed out of the tent  dont you believe it professor he begged ive been listening to every word but say lenora just look at laura and french  they all three peered anxiously out of the opening of the tent laura and the inspector were very slowly approaching the cook wagon laura was carrying a large bunch of wild flowers one of which she was in the act of fastening in frenchs buttonhole  that fellow french has got grit quest declared he sticks to it all the time hell win out with laura in the end you mark my words  i hope he will lenora said shes a dear girl although she has got an idea into her head that she hates men and lovemaking i think the inspectors just the man for her  the two had paused outside the cook wagon laura held out the flowers to the chinaman  cant you find me a bowl for these she asked  he looked slowly up at her  no bowlee for flowers he answered all want for eatee  laura leaned over and shook him by the shoulder  well ill eatee off the ground she said give me a bowl you slanteyed old idiot  why dont you obey the lady french intervened  very slowly the chinaman rose to his feet disappeared inside the cook wagon and reappeared with a basin which he handed to laura she thanked him carelessly and they passed on from where they stood both quest and lenora saw the look which for a moment flashed from the chinamans eyes lenora shivered  ill be glad when we get away from here she declared clinging to quests arm that chinaman hates laura like poison and im afraid of him  quest nodded  she does seem to have put his back up he agreed as to going on i think we might just as well move tomorrow my arms all right  and im quite well lenora asserted eagerly  weve wired for them to meet craig quest said i only hope they dont let him slip through their fingers i havent much faith in his promise to turn up at the professors lets see what laura and french have to say  cant see any sense in staying on here any longer was frenchs immediate decision so long as you two invalids feel that you can stand the journey besides were using up these fellows hospitality  well get everything in order tonight laura decided and start first thing tomorrow  they busied themselves for the next hour or two in making preparations after their evening meal the two men walked with lenora and laura to their tent  i think you girls had better go to bed quest suggested try and get a long nights sleep  thats all very well french remarked but its only eight oclock what about a stroll miss laura just up to the ridge  laura hesitated for a moment and glanced towards lenora  please go the latter begged i really dont feel like going to sleep just yet  ill look after lenora quest promised you have your walk theres the professor sitting outside his tent wouldnt you like to take him with you  laura glanced indignantly at him as they strolled out and lenora laughed softly  how dared you suggest such a thing she murmured to quest do look at them the inspector wants her to take his watch and she cant quite make up her mind about it why lauras getting positively frivolous  guess wed better not watch them any longer quest decided what about a game of bezique  i should love it lenora assented youll find the cards in that satchel  they sat and played for half an hour by the light of a lantern suddenly quest paused in the act of dealing and glanced over his shoulder  what the mischief was that he muttered  sounded as though the tent flapped lenora replied  quest rose and with the lantern in his hand walked to the other side of the tent the flap was open but there was no sign of any one in sight he looked around and came back  queer thing he exclaimed it sounded just as though some one had pulled the flap of the tent back the flaps open but there isnt a soul in sight  i expect it was fancy lenora remarked still there isnt a breath of wind is there  quest returned to his place and they recommenced the game just at that moment the entrance to the tent was lifted and laura ran in she plumped down upon her bed with her hands on either side of her  if that man she began  suddenly she sprang up with a little cry which turned almost into a scream from a look of humorous indignation her face suddenly assumed an expression of absolute terror she shrank away  theres something soft in the bed she shrieked i felt it with my hand  they all looked towards the cot quest held up the lantern they distinctly saw a movement under the bedclothes the inspector stooping down suddenly entered the tent  say whats wrong here he demanded  theres something in lauras bed quest muttered here give me the campstool  he stole towards the bed gripping the campstool firmly with his right hand and slowly turning down the bedclothes with the feet of the chair suddenly there was a piercing scream a huge snake coiled and quivering for the spring lifted its head even quest seemed for the moment nerveless then from the doorway came the sharp report of a revolver and the snake fell a limp inert thing they all looked at the professor as though fascinated he came a step farther into the tent the revolver still smoking in his hand standing over the snake he deliberately fired again and again into the body  i think he remarked in his usual calm tones that we may consider the creature now beyond any power of doing harm you will be interested to hear he continued bending over the remains of the creature that this is an exceedingly rare species a sort of second cousin to the rattlesnake found only in this part of the world and fatally poisonous  but how could it have got there lenora faltered  the professor shook his head gravely  i am afraid he said that there can be no doubt about that i saw the chinaman whom laura is so fond of sneaking away from this tent a few minutes ago and i suspected some devilry that is why i went and fetched my revolver  there was a roar of anger from french he snatched the weapon from the professors hand  ill kill that yellow dog he shouted where is he  he dashed across the open space towards the camp wagon his teeth were set and there was murder in his blazing eyes  wheres that chinaman he yelled at the top of his voice  the cowboys struggled to their feet the chinaman who was sitting inside the cook wagon poring over a book by the light of a lantern recognised the note of fury in frenchs tone and raised his head startled a paroxysm of fear seized him the very moment that french threw open the door of the wagon he kicked the lantern across the floor and plunged at the canvas sides of the vehicle slipping underneath until he reached the ground french left in darkness groped around for a moment and then emerged the cowboys had gathered together outside  say mr inspector french one of them demanded whats wrong with john chinaman you folks seem to have a sort of grudge against our cooks whats the oriental been doing eh  tried to commit a filthy murder french shouted brought a snake and put it into the bed of one of the young women  they hesitated no longer  come on boys one of them cried well have to see this matter through  they found the spot where the chinaman had escaped from the wagon but even at that moment they heard the sound of a horses hoofs and saw a flying figure in the distance  said he couldnt ride french shouted told the young lady so when she wanted him to go and warn us of the fire look at him now  come on all of you one of the cowboys yelled as they rushed for the horse bring your lariats well have him sure  french with his start was the first to reach a horse the cowboys galloped off through the shadows dimly visible they now and then caught a glimpse of their quarry sometimes he faded out of sight altogether  well have him through that patch of brush long jim shouted he wont dare to ride the pace there  they saw him for a moment bending low over his horse but they did not see him slip easily from its back roll over into the brushwood and lie there concealed they heard the thunder of hoofs ahead and they galloped by when they were out of sight the chinaman stole away into the darkness nearly an hour later the little party caught up with the riderless horse the language of the cowboys was picturesque  spread out boys well round him up going back if we can long jim directed if he was spilled off well get him sure but if the dirty coyote has tricked us and slipped off into the brush its good night well never find him  frenchs hand tightened upon his revolver and his eyes pierced the darkness to right and to left as he rode slowly back  therell be no trial if i can get the drop on him he muttered  away in the distance john chinaman was reaching allguez and the little party of cowboys rode into the camp without having seen a sign of him french was narrating his failure to the three others when quest in silence handed him a cablegram a messenger had just brought      to inspector french allguez nm      very sorry craig gave us slip after leaving depot niece     disappeared from address given no clues at present when are     you returning  french swore softly for a moment then he dropped into a chair exhausted  this he declared is our unlucky evening   3  the woman who had just laid the cloth for a homely evening meal smiled across at the girl who stood at the window  its all ready now directly your uncle comes home she announced say you never seem to tire of looking out of that window  the girl turned around with a smile she was very young and dressed in deep mourning  ive never seen anything like it before mrs malony she said it was quite quiet where we lived in london and here with the street cars and the elevated railways and the clanging of bells there never seems to be a moments peace  mrs malony came to the girls side  your poor uncle looks as though a little peace would do him good she remarked  the girl sighed  if only i could do something for him she murmured  hes in some kind of trouble i think mrs malony observed he is not what you might call a communicative person but its easy to see that he is far from being happy in himself youll ring when youre ready miss mary  the door was suddenly opened and craig entered he was very pale and a little out of breath before he closed the door he listened for a moment  just as we were speaking about you mr craig the landlady continued i was saying to the young lady that there was only one thing i could wish for you both and that was that you werent quite so worried like  craig seemed scarcely to hear her  look across the road he begged tell me if there is a man in a blue serge suit and a bowler hat smoking a cigar looking across here  mrs malony and the girl both obeyed the girl was the first to speak  yes she announced he is looking straight at these windows  craig groaned and sank down upon a chair  leave us if you please mrs malony he ordered ill ring when im ready  mrs malony hesitated with the doorknob in her hand  im not wishing to say anything that might sound offensive she observed slowly but if its a case of trouble of any sort with the police mr craig  that will do craig interrupted it isnt anything of the sort you think you are not likely to suffer by having me here mrs malony or by looking after my niece when i have gone  the landlady left the room silently the girl came over to her uncle and threw her arm around his neck  please dont talk about going away uncle she pleaded i have been so happy since i have been with you  he patted her head felt in his pocket and drew out a little paper bag from which he shook a bunch of violets the girl pinned them to her frock with a little cry of pleasure  how kind you are to me she exclaimed you think of everything  he sighed  if i had had you for a little longer mary he said perhaps i should have been a better man go to the window please and tell me if that man is still there  she crossed the room with light footsteps presently she returned  he is just crossing the street she announced i think that he seems to be coming here  craig took the girl for a minute into his arms  goodbye dear he said i want you to take this paper and keep it carefully you will be cared for always but i must go  but where must you go she asked bewildered  i have an appointment at professor ashleighs he told her i cannot tell you anything more than that goodbye  he kissed her for a moment passionately then suddenly he tore himself away she heard him run lightly down the stairs some instinct led her to the back window she saw him emerge from the house and pass down the yard then she went to the front the man in the blue serge suit was talking to the landlady below she sank into a chair puzzled and unhappy then she heard heavy footsteps the door was opened the man in the blue serge suit entered followed by the protesting landlady  theres no sense in coming here to worry the young lady mrs malony declared irritably as for mr craig i told you that hed gone out  gone out eh the man repeated speaking in a thick disagreeable tone why i watched him in here not ten minutes ago now then young lady guess youd better cough up the truth wheres this precious uncle of yours  my uncle has gone out the girl replied drawing herself up he left five minutes ago  sneaked out by the back way maybe the man sneered  if there was any fear of your stopping to speak to him i should think he would the girl retorted boldly my uncle is rather particular about his acquaintances  the man laughed  whats that in your hand he demanded  something my uncle gave me before he went out the girl replied i havent looked at it yet myself  give it here he ordered  she spread it out upon the table  you may look at it if you choose she agreed my uncle did not tell me not to show it to any one  they read it together the few lines seemed to be written with great care they took indeed the form of a legal document to which was affixed the seal of a notary and the name of a witness      i john craig being about to receive the just punishment for     all my sins hereby bequeath to my niece mary carlton all     monies and property belonging to me a list of which she will     find at this address i make one condition only of my bequest     and i beg my niece to fervently respect it it is that she never     of her own consent or knowledge speak to any one of the name of     ashleigh or associate with any of that name      john craig  the man folded up the paper  ill take care of this he said its yours right enough well just need to borrow it for a time go and get your hat and coat on miss  i shall not the girl objected my uncle told me if anything happened to him that i was to remain here  and remain here she shall so long as she likes mrs malony insisted ive given my promise too to look after her and mr craig knows that i am an honest woman  you may be that the man replied but its just as well for you both to understand this im from the police and what i say goes no harm will come to the girl mrs malony and she shall come back here but for the present she is going to accompany me to headquarters if you make any trouble i only have to blow my whistle and i can fill your house with policemen  ill go the girl whispered  in silence she put on her hat and coat in silence she drove with him to the policestation where she was shown at once into an inspectors office the man who had brought her whispered for a moment or two with his chief and handed him the paper inspector french read it and whistled softly he took up the telephone by his side  say youve something of a find here he remarked to the plainclothes man put me through to mr quest please he added speaking into the receiver  the two men whispered together the girl stole from her place and turned over rapidly the pages of a directory which was on the round table before her she found the as quickly her eye fell upon the name of ashleigh she repeated the address to herself and glanced around the two men were still whispering for the moment she was forgotten she stole on tiptoe across the room ran down the stone steps and hastened into the street   4  the professor who was comfortably seated in quests favourite easychair glanced at his watch and shook his head  i am afraid my friend he said that craigs nerve has failed him a voluntary surrender was perhaps too much to hope for  quest smoked for a moment in silence  cant understand those fellows letting him give them the slip he muttered he ought to have been under close surveillance from the moment he set foot in new york whats that he added turning to the door  his servant entered bearing a note  this was left a few minutes ago sir he announced by a messenger boy there was no answer required  the man retired and quest unfolded the sheet of paper his expression suddenly changed  listen he exclaimed      to sanford quest      gather your people in professor ashleighs library at ten     oclock tonight i will be there and tell you my whole story      john craig  the professor sat for a moment speechless  then he meant it after all he exclaimed at last  seems like it quest admitted ill just telephone to french  the professor rose to his feet knocked the ash from his cigar struggled into his coat and took up his hat then he waited until quest had completed his conversation the latters face had grown grave and puzzled it was obvious that he was receiving information of some importance he put down the instrument at last with a curt word of farewell  let me send a couple of men up with you professor he begged you dont want to run any risk of having craig there before we arrive  the professor smiled  my friend he said it is seldom in my life that i have had to have recourse to physical violence but i flatter myself that there is no man who would do me any harm we will meet then at my house you will bring the young ladies  sure quest replied i am just sending word up to them now  the professor moved towards the door  if only this may prove to be the end he sighed                                       quest spent the next hour or so in restless deliberations there were still many things which puzzled him at about a quarter past nine lenora and laura arrived dressed for their expedition quest threw open the window and looked out across the city a yellowish haze which accompanied by a sulphurous heat had been brooding over the city all day long had suddenly increased in density the air was stifling  im afraid we are in for a bad thunderstorm girls quest remarked  laura laughed  who cares the automobiles there mr quest  lets go then he replied  they descended into the street and drove to the professors house in silence even laura was feeling the strain of these last hours of anxiety on the way they picked up french and a plainclothes man and the whole party arrived at their destination just as the storm broke the professor met them in the hall he too seemed to have lost to some extent his customary equanimity  come this way my friends he invited if craig keeps his word he will be here now within a few minutes this way  they followed him into the library chairs were arranged around the table in the middle of the room and they all sat down the professor took out his watch it was five minutes to ten  in a few minutes he continued solemnly this weight is to be lifted from the minds of all of us i have come to the conclusion that on this occasion craig will keep his word i am not sure mind but i believe that he is in the house at this present moment i have heard movements in the room which belonged to him i have not interfered i have been content to wait  at least he has not tried to escape quest remarked french here brought news of him he has been living with his niece very quietly but without any particular attempt at concealment or any signs of wishing to leave the city  i had that girl brought to my office french remarked barely an hour ago but she slipped away while we were talking say whats that  they all rose quickly to their feet in a momentary lull of the storm they could hear distinctly a girls shrill call from outside followed by the clamour of angry voices  i bet thats the girl french exclaimed shes been looking up the professors address in a directory  they all hurried out into the hall the plainclothes man whom they had left on guard was standing there with his hand upon craigs collar the girl sobbing bitterly was clinging to his arm craig was making desperate efforts to escape directly he saw the little party issue from the library however the strength seemed to pass from his limbs he remained in the clutches of his captor limp and helpless  i caught the girl trying to make her way into the house the latter explained she called out and this man came running downstairs right into my arms  it is quite all right the professor said in a dignified tone you may release them both craig was on his way to keep an appointment here at ten oclock quest will you and the inspector bring him in let us resume our places at the table  the little procession made its way down the hall the girl was still clinging to her uncle  what are they going to do to you these people she sobbed they shant hurt you they shant  lenora passed her arm around the girl  of course not dear she said soothingly your uncle has come of his own free will to answer a few questions only i think it would be better if you would let me  lenora never finished her sentence they had reached the entrance now to the library the professor was standing in the doorway with extended hand motioning them to take their places at the table then with no form of warning the room seemed suddenly filled with a blaze of blue light it came at first in a thin flash from the window to the table became immediately multiplied a thousand times and played round the table in sparks which suddenly expanded to sheets of leaping curling flame the roar of thunder shook the very foundations of the houseand then silence for several seconds not one of them seemed to have the power of speech an amazing thing had happened the oak table in the middle of the room was a charred fragment the chairs were every one blackened remnants  a thunderbolt french gasped at last  quest was the first to cross the room from the table to the outside window was one charred black line which had burnt its way through the carpet he threw open the window the wire whose course he had followed ended there with a little lump of queer substance he broke it off from the end of the wire which was absolutely brittle and brought it into the room  what is it lenora faltered  what have you got there french echoed  quest examined the strangelooking lump of metal steadily the most curious thing about it seemed to be that it was absolutely sound and showed no signs of damage he turned to the professor  i think you are the only one who will be able to appreciate this professor he remarked look it is a fragment of opotana distinct and wonderful specimen of opotan  every one looked puzzled  but what lenora enquired is opotan  it is a new metal quest explained gravely towards which scientists have been directing a great deal of attention lately it has the power of collecting all the electricity from the air around us there are a dozen people at the present moment conducting experiments with it for the purpose of cheapening electric lights if we had been in the room ten seconds sooner  he paused significantly then he swung round on his heel craig a now pitiful object his hands nervously twitching his face ghastly was cowering in the background  your last little effort craig he demanded sternly  craig made no reply the professor who had disappeared for a moment came back to them  there is a smaller room across the hall he said which will do for our purpose  craig suddenly turned and faced them  i have changed my mind he said i have nothing to tell you do what you will with me take me to the tombs deal with me any way you choose but i have nothing to say  french smiled a little grimly  we may make you change your mind when we get you there he remarked  no one will ever make me change my mind the man replied this is my last word  quest pointed a threatening finger at him  your last voluntary word perhaps he said but science is still your master craig science has brought many criminals to their doom it shall take its turn with you bring him along french to my study there is a way of dealing with him                                       quest felt his forehead and found it damp there were dark rims under his eyes before him was craig with a little band around his forehead and the mirror where they could all see it the professor stood a little in the background laura and french were side by side gazing with distended eyes at the blank mirror and lenora was doing her best to soothe the terrified niece twice quests teeth came together and once he almost reeled  its the fight of his life he muttered at last but ive got him  almost as he spoke they could see craigs resistance begin to weaken the tenseness of his form relaxed quests will was triumphing slowly in the mirror they saw a little picture creeping from outline into definite form a picture of the professors library craig himself was there with mortar and trowel and a black box in his hand  its coming lenora moaned  quest stood perfectly tense the picture suddenly flashed into brilliant clearness they saw craigs features with almost lifelike detail from the corner of that room where the professor was standing came a smothered groan it was a terrifying a paralysing moment even the silence seemed charged with awful things then suddenly without any warning the picture faded completely away a cry which was almost a howl of anger broke from quests lips craig had fallen sideways from his chair there was an ominous change in his face something seemed to have passed from the atmosphere of the room some tense and nameless quality quest moved forward and laid his hand on craigs heart the girl was on her knees crying  take her away quest whispered to lenora  what about him french demanded as lenora led the girl from the room  he fought too hard quest said gravely he is dead professor  they all looked around the spot where he had been standing was empty the professor had gone     chapter xvi  justice cheated   the first shock was over craigs body had been removed and the girls had taken mary half stunned with grief to their room french and quest were left alone  this is some disappointment the former remarked gloomily  it is a disappointment quest said slowly which may clear the way to bigger things  whats in your mind now french enquired  quest shook his head  a turmoil first of all where is the professor  must have scooted right away home french suggested he was looking pretty sick all the time guess it must have been a powerful shock for him and he isnt so young as he used to be  give me that paper of craigs again quest asked stretching out his hand  the inspector produced the document from his inner pocket and quest stretching it out upon his knee read it word for word  never to communicate or to have anything to do with any one of the name of ashleigh eh he remarked as he handed it back again rather a queer provision that french  ive been thinking that myself the inspector admitted seems to be rather reversing the positions doesnt it  quest glanced at the clock  well he said if youre ready inspector well be getting along  where to french demanded  quest looked for a moment surprised just then lenora entered the room  are you going out she asked quest  he nodded  the inspector and i are going to have a look for that black box he told her  wont you want me  he shook his head  i think you girls have had as much as is good for you of this sort of business he declared grimly  but its all over now lenora protested  quest buttoned up his coat and motioned to french to follow him  im not so sure he said ill phone if we want you lenora we shall be at the professors  the two men drove to the outskirts of the city almost in silence while several of the officers followed in another taxi the professors house seemed more than ever deserted as they drew up at the front door they entered without ringing and crossed the hall towards the library on the threshold quest paused and held up his finger  some one is in there he whispered stepping quickly forward come  he threw open the door the room was empty yet both quest and french were conscious of a curious conviction that it had been occupied within the last few seconds french even shook out the curtains and swung open the doors of a bureau there was no sign of anybody however nor any evidence as to how they could have left the room  queer but it seemed to me i heard some one french muttered  i was sure of it quest replied shaking the curtains at the back of the door  they stood still for a moment and listened the silence in the empty house was almost unnatural quest turned away with a shrug of the shoulders  at any rate he said craigs dying thoughts must have been truthful come  he led the way to the fireplace went down on his knees and passed his hands over the bricks the third one he touched shook he tapped itwithout a doubt it was hollow with his penknife he loosened the mortar a little and drew it out easily the back was open inside was the black box  craigs secret at last french muttered hoarsely bring it to the light quick  they were unemotional men but the moment was supreme the key to the mystery of these tragical weeks was there in their hands their eyes almost devoured those few hastily scrawled words buried with so much care      see page 62 january number american medical journal 1905  they looked at one another they repeated vaguely this most commonplace of messages as the final result of their strenuous enterprise these cryptic words seemed pitifully inadequate quests face darkened he crumpled the paper in his fingers  there must be some meaning in this he muttered it cant be altogether a fools game were on wait  he moved towards a table which usually stood against the wall but which had obviously been dragged out recently into the middle of the room it was covered with bound volumes quest glanced at one and exclaimed softly  american medical journal 1905 french theres something in this message after all  he turned over the pages rapidly then he came to a stop page 60 was there page 62 had been neatly removed with a pair of scissors  the professor he cried the professors been at work here  the two men stood looking at one another across the table strange thoughts were framing themselves in the brains of both of them then there came a startling and in its way a dramatic interlude through the empty house came the ringing of the electric bell from the front door shrill and insistent without a moments hesitation quest hurried out and french followed him on the doorstep was another surprise lenora and laura were there the former carrying a small blackbound volume  dont be cross she begged quickly we just had to come look we picked this up underneath the chair where craig was sitting it must have slipped from his pocket you see what is written on it diary of john craig  quest took it in his hand  this ought to be interesting he remarked come along in  they passed into the library french lingered behind for a moment and caught up with them just as they were opening the book underneath the electric lamp  see what ive found he exclaimed it was just by the side of the wall there wheres that journal  he spread out the piece of paperit fitted exactly into the empty space they all read together      professor ashleigh after being bitten by the anthropoid     rapidly developed hydrophobia of a serious nature after     treatment with a new serum the patient was relieved of the     hydrophobic symptoms but to my horror this mildmannered     humane man seems possessed at times of all the characteristics     of the brutal anthropoidcunning thievery brutality i do not     know what may come of this i hesitate to put even these words     on to paper i am doubtful as to what course in the interests     of humanity i ought to take      signed james merrill md      editors note just as we go to press a cable announces the     terrible death of doctor merrill the writer of the above notes     he was attacked by wild animals while alone in a south american     jungle and torn to pieces  there was a queer little silence among the company no one seemed inclined for speech they looked at one another in dumb wondering horror then quest drew a penknife from his pocket and with a turn of his wrist forced the lock of the diary they all watched him with fascinated eyes it was something to escape from their thoughts they leaned over as he spread the book out before him those first two sentences were almost in the light of a dedication      for ten years i have protected my master professor edgar     ashleigh at the cost of my peace of mind my happiness my     reputation this book even though it be too late to help me     shall clear my reputation  quest closed the volume  french he decided we must find the professor will you have your men search the house and grounds immediately  the inspector left the room like a dazed man they could hear him giving orders outside  the next page lenora begged just one page more  quest hesitated for a moment then he turned it over all three read again      ten years of horror struggling all the while to keep him from     that other self that thing of bestiality to keep his horrible     secret from the world to cover up his crimes even though their     shadow should rest upon me now sanford quest has come will     this mean discovery  another page lenora faltered  no more quest said dont you see where it is leading us we have the truth here wait  he strode hastily to the door french and one of the plainclothes men were descending the stairs  well quest asked breathlessly  the professor is not in the house french reported we are going to search the grounds  quest returned to the library lenora clung to his arm the diary lay still upon the table  quest opened the volume slowly again they all read together      the evil nature is growing stronger every day he is developing     a sort of ferocious cunning to help him in his crimes he     wanders about in the dark wearing a black velvet suit with     holes for his eyes and leaving only his hands exposed i have     watched him come into a halfdarkened room and one can see     nothing but the hands and the eyes sometimes if he closes his     eyes only the hands  mrs rheinholdt quest muttered wait i know where that suit is  he hastened to a cupboard at the farther end of the room snatched some garments from it and vanished into the hall  one moment girls he said i see now how he did it wait ill show you  they stood quite still a little terrified in a moment or two the door reopened a finger turned out all the electric lights but one then there was nothing to be seen but a pair of white hands which seemed to come floating towards them through the darknessa pair of white hands and a pair of gleaming eyes lenora screamed wildly even laura was unnerved  stop that she cried out who are you anyway  the lights were suddenly turned on quest threw off his disguise  there you are he exclaimed triumphantly ingenious but one ought to have seen through it long ago the stroke of genius about it was that as soon as he had used a dodge once or twice and set you thinking about it he dropped it  the door was suddenly opened and french entered  beaten he exclaimed tersely  you havent found him quest asked  french shook his head  weve searched every room every cupboard every scrap of the cellar in the house he announced weve been into every corner of the grounds searched all the place inside and out theres no sign of the professor  quest pocketed the diary  youre perfectly certain that he is not in this house or anywhere upon the premises  certain sure french replied  quest shrugged his shoulders  well wed better get back he said you come too french well sit down and figure out some scheme for finding him  they made their way to the front door and crowded into the autos the two men left with marked reluctance the two girls had but one idea in their headsto get away and get away quickly  do start please lenora begged theres just one thing in life i want and that is to be in my own room to feel myself away from his world of horrible unnatural mysteries  the kid has the right idea laura agreed ive had enough myself  they were on the point of starting the chauffeur with his hand upon the starting handle french with the steering wheel of the police car already in his hand and then the little party seemed suddenly turned to stone for a few breathless seconds not one of them moved out into the clammy night air came the echoes of a hideous inhuman bloodcurdling scream quest was the first to recover himself he leaped from his seat and rushed back across the empty hall into the study followed a little way behind by french and the others an unsuspected panel door which led into the garden stood slightly ajar the professor with his hand on the back of a chair was staring at the fireplace shaking as though with some horrible ague his face distorted his body curiously hunchedup he seemed suddenly to have dropped his humanity to have fallen back into the world of some strange creatures he heard their footsteps but he did not turn his head his hands were stretched out in front of him as though to keep away from his sight some hateful object  stop him he cried take him away its craighis spirit he came to me in the garage he followed me through the grounds he mocked at me when i hid in the tree hes there now kneeling before the fireplace why cant i kill him he is coming stop him some one  no one spoke or moved no one indeed had the power then at last quest found words  there is no one in the room professor he said except us  the sound of a human voice seemed to produce a strange effect the professor straightened himself shook his head his hands dropped to his side he turned around and faced them he was ghastly pale but his smile was once more the smile of the amiable naturalist  my friends he said forgive me i am very old and the events of these last few hours have unnerved me forgive me  he groped for a moment and sank into a chair quest fetched a decanter and a glass from the sideboard poured out some wine and held it to his lips the professor drank it eagerly  my dear friend he exclaimed you have saved me i have something to tell you something i must tell you at once but not here i loathe this place let me come with you to your rooms  as you please quest answered calmly  the professor rose hastily to his feet as he turned around he saw french concealing something in his hands he shivered  i dont need those he cried what are they handcuffs ah no i am only too anxious to tell you all that i know take care of me mr quest take me with you  he gripped quests arm in silence they passed from the room in silence they took their places once more in the automobiles in silence they drove without a pause to quests rooms the professor seemed to breathe more freely as they left the neighbourhood of his house behind he walked up the stairs to quests library almost blithely if he was aware of it he took no notice of french and the two plainclothes men behind as he stepped into the room he drew a long sigh of relief he made his way at once to his favourite easychair threw off his overcoat and leaned back  quest he pronounced you are the best friend i have in my life it is you who have rid me of my great burden tell mehelp me a little with my storyhave you read that page from the medical journal which craig has kept locked up all these years  we have all read it quest replied  it was forged the professor declared firmly forged by craig all the years since he has blackmailed me i have been his servant and his tool i have been afraid to speak at last i am free of him thank god  craig after all french muttered  the professor sat with a faint wistful smile upon the corners of his lips looking around at all of them his face had become like the face of a child eager for sympathy and kindness  you will trust me i know he continued you will believe me all my life i have laboured for science i have never been selfish i have laid up no store of gold or treasure knowledge has been my mistress knowledge has been my heaven if i had been a wise man i would have ridden myself of this hideous burden but i was foolish and afraid i wanted to pursue my studies i wanted to be left in peace so i let that fiend prey upon my fears but nownow i feel that the burden has rolled away i shall tell you my story and afterwards i will do great things yet great things for science great things for the world  they listened to him spellbound only lenora stood a little apart with a faint frown upon her forehead she touched quest on the shoulder  mr quest she murmured he is lying  quest turned his head his lips scarcely moved  what do you mean he whispered  he is lying lenora insisted i tell you theres another creature there something we dont understand let me bring the electrothought transference apparatus let us read his mind if i am wrong i will go down on my knees and beg for forgiveness  quest nodded lenora hastened to the further end of the room snatched the cloth from the instrument and wheeled down the little mirror with its coils and levers the professor watched her slowly his face changed the benevolence faded away his teeth for a moment showed in something which was almost a snarl  you believe me he cried turning to quest you are not going to try that horrible thing on meprofessor lord ashleigh i am all broken up i am not fit for it look at my hands how they shake  professor quest said sternly we are surrounded by the shadow of some terrible deeds for which as yet there is no explanation i do not say that we mistrust you but i ask you to submit to this test  i refuse the professor replied harshly  and i insist quest muttered  the professor drew a little breath he sat back in his chair his face became still his lips were drawn closely together lenora wheeled up the machine and with deft fingers adjusted the fittings on one side quest himself connected it up on the other the professor sat there like a figure of stone the silence in the room was so intense that the ticking of the small clock upon the mantelpiece was clearly audible the silent battle of wills seemed like a live and visible struggle the very atmosphere seemed charged with the thrill and wonder of it never before had quest met with resistance so complete and immovable for the first time the thought of failure oppressed him even that slight slackening of his rigid concentration brought relief to the professor without any knowledge as to the source of their conviction the two girls who watched felt that the professor was becoming dominant and then there came a sudden queer change the intangible triumph of the professors stony poise seemed to fade away his eyes had sought the corner of the room his lips quivered the horror was there again the horror they had seen before he crouched a little back his hands were uplifted as though to keep off some evil thing  craig lenora whispered he thinks he sees craig again  quest held up his hand he realised that this was his moment he leaned a little farther forward sternly he concentrated the whole of his will power upon his task almost at once there was a change the professor fell back in the chair the tense selfcontrol had passed from his features his lips twitched simultaneously the mirror for a moment was cloudedthen slowly a picture upon it gathered outline and substance there was a jungle strange tall trees and brushwood so thick that it reached to the waists of the two men who were slowly making their way through it one was the professor clearly recognisable under his white sun helmet the other a stranger to all of them suddenly they stopped the latter had crept a yard or so ahead his gun raised to his shoulder his eyes fixed upon some possible object of pursuit there was a sudden change in the professor they saw him seize his gun by the barrel and whirl it above his head he seemed suddenly to lose his whole identity he crouched on his haunches almost like an animal and sprang at the others throat they could almost hear the snarl from his lips as the two men went down together into the undergrowth the picture faded away  dr merrill lenora faltered then it was not wild beasts which killed him  almost immediately figures again appeared in the mirror this time they saw the professor in bed in a tent craig sitting by him a violin in his hand a native servant entered with food which he placed by the bedside with a low obeisance slowly the professor raised himself in bed his face was distorted his mouth curved into strange lines with a sudden spring he seized the native servant by the throat and bore him back upon the floor craig passed his arm through his masters and exerting all his strength dragged him away they saw the man run terrified from the room they saw craig soothe the professor and finally get him back to bed then he seized the violin and bent a little forward playing softly slowly the professor relapsed into what seemed to be a sleep the scene faded away to be replaced almost immediately by another there was a small passage which seemed to lead from the back entrance of a house the professor with a black mantle craig following him pleading expostulating they saw the conservatory for a minute and then blackness the professor was leaning against a marble basin there was nothing to be seen of him but his eyes and hands they saw him listen for a moment or two in cold unresponsive silence then stretch out his hand and push craig away the picture glowed and faded and glowed again then they saw through the gloom the figure of a woman approach a diamond necklace around her neck they saw the hands steal out and encircle her throatand then more darkness silence obscurity the mirror was empty once more  mrs rheinholdts jewels lenora cried what next oh my god what next  their eyes ached with the strain but there was not one of them who could even glance away from the mirror it was quests study which slowly appeared then the salvation army girl was there talking to the professor they saw him leave her they saw him look back from the door a strange evil glance then the secretary entered and spoke to her once more the door opened the hands were there stretching and reaching a paperweight gripped in the righthand fingers they saw it raised above the secretarys head they saw the other hand take the girl by the throat and push her towards the table a wild scream broke from lenoras lips quest wavered for a moment the picture faded out  oh stop it lenora begged havent we seen enough we know the truth now stop  the criminologist made no reply his eyes were still fixed upon the professor who showed some signs of returning consciousness he was gripping at his collar he seemed to have difficulty with his breathing quest suddenly braced himself he pushed lenora back  one more he muttered theres something growing in his mind i can feel it wait  again they all turned towards the mirror they saw the hallway of ashleigh house the pictures upon the walls they could almost feel the quiet silence of night they saw the professor come stealing down the stairs he was wearing the black velvet suit with the cowl in his hand they watched him pause before a certain door draw on the cowl and disappear through the opening they could see lord ashleigh asleep in bed the moonlight streaming through the open window across the counterpane they saw the professor turn with a strange horrible look in his face and close the door lenora burst into sobs  no more she begged no more please  suddenly without any warning laura also began to sob hysterically french mopped his forehead with his handkerchief his face was unrecognisable he had lost all his healthy colour and his lips were twitching quest himself was as pale as death and there were black rims under his eyes  weve had enough he admitted swaying a little on his feet undo the other band if you can lenora  he leaned forward and released their victim the whole atmosphere of the place seemed immediately to change lenora drew a long convulsive breath and sank into a chair the professor sat up and gazed at them all with the air of a man who had just awakened from a dream his features relapsed his mouth once more resolved itself into pleasant and natural lines he smiled at them cordially  have i by any chance slept he asked or  he never finished his sentence his eyes fell upon the mirror the metal band lying by his side he read the truth in the faces still turned towards him he rose to his feet there was another and equally sudden change in his demeanour and tone he carried himself with the calm dignity of the scientist  the end of our struggle i presume he said to quest pointing to the metal band you will at least admit that i have shown you fine sport  no one answered him even quest had barely yet recovered himself the professor shrugged his shoulders  i recognise of course he said gravely that this is the end a person in extremis has privileges will you allow me to write just a matter of twenty lines at your desk  silently quest assented the professor seated himself in the swing chair drew a sheet of paper towards him dipped the pen in the ink and began to write then he turned round and reached for his own small black bag which lay upon the table quest caught him by the wrist  what do you want out of that professor he enquired  merely my own pen and ink the professor expostulated if there is anything i detest in the world it is violet ink and your pen too is execrable as these are to be the last words i shall leave to a sorrowing world i should like to write them in my own fashion open the bag for yourself if you will you can pass me the things out  quest opened the bag took out a pen and a small glass bottle of ink he handed them to the professor who started once more to write quest watched him for a moment and then turned away to french the professor looked over his shoulder and suddenly bared his wrist lenora seized her employer by the arm  look she cried what is he going to do  quest swung round but he was too late the professor had dug the pen into his arm he sat in his chair and laughed as they all hurried towards him then suddenly he sprang to his feet again the change came into his face which they had seen in the mirror french dashed forward towards him the professor snarled seemed about to spring then suddenly once more stretched out his hands to show that he was helpless and handed to quest the paper upon which he had been writing  you have nothing to fear from me he exclaimed here is my last message to you sanford quest read itread it aloud always remember that this was not your triumph but mine  quest held up the paper they all read the professors letters were carefully formed his handwriting perfectly legible      you have been a clever opponent sanford quest but even now     you are to be cheated the wisdom of the ages outreaches yours     outreaches it and triumphs  quest looked up quickly  what the devil does he mean he muttered  the professors arms shot suddenly above his head again that strange animal look convulsed his features he burst into a loud unnatural laugh  mean you fool he cried holding out his wrist which was slowly turning black poisoned that is what it means  they all stared at him quest seized the ink bottle revealed the false top and laid it down again with a little exclamation then before they could realize it the end came the professor lay a crumpledup heap upon the floor the last change of all had taken place in his face his arms were outstretched his face deathly white his lips faintly curved in the half amiable half supercilious smile of the savant who sees beyond quest stooped over him  he is dead he declared                                       quest swung round in his chair as french entered the room and held out his left hand  glad to see you french help yourself to a cigar  i dont know as i want to smoke this morning just at present thank you french replied  quest laid down his pen and looked up french was fidgeting about with his hat in his hand he was dressed more carefully than usual but he was obviously ill at ease  nothing wrong eh  no theres nothing wrong french admitted i just looked in  quest waited for a moment then he crossed his legs and assumed a patient attitude  what the dickens did you look in for he asked  the fact of it is french explained i should like a few words with miss laura  quest laughed shortly  why on earth couldnt you say so he observed never knew you bashful before inspector shes up in the laboratory ill ring for some one to show you the way  quest touched the bell and his new secretary entered almost at once  take inspector french up into the laboratory quest directed see you later french  yesperhapsi hope so the inspector replied nervously  quest watched him disappear with a puzzled smile  then he sat down at his desk drew a sheet of paper towards him and began to write      my dear inspector      i am taking this opportunity of letting you know that out of     deference to the wishes of the woman i hope soon to marry i am     abandoning the hazardous and nerveracking profession of     criminology for a safer and happier career you will have     therefore to find help elsewhere in the future      with best wishes      yours      sanford quest  he left the sheet of paper upon the desk and ringing the bell sent for lenora she appeared in a few moments and came over to his side  what is it mr quest she asked  he gave her the letter without remark she read it through and turning slowly around looked at him expectantly  hows that seem to you he asked reaching out his hand for a cigar  very sensible indeed she replied  its no sort of life this for a married man quest declared you agree with me there dont you lenora  yes she admitted a little faintly  quest lit his cigar deliberately then he enclosed the letter in an envelope and addressed it to inspector french  youd better deliver this to the inspector he said in case he doesnt call round here on his way out  he handed her the note for a moment she looked at him then she turned quickly away  he shall have it at once she said in a low tone  quest watched her cross the room she opened the door and passed out without a backward glance then he shrugged his shoulders hesitated for a moment and followed her he heard the door of her apartment on the next floor close however and made his way to the laboratory he entered the room softly and paused upon the threshold his presence was altogether unobserved by the two people who were standing at the other end of the apartment  i say miss laura the inspector was saying this has got to come sometime or other why dont you make up your mind to it im no great hand at lovemaking but im the right sort of man for you and i think you know it  this quest murmured to himself is where laura boxes the inspectors ears  nothing of the sort happened however there was a queer a mystifying change in lauras expression she was looking down at the floor suddenly her face was hidden in her hands the inspector threw his arms around her  thats all the answer i want he declared  quest stole softly away as he regained the door of his study lenora dressed for the street hurried out she tried to pass him but he laid his hand upon her shoulder  i was just going round to mr frenchs office she explained  thats all right quest replied the inspectors here you can leave the note upon the table hi parkins he called out to his secretary in the next room get my hat and coat come back a moment lenora  she turned into the room a little unwillingly and leaned against the table quest stood by her side  lenora he said quietly that was kind of a brutal note i told you to give to french but i thought youd understand  she raised her eyes suddenly to his  understand what she whispered  the secretary entered the room helped quest on with his coat and handed him his hat  if you are quite ready lenora  ready she exclaimed where are we going  quest sighed  fancy having to explain all these things he said taking her arm i just want you to understand lenora that ive waitedquite long enough parkins he added turning to his secretary if any one calls just say that my wife and i will be back early in the afternoon and youd better step upstairs to the laboratory and give my compliments to inspector french and say that i hope he and miss laura will join us at delmonicos for luncheon at one oclock  very good sir the man replied  lenoras face was suddenly transformed she passed her arm through quests he stooped and kissed her as he led her towards the door  you understand now dont you he whispered smiling down at her  i think so she admitted with a little sigh of content   the end                                           john fox jrs  stories of the kentucky mountains  may be had wherever books are sold ask for
