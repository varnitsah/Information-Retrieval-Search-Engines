things are quite improbable to be sure but are they impossible  our big world rolls over as smoothly as it did centuries ago without a squeak to show it needs oiling after all these years of revolution but times change because men change and because civilization like john browns soul goes ever marching on  the impossibilities of yesterday become the accepted facts of today  here is a fairy tale founded upon the wonders of electricity and written for children of this generation  yet when my readers shall have become men and women my story may not seem to their children like a fairy tale at all  perhaps one perhaps twoperhaps several of the demons devices will be by that time in popular use  who knows     1  robs workshop   when rob became interested in electricity his clearheaded father considered the boys fancy to be instructive as well as amusing so he heartily encouraged his son and rob never lacked batteries motors or supplies of any sort that his experiments might require  he fitted up the little back room in the attic as his workshop and from thence a network of wires soon ran throughout the house  not only had every outside door its electric bell but every window was fitted with a burglar alarm moreover no one could cross the threshold of any interior room without registering the fact in robs workshop the gas was lighted by an electric fob a chime connected with an erratic clock in the boys room woke the servants at all hours of the night and caused the cook to give warning a bell rang whenever the postman dropped a letter into the box there were bells bells bells everywhere ringing at the right time the wrong time and all the time and there were telephones in the different rooms too through which rob could call up the different members of the family just when they did not wish to be disturbed  his mother and sisters soon came to vote the boys scientific craze a nuisance but his father was delighted with these evidences of robs skill as an electrician and insisted that he be allowed perfect freedom in carrying out his ideas  electricity said the old gentleman sagely is destined to become the motive power of the world  the future advance of civilization will be along electrical lines  our boy may become a great inventor and astonish the world with his wonderful creations  and in the meantime said the mother despairingly we shall all be electrocuted or the house burned down by crossed wires or we shall be blown into eternity by an explosion of chemicals  nonsense ejaculated the proud father  robs storage batteries are not powerful enough to electrocute one or set the house on fire  do give the boy a chance belinda  and the pranks are so humiliating continued the lady  when the minister called yesterday and rang the bell a big card appeared on the front door on which was printed the words busy call again fortunately helen saw him and let him in but when i reproved robert for the act he said he was just trying the sign to see if it would work  exactly  the boy is an inventor already  i shall have one of those cards attached to the door of my private office at once  i tell you belinda our son will be a great man one of these days said mr joslyn walking up and down with pompous strides and almost bursting with the pride he took in his young hopeful  mrs joslyn sighed  she knew remonstrance was useless so long as her husband encouraged the boy and that she would be wise to bear her cross with fortitude  rob also knew his mothers protests would be of no avail so he continued to revel in electrical processes of all sorts using the house as an experimental station to test the powers of his productions  it was in his own room howeverhis workshopthat he especially delighted  for not only was it the center of all his numerous lines throughout the house but he had rigged up therein a wonderful array of devices for his own amusement  a trolleycar moved around a circular track and stopped regularly at all stations an engine and train of cars moved jerkily up and down a steep grade and through a tunnel a windmill was busily pumping water from the dishpan into the copper skillet a sawmill was in full operation and a host of mechanical blacksmiths scissorsgrinders carpenters woodchoppers and millers were connected with a motor which kept them working away at their trades in awkward but persevering fashion  the room was crossed and recrossed with wires  they crept up the walls lined the floor made a grille of the ceiling and would catch an unwary visitor under the chin or above the ankle just when he least expected it  yet visitors were forbidden in so crowded a room and even his father declined to go farther than the doorway  as for rob he thought he knew all about the wires and what each one was for but they puzzled even him at times and he was often perplexed to know how to utilize them all  one day when he had locked himself in to avoid interruption while he planned the electrical illumination of a gorgeous pasteboard palace he really became confused over the network of wires  he had a switchboard to be sure where he could make and break connections as he chose but the wires had somehow become mixed and he could not tell what combinations to use to throw the power on to his miniature electric lights  so he experimented in a rather haphazard fashion connecting this and that wire blindly and by guesswork in the hope that he would strike the right combination  then he thought the combination might be right and there was a lack of power so he added other lines of wire to his connections and still others until he had employed almost every wire in the room  yet it would not work and after pausing a moment to try to think what was wrong he went at it again putting this and that line into connection adding another here and another there until suddenly as he made a last change a quick flash of light almost blinded him and the switchboard crackled ominously as if struggling to carry a powerful current  rob covered his face at the flash but finding himself unhurt he took away his hands and with blinking eyes attempted to look at a wonderful radiance which seemed to fill the room making it many times brighter than the brightest day  although at first completely dazzled he peered before him until he discovered that the light was concentrated near one spot from which all the glorious rays seemed to scintillate  he closed his eyes a moment to rest them then reopening them and shading them somewhat with his hands he made out the form of a curious being standing with majesty and composure in the center of the magnificent radiance and looking down upon him     2  the demon of electricity   rob was a courageous boy but a thrill of fear passed over him in spite of his bravest endeavor as he gazed upon the wondrous apparition that confronted him  for several moments he sat as if turned to stone so motionless was he but his eyes were nevertheless fastened upon the being and devouring every detail of his appearance  and how strange an appearance he presented  his jacket was a wavering mass of white light edged with braid of red flames that shot little tongues in all directions  the buttons blazed in golden fire  his trousers had a bluish incandescent color with glowing stripes of crimson braid  his vest was gorgeous with all the colors of the rainbow blended into a flashing resplendent mass  in feature he was most majestic and his eyes held the soft but penetrating brilliance of electric lights  it was hard to meet the gaze of those searching eyes but rob did it and at once the splendid apparition bowed and said in a low clear voice  i am here  i know that answered the boy trembling but why are you here  because you have touched the master key of electricity and i must obey the laws of nature that compel me to respond to your summons  ii didnt know i touched the master key faltered the boy  i understand that  you did it unconsciously  no one in the world has ever done it before for nature has hitherto kept the secret safe locked within her bosom  rob took time to wonder at this statement  then who are you he inquired at length  the demon of electricity was the solemn answer  good gracious exclaimed rob a demon  certainly  i am in truth the slave of the master key and am forced to obey the commands of any one who is wise and brave enoughor as in your own case fortunate and foolhardy enoughto touch it  iive never guessed there was such a thing as a master key oror a demon of electricity andand im awfully sorry ii called you up stammered the boy abashed by the imposing appearance of his companion  the demon actually smiled at this speecha smile that was almost reassuring  i am not sorry he said in kindlier tone for it is not much pleasure waiting century after century for some one to command my services  i have often thought my existence uncalled for since you earth people are so stupid and ignorant that you seem unlikely ever to master the secret of electrical power  oh we have some great masters among us cried rob rather nettled at this statement  now theres edison  edison exclaimed the demon with a faint sneer what does he know  lots of things declared the boy  hes invented no end of wonderful electrical things  you are wrong to call them wonderful replied the demon lightly he really knows little more than yourself about the laws that control electricity  his inventions are trifling things in comparison with the really wonderful results to be obtained by one who would actually know how to direct the electric powers instead of groping blindly after insignificant effects  why ive stood for months by edisons elbow hoping and longing for him to touch the master key but i can see plainly he will never accomplish it  then theres tesla said the boy  the demon laughed  there is tesla to be sure he said  but what of him  why hes discovered a powerful light the demon gave an amused chuckle and hes in communication with the people in mars  what people  why the people who live there  there are none  this great statement almost took robs breath away and caused him to stare hard at his visitor  its generally thought he resumed in an annoyed tone that mars has inhabitants who are far in advance of ourselves in civilization many scientific men think the people of mars have been trying to signal us for years only we dont understand their signals  and great novelists have written about the martians and their wonderful civilization and  and they all know as much about that little planet as you do yourself interrupted the demon impatiently  the trouble with you earth people is that you delight in guessing about what you can not know  now i happen to know all about mars because i can traverse all space and have had ample leisure to investigate the different planets mars is not peopled at all nor is any other of the planets you recognize in the heavens  some contain low orders of beasts to be sure but earth alone has an intelligent thinking reasoning population and your scientists and novelists would do better trying to comprehend their own planet than in groping through space to unravel the mysteries of barren and unimportant worlds  rob listened to this with surprise and disappointment but he reflected that the demon ought to know what he was talking about so he did not venture to contradict him  it is really astonishing continued the apparition how little you people have learned about electricity  it is an earth element that has existed since the earth itself was formed and if you but understood its proper use humanity would be marvelously benefited in many ways  we are already protested rob our discoveries in electricity have enabled us to live much more conveniently  then imagine your condition were you able fully to control this great element replied the other gravely  the weaknesses and privations of mankind would be converted into power and luxury  thats true mrmrdemon said the boy  excuse me if i dont get your name right but i understood you to say you are a demon  certainly  the demon of electricity  but electricity is a good thing you know andand  well  ive always understood that demons were bad things added rob boldly  not necessarily returned his visitor  if you will take the trouble to consult your dictionary you will find that demons may be either good or bad like any other class of beings  originally all demons were good yet of late years people have come to consider all demons evil  i do not know why  should you read hesiod you will find he says    soon was a world of holy demons made   aerial spirits by great jove designed   to be on earth the guardians of mankind   but jove was himself a myth objected rob who had been studying mythology  the demon shrugged his shoulders  then take the words of mr shakespeare to whom you all defer he replied  do you not remember that he says    thy demon thats thy spirit which keeps thee is   noble courageous high unmatchable   oh if shakespeare says it thats all right answered the boy  but it seems youre more like a genius for you answer the summons of the master key of electricity in the same way aladdins genius answered the rubbing of the lamp  to be sure  a demon is also a genius and a genius is a demon said the being  what matters a name  i am here to do your bidding     3  the three gifts   familiarity with any great thing removes our awe of it  the great general is only terrible to the enemy the great poet is frequently scolded by his wife the children of the great statesman clamber about his knees with perfect trust and impunity the great actor who is called before the curtain by admiring audiences is often waylaid at the stage door by his creditors  so rob having conversed for a time with the glorious demon of electricity began to regard him with more composure and less awe as his eyes grew more and more accustomed to the splendor that at first had wellnigh blinded them  when the demon announced himself ready to do the boys bidding he frankly replied  i am no skilled electrician as you very well know  my calling you here was an accident  so i dont know how to command you nor what to ask you to do  but i must not take advantage of your ignorance answered the demon also i am quite anxious to utilize this opportunity to show the world what a powerful element electricity really is  so permit me to inform you that having struck the master key you are at liberty to demand from me three gifts each week for three successive weeks  these gifts provided they are within the scope of electricity i will grant  rob shook his head regretfully  if i were a great electrician i should know what to ask he said but i am too ignorant to take advantage of your kind offer  then replied the demon i will myself suggest the gifts and they will be of such a character that the earth people will learn the possibilities that lie before them and be encouraged to work more intelligently and to persevere in mastering those natural and simple laws which control electricity  for one of the greatest errors they now labor under is that electricity is complicated and hard to understand  it is really the simplest earth element lying within easy reach of any one who stretches out his hand to grasp and control its powers  rob yawned for he thought the demons speeches were growing rather tiresome  perhaps the genius noticed this rudeness for he continued  i regret of course that you are a boy instead of a grown man for it will appear singular to your friends that so thoughtless a youth should seemingly have mastered the secrets that have baffled your most learned scientists  but that can not be helped and presently you will become through my aid the most powerful and wonderful personage in all the world  thank you said rob meekly  itll be no end of fun  fun echoed the demon scornfully  but never mind i must use the material fate has provided for me and make the best of it  what will you give me first asked the boy eagerly  that requires some thought returned the demon and paused for several moments while rob feasted his eyes upon the gorgeous rays of color that flashed and vibrated in every direction and surrounded the figure of his visitor with an intense glow that resembled a halo  then the demon raised his head and said  the thing most necessary to man is food to nourish his body  he passes a considerable part of his life in the struggle to procure food to prepare it properly and in the act of eating  this is not right your body can not be very valuable to you if all your time is required to feed it  i shall therefore present you as my first gift this box of tablets  within each tablet are stored certain elements of electricity which are capable of nourishing a human body for a full day  all you need do is to toss one into your mouth each day and swallow it  it will nourish you satisfy your hunger and build up your health and strength  the ordinary food of mankind is more or less injurious this is entirely beneficial  moreover you may carry enough tablets in your pocket to last for months  here he presented rob the silver box of tablets and the boy somewhat nervously thanked him for the gift  the next requirement of man continued the demon is defense from his enemies  i notice with sorrow that men frequently have wars and kill one another  also even in civilized communities man is in constant danger from highwaymen cranks and policemen  to defend himself he uses heavy and dangerous guns with which to destroy his enemies  this is wrong  he has no right to take away what he can not bestow to destroy what he can not create  to kill a fellowcreature is a horrid crime even if done in selfdefense  therefore my second gift to you is this little tube  you may carry it within your pocket whenever an enemy threatens you be it man or beast simply point the tube and press this button in the handle  an electric current will instantly be directed upon your foe rendering him wholly unconscious for the period of one hour  during that time you will have opportunity to escape  as for your enemy after regaining consciousness he will suffer no inconvenience from the encounter beyond a slight headache  thats fine said rob as he took the tube  it was scarcely six inches long and hollow at one end  the busy lives of men proceeded the demon require them to move about and travel in all directions  yet to assist them there are only such crude and awkward machines as electric trolleys cable cars steam railways and automobiles  these crawl slowly over the uneven surface of the earth and frequently get out of order  it has grieved me that men have not yet discovered what even birds know that the atmosphere offers them swift and easy means of traveling from one part of the earths surface to another  some people have tried to build airships remarked rob  so they have great unwieldy machines which offer so much resistance to the air that they are quite useless  a big machine is not needed to carry one through the air  there are forces in nature which may be readily used for such purpose  tell me what holds you to the earth and makes a stone fall to the ground  attraction of gravitation said rob promptly  exactly  that is one force i refer to said the demon  the force of repulsion which is little known but just as powerful is another that mankind may direct  then there are the polar electric forces attracting objects toward the north or south poles  you have guessed something of this by the use of the compass or electric needle opposed to these is centrifugal electric force drawing objects from east to west or in the opposite direction  this force is created by the whirl of the earth upon its axis and is easily utilized although your scientific men have as yet paid little attention to it  these forces operating in all directions absolute and immutable are at the disposal of mankind  they will carry you through the atmosphere wherever and whenever you choose  that is if you know how to control them  now here is a machine i have myself perfected  the demon drew from his pocket something that resembled an openfaced watch having a narrow flexible band attached to it  when you wish to travel said he attach this little machine to your left wrist by means of the band  it is very light and will not be in your way  on this dial are points marked up and down as well as a perfect compass  when you desire to rise into the air set the indicator to the word up using a finger of your right hand to turn it  when you have risen as high as you wish set the indicator to the point of the compass you want to follow and you will be carried by the proper electric force in that direction  to descend set the indicator to the word down  do you understand  perfectly cried rob taking the machine from the demon with unfeigned delight  this is really wonderful and im awfully obliged to you  dont mention it returned the demon dryly  these three gifts you may amuse yourself with for the next week  it seems hard to entrust such great scientific discoveries to the discretion of a mere boy but they are quite harmless so if you exercise proper care you can not get into trouble through their possession  and who knows what benefits to humanity may result  one week from today at this hour i will again appear to you at which time you shall receive the second series of electrical gifts  im not sure said rob that i shall be able again to make the connections that will strike the master key  probably not answered the demon  could you accomplish that you might command my services forever  but having once succeeded you are entitled to the nine giftsthree each week for three weeksso you have no need to call me to do my duty  i shall appear of my own accord  thank you murmured the boy  the demon bowed and spread his hands in the form of a semicircle  an instant later there was a blinding flash and when rob recovered from it and opened his eyes the demon of electricity had disappeared     4  testing the instruments   there is little doubt that this strange experience befallen a grown man he would have been stricken with a fit of trembling or a sense of apprehension or even fear at the thought of having faced the terrible demon of electricity of having struck the master key of the worlds greatest natural forces and finding himself possessed of three such wonderful and useful gifts  but a boy takes everything as a matter of course  as the tree of knowledge sprouts and expands within him shooting out leaf after leaf of practical experience the succession of surprises dulls his faculty of wonderment  it takes a great deal to startle a boy  rob was full of delight at his unexpected good fortune but he did not stop to consider that there was anything remarkably queer or uncanny in the manner in which it had come to him  his chief sensation was one of pride  he would now be able to surprise those who had made fun of his electrical craze and force them to respect his marvelous powers  he decided to say nothing about the demon or the accidental striking of the master key  in exhibiting to his friends the electrical devices he had acquired it would be no end of fun to mark their amazement and leave them to guess how he performed his feats  so he put his treasures into his pocket locked his workshop and went downstairs to his room to prepare for dinner  while brushing his hair he remembered it was no longer necessary for him to eat ordinary food  he was feeling quite hungry at that moment for he had a boys ravenous appetite but taking the silver box from his pocket he swallowed a tablet and at once felt his hunger as fully satisfied as if he had partaken of a hearty meal while at the same time he experienced an exhilarating glow throughout his body and a clearness of brain and gaiety of spirits which filled him with intense gratification  still he entered the diningroom when the bell rang and found his father and mother and sisters already assembled there  where have you been all day robert inquired his mother  no need to ask said mr joslyn with a laugh  fussing over electricity ill bet a cookie  i do wish said the mother fretfully that he would get over that mania  it unfits him for anything else  precisely returned her husband dishing the soup but it fits him for a great career when he becomes a man  why shouldnt he spend his summer vacation in pursuit of useful knowledge instead of romping around like ordinary boys  no soup thank you said rob  what exclaimed his father looking at him in surprise its your favorite soup  i know said rob quietly but i dont want any  are you ill robert asked his mother  never felt better in my life answered rob truthfully  yet mrs joslyn looked worried and when rob refused the roast she was really shocked  let me feel your pulse my poor boy she commanded and wondered to find it so regular  in fact robs action surprised them all  he sat calmly throughout the meal eating nothing but apparently in good health and spirits while even his sisters regarded him with troubled countenances  hes worked too hard i guess said mr joslyn shaking his head sadly  oh no i havent protested rob but ive decided not to eat anything hereafter  its a bad habit and does more harm than good  wait till breakfast said sister helen with a laugh youll be hungry enough by that time  however the boy had no desire for food at breakfast time either as the tablet sufficed for an entire day  so he renewed the anxiety of the family by refusing to join them at the table  if this goes on mr joslyn said to his son when breakfast was finished i shall be obliged to send you away for your health  i think of making a trip this morning said rob carelessly  where to  oh i may go to boston or take a run over to cuba or jamaica replied the boy  but you can not go so far by yourself declared his father and there is no one to go with you just now  nor can i spare the money at present for so expensive a trip  oh it wont cost anything replied rob with a smile  mr joslyn looked upon him gravely and sighed  mrs joslyn bent over her son with tears in her eyes and said  this electrical nonsense has affected your mind dear  you must promise me to keep away from that horrid workshop for a time  i wont enter it for a week he answered  but you neednt worry about me  i havent been experimenting with electricity all this time for nothing i can tell you  as for my health im as well and strong as any boy need be and theres nothing wrong with my head either common folks always think great men are crazy but edison and tesla and i dont pay any attention to that  weve got our discoveries to look after  now as i said im going for a little trip in the interests of science  i may be back tonight or i may be gone several days anyhow ill be back in a week and you mustnt worry about me a single minute  how are you going inquired his father in the gentle soothing tone persons use in addressing maniacs  through the air said rob  his father groaned  wheres your balloon inquired sister mabel sarcastically  i dont need a balloon returned the boy  thats a clumsy way of traveling at best  i shall go by electric propulsion  good gracious cried mr joslyn and the mother murmured my poor boy my poor boy  as you are my nearest relatives continued rob not noticing these exclamations i will allow you to come into the back yard and see me start  you will then understand something of my electrical powers  they followed him at once although with unbelieving faces and on the way rob clasped the little machine to his left wrist so that his coat sleeve nearly hid it  when they reached the lawn at the back of the house rob kissed them all goodby much to his sisters amusement and turned the indicator of the little instrument to the word up  immediately he began to rise into the air  dont worry about me he called down to them  goodby  mrs joslyn with a scream of terror hid her face in her hands  hell break his neck cried the astounded father tipping back his head to look after his departing son  come back  come back shouted the girls to the soaring adventurer  i willsome day was the faraway answer  having risen high enough to pass over the tallest tree or steeple rob put the indicator to the east of the compassdial and at once began moving rapidly in that direction  the sensation was delightful  he rode as gently as a feather floats without any exertion at all on his own part yet he moved so swiftly that he easily distanced a railway train that was speeding in the same direction  this is great reflected the youth  here i am traveling in fine style without a penny to pay any one  and ive enough food to last me a month in my coat pocket  this electricity is the proper stuff after all  and the demons a trump and no mistake  wheeee  how small everything looks down below there  the people are bugs and the houses are soapboxes and the trees are like clumps of grass  i seem to be passing over a town  guess ill drop down a bit and take in the sights  he pointed the indicator to the word down and at once began dropping through the air  he experienced the sensation one feels while descending in an elevator  when he reached a point just above the town he put the indicator to the zero mark and remained stationary while he examined the place  but there was nothing to interest him particularly so after a brief survey he once more ascended and continued his journey toward the east  at about two oclock in the afternoon he reached the city of boston and alighting unobserved in a quiet street he walked around for several hours enjoying the sights and wondering what people would think of him if they but knew his remarkable powers  but as he looked just like any other boy no one noticed him in any way  it was nearly evening and rob had wandered down by the wharves to look at the shipping when his attention was called to an ugly looking bull dog which ran toward him and began barking ferociously  get out said the boy carelessly and made a kick at the brute  the dog uttered a fierce growl and sprang upon him with bared teeth and flashing red eyes  instantly rob drew the electric tube from his pocket pointed it at the dog and pressed the button  almost at the same moment the dog gave a yelp rolled over once or twice and lay still  i guess thatll settle him laughed the boy but just then he heard an angry shout and looking around saw a policeman running toward him  kill me dog will yeeh yelled the officer well ill just run ye in for that same an yell spend the night in the lockup and on he came with drawn club in one hand and a big revolver in the other  youll have to catch me first said rob still laughing and to the amazement of the policeman he began rising straight into the air  come down here  come down or ill shoot shouted the fellow flourishing his revolver  rob was afraid he would so to avoid accidents he pointed the tube at him and pressed the button  the redwhiskered policeman keeled over quite gracefully and fell across the body of the dog while rob continued to mount upward until he was out of sight of those in the streets  that was a narrow escape he thought breathing more freely  i hated to paralyze that policeman but he might have sent a bullet after me  anyhow hell be all right again in an hour so i neednt worry  it was beginning to grow dark and he wondered what he should do next had he possessed any money he would have descended to the town and taken a bed at a hotel but he had left home without a single penny fortunately the nights were warm at this season so he determined to travel all night that he might reach by morning some place he had never before visited  cuba had always interested him and he judged it ought to lie in a southeasterly direction from boston  so he set the indicator to that point and began gliding swiftly toward the southeast  he now remembered that it was twentyfour hours since he had eaten the first electrical tablet  as he rode through the air he consumed another  all hunger at once left him while he felt the same invigorating sensations as before  after a time the moon came out and rob amused himself gazing at the countless stars in the sky and wondering if the demon was right when he said the world was the most important of all the planets  but presently he grew sleepy and before he realized what was happening he had fallen into a sound and peaceful slumber while the indicator still pointed to the southeast and he continued to move rapidly through the cool night air     5  the cannibal island   doubtless the adventures of the day had tired rob for he slept throughout the night as comfortably as if he had been within his own room lying upon his own bed  when at last he opened his eyes and gazed sleepily about him he found himself over a great body of water moving along with considerable speed  its the ocean of course he said to himself  i havent reached cuba yet  it is to be regretted that robs knowledge of geography was so superficial for as he had intended to reach cuba he should have taken a course almost southwest from boston instead of southeast  the sad result of his ignorance you will presently learn for during the entire day he continued to travel over a boundless waste of ocean without the sight of even an island to cheer him  the sun shone so hot that he regretted he had not brought an umbrella but he wore a widebrimmed straw hat which protected him somewhat and he finally discovered that by rising to a considerable distance above the ocean he avoided the reflection of the sun upon the water and also came with the current of good breeze  of course he dared no stop for there was no place to land so he calmly continued his journey  it may be ive missed cuba he thought but i can not change my course now for if i did i might get lost and never be able to find land again  if i keep on as i am i shall be sure to reach land of some sort in time and when i wish to return home i can set the indicator to the northwest and that will take me directly back to boston  this was good reasoning but the rash youth had no idea he was speeding over the ocean or that he was destined to arrive shortly at the barbarous island of brava off the coast of africa  yet such was the case just as the sun sank over the edge of the waves he saw to his great relief a large island directly in his path  he dropped to a lower position in the air and when he judged himself to be over the center of the island he turned the indicator to zero and stopped short  the country was beautifully wooded while pretty brooks sparkled through the rich green foliage of the trees  the island sloped upwards from the seacoast in all directions rising to a hill that was almost a mountain in the center  there were two open spaces one on each side of the island and rob saw that these spaces were occupied by queerlooking huts built from brushwood and branches of trees  this showed that the island was inhabited but as rob had no idea what island it was he wisely determined not to meet the natives until he had discovered what they were like and whether they were disposed to be friendly  so he moved over the hill the top of which proved to be a flat grasscovered plateau about fifty feet in diameter  finding it could not be easily reached from below on account of its steep sides and contained neither men nor animals he alighted on the hilltop and touched his feet to the earth for the first time in twentyfour hours  the ride through the air had not tired him in the least in fact he felt as fresh and vigorous as if he had been resting throughout the journey  as he walked upon the soft grass of the plateau he felt elated and compared himself to the explorers of ancient days for it was evident that civilization had not yet reached this delightful spot  there was scarcely any twilight in this tropical climate and it grew dark quickly  within a few minutes the entire island save where he stood became dim and indistinct  he ate his daily tablet and after watching the red glow fade in the western sky and the gray shadows of night settle around him he stretched himself comfortably upon the grass and went to sleep  the events of the day must have deepened his slumber for when he awoke the sun was shining almost directly over him showing that the day was well advanced  he stood up rubbed the sleep from his eyes and decided he would like a drink of water  from where he stood he could see several little brooks following winding paths through the forest so he settled upon one that seemed farthest from the brushwood villages and turning his indicator in that direction soon floated through the air to a sheltered spot upon the bank  kneeling down he enjoyed a long refreshing drink of the clear water but as he started to regain his feet a coil of rope was suddenly thrown about him pinning his arms to his sides and rendering him absolutely helpless  at the same time his ears were saluted with a wild chattering in an unknown tongue and he found himself surrounded by a group of natives of hideous appearance  they were nearly naked and bore spears and heavy clubs as their only weapons  their hair was long curly and thick as bushes and through their noses and ears were stuck the teeth of sharks and curious metal ornaments  these creatures had stolen upon rob so quietly that he had not heard a sound but now they jabbered loudly as if much excited  finally one fat and somewhat aged native who seemed to be a chief came close to rob and said in broken english  how get here  i flew said the boy with a grin  the chief shook his head saying  no boat come  how white man come  through the air replied rob who was rather flattered at being called a man  the chief looked into the air with a puzzled expression and shook his head again  white man lie he said calmly  then he held further conversation with his fellows after which he turned to rob and announced  me see white man many times  come in big boats  white man all bad make kill with bangsticks  we kill white man with club  then we eat white man  dead white man good  live white man bad  this did not please rob at all  the idea of being eaten by savages had never occurred to him as a sequel to his adventures  so he said rather anxiously to the chief  look here old fellow do you want to die  me no die  you die was the reply  youll die too if you eat me said rob  im full of poison  poison  dont know poison returned the chief much perplexed to understand him  well poison will make you sickawful sick  then youll die  im full of it eat it every day for breakfast  it dont hurt white men you see but it kills black men quicker than the bangstick  the chief listened to this statement carefully but only understood it in part  after a moments reflection he declared  white man lie  lie all time  me eat plenty white man  never get sick never die  then he added with renewed cheerfulness me eat you too  before rob could think of a further protest his captors caught up the end of the rope and led him away through the forest  he was tightly bound and one strand of rope ran across the machine on his wrist and pressed it into his flesh until the pain was severe  but he resolved to be brave whatever happened so he stumbled along after the savages without a word  after a brief journey they came to a village where rob was thrust into a brushwood hut and thrown upon the ground still tightly bound  we light fire said the chief  then kill little white man  then eat him  with this comforting promise he went away and left rob alone to think the matter over  this is tough reflected the boy with a groan  i never expected to feed cannibals  wish i was at home with mother and dad and the girls wish id never seen the demon of electricity and his wonderful inventions  i was happy enough before i struck that awful master key and now ill be eatenwith salt and pepper probably  wonder if therell be any gravy  perhaps theyll boil me with biscuits as mother does chickens  ohhhhh  its just awful  in the midst of these depressing thoughts he became aware that something was hurting his back  after rolling over he found that he had been lying upon a sharp stone that stuck out of the earth  this gave him an idea  he rolled upon the stone again and began rubbing the rope that bound him against the sharp edge  outside he could hear the crackling of fagots and the roar of a newlykindled fire so he knew he had no time to spare  he wriggled and pushed his body right and left right and left sawing away at the rope until the strain and exertion started the perspiration from every pore  at length the rope parted and hastily uncoiling it from his body rob stood up and rubbed his benumbed muscles and tried to regain his lost breath  he had not freed himself a moment too soon he found for hearing a grunt of surprise behind him he turned around and saw a native standing in the door of the hut  rob laughed for he was not a bit afraid of the blacks now  as the native made a rush toward him the boy drew the electric tube from his pocket pointed it at the foe and pressed the button  the fellow sank to the earth without even a groan and lay still  then another black entered followed by the fat chief  when they saw rob at liberty and their comrade lying apparently dead the chief cried out in surprise using some expressive words in his own language  if its just the same to you old chap said rob coolly i wont be eaten today  you can make a pie of that fellow on the ground  no  we eat you cried the chief angrily  you cut rope but no get away no boat  i dont need a boat thank you said the boy and then as the other native sprang forward he pointed the tube and laid him out beside his first victim  at this act the chief stood an instant in amazed uncertainty  then he turned and rushed from the hut  laughing with amusement at the waddling fat figure rob followed the chief and found himself standing almost in the center of the native village  a big fire was blazing merrily and the blacks were busy making preparations for a grand feast  rob was quickly surrounded by a crowd of the villagers who chattered fiercely and made threatening motions in his direction but as the chief cried out to them a warning in the native tongue they kept a respectful distance and contented themselves with brandishing their spears and clubs  if any of your fellows come nearer rob said to the fat chief ill knock em over  what you make do asked the chief nervously  watch sharp and youll see answered rob  then he made a mocking bow to the circle and continued im pleased to have met you fellows and proud to think you like me well enough to want to eat me but im in a bit of a hurry today so i cant stop to be digested  after which as the crowd broke into a hum of surprise he added goodday black folks and quickly turned the indicator of his traveling machine to the word up  slowly he rose into the air until his heels were just above the gaping blacks but there he stopped short  with a thrill of fear he glanced at the indicator  it was pointed properly and he knew at once that something was wrong with the delicate mechanism that controlled it probably the pressure of the rope across its face when he was bound had put it out of order  there he was seven feet in the air but without the power to rise an inch farther  this short flight however had greatly astonished the blacks who seeing his body suspended in midair immediately hailed him as a god and prostrated themselves upon the ground before him  the fat chief had seen something of white men in his youth and had learned to mistrust them  so while he remained as prostrate as the rest he peeped at rob with one of his little black eyes and saw that the boy was ill at ease and seemed both annoyed and frightened  so he muttered some orders to the man next him who wriggled along the ground until he had reached a position behind rob when he rose and pricked the suspended god with the point of his spear  ouch yelled the boy stop that  he twisted his head around and seeing the black again make a movement with the spear rob turned his electric tube upon him and keeled him over like a tenpin  the natives who had looked up at his cry of pain again prostrated themselves kicking their toes against the ground in a terrified tattoo at this new evidence of the gods powers  the situation was growing somewhat strained by this time and rob did not know what the savages would decide to do next so he thought it best to move away from them since he was unable to rise to a greater height  he turned the indicator towards the south where a level space appeared between the trees but instead of taking that direction he moved towards the northeast a proof that his machine had now become absolutely unreliable  moreover he was slowly approaching the fire which although it had ceased blazing was a mass of glowing red embers  in his excitement he turned the indicator this way and that trying to change the direction of his flight but the only result of his endeavor was to carry him directly over the fire where he came to a full stop  murder  help  fire and blazes he cried as he felt the glow of the coals beneath him  ill be roasted after all  here help fatty help  the fat chief sprang to his feet and came to the rescue  he reached up caught rob by the heels and pulled him down to the ground away from the fire  but the next moment as he clung to the boys feet they both soared into the air again and although now far enough from the fire to escape its heat the savage finding himself lifted from the earth uttered a scream of horror and let go of rob to fall head over heels upon the ground  the other blacks had by this time regained their feet and now they crowded around their chief and set him upright again  rob continued to float in the air just above their heads and now abandoned all thoughts of escaping by means of his wrecked traveling machine  but he resolved to regain a foothold upon the earth and take his chances of escape by running rather than flying  so he turned the indicator to the word down and very slowly it obeyed allowing him to his great relief to sink gently to the ground     6  the buccaneers   once more the blacks formed a circle around our adventurer who coolly drew his tube and said to the chief  tell your people im going to walk away through those trees and if any one dares to interfere with me ill paralyze him  the chief understood enough english to catch his meaning and repeated the message to his men  having seen the terrible effect of the electric tube they wisely fell back and allowed the boy to pass  he marched through their lines with a fine air of dignity although he was fearful lest some of the blacks should stick a spear into him or bump his head with a warclub  but they were awed by the wonders they had seen and were still inclined to believe him a god so he was not molested  when he found himself outside the village he made for the high plateau in the center of the island where he could be safe from the cannibals while he collected his thoughts  but when he reached the place he found the sides so steep he could not climb them so he adjusted the indicator to the word up and found it had still had enough power to support his body while he clambered up the rocks to the level grasscovered space at the top  then reclining upon his back he gave himself up to thoughts of how he might escape from his unpleasant predicament  here i am on a cannibal island hundreds of miles from civilization with no way to get back he reflected  the family will look for me every day and finally decide ive broken my neck  the demon will call upon me when the week is up and wont find me at home so ill miss the next three gifts  i dont mind that so much for they might bring me into worst scrapes than this  but how am i to get away from this beastly island  ill be eaten after all if i dont look out  these and similar thoughts occupied him for some time yet in spite of much planning and thinking he could find no practical means of escape  at the end of an hour he looked over the edge of the plateau and found it surrounded by a ring of the black cannibals who had calmly seated themselves to watch his movements  perhaps they intend to starve me into surrender he thought but they wont succeed so long as my tablets hold out  and if in time they should starve me ill be too thin and tough to make good eating so ill get the best of them anyhow  then he again lay down and began to examine his electrical traveling machine  he did not dare take it apart fearing he might not be able to get it together again for he knew nothing at all about its construction  but he discovered two little dents on the edge one on each side which had evidently been caused by the pressure of the rope  if i could get those dents out he thought the machine might work  he first tried to pry out the edges with his pocket knife but the attempt resulted in failure  then as the sides seemed a little bulged outward by the dents he placed the machine between two flat stones and pressed them together until the little instrument was nearly round again  the dents remained to be sure but he hoped he had removed the pressure upon the works  there was just one way to discover how well he had succeeded so he fastened the machine to his wrist and turned the indicator to the word up  slowly he ascended this time to a height of nearly twenty feet  then his progress became slower and finally ceased altogether  thats a little better he thought  now lets see if it will go sidewise  he put the indicator to northwestthe direction of homeand very slowly the machine obeyed and carried him away from the plateau and across the island  the natives saw him go and springing to their feet began uttering excited shouts and throwing their spears at him  but he was already so high and so far away that they failed to reach him and the boy continued his journey unharmed  once the branches of a tall tree caught him and nearly tipped him over but he managed to escape others by drawing up his feet  at last he was free of the island and traveling over the ocean again  he was not at all sorry to bid goodby to the cannibal island but he was worried about the machine which clearly was not in good working order  the vast ocean was beneath him and he moved no faster than an ordinary walk  at this rate ill get home some time next year  he grumbled however i suppose i ought to be glad the machine works at all  and he really was glad  all the afternoon and all the long summer night he moved slowly over the water  it was annoying to go at a reglar jogtrot as rob called it after his former swift flight but there was no help for it  just as dawn was breaking he saw in the distance a small vessel sailing in the direction he was following yet scarcely moving for lack of wind  he soon caught up with it but saw no one on deck and the craft had a dingy and uncaredfor appearance that was not reassuring but after hovering over it for some time rob decided to board the ship and rest for a while  he alighted near the bow where the deck was highest and was about to explore the place when a man came out of the low cabin and espied him  this person had a most villainous countenance and was darkskinned blackbearded and dressed in an outlandish piratical costume  on seeing the boy he gave a loud shout and was immediately joined by four companions each as disagreeable in appearance as the first  rob knew there would be trouble the moment he looked at this evil crew and when they drew their daggers and pistols and began fiercely shouting in an unknown tongue the boy sighed and took the electric tube from his coat pocket  the buccaneers did not notice the movement but rushed upon him so quickly that he had to press the button at a lively rate  the tube made no noise at all so it was a strange and remarkable sight to see the pirates suddenly drop to the deck and lie motionless  indeed one was so nearly upon him when the electric current struck him that his head in falling bumped into robs stomach and sent him reeling against the side of the vessel  he quickly recovered himself and seeing his enemies were rendered harmless the boy entered the cabin and examined it curiously  it was dirty and illsmelling enough but the corners and spare berths were heaped with merchandise of all kinds which had been taken from those so unlucky as to have met these cruel and desperate men  after a short inspection of the place he returned to the deck and again seated himself in the bow  the crippled condition of his traveling machine was now his chief trouble and although a good breeze had sprung up to fill the sails and the little bark was making fair headway rob knew he could never expect to reach home unless he could discover a better mode of conveyance than this  he unstrapped the machine from his wrist to examine it better and while holding it carelessly in his hand it slipped and fell with a bang to the deck striking upon its round edge and rolling quickly past the cabin and out of sight  with a cry of alarm he ran after it and after much search found it lying against the bulwark near the edge of a scupper hole where the least jar of the ship would have sent it to the bottom of the ocean  rob hastily seized his treasure and upon examining it found the fall had bulged the rim so that the old dents scarcely showed at all  but its original shape was more distorted than ever and rob feared he had utterly ruined its delicate mechanism should this prove to be true he might now consider himself a prisoner of this piratical band the members of which although temporarily disabled would soon regain consciousness  he sat in the bow sadly thinking of his misfortunes until he noticed that one of the men began to stir  the effect of the electric shock conveyed by the tube was beginning to wear away and now the buccaneer sat up rubbed his head in a bewildered fashion and looked around him when he saw rob he gave a shout of rage and drew his knife but one motion of the electric tube made him cringe and slip away to the cabin where he remained out of danger  and now the other four sat up groaning and muttering in their outlandish speech  but they had no notion of facing robs tube a second time so one by one they joined their leader in the cabin leaving the boy undisturbed  by this time the ship had begun to pitch and toss in an uncomfortable fashion and rob noticed that the breeze had increased to a gale there being no one to look after the sails the vessel was in grave danger of capsizing or breaking her masts  the waves were now running high too and rob began to be worried  presently the captain of the pirates stuck his head out of the cabin door jabbered some unintelligible words and pointed to the sails  the boy nodded for he understood they wanted to attend to the rigging  so the crew trooped forth rather fearfully and began to reef the sails and put the ship into condition to weather the storm  rob paid no further attention to them  he looked at his traveling machine rather doubtfully and wondered if he dared risk its power to carry him through the air  whether he remained in the ship or trusted to the machine he stood a good chance of dropping into the sea at any moment  so while he hesitated he attached the machine to his wrist and leaned over the bulwarks to watch the progress of the storm  he might stay in the ship until it foundered he thought and then take his chances with the machine  he decided to wait until a climax arrived  the climax came the next moment for while he leaned over the bulwarks the buccaneers stole up behind him and suddenly seized him in their grasp  while two of them held his arms the others searched his pockets taking from him the electric tube and the silver box containing his tablets  these they carried to the cabin and threw upon the heap of other valuables they had stolen  they did not notice his traveling machine however but seeing him now unarmed they began jeering and laughing at him while the brutal captain relieved his anger by giving the prisoner several malicious kicks  rob bore his misfortune meekly although he was almost ready to cry with grief and disappointment  but when one of the pirates to inflict further punishment on the boy came towards him with a heavy strap he resolved not to await the blow  turning the indicator to the word up he found to his joy and relief that it would yet obey the influence of the power of repulsion  seeing him rise into the air the fellow made a grab for his foot and held it firmly while his companions ran to help him  weight seemed to make no difference in the machine it lifted the pirate as well as rob it lifted another who clung to the first mans leg and another who clung to him  the other two also caught hold hoping their united strength would pull him down and the next minute rob was soaring through the air with the entire string of five buccaneers dangling from his left leg  at first the villains were too astounded to speak but as they realized that they were being carried through the air and away from their ship they broke into loud shouts of dismay and finally the one who grasped robs leg lost his hold and the five plunged downward and splashed into the sea  finding the machine disposed to work accurately rob left the buccaneers to swim to the ship in the best way they could while he dropped down to the deck again and recovered from the cabin his box of tablets and the electric tube  the fellows were just scrambling on board when he again escaped shooting into the air with considerable speed  indeed the instrument now worked better than at any time since he had reached the cannibal island and the boy was greatly delighted  the wind at first sent him spinning away to the south but he continued to rise until he was above the air currents and the storm raged far beneath him  then he set the indicator to the northwest and breathlessly waited to see if it would obey  hurrah away he sped at a fair rate of speed while all his anxiety changed to a feeling of sweet contentment  his success had greatly surprised him but he concluded that the jar caused by dropping the instrument had relieved the pressure upon the works and so helped rather than harmed the free action of the electric currents  while he moved through the air with an easy gliding motion he watched with much interest the storm raging below  above his head the sun was peacefully shining and the contrast was strange and impressive  after an hour or so the storm abated or else he passed away from it for the deep blue of the ocean again greeted his eyes  he dropped downward until he was about a hundred feet above the water when he continued his northwesterly course  but now he regretted having interfered for a moment with the action of the machine for his progress instead of being swift as a birds flight became slow and jerky nor was he sure that the damaged machine might not break down altogether at any moment  yet so far his progress was in the right direction and he resolved to experiment no further with the instrument but to let it go as it would so long as it supported him above the water  however irregular the motion might be it was sure if continued to bring him to land in time and that was all he cared about just then  when night fell his slumber was broken and uneasy for he wakened more than once with a start of fear that the machine had broken and he was falling into the sea  sometimes he was carried along at a swift pace and again the machine scarcely worked at all so his anxiety was excusable  the following day was one of continued uneasiness for the boy who began to be harrassed by doubts as to whether after all he was moving in the right direction  the machine had failed at one time in this respect and it might again  he had lost all confidence in its accuracy  in spite of these perplexities rob passed the second night of his uneven flight in profound slumber being exhausted by the strain and excitement he had undergone  when he awoke at daybreak he saw to his profound delight that he was approaching land  the rising sun found him passing over a big city which he knew to be boston  he did not stop  the machine was so little to be depended upon that he dared make no halt  but he was obliged to alter the direction from northwest to west and the result of this slight change was so great a reduction in speed that it was midday before he saw beneath him the familiar village in which he lived  carefully marking the location of his fathers house he came to a stop directly over it and a few moments later he managed to land upon the exact spot in the back yard whence he had taken his first successful flight     7  the demon becomes angry   when rob had been hugged and kissed by his mother and sisters and even mr joslyn had embraced him warmly he gave them a brief account of his adventures  the story was received with many doubtful looks and much grave shaking of heads as was quite natural under the circumstances  i hope my dear son said the father that you have now passed through enough dangers to last you a lifetime so that hereafter you will be contented to remain at home  oh robert cried his mother with tears in her loving eyes you dont know how weve all worried about you for the past week  a week asked rob with surprise  yes its a week tomorrow morning since you flew into the air and disappeared  then said the boy thoughtfully ive reached home just in time  in time for what she asked  but he did not answer that question  he was thinking of the demon and that on the afternoon of this very day he might expect the wise and splendid genius to visit him a second time  at luncheon although he did not feel hungry he joined the family at the table and pleased his mother by eating as heartily as of old  he was surprised to find how good the food tasted and to realize what a pleasure it is to gratify ones sense of taste  the tablets were all right for a journey he thought but if he always ate them he would be sure to miss a great deal of enjoyment since there was no taste to them at all  at four oclock he went to his workshop and unlocked the door everything was exactly as he had left it and he looked at his simple electrical devices with some amusement  they seemed tame beside the wonders now in his possession yet he recollected that his numerous wires had enabled him to strike the master key and therefore should not be despised  before long he noticed a quickening in the air as if it were suddenly surcharged with electric fluid and the next instant in a dazzling flash of light appeared the demon  i am here he announced  so am i answered rob  but at one time i really thought i should never see you again  ive been  spare me your history said the demon coldly  i am aware of your adventures  oh you are said rob amazed  then you know  i know all about your foolish experiences interrupted the demon for i have been with you constantly although i remained invisible  then you know what a jolly time ive had returned the boy  but why do you call them foolish experiences  because they were abominably foolish retorted the demon bitterly i entrusted to you gifts of rare scientific interestelectrical devices of such utility that their general adoption by mankind would create a new era in earth life  i hoped your use of these devices would convey such hints to electrical engineers that they would quickly comprehend their mechanism and be able to reproduce them in sufficient quantities to supply the world  and how do you treat these marvelous gifts  why you carry them to a cannibal island where even your crude civilization has not yet penetrated  i wanted to astonish the natives said rob grinning  the demon uttered an exclamation of anger and stamped his foot so fiercely that thousands of electric sparks filled the air to disappear quickly with a hissing crinkling sound  you might have astonished those ignorant natives as easily by showing them an ordinary electric light he cried mockingly  the power of your gifts would have startled the most advanced electricians of the world  why did you waste them upon barbarians  really faltered rob who was frightened and awed by the demons vehement anger i never intended to visit a cannibal island  i meant to go to cuba  cuba  is that a center of advanced scientific thought  why did you not take your marvels to new york or chicago or if you wished to cross the ocean to paris or vienna  i never thought of those places acknowledged rob meekly  then you were foolish as i said declared the demon in a calmer tone  can you not realize that it is better to be considered great by the intelligent thinkers of the earth than to be taken for a god by stupid cannibals  oh yes of course said rob  i wish now that i had gone to europe but youre not the only one who has a kick coming he continued your flimsy traveling machine was nearly the death of me  ah it is true acknowledged the demon frankly  the case was made of too light material  when the rim was bent it pressed against the works and impeded the proper action of the currents  had you gone to a civilized country such an accident could not have happened but to avoid possible trouble in the future i have prepared a new instrument having a stronger case which i will exchange for the one you now have  thats very kind of you said rob eagerly handing his battered machine to the demon and receiving the new one in return  are you sure this will work  it is impossible for you to injure it answered the other  and how about the next three gifts inquired the boy anxiously  before i grant them replied the demon you must give me a promise to keep away from uncivilized places and to exhibit your acquirements only among people of intelligence  all right agreed the boy im not anxious to visit that island again or any other uncivilized country  then i will add to your possessions three gifts each more precious and important than the three you have already received  at this announcement rob began to quiver with excitement and sat staring eagerly at the demon while the latter increased in stature and sparkled and glowed more brilliantly than ever     8  rob acquires new powers   i have seen the folly of sending you into the world with an offensive instrument yet with no method of defense resumed the demon presently  you have knocked over a good many people with that tube during the past week  i know said rob but i couldnt help it  it was the only way i had to protect myself  therefore my next gift shall be this garment of protection  you must wear it underneath your clothing  it has power to accumulate and exercise electrical repellent force  perhaps you do not know what that means so i will explain more fully  when any missile such as a bullet sword or lance approaches your person its rush through the air will arouse the repellent force of which i speak and this force being more powerful than the projective force will arrest the flight of the missile and throw it back again  therefore nothing can touch your person that comes with any degree of force or swiftness and you will be safe from all ordinary weapons  when wearing this garment you will find it unnecessary to use the electric tube except on rare occasions  never allow revenge or animosity to influence your conduct men may threaten but they can not injure you so you must remember that they do not possess your mighty advantages and that because of your strength you should bear with them patiently  rob examined the garment with much curiosity  it glittered like silver yet was soft and pliable as lambs wool  evidently the demon had prepared it especially for his use for it was just robs size  now continued the demon more gravely we approach the subject of an electrical device so truly marvelous that even i am awed when i contemplate the accuracy and perfection of the natural laws which guide it and permit it to exercise its functions  mankind has as yet conceived nothing like it for it requires full knowledge of electrical power to understand even its possibilities  the being paused and drew from an inner pocket something resembling a flat metal box  in size it was about four inches by six and nearly an inch in thickness  what is it asked rob wonderingly  it is an automatic record of events answered the demon  i dont understand said rob with hesitation  i will explain to you its use returned the demon although the electrical forces which operate it and the vibratory currents which are the true records must remain unknown to you until your brain has mastered the higher knowledge of electricity  at present the practical side of this invention will be more interesting to you than a review of its scientific construction  suppose you wish to know the principal events that are occurring in germany at the present moment  you first turn this little wheel at the side until the word germany appears in the slot at the small end then open the top cover which is hinged and those passing events in which you are interested will appear before your eyes  the demon as he spoke opened the cover and looking within the boy saw as in a mirror a moving picture before him  a regiment of soldiers was marching through the streets of berlin and at its head rode a body of horsemen in the midst of which was the emperor himself the people who thronged the sidewalks cheered and waved their hats and handkerchiefs with enthusiasm while a band of musicians played a german air which rob could distinctly hear  while he gazed spellbound the scene changed and he looked upon a great warship entering a harbor with flying pennants  the rails were lined with officers and men straining their eyes for the first sight of their beloved vaterland after a long foreign cruise and a ringing cheer as from a thousand throats came faintly to robs ear  again the scene changed and within a dingy underground room hemmed in by walls of stone and dimly lighted by a flickering lamp a body of wildeyed desperate men were plighting an oath to murder the emperor and overthrow his government  anarchists asked rob trembling with excitement  anarchists answered the demon with a faint sneer and he shut the cover of the record with a sudden snap  its wonderful cried the boy with a sigh that was followed by a slight shiver  the record is indeed proof within itself of the marvelous possibilities of electricity  men are now obliged to depend upon newspapers for information but these can only relate events long after they have occurred  and newspaper statements are often unreliable and sometimes wholly false while many events of real importance are never printed in their columns  you may guess what an improvement is this automatic record of events which is as reliable as truth itself nothing can be altered or falsified for the vibratory currents convey the actual events to your vision even as they happen  but suppose said rob that something important should happen while im asleep or not looking at the box  i have called this a record replied the demon and such it really is although i have shown you only such events as are in process of being recorded  by pressing this spring you may open the opposite cover of the box where all events of importance that have occurred throughout the world during the previous twentyfour hours will appear before you in succession  you may thus study them at your leisure the various scenes constitute a register of the worlds history and may be recalled to view as often as you desire  itsits like knowing everything murmured rob deeply impressed for perhaps the first time in his life  it is knowing everything returning the demon and this mighty gift i have decided to entrust to your care  be very careful as to whom you permit to gaze upon these pictures of passing events for knowledge may often cause great misery to the human race  ill be careful promised the boy as he took the box reverently within his own hands  the third and last gift of the present series resumed the demon is one no less curious than the record of events although it has an entirely different value  it is a character marker  whats that inquired rob  i will explain  perhaps you know that your fellowcreatures are more or less hypocritical  that is they try to appear good when they are not and wise when in reality they are foolish  they tell you they are friendly when they positively hate you and try to make you believe they are kind when their natures are cruel  this hypocrisy seems to be a human failing  one of your writers has said with truth that among civilized people things are seldom what they seem  ive heard that remarked rob  on the other hand continued the demon some people with fierce countenances are kindly by nature and many who appear to be evil are in reality honorable and trustworthy  therefore that you may judge all your fellowcreatures truly and know upon whom to depend i give you the character marker  it consists of this pair of spectacles while you wear them every one you meet will be marked upon the forehead with a letter indicating his or her character  the good will bear the letter g the evil the letter e  the wise will be marked with a w and the foolish with an f  the kind will show a k upon their foreheads and the cruel a letter c  thus you may determine by a single look the true natures of all those you encounter  and are these also electrical in their construction asked the boy as he took the spectacles  certainly  goodness wisdom and kindness are natural forces creating character  for this reason men are not always to blame for bad character as they acquire it unconsciously  all character sends out certain electrical vibrations which these spectacles concentrate in their lenses and exhibit to the gaze of their wearer as i have explained  its a fine idea said the boy who discovered it  it is a fact that has always existed but is now utilized for the first time  oh said rob  with these gifts and the ones you acquired a week ago you are now equipped to astound the world and awaken mankind to a realization of the wonders that may be accomplished by natural forces  see that you employ these powers wisely in the interests of science and do not forget your promise to exhibit your electrical marvels only to those who are most capable of comprehending them  ill remember said rob  then adieu until a week from today when i will meet you here at this hour and bestow upon you the last three gifts which you are entitled to receive  goodby  goodby repeated rob and in a gorgeous flash of color the demon disappeared leaving the boy alone in the room with his new and wonderful possessions     9  the second journey   by this time you will have gained a fair idea of robs character  he is in truth a typical american boy possessing an average intelligence not yet regulated by the balancewheel of experience  the mysteries of electricity were so attractive to his eager nature that he had devoted considerable time and some study to electrical experiment but his study was the superficial kind that seeks to master only such details as may be required at the moment  moreover he was full of boyish recklessness and irresponsibility and therefore difficult to impress with the dignity of science and the gravity of human existence life to him was a great theater wherein he saw himself the most interesting if not the most important actor and so enjoyed the play with unbounded enthusiasm  aside from the extraordinary accident which had forced the electrical demon into this life rob may be considered one of those youngsters who might possibly develop into a brilliant manhood or enter upon an ordinary humdrum existence as fate should determine  just at present he had no thought beyond the passing hour nor would he bother himself by attempting to look ahead or plan for the future  yet the importance of his electrical possessions and the stern injunction of the demon to use them wisely had rendered the boy more thoughtful than at any previous time during his brief life and he became so preoccupied at the dinner table that his father and mother cast many anxious looks in his direction  of course rob was anxious to test his newlyacquired powers and decided to lose no time in starting upon another journey  but he said nothing to any of the family about it fearing to meet with opposition  he passed the evening in the sittingroom in company with his father and mother and sisters and even controlled his impatience to the extent of playing a game of carom with nell but he grew so nervous and impatient at last that his sister gave up the game in disgust and left him to his own amusement  at one time he thought of putting on the electric spectacles and seeing what the real character of each member of his family might be but a sudden fear took possession of him that he might regret the act forever afterward  they were his nearest and dearest friends on earth and in his boyish heart he loved them all and believed in their goodness and sincerity  the possibility of finding a bad character mark on any of their familiar faces made him shudder and he determined then and there never to use the spectacles to view the face of a friend or relative had any one at that moment been gazing at rob through the lenses of the wonderful character marker i am sure a big w would have been found upon the boys forehead  when the family circle broke up and all retired for the night rob kissed his parents and sisters with real affection before going to his own room  but on reaching his cozy little chamber instead of preparing for bed rob clothed himself in the garment of repulsion then he covered the glittering garment with his best summer suit of clothes which effectually concealed it  he now looked around to see what else he should take and thought of an umbrella a raincoat a book or two to read during the journey and several things besides but he ended by leaving them all behind  i cant be loaded down with so much truck he decided and im going into civilized countries this time where i can get anything i need  however to prevent a recurrence of the mistake he had previously made he tore a map of the world and a map of europe from his geography and folding them up placed them in his pocket  he also took a small compass that had once been a watchcharm and finally the contents of a small iron bank that opened with a combination lock  this represented all his savings amounting to two dollars and seventeen cents in dimes nickles and pennies  it isnt a fortune he thought as he counted it up but i didnt need any money the last trip so perhaps ill get along somehow  i dont like to tackle dad for more for he might ask questions and try to keep me at home  by the time he had finished his preparations and stowed all his electrical belongings in his various pockets it was nearly midnight and the house was quiet  so rob stole down stairs in his stocking feet and noiselessly opened the back door  it was a beautiful july night and in addition to the light of the full moon the sky was filled with the radiance of countless thousands of brilliant stars  after rob had put on his shoes he unfolded the map which was plainly visible by the starlight and marked the direction he must take to cross the atlantic and reach london his first stopping place  then he consulted his compass put the indicator of his traveling machine to the word up and shot swiftly into the air  when he had reached a sufficient height he placed the indicator to a point north of east and with a steady and remarkably swift flight began his journey  here goes he remarked with a sense of exaltation for another week of adventure  i wonder whatll happen between now and next saturday     10  how rob served a mighty king   the new traveling machine was a distinct improvement over the old one for it carried rob with wonderful speed across the broad atlantic  he fell asleep soon after starting and only wakened when the sun was high in the heavens  but he found himself whirling along at a good rate with the greenish shimmer of the peaceful ocean waves spread beneath him far beyond his range of vision  being in the track of the ocean steamers it was not long before he found himself overtaking a magnificent vessel whose decks were crowded with passengers  he dropped down some distance to enable him to see these people more plainly and while he hovered near he could hear the excited exclamations of the passengers who focused dozens of marine glasses upon his floating form  this inspection somewhat embarrassed him and having no mind to be stared at he put on additional speed and soon left the steamer far behind him  about noon the sky clouded over and rob feared a rainstorm was approaching  so he rose to a point considerably beyond the clouds where the air was thin but remarkably pleasant to inhale and the rays of the sun were not so hot as when reflected by the surface of the water  he could see the dark clouds rolling beneath him like volumes of smoke from a factory chimney and knew the earth was catching a severe shower of rain yet he congratulated himself on his foresight in not being burdened with umbrella or raincoat since his elevated position rendered him secure from rainclouds  but having cut himself off from the earth there remained nothing to see except the clear sky overhead and the tumbling clouds beneath so he took from his pocket the automatic record of events and watched with breathless interest the incidents occurring in different parts of the world  a big battle was being fought in the philippines and so fiercely was it contested that rob watched its progress for hours with rapt attention  finally a brave rally by the americans sent their foes to the cover of the woods where they scattered in every direction only to form again in a deep valley hidden by high hills  if only i was there thought rob i could show that captain where to find the rebels and capture them  but i guess the philippines are rather out of my way so our soldiers will never know how near they are to a complete victory  the boy also found considerable amusement in watching the course of an insurrection in venezuela where opposing armies of wellarmed men preferred to bluster and threaten rather than come to blows  during the evening he found that an important event was madame bernhardts production of a new play and rob followed it from beginning to end with great enjoyment although he felt a bit guilty at not having purchased a ticket  but its a crowded house anyway he reflected and im not taking up a reserved seat or keeping any one else from seeing the show  so wheres the harm  yet it seems to me if these records get to be common as the demon wishes people will all stay at home and see the shows and the poor actors ll starve to death  the thought made him uneasy and he began for the first time to entertain a doubt of the demons wisdom in forcing such devices upon humanity  the clouds had now passed away and the moon sent her rays to turn the edges of the waves into glistening showers of jewels  rob closed the lid of the wonderful record of events and soon fell into a deep sleep that held him unconscious for many hours  when he awoke he gave a start of surprise for beneath him was land how long it was since he had left the ocean behind him he could not guess but his first thought was to set the indicator of the traveling machine to zero and to hover over the country until he could determine where he was  this was no easy matter  he saw green fields lakes groves and villages but these might exist in any country  being still at a great elevation he descended gradually until he was about twenty feet from the surface of the earth where he paused near the edge of a small village  at once a crowd of excited people assembled shouting to one another and pointing towards him in wonder  in order to be prepared for emergencies rob had taken the electric tube from his pocket and now as he examined the dress and features of the people below the tube suddenly slipped from his grasp and fell to the ground where one end stuck slantingly into the soft earth  a man rushed eagerly towards it but the next moment he threw up his hands and fell upon his back unconscious  others who ran to assist their fallen comrade quickly tumbled into a heap beside him  it was evident to rob that the tube had fallen in such a position that the button was being pressed continually and a current of electric fluid issued to shock whoever came near  not wishing to injure these people he dropped to the ground and drew the tube from the earth thus releasing the pressure upon the button  but the villagers had now decided that the boy was their enemy and no sooner had he touched the ground than a shower of stones and sticks rained about him  not one reached his body however for the garment of repulsion stopped their flight and returned them to rattle with more or less force against those who had thrown themlike regular boomerangs thought rob  to receive their own blows in this fashion seemed so like magic to the simple folk that with roars of fear and pain they ran away in all directions  its no use stopping here remarked rob regretfully for ive spoiled my welcome by this accident  i think these people are irish by their looks and speech so i must be somewhere in the emerald isle  he consulted his map and decided upon the general direction he should take to reach england after which he again rose into the air and before long was passing over the channel towards the shores of england  either his map or compass or his calculations proved wrong for it was high noon before having changed his direction a half dozen times he came to the great city of london  he saw at a glance that it would never do to drop into the crowded streets unless he wanted to become an object of public curiosity so he looked around for a suitable place to alight  near by was a monstrous church that sent a sharp steeple far into the air  rob examined this spire and saw a narrow opening in the masonry that led to a small room where a chime of bells hung  he crept through the opening and finding a ladder that connected the belfry with a platform below began to descend  there were three ladders and then a winding flight of narrow rickety stairs to be passed before rob finally reached a small room in the body of the church  this room proved to have two doors one connecting with the auditorium and the other letting into a side street  both were locked but rob pointed the electric tube at the outside door and broke the lock in an instant  then he walked into the street as composedly as if he had lived all his life in london  there were plenty of sights to see you may be sure and rob walked around until he was so tired that he was glad to rest upon one of the benches in a beautiful park  here half hidden by the trees he amused himself by looking at the record of events  londons a great town and no mistake he said to himself but lets see what the british are doing in south africa today  he turned the cylinder to south africa and opening the lid at once became interested  an english column commanded by a brave but stubborn officer was surrounded by the boer forces and fighting desperately to avoid capture or annihilation  this would be interesting to king edward thought the boy  guess ill hunt him up and tell him about it  a few steps away stood a policeman  rob approached him and asked  wheres the king today  the officer looked at him with mingled surprise and suspicion  is majesty is sojournin at marlbro ouse just now was the reply peraps you wants to make im a wissit he continued with lofty sarcasm  thats it exactly said rob  im an american and thought while i was in london id drop in on his royal highness and say hello to him  the officer chuckled as if much amused  hamericans is bloomin green he remarked so youse can stand for hamerican right enough  no other wissitors is such blarsted fools but yons the palace an i spose is majestyll give ye a ot reception  thanks ill look him up said the boy and left the officer convulsed with laughter  he soon knew why  the palace was surrounded by a cordon of the kings own life guards who admitted no one save those who presented proper credentials  theres only one thing to do thought rob and thats to walk straight in as i havent any friends to give me a regular introduction  so he boldly advanced to the gate where he found himself stopped by crossed carbines and a cry of halt  excuse me said rob im in a hurry  he pushed the carbines aside and marched on  the soldiers made thrusts at him with their weapons and an officer jabbed at his breast with a glittering sword but the garment of repulsion protected him from these dangers as well as from a hail of bullets that followed his advancing figure  he reached the entrance of the palace only to face another group of guardsmen and a second order to halt and as these soldiers were over six feet tall and stood shoulder to shoulder rob saw that he could not hope to pass them without using his electric tube  stand aside you fellows he ordered  there was no response  he extended the tube and as he pressed the button described a semicircle with the instrument  immediately the tall guardsmen toppled over like so many tenpins and rob stepped across their bodies and penetrated to the reception room where a brilliant assemblage awaited in hushed and anxious groups for opportunity to obtain audience with the king  i hope his majesty isnt busy said rob to a solemnvisaged official who confronted him  i want to have a little talk with him  iiahbeg pardon exclaimed the astounded master of ceremonies what name please  oh never mind my name replied rob and pushing the gentleman aside he entered the audience chamber of the great king  king edward was engaged in earnest consultation with one of his ministers and after a look of surprise in robs direction and a grave bow he bestowed no further attention upon the intruder  but rob was not to be baffled now  your majesty he interrupted ive important news for you  a big fight is taking place in south africa and your soldiers will probably be cut into mince meat  the minister strode towards the boy angrily  explain this intrusion he cried  i have explained  the boers are having a regular killingbee  here take a look at it yourselves  he drew the record from his pocket and at the movement the minister shrank back as if he suspected it was an infernal machine and might blow his head off but the king stepped quietly to the boys side and looked into the box when rob threw open the lid  as he comprehended the full wonder of the phenomenon he was observing edward uttered a low cry of amazement but thereafter he silently gazed upon the fierce battle that still raged far away upon the african veld before long his keen eye recognized the troops engaged and realized their imminent danger  theyll be utterly annihilated he gasped  what shall we do  oh we cant do anything just now answered rob  but its curious to watch how bravely the poor fellows fight for their lives  the minister who by this time was also peering into the box groaned aloud and then all three forgot their surroundings in the tragedy they were beholding  hemmed in by vastly superior numbers the english were calmly and stubbornly resisting every inch of advance and selling their lives as dearly as possible  their leader fell pierced by a hundred bullets and the king who had known him from boyhood passed his hand across his eyes as if to shut out the awful sight  but the fascination of the battle forced him to look again and the next moment he cried aloud  look there  look there  over the edge of a line of hills appeared the helmets of a file of english soldiers  they reached the summit followed by rank after rank until the hillside was alive with them  and then with a ringing cheer that came like a faint echo to the ears of the three watchers they broke into a run and dashed forward to the rescue of their brave comrades  the boers faltered gave back and the next moment fled precipitately while the exhausted survivors of the courageous band fell sobbing into the arms of their rescuers  rob closed the lid of the record with a sudden snap that betrayed his deep feeling and the king pretended to cough behind his handkerchief and stealthily wiped his eyes  twasnt so bad after all remarked the boy with assumed cheerfulness but it looked mighty ticklish for your men at one time  king edward regarded the boy curiously remembering his abrupt entrance and the marvelous device he had exhibited  what do you call that he asked pointing at the record with a finger that trembled slightly from excitement  it is a new electrical invention replied rob replacing it in his pocket and so constructed that events are reproduced at the exact moment they occur  where can i purchase one demanded the king eagerly  theyre not for sale said rob  this one of mine is the first that ever happened  oh  i really think continued the boy nodding sagely that it wouldnt be well to have these records scattered around  their use would give some folks unfair advantage over others you know  certainly  i only showed you this battle because i happened to be in london at the time and thought youd be interested  it was very kind of you said edward but how did you gain admittance  well to tell the truth i was obliged to knock over a few of your tall lifeguards  they seem to think youre a good thing and need looking after like jam in a cupboard  the king smiled  i hope you havent killed my guards said he  oh no theyll come around all right  it is necessary continued edward that public men be protected from intrusion no matter how democratic they may be personally  you would probably find it as difficult to approach the president of the united states as the king of england  oh im not complaining said rob  it wasnt much trouble to break through  you seem quite young to have mastered such wonderful secrets of nature continued the king  so i am replied rob modestly but these natural forces have really existed since the beginning of the world and some one was sure to discover them in time  he was quoting the demon although unconsciously  you are an american i suppose said the minister coming close to rob and staring him in the face  guessed right the first time answered the boy and drawing his character marking spectacles from his pocket he put them on and stared at the minister in turn  upon the mans forehead appeared the letter e  your majesty said rob i have here another queer invention  will you please wear these spectacles for a few moments  the king at once put them on  they are called character markers continued the boy because the lenses catch and concentrate the character vibrations radiating from every human individual and reflect the true character of the person upon his forehead  if a letter g appears you may be sure his disposition is good if his forehead is marked with an e his character is evil and you must beware of treachery  the king saw the e plainly marked upon his ministers forehead but he said nothing except thank you and returned the spectacles to rob  but the minister who from the first had been ill at ease now became positively angry  do not believe him your majesty he cried  it is a trick and meant to deceive you  i did not accuse you answered the king sternly  then he added i wish to be alone with this young gentleman  the minister left the room with an anxious face and hanging head  now said rob lets look over the record of the past day and see if that fellow has been up to any mischief  he turned the cylinder of the record to england and slowly the events of the last twentyfour hours were reproduced one after the other upon the polished plate  before long the king uttered an exclamation  the record pictured a small room in which were seated three gentlemen engaged in earnest conversation  one of them was the accused minister  those men said the king in a low voice while he pointed out the other two are my avowed enemies  this is proof that your wonderful spectacles indicated my ministers character with perfect truth  i am grateful to you for thus putting me upon my guard for i have trusted the man fully  oh dont mention it replied the boy lightly im glad to have been of service to you  but its time for me to go  i hope you will favor me with another interview said the king for i am much interested in your electrical inventions  i will instruct my guards to admit you at any time so you will not be obliged to fight your way in  all right  but it really doesnt matter answered rob  its no trouble at all to knock em over  then he remembered his manners and bowed low before the king who seemed to him a fine fellow and not a bit stuck up  and then he walked calmly from the palace  the people in the outer room stared at him wonderingly and the officer of the guard saluted the boy respectfully  but rob only smiled in an amused way as he marched past them with his hands thrust deep into his trousers pockets and his straw hat tipped jauntily upon the back of his head     11  the man of science   rob passed the remainder of the day wandering about london and amusing himself by watching the peculiar ways of the people  when it became so dark that there was no danger of his being observed he rose through the air to the narrow slit in the church tower and lay upon the floor of the little room with the bells hanging all around him to pass the night  he was just falling asleep when a tremendous din and clatter nearly deafened him and set the whole tower trembling  it was the midnight chime  rob clutched his ears tightly and when the vibrations had died away descended by the ladder to a lower platform  but even here the next hourly chime made his ears ring and he kept descending from platform to platform until the last half of a restless night was passed in the little room at the bottom of the tower  when at daylight the boy sat up and rubbed his eyes he said wearily churches are all right as churches but as hotels they are rank failures  i ought to have bunked in with my friend king edward  he climbed up the stairs and the ladders again and looked out the little window in the belfry  then he examined his map of europe  i believe ill take a run over to paris he thought  i must be home again by saturday to meet the demon so ill have to make every day count  without waiting for breakfast since he had eaten a tablet the evening before he crept through the window and mounted into the fresh morning air until the great city with its broad waterway lay spread out beneath him  then he sped away to the southeast and crossing the channel passed between amiens and rouen and reached paris before ten oclock  near the outskirts of the city appeared a high tower upon the flat roof of which a man was engaged in adjusting a telescope  upon seeing rob who was passing at no great distance from this tower the man cried out  approchezvenez ici  then he waved his hands frantically in the air and fairly danced with excitement  so the boy laughed and dropped down to the roof where standing beside the frenchman whose eyes were actually protruding from their sockets he asked coolly  well what do you want  the other was for a moment speechless  he was a tall lean man having a bald head but a thick irongray beard and his black eyes sparkled brightly from behind a pair of goldrimmed spectacles  after attentively regarding the boy for a time he said in broken english  but msieur how can you fly wizout zeze machine  i have experiment myself wiz some airship but youzere is nossing to make go  rob guessed that here was his opportunity to do the demon a favor by explaining his electrical devices to this new acquaintance who was evidently a man of science  here is the secret professor he said and holding out his wrist displayed the traveling machine and explained as well as he could the forces that operated it  the frenchman as you may suppose was greatly astonished and to show how perfectly the machine worked rob turned the indicator and rose a short distance above the tower circling around it before he rejoined the professor on the roof  then he showed his food tablets explaining how each was stored with sufficient nourishment for an entire day  the scientist positively gasped for breath so powerful was the excitement he experienced at witnessing these marvels  eet is wonderfulgrandmagnifique he exclaimed  but here is something of still greater interest continued rob and taking the automatic record of events from his pocket he allowed the professor to view the remarkable scenes that were being enacted throughout the civilized world  the frenchman was now trembling violently and he implored rob to tell him where he might obtain similar electrical machines  i cant do that replied the boy decidedly but having seen these you may be able to discover their construction for yourself  now that you know such things to be possible and practical the hint should be sufficient to enable a shrewd electrician to prepare duplicates of them  the scientist glared at him with evident disappointment and rob continued  these are not all the wonders i can exhibit  here is another electrical device that is perhaps the most remarkable of any i possess  he took the character marking spectacles from his pocket and fitted them to his eyes  then he gave a whistle of surprise and turned his back upon his new friend  he had seen upon the frenchmans forehead the letters e and c  guess ive struck the wrong sort of scientist after all he muttered in a disgusted tone  his companion was quick to prove the accuracy of the character marker seeing the boys back turned he seized a long iron bar that was used to operate the telescope and struck at rob so fiercely that had he not worn the garment of protection his skull would have been crushed by the blow  at it was the bar rebounded with a force that sent the murderous frenchman sprawling upon the roof and rob turned around and laughed at him  it wont work professor he said  im proof against assassins perhaps you had an idea that when you had killed me you could rob me of my valuable possessions but they wouldnt be a particle of use to a scoundrel like you i assure you  good morning  before the surprised and baffled scientist could collect himself sufficiently to reply the boy was soaring far above his head and searching for a convenient place to alight that he might investigate the charms of this famed city of paris  it was indeed a beautiful place with many stately buildings lining the shady boulevards  so thronged were the streets that rob well knew he would soon be the center of a curious crowd should he alight upon them already a few skygazers had noted the boy moving high in the air above their heads and one or two groups stood pointing their fingers at him  pausing at length above the imposing structure of the hotel anglais rob noticed at one of the upper floors an open window before which was a small iron balcony  alighting upon this he proceeded to enter without hesitation the open window  he heard a shriek and a cry of au voleur and caught sight of a womans figure as she dashed into an adjoining room slamming and locking the door behind her  i dont know as i blame her observed rob with a smile at the panic he had created  i spose she takes me for a burglar and thinks ive climbed up the lightning rod  he soon found the door leading into the hallway and walked down several flights of stairs until he reached the office of the hotel  how much do you charge a day he inquired addressing a fat and pompouslooking gentlemen behind the desk  the man looked at him in a surprised way for he had not heard the boy enter the room  but he said something in french to a waiter who was passing and the latter came to rob and made a low bow  i speak ze eengliss ver fine he said  what desire have you  what are your rates by the day asked the boy  ten francs msieur  how many dollars is that  dollar americaine  yes united states money  ah oui eet is ze two dollar msieur  all right i can stay about a day before i go bankrupt  give me a room  certainement msieur  have you ze luggage  no but ill pay in advance said rob and began counting out his dimes and nickles and pennies to the unbounded amazement of the waiter who looked as if he had never seen such coins before  he carried the money to the fat gentleman who examined the pieces curiously and there was a long conference between them before it was decided to accept them in payment for a room for a day  but at this season the hotel was almost empty and when rob protested that he had no other money the fat gentleman put the coins into his cash box with a resigned sigh and the waiter showed the boy to a little room at the very top of the building  rob washed and brushed the dust from his clothes after which he sat down and amused himself by viewing the pictures that constantly formed upon the polished plate of the record of events     12  how rob saved a republic   while following the shifting scenes of the fascinating record rob noted an occurrence that caused him to give a low whistle of astonishment and devote several moments to serious thought  i believe its about time i interfered with the politics of this republic he said at last as he closed the lid of the metal box and restored it to his pocket  if i dont take a hand there probably wont be a republic of france very long and as a good american i prefer a republic to a monarchy  then he walked downstairs and found his englishspeaking waiter  wheres president loubet he asked  ze president  ah he is wiz his mansion  to be at his residence msieur  where is his residence  the waiter began a series of voluble and explicit directions which so confused the boy that he exclaimed  oh much obliged and walked away in disgust  gaining the street he approached a gendarme and repeated his question with no better result than before for the fellow waved his arms wildly in all directions and roared a volley of incomprehensible french phrases that conveyed no meaning whatever  if ever i travel in foreign countries again said rob ill learn their lingo in advance  why doesnt the demon get up a conversation machine that will speak all languages  by dint of much inquiry however and after walking several miles following ambiguous directions he managed to reach the residence of president loubet  but there he was politely informed that the president was busily engaged in his garden and would see no one  thats all right said the boy calmly  if hes in the garden ill have no trouble finding him  then to the amazement of the frenchmen rob shot into the air fifty feet or so from which elevation he overlooked a pretty garden in the rear of the presidents mansion  the place was protected from ordinary intrusion by high walls but rob descended within the enclosure and walked up to a man who was writing at a small table placed under the spreading branches of a large tree  is this president loubet he inquired with a bow  the gentleman looked up  my servants were instructed to allow no one to disturb me he said speaking in excellent english  it isnt their fault i flew over the wall returned rob  the fact is he added hastily as he noted the presidents frown i have come to save the republic and i havent much time to waste over a bundle of frenchmen either  the president seemed surprised  your name he demanded sharply  robert billings joslyn united states of america  your business monsieur joslyn  rob drew the record from his pocket and placed it upon the table  this sir said he is an electrical device that records all important events  i wish to call your attention to a scene enacted in paris last evening which may have an effect upon the future history of your country  he opened the lid placed the record so that the president could see clearly and then watched the changing expressions upon the great mans face first indifference then interest the next moment eagerness and amazement  mon dieu he gasped the orleanists  rob nodded  yes theyve worked up a rather pretty plot havent they  the president did not reply  he was anxiously watching the record and scribbling notes on a paper beside him  his face was pale and his lips tightly compressed  finally he leaned back in his chair and asked  can you reproduce this scene again  certainly sir answered the boy as often as you like  will you remain here while i send for my minister of police  it will require but a short time  call him up then  im in something of a hurry myself but now ive mixed up with this thing ill see it through  the president touched a bell and gave an order to his servant  then he turned to rob and said wonderingly  you are a boy  thats true mr president was the answer but an american boy you must remember  that makes a big difference i assure you  the president bowed gravely  this is your invention he asked  no im hardly equal to that  but the inventor has made me a present of the record and its the only one in the world  it is a marvel remarked the president thoughtfully  more  it is a real miracle  we are living in an age of wonders my young friend  no one knows that better than myself sir replied rob  but tell me can you trust your chief of police  i think so said the president slowly yet since your invention has shown me that many men i have considered honest are criminally implicated in this royalist plot i hardly know whom to depend upon  then please wear these spectacles during your interview with the minister of police said the boy  you must say nothing while he is with us about certain marks that will appear upon his forehead but when he has gone i will explain those marks so you will understand them  the president covered his eyes with the spectacles  why he exclaimed i see upon your own brow the letters  stop sir interrupted rob with a blush i dont care to know what the letters are if its just the same to you  the president seemed puzzled by this speech but fortunately the minister of police arrived just then and under robs guidance the pictured record of the orleanist plot was reproduced before the startled eyes of the official  and now said the boy let us see if any of this foolishness is going on just at present  he turned to the opposite side of the record and allowed the president and his minister of police to witness the quick succession of events even as they occurred  suddenly the minister cried ha and pointing to the figure of a man disembarking from an english boat at calais he said excitedly  that your excellency is the duke of orleans in disguise  i must leave you for a time that i may issue some necessary orders to my men but this evening i shall call to confer with you regarding the best mode of suppressing this terrible plot  when the official had departed the president removed the spectacles from his eyes and handed them to rob  what did you see asked the boy  the letters g and w  then you may trust him fully declared rob and explained the construction of the character marker to the interested and amazed statesman  and now i must go he continued for my stay in your city will be a short one and i want to see all i can  the president scrawled something on a sheet of paper and signed his name to it afterward presenting it with a courteous bow to his visitor  this will enable you to go wherever you please while in paris he said  i regret my inability to reward you properly for the great service you have rendered my country but you have my sincerest gratitude and may command me in any way  oh thats all right answered rob  i thought it was my duty to warn you and if you look sharp youll be able to break up this conspiracy  but i dont want any reward  good day sir  he turned the indicator of his traveling machine and immediately rose into the air followed by a startled exclamation from the president of france  moving leisurely over the city he selected a deserted thoroughfare to alight in from whence he wandered unobserved into the beautiful boulevards  these were now brilliantly lighted and crowds of pleasure seekers thronged them everywhere  rob experienced a decided sense of relief as he mixed with the gay populace and enjoyed the sights of the splendid city for it enabled him to forget for a time the responsibilities thrust upon him by the possession of the demons marvelous electrical devices     13  rob loses his treasures   our young adventurer had intended to pass the night in the little bed at his hotel but the atmosphere of paris proved so hot and disagreeable that he decided it would be more enjoyable to sleep while journeying through the cooler air that lay far above the earths surface  so just as the clocks were striking the midnight hour rob mounted skyward and turned the indicator of the traveling machine to the east intending to make the city of vienna his next stop  he had risen to a considerable distance where the air was remarkably fresh and exhilarating and the relief he experienced from the close and muggy streets of paris was of such a soothing nature that he presently fell fast asleep  his day in the metropolis had been a busy one for like all boys he had forgotten himself in the delight of sightseeing and had tired his muscles and exhausted his strength to an unusual degree  it was about three oclock in the morning when rob moving restlessly in his sleep accidently touched with his right hand the indicator of the machine which was fastened to his left wrist setting it a couple of points to the south of east  he was of course unaware of the slight alteration in his course which was destined to prove of serious importance in the near future  for the boys fatigue induced him to sleep far beyond daybreak and during this period of unconsciousness he was passing over the face of european countries and approaching the lawless and dangerous dominions of the orient  when at last he opened his eyes he was puzzled to determine where he was  beneath him stretched a vast sandy plain and speeding across this he came to a land abounding in luxuriant vegetation  the centrifugal force which propelled him was evidently for some reason greatly accelerated for the scenery of the country he was crossing glided by him at so rapid a rate of speed that it nearly took his breath away  i wonder if ive passed vienna in the night he thought  it ought not to have taken me more than a few hours to reach there from paris  vienna was at that moment fifteen hundred miles behind him but robs geography had always been his stumbling block at school and he had not learned to gage the speed of the traveling machine so he was completely mystified as to his whereabouts  presently a village having many queer spires and minarets whisked by him like a flash  rob became worried and resolved to slow up at the next sign of habitation  this was a good resolution but turkestan is so thinly settled that before the boy could plan out a course of action he had passed the barren mountain range of thianshan as nimbly as an acrobat leaps a jumpingbar  this wont do at all he exclaimed earnestly  the traveling machine seems to be running away with me and im missing no end of sights by scooting along up here in the clouds  he turned the indicator to zero and was relieved to find it obey with customary quickness  in a few moments he had slowed up and stopped when he found himself suspended above another stretch of sandy plain being too high to see the surface of the plain distinctly he dropped down a few hundred feet to a lower level where he discovered he was surrounded by billows of sand as far as his eye could reach  its a desert all right was his comment perhaps old sahara herself  he started the machine again towards the east and at a more moderate rate of speed skimmed over the surface of the desert  before long he noticed a dark spot ahead of him which proved to be a large body of fierce looking men riding upon dromedaries and slender spirited horses and armed with long rifles and crookedly shaped simitars  those fellows seem to be looking for trouble remarked the boy as he glided over them and it wouldnt be exactly healthy for an enemy to get in their way  but i havent time to stop so im not likely to get mixed up in any rumpus with them  however the armed caravan was scarcely out of sight before rob discovered he was approaching a rich wooded oasis of the desert in the midst of which was built the walled city of yarkand  not that he had ever heard of the place or knew its name for few europeans and only one american traveler had ever visited it  but he guessed it was a city of some importance from its size and beauty and resolved to make a stop there  above the high walls projected many slender white minarets indicating that the inhabitants were either turks or some race of mohammedans so rob decided to make investigations before trusting himself to their company  a cluster of tall trees with leafy tops stood a short distance outside the walls and here the boy landed and sat down to rest in the refreshing shade  the city seemed as hushed and still as if it were deserted and before him stretched the vast plain of white heated sands  he strained his eyes to catch a glimpse of the band of warriors he had passed but they were moving slowly and had not yet appeared  the trees that sheltered rob were the only ones without the city although many low bushes or shrubs grew scattering over the space between him and the walls  an arched gateway broke the enclosure at his left but the gates were tightly shut  something in the stillness and the intense heat of the midday sun made the boy drowsy  he stretched himself upon the ground beneath the dense foliage of the biggest tree and abandoned himself to the languor that was creeping over him  ill wait until that army of the desert arrives he thought sleepily  they either belong in this city or have come to capture it so i can tell better what to dance when i find out what the band plays  the next moment he was sound asleep sprawling upon his back in the shade and slumbering as peacefully as an infant  and while he lay motionless three men dropped in quick succession from the top of the city wall and hid among the low bushes crawling noiselessly from one to another and so approaching by degrees the little group of trees  they were turks and had been sent by those in authority within the city to climb the tallest tree of the group and discover if the enemy was near  for robs conjecture had been correct and the city of yarkand awaited with more or less anxiety a threatened assault from its hereditary enemies the tatars  the three spies were not less forbidding in appearance than the horde of warriors rob had passed upon the desert  their features were coarse and swarthy and their eyes had a most villainous glare  old fashioned pistols and doubleedged daggers were stuck in their belts and their clothing though of gorgeous colors was soiled and neglected  with all the caution of the american savage these turks approached the tree where to their unbounded amazement they saw the boy lying asleep  his dress and fairness of skin at once proclaimed him in their shrewd eyes a european and their first thought was to glance around in search of his horse or dromedary  seeing nothing of the kind near they were much puzzled to account for his presence and stood looking down at him with evident curiosity  the sun struck the polished surface of the traveling machine which was attached to robs wrist and made the metal glitter like silver  this attracted the eyes of the tallest turk who stooped down and stealthily unclasped the band of the machine from the boys outstretched arm then after a hurried but puzzled examination of the little instrument he slipped it into the pocket of his jacket  rob stirred uneasily in his sleep and one of the turks drew a slight but stout rope from his breast and with gentle but deft movement passed it around the boys wrists and drew them together behind him  the action was not swift enough to arouse the power of repulsion in the garment of protection but it awakened rob effectually so that he sat up and stared hard at his captors  what are you trying to do anyhow he demanded  the turks laughed and said something in their own language  they had no knowledge of english  youre only making fools of yourselves continued the boy wrathfully  its impossible for you to injure me  the three paid no attention to his words  one of them thrust his hand into robs pocket and drew out the electric tube  his ignorance of modern appliances was so great that he did not know enough to push the button  rob saw him looking down the hollow end of the tube and murmured  i wish it would blow your ugly head off  but the fellow thinking the shining metal might be of some value to him put the tube in his own pocket and then took from the prisoner the silver box of tablets  rob writhed and groaned at losing his possessions in this way and while his hands were fastened behind him tried to feel for and touch the indicator of the traveling machine  when he found that the machine also had been taken his anger gave way to fear for he realized he was in a dangerously helpless condition  the third turk now drew the record of events from the boys inner pocket  he knew nothing of the springs that opened the lids so after a curious glance at it he secreted the box in the folds of his sash and continued the search of the captive  the character marking spectacles were next abstracted but the turk seeing in them nothing but spectacles scornfully thrust them back into robs pocket while his comrades laughed at him  the boy was now rifled of seventeen cents in pennies a broken pocket knife and a leadpencil the last article seeming to be highly prized  after they had secured all the booty they could find the tall turk who seemed the leader of the three violently kicked at the prisoner with his heavy boot  his surprise was great when the garment of repulsion arrested the blow and nearly overthrew the aggressor in turn snatching a dagger from his sash he bounded upon the boy so fiercely that the next instant the enraged turk found himself lying upon his back three yards away while his dagger flew through the air and landed deep in the desert sands  keep it up cried rob bitterly  i hope youll enjoy yourself  the other turks raised their comrade to his feet and the three stared at one another in surprise being unable to understand how a bound prisoner could so effectually defend himself  but at a whispered word from the leader they drew their long pistols and fired point blank into robs face  the volley echoed sharply from the city walls but as the smoke drifted slowly away the turks were horrified to see their intended victim laughing at them  uttering cries of terror and dismay the three took to their heels and bounded towards the wall where a gate quickly opened to receive them the populace feeling sure the tatar horde was upon them  nor was this guess so very far wrong for as rob sitting disconsolate upon the sand raised his eyes he saw across the desert a dark line that marked the approach of the invaders  nearer and nearer they came while rob watched them and bemoaned the foolish impulse that had led him to fall asleep in an unknown land where he could so easily be overpowered and robbed of his treasures  i always suspected these electrical inventions would be my ruin some day he reflected sadly and now im sidetracked and left helpless in this outlandish country without a single hope of ever getting home again  they probably wont be able to kill me unless they find my garment of repulsion and strip that off but i never could cross this terrible desert on foot and having lost my food tablets id soon starve if i attempted it  fortunately he had eaten one of the tablets just before going to sleep so there was no danger of immediate starvation  but he was miserable and unhappy and remained brooding over his cruel fate until a sudden shout caused him to look up     14  turk and tatar   the tatars had arrived swiftly and noiselessly and a dozen of the warriors still mounted were surrounding him  his helpless condition aroused their curiosity and while some of them hastily cut away his bonds and raised him to his feet other plied him with questions in their own language  rob shook his head to indicate that he could not understand so they led him to the chiefan immense bearded representative of the tribe of karakhitai the terrible and relentless black tatars of thibet  the huge frame of this fellow was clothed in flowing robes of clothofgold braided with jewels and he sat majestically upon the back of a jetblack camel  under ordinary circumstances the stern features and flashing black eyes of this redoubtable warrior would have struck a chill of fear to the boys heart but now under the influence of the crushing misfortunes he had experienced he was able to gaze with indifference upon the terrible visage of the desert chief  the tatar seemed not to consider rob an enemy  instead he looked upon him as an ally since the turks had bound and robbed him  finding it impossible to converse with the chief rob took refuge in the sign language  he turned his pockets wrong side out showed the red welts left upon his wrists by the tight cord and then shook his fists angrily in the direction of the town  in return the tatar nodded gravely and issued an order to his men  by this time the warriors were busily pitching tents before the walls of yarkand and making preparations for a formal siege  in obedience to the chieftains orders rob was given a place within one of the tents nearest the wall and supplied with a brace of brassmounted pistols and a dagger with a sharp zigzag edge  these were evidently to assist the boy in fighting the turks and he was well pleased to have them  his spirits rose considerably when he found he had fallen among friends although most of his new comrades had such evil faces that it was unnecessary to put on the character markers to judge their natures with a fair degree of accuracy  i cant be very particular about the company i keep he thought and this gang hasnt tried to murder me as the rascally turks did  so for the present ill stand in with the scowling chief and try to get a shot at the thieves who robbed me  if our side wins i may get a chance to recover some of my property  its a slim chance of course but its the only hope i have left  that very evening an opportunity occurred for rob to win glory in the eyes of his new friends  just before sundown the gates of the city flew open and a swarm of turks mounted upon fleet horses and camels issued forth and fell upon their enemies  the tatars who did not expect the sally were scarcely able to form an opposing rank when they found themselves engaged in a handtohand conflict fighting desperately for their lives  in such a battle however the turks were at a disadvantage for the active tatars slipped beneath their horses and disabled them bringing both the animals and their riders to the earth  at the first onslaught rob shot his pistol at a turk and wounded him so severely that he fell from his horse  instantly the boy seized the bridle and sprang upon the steeds back and the next moment he had dashed into the thickest part of the fray  bullets and blows rained upon him from all sides but the garment of repulsion saved him from a single scratch  when his pistols had been discharged he caught up the broken handle of a spear and used it as a club galloping into the ranks of the turks and belaboring them as hard as he could  the tatars cheered and followed him and the turks were so amazed at his miraculous escape from their bullets that they became terrified thinking he bore a charmed life and was protected by unseen powers  this terror helped turn the tide of battle and before long the enemy was pressed back to the walls and retreated through the gates which were hastily fastened behind them  in order to prevent a repetition of this sally the tatars at once invested the gates so that if the turks should open them they were as likely to let their foes in as to oppose them  while the tents were being moved up rob had an opportunity to search the battlefield for the bodies of the three turks who had robbed him but they were not among the fallen  those fellows were too cowardly to take part in a fair fight declared the boy but he was much disappointed nevertheless as he felt very helpless without the electric tube or the traveling machine  the tatar chief now called rob to his tent and presented him with a beautiful ring set with a glowing pigeonsblood ruby in acknowledgment of his services  this gift made the boy feel very proud and he said to the chief  youre all right old man even if you do look like a pirate  if you can manage to capture that city so i can get my electrical devices back ill consider you a trump as long as i live  the chief thought this speech was intended to express robs gratitude so he bowed solemnly in return  during the night that followed upon the first engagement of the turks and tatars the boy lay awake trying to devise some plan to capture the city  the walls seemed too high and thick to be either scaled or broken by the tatars who had no artillery whatever and within the walls lay all the fertile part of the oasis giving the besieged a good supply of water and provisions while the besiegers were obliged to subsist on what water and food they had brought with them  just before dawn rob left his tent and went out to look at the great wall  the stars gave plenty of light but the boy was worried to find that according to eastern custom no sentries or guards whatever had been posted and all the tatars were slumbering soundly  the city was likewise wrapped in profound silence but just as rob was turning away he saw a head project stealthily over the edge of the wall before him and recognized in the features one of the turks who had robbed him  finding no one awake except the boy the fellow sat upon the edge of the wall with his feet dangling downward and grinned wickedly at his former victim  rob watched him with almost breathless eagerness  after making many motions that conveyed no meaning whatever the turk drew the electric tube from his pocket and pointed his finger first at the boy and then at the instrument as if inquiring what it was used for  rob shook his head  the turk turned the tube over several times and examined it carefully after which he also shook his head seeming greatly puzzled  by this time the boy was fairly trembling with excitement  he longed to recover this valuable weapon and feared that at any moment the curious turk would discover its use  he held out his hand toward the tube and tried to say by motions that he would show the fellow how to use it  the man seemed to understand by he would not let the glittering instrument out of his possession  rob was almost in despair when he happened to notice upon his hand the ruby ring given him by the chief  drawing the jewel from his finger he made offer by signs that he would exchange it for the tube  the turk was much pleased with the idea and nodded his head repeatedly holding out his hand for the ring  rob had little confidence in the mans honor but he was so eager to regain the tube that he decided to trust him  so he threw the ring to the top of the wall where the turk caught it skilfully but when rob held out his hand for the tube the scoundrel only laughed at him and began to scramble to his feet in order to beat a retreat  chance however foiled this disgraceful treachery for in his hurry the turk allowed the tube to slip from his grasp and it rolled off the wall and fell upon the sand at robs very feet  the robber turned to watch its fall and filled with sudden anger the boy grabbed the weapon pointed it at his enemy and pressed the button  down tumbled the turk without a cry and lay motionless at the foot of the wall  robs first thought was to search the pockets of his captive and to his delight he found and recovered his box of food tablets  the record of events and the traveling machine were doubtless in the possession of the other robbers but rob did not despair of recovering them now that he had the tube to aid him  day was now breaking and several of the tatars appeared and examined the body of the turk with grunts of surprise for there was no mark upon him to show how he had been slain  supposing him to be dead they tossed him aside and forgot all about him  rob had secured his ruby ring again and going to the chiefs tent he showed the jewel to the guard and was at once admitted  the blackbearded chieftain was still reclining upon his pillows but rob bowed before him and by means of signs managed to ask for a band of warriors to assist him in assaulting the town  the chieftain appeared to doubt the wisdom of the enterprise not being able to understand how the boy could expect to succeed but he graciously issued the required order and by the time rob reached the city gate he found a large group of tatars gathered to support him while the entire camp roused to interest in the proceedings stood looking on  rob cared little for the quarrel between the turks and tatars and under ordinary circumstances would have refused to side with one or the other but he knew he could not hope to recover his electrical machines unless the city was taken by the band of warriors who had befriended him so he determined to force an entrance for them  without hesitation he walked close to the great gate and shattered its fastenings with the force of the electric current directed upon them from the tube  then shouting to his friends the tatars for assistance they rushed in a body upon the gate and dashed it open  the turks had expected trouble when they heard the fastenings of the huge gate splinter and fall apart so they had assembled in force before the opening  as the tatars poured through the gateway in a compact mass they were met by a hail of bullets spears and arrows which did fearful execution among them  many were killed outright while others fell wounded to be trampled upon by those who pressed on from the rear  rob maintained his position in the front rank but escaped all injury through the possession of the garment of repulsion  but he took an active part in the fight and pressed the button of the electric tube again and again tumbling the enemy into heaps on every side even the horses and camels falling helplessly before the resistless current of electricity  the tatars shouted joyfully as they witnessed this marvelous feat and rushed forward to assist in the slaughter but the boy motioned them all back  he did not wish any more bloodshed than was necessary and knew that the heaps of unconscious turks around him would soon recover  so he stood alone and faced the enemy calmly knocking them over as fast as they came near  two of the turks managed to creep up behind the boy and one of them who wielded an immense simitar with a twoedged blade as sharp as a razor swung the weapon fiercely to cut off robs head  but the repulsive force aroused in the garment was so terrific that it sent the weapon flying backwards with redoubled swiftness so that it caught the second turk at the waist and cut him fairly in two  thereafter they all avoided coming near the boy and in a surprisingly short time the turkish forces were entirely conquered all having been reduced to unconsciousness except a few cowards who had run away and hidden in the cellars or garrets of the houses  the tatars entered the city with shouts of triumph and the chief was so delighted that he threw his arms around robs neck and embraced him warmly  then began the sack of yarkand the fierce tatars plundering the bazaars and houses stripping them of everything of value they could find  rob searched anxiously among the bodies of the unconscious turks for the two men who had robbed him but neither could be found  he was more successful later for in running through the streets he came upon a band of tatars leading a man with a rope around his neck whom rob quickly recognized as one of the thieves he was hunting for  the tatars willingly allowed him to search the fellow and in one of his pockets rob found the record of events  he had now recovered all his property except the traveling machine the one thing that was absolutely necessary to enable him to escape from this barbarous country  he continued his search persistently and an hour later found the dead body of the third robber lying in the square in the center of the city but the traveling machine was not on his person and for the first time the boy began to give way to despair  in the distance he heard loud shouts and sound of renewed strife warning him that the turks were recovering consciousness and engaging the tatars with great fierceness  the latter had scattered throughout the town thinking themselves perfectly secure so that not only were they unprepared to fight but they became panicstricken at seeing their foes return as it seemed from death to life  their usual courage forsook them and they ran terrified in every direction only to be cut down by the revengeful turkish simitars  rob was sitting upon the edge of a marble fountain in the center of the square when a crowd of victorious turks appeared and quickly surrounded him  the boy paid no attention to their gestures and the turks feared to approach him nearly so they stood a short distance away and fired volleys at him from their rifles and pistols  rob glared at them scornfully and seeing they could not injure him the turks desisted but they still surrounded him and the crowd grew thicker every moment  women now came creeping from their hiding places and mingled with the ranks of the men and rob guessed from their joyous chattering that the turks had regained the city and driven out or killed the tatar warriors  he reflected gloomily that this did not affect his own position in any way since he could not escape from the oasis  suddenly on glancing at the crowd rob saw something that arrested his attention  a young girl was fastening some article to the wrist of a burly villainouslooking turk  the boy saw a glitter that reminded him of the traveling machine but immediately afterward the man and the girl bent their heads over the fellows wrist in such a way that rob could see nothing more  while the couple were apparently examining the strange device rob started to his feet and walked toward them  the crowd fell back at his approach but the man and the girl were so interested that they did not notice him  he was still several paces away when the girl put out her finger and touched the indicator on the dial  to robs horror and consternation the big turk began to rise slowly into the air while a howl of fear burst from the crowd  but the boy made a mighty spring and caught the turk by his foot clinging to it with desperate tenacity while they both mounted steadily upward until they were far above the city of the desert  the big turk screamed pitifully at first and then actually fainted away from fright  rob was much frightened on his part for he knew if his hands slipped from their hold he would fall to his death  indeed one hand was slipping already so he made a frantic clutch and caught firmly hold of the turks baggy trousers  then slowly and carefully he drew himself up and seized the leather belt that encircled the mans waist  this firm grip gave him new confidence and he began to breathe more freely  he now clung to the body of the turk with both legs entwined in the way he was accustomed to cling to a treetrunk when he climbed after cherries at home  he had conquered his fear of falling and took time to recover his wits and his strength  they had now reached such a tremendous height that the city looked like a speck on the desert beneath them  knowing he must act quickly rob seized the dangling left arm of the unconscious turk and raised it until he could reach the dial of the traveling machine  he feared to unclasp the machine just then for two reasons if it slipped from his grasp they would both plunge downward to their death and he was not sure the machine would work at all if in any other position than fastened to the left wrist  rob determined to take no chances so he left the machine attached to the turk and turned the indicator to zero and then to east for he did not wish to rejoin either his enemies the turks or his equally undesirable friends the tatars  after traveling eastward a few minutes he lost sight of the city altogether so still clinging to the body of the turk he again turned the indicator and began to descend  when at last they landed gently upon a rocky eminence of the kuenlun mountains the boys strength was almost exhausted and his limbs ached with the strain of clinging to the turks body  his first act was to transfer the traveling machine to his own wrist and to see that his other electrical devices were safely bestowed in his pockets  then he sat upon the rock to rest until the turk recovered consciousness  presently the fellow moved uneasily rolled over and then sat up and stared at his surroundings  perhaps he thought he had been dreaming for he rubbed his eyes and looked again with mingled surprise and alarm  then seeing rob he uttered a savage shout and drew his dagger  rob smiled and pointed the electric tube at the man who doubtless recognized its power for he fell back scowling and trembling  this place seems like a good jog from civilization remarked the boy as coolly as if his companion could understand what he said but as your legs are long and strong you may be able to find your way  its true youre liable to starve to death but if you do it will be your own misfortune and not my fault  the turk glared at him sullenly but did not attempt to reply  rob took out his box of tablets ate one of them and offered another to his enemy  the fellow accepted it ungraciously enough but seeing rob eat one he decided to follow his example and consumed the tablet with a queer expression of distrust upon his face  brave man cried rob laughingly youve avoided the pangs of starvation for a time anyhow so i can leave you with a clear conscience  without more ado he turned the indicator of the traveling machine and mounted into the air leaving the turk sitting upon the rocks and staring after him in comical bewilderment     15  a battle with monsters   our young adventurer never experienced a more grateful feeling of relief and security than when he found himself once more high in the air alone and in undisputed possession of the electrical devices bestowed upon him by the demon  the dangers he had passed through since landing at the city of the desert and the desperate chance that alone had permitted him to regain the traveling machine made him shudder at the bare recollection and rendered him more sober and thoughtful than usual  we who stick closely to the earths surface can scarcely realize how rob could travel through the air at such dizzy heights without any fear or concern whatsoever  but he had come to consider the air a veritable refuge  experience had given him implicit confidence in the powers of the electrical instrument whose unseen forces carried him so swiftly and surely and while the tiny watchlike machine was clasped to his wrist he felt himself to be absolutely safe  having slipped away from the turk and attained a fair altitude he set the indicator at zero and paused long enough to consult his map and decide what direction it was best for him to take  the mischance that had swept him unwittingly over the countries of europe had also carried him more than half way around the world from his home  therefore the nearest way to reach america would be to continue traveling to the eastward  so much time had been consumed at the desert oasis that he felt he must now hasten if he wished to reach home by saturday afternoon so having quickly come to a decision he turned the indicator and began a swift flight into the east  for several hours he traveled above the great desert of gobi but by noon signs of a more fertile country began to appear and dropping to a point nearer the earth he was able to observe closely the country of the chinese with its crowded population and ancient but crude civilization  then he came to the great wall of china and to mighty peking above which he hovered some time examining it curiously  he really longed to make a stop there but with his late experiences fresh in his mind he thought it much safer to view the wonderful city from a distance  resuming his flight he presently came to the gulf of laou tong whose fair face was freckled with many ships of many nations and so on to korea which seemed to him a land fully a century behind the times  night overtook him while speeding across the sea of japan and having a great desire to view the mikados famous islands he put the indicator at zero and coming to a full stop composed himself to sleep until morning that he might run no chances of being carried beyond his knowledge during the night  you might suppose it no easy task to sleep suspended in midair yet the magnetic currents controlled by the traveling machine were so evenly balanced that rob was fully as comfortable as if reposing upon a bed of down  he had become somewhat accustomed to passing the night in the air and now slept remarkably well having no fear of burglars or fire or other interruptions that dwellers in cities are subject to  one thing however he should have remembered that he was in an ancient and little known part of the world and reposing above a sea famous in fable as the home of many fierce and terrible creatures while not far away lay the land of the dragon the simurg and other ferocious monsters  rob may have read of these things in fairy tales and books of travel but if so they had entirely slipped his mind so he slumbered peacefully and actually snored a little i believe towards morning  but even as the red sun peeped curiously over the horizon he was awakened by a most unusual disturbancea succession of hoarse screams and a pounding of the air as from the quickly revolving blades of some huge windmill  he rubbed his eyes and looked around  coming towards him at his right hand was an immense bird whose body seemed almost as big as that of a horse  its wideopen curving beak was set with rows of pointed teeth and the talons held against its breast and turned threateningly outward were more powerful and dreadful than a tigers claws  while fascinated and horrified he watched the approach of this feathered monster a scream sounded just behind him and the next instant the stroke of a mighty wing sent him whirling over and over through the air  he soon came to a stop however and saw that another of the monsters had come upon him from the rear and was now with its mate circling closely around him while both uttered continuously their hoarse savage cries  rob wondered why the garment of repulsion had not protected him from the blow of the birds wing but as a matter of fact it had protected him  for it was not the wing itself but the force of the eddying currents of air that had sent him whirling away from the monster  with the indicator at zero the magnetic currents and the opposing powers of attraction and repulsion were so evenly balanced that any violent atmospheric disturbance affected him in the same way that thistledown is affected by a summer breeze  he had noticed something of this before but whenever a strong wind was blowing he was accustomed to rise to a position above the air currents  this was the first time he had slept with the indicator at zero  the huge birds at once renewed their attack but rob had now recovered his wits sufficiently to draw the electric tube from his pocket  the first one to dart towards him received the powerful electric current direct from the tube and fell stunned and fluttering to the surface of the sea where it floated motionless  its mate perhaps warned by this sudden disaster renewed its circling flight moving so swiftly that rob could scarcely follow it and drawing nearer and nearer every moment to its intended victim  the boy could not turn in the air very quickly and he feared an attack in the back mistrusting the saving power of the garment of repulsion under such circumstances so in desperation he pressed his finger upon the button of the tube and whirled the instrument around his head in the opposite direction to that in which the monster was circling  presently the current and the bird met and with one last scream the creature tumbled downwards to join its fellow upon the waves where they lay like two floating islands  their presence had left a rank sickening stench in the surrounding atmosphere so rob made haste to resume his journey and was soon moving rapidly eastward  he could not control a shudder at the recollection of his recent combat and realized the horror of a meeting with such creatures by one who had no protection from their sharp beaks and talons  its no wonder the japs draw ugly pictures of those monsters he thought  people who live in these parts must pass most of their lives in a tremble  the sun was now shining brilliantly and when the beautiful islands of japan came in sight rob found that he had recovered his wonted cheerfulness  he moved along slowly hovering with curious interest over the quaint and picturesque villages and watching the industrious japanese patiently toiling at their tasks  just before he reached tokio he came to a military fort and for nearly an hour watched the skilful maneuvers of a regiment of soldiers at their morning drill they were not very big people compared with other nations but they seemed alert and well trained and the boy decided it would require a brave enemy to face them on a field of battle  having at length satisfied his curiosity as to japanese life and customs rob prepared for his long flight across the pacific ocean  by consulting his map he discovered that should he maintain his course due east as before he would arrive at a point in america very near to san francisco which suited his plans excellently  having found that he moved more swiftly when farthest from the earths surface because the air was more rarefied and offered less resistance rob mounted upwards until the islands of japan were mere specks visible through the clear sunny atmosphere  then he began his eastward flight the broad surface of the pacific seeming like a blue cloud far beneath him     16  shipwrecked mariners   ample proof of robs careless and restless nature having been frankly placed before the reader in these pages you will doubtless be surprised when i relate that during the next few hours our young gentleman suffered from a severe attack of homesickness becoming as gloomy and unhappy in its duration as ever a homesick boy could be  it may have been because he was just then cut off from all his fellowcreatures and even from the world itself it may have been because he was satiated with marvels and with the almost absolute control over the powers which the demon had conferred upon him or it may have been because he was born and reared a hearty healthy american boy with a disposition to battle openly with the world and take his chances equally with his fellows rather than be placed in such an exclusive position that no one could hope successfully to oppose him  perhaps he himself did not know what gave him this horrible attack of the blues but the truth is he took out his handkerchief and cried like a baby from very loneliness and misery  there was no one to see him thank goodness and the tears gave him considerable relief  he dried his eyes made an honest struggle to regain his cheerfulness and then muttered to himself  if i stay up here like an airbubble in the sky i shall certainly go crazy  i suppose theres nothing but water to look at down below but if i could only sight a ship or even see a fish jump it would do me no end of good  thereupon he descended until as the oceans surface same nearer and nearer he discovered a tiny island lying almost directly underneath him  it was hardly big enough to make a dot on the biggest map but a clump of trees grew in the central portion while around the edges were jagged rocks protecting a sandy beach and a stretch of flowerstrewn upland leading to the trees  it looked beautiful from robs elevated position and his spirits brightened at once  ill drop down and pick a bouquet he exclaimed and a few moments later his feet touched the firm earth of the island  but before he could gather a dozen of the brilliant flowers a glad shout reached his ears and looking up he saw two men running towards him from the trees  they were dressed in sailor fashion but their clothing was reduced to rags and scarcely clung to their brown skinny bodies  as they advanced they waved their arms wildly in the air and cried in joyful tones  a boat a boat  rob stared at them wonderingly and had much ado to prevent the poor fellows from hugging him outright so great was their joy at his appearance  one of them rolled upon the ground laughing and crying by turns while the other danced and cut capers until he became so exhausted that he sank down breathless beside his comrade  how came you here then inquired the boy in pitying tones  were shipwrecked american sailors from the bark cynthia jane which went down near here over a month ago answered the smallest and thinnest of the two  we escaped by clinging to a bit of wreckage and floated to this island where we have nearly starved to death  indeed we now have eaten everything on the island that was eatable and had your boat arrived a few days later youd have found us lying dead upon the beach  rob listened to this sad tale with real sympathy  but i didnt come here in a boat said he  the men sprang to their feet with white scared faces  no boat they cried are you too shipwrecked  no he answered  i flew here through the air  and then he explained to them the wonderful electric traveling machine  but the sailors had no interest whatever in the relation  their disappointment was something awful to witness and one of them laid his head upon his comrades shoulder and wept with unrestrained grief so weak and discouraged had they become through suffering  suddenly rob remembered that he could assist them and took the box of concentrated food tablets from his pocket  eat these he said offering one of each to the sailors  at first they could not understand that these small tablets would be able to allay the pangs of hunger but when rob explained their virtues the men ate them greedily  within a few moments they were so greatly restored to strength and courage that their eyes brightened their sunken cheeks flushed and they were able to converse with their benefactor with calmness and intelligence  then the boy sat beside them upon the grass and told them the story of his acquaintance with the demon and of all his adventures since he had come into possession of the wonderful electric contrivances  in his present mood he felt it would be a relief to confide in some one and so these poor lonely men were the first to hear his story  when he related the manner in which he had clung to the turk while both ascended into the air the elder of the two sailors listened with rapt attention and then after some thought asked  why couldnt you carry one or both of us to america  rob took time seriously to consider this idea while the sailors eyed him with eager interest  finally he said  im afraid i couldnt support your weight long enough to reach any other land  its a long journey and youd pull my arms out of joint before wed been up an hour  their faces fell at this but one of them said  why couldnt we swing ourselves over your shoulders with a rope  our two bodies would balance each other and we are so thin and emaciated that we do not weigh very much  while considering this suggestion rob remembered how at one time five pirates had clung to his left leg and been carried some distance through the air  have you a rope he asked  no was the answer but there are plenty of long tough vines growing on the island that are just as strong and pliable as ropes  then if you are willing to run the chances decided the boy i will make the attempt to save you  but i must warn you that in case i find i can not support the weight of your bodies i shall drop one or both of you into the sea  they looked grave at this prospect but the biggest one said  we would soon meet death from starvation if you left us here on the island so as there is at least a chance of our being able to escape in your company i for one am willing to risk being drowned  it is easier and quicker than being starved  and as im the heavier i suppose youll drop me first  certainly declared rob promptly  this announcement seemed to be an encouragement to the little sailor but he said nervously  i hope youll keep near the water for i havent a good head for heightsthey always make me dizzy  oh if you dont want to go began rob i can easily  but i do i do i do cried the little man interrupting him  i shall die if you leave me behind  well then get your ropes and well do the best we can said the boy  they ran to the trees around the trunks of which were clinging many tendrils of greenishbrown vine which possessed remarkable strength with their knives they cut a long section of this vine the ends of which were then tied into loops large enough to permit the sailors to sit in them comfortably  the connecting piece rob padded with seaweed gathered from the shore to prevent its cutting into his shoulders  now then he said when all was ready take your places  the sailors squatted in the loops and rob swung the vine over his shoulders and turned the indicator of the traveling machine to up  as they slowly mounted into the sky the little sailor gave a squeal of terror and clung to the boys arm but the other although seemingly anxious sat quietly in his place and made no trouble  dddont gggo so high stammered the little one tremblingly suppose we should fffall  well spose we should answered rob gruffly  you couldnt drown until you struck the water so the higher we are the longer youll live in case of accident  this phase of the question seemed to comfort the frightened fellow somewhat but as he said he had not a good head for heights and so continued to tremble in spite of his resolve to be brave  the weight on robs shoulders was not so great as he had feared the traveling machine seeming to give a certain lightness and buoyancy to everything that came into contact with its wearer  as soon as he had reached a sufficient elevation to admit of good speed he turned the indicator once more to the east and began moving rapidly through the air the shipwrecked sailors dangling at either side  this is awawawful gasped the little one  say you shut up commanded the boy angrily  if your friend was as big a coward as you are id drop you both this minute  let go my arm and keep quiet if you want to reach land alive  the fellow whimpered a little but managed to remain silent for several minutes  then he gave a sudden twitch and grabbed robs arm again  sposespose the vine should break he moaned a horrified look upon his face  ive had about enough of this said rob savagely  if you havent any sense you dont deserve to live  he turned the indicator on the dial of the machine and they began to descend rapidly  the little fellow screamed with fear but rob paid no attention to him until the feet of the two suspended sailors were actually dipping into the waves when he brought their progress to an abrupt halt  whwhwhat are you gggoing to do gurgled the cowardly sailor  im going to feed you to the sharksunless you promise to keep your mouth shut retorted the boy  now then decide at once  which will it besharks or silence  i wont say a wordpon my honor i wont said the sailor shudderingly  all right remember your promise and well have no further trouble remarked rob who had hard work to keep from laughing at the mans abject terror  once more he ascended and continued the journey and for several hours they rode along swiftly and silently  robs shoulders were beginning to ache with the continued tugging of the vine upon them but the thought that he was saving the lives of two unfortunate fellowcreatures gave him strength and courage to persevere  night was falling when they first sighted land a wild and seemingly uninhabited stretch of the american coast  rob made no effort to select a landing place for he was nearly worn out with a strain and anxiety of the journey  he dropped his burden upon the brow of a high bluff overlooking the sea and casting the vine from his shoulders fell to the earth exhausted and half fainting     17  the coast of oregon   when he had somewhat recovered rob sat up and looked around him  the elder sailor was kneeling in earnest prayer offering grateful thanks for his escape from suffering and death  the younger one lay upon the ground sobbing and still violently agitated by recollections of the frightful experiences he had undergone  although he did not show his feelings as plainly as the men the boy was none the less gratified at having been instrumental in saving the lives of two fellowbeings  the darkness was by this time rapidly enveloping them so rob asked his companions to gather some brushwood and light a fire which they quickly did  the evening was cool for the time of year and the heat from the fire was cheering and grateful so they all lay near the glowing embers and fell fast asleep  the sound of voices aroused rob next morning and on opening his eyes and gazing around he saw several rudely dressed men approaching  the two shipwrecked sailors were still sound asleep  rob stood up and waited for the strangers to draw near  they seemed to be fishermen and were much surprised at finding three people asleep upon the bluff  whar n thunder d ye come from asked the foremost fisherman in a surprised voice  from the sea replied the boy  my friends here are shipwrecked sailors from the cynthia jane  but howd ye make out to climb the bluff inquired a second fisherman no one ever did it afore as we knows on  oh that is a long story replied the boy evasively  the two sailors had awakened and now saluted the newcomers  soon they were exchanging a running fire of questions and answers  where are we rob heard the little sailor ask  coast of oregon was the reply  were about seven miles from port orford by land an about ten miles by sea  do you live at port orford inquired the sailor  thats what we do friend an if your party wants to join us well do our best to make you comftable bein as youre shipwrecked an need help  just then a loud laugh came from another group where the elder sailor had been trying to explain robs method of flying through the air  laugh all you want to said the sailor sullenly its trueevry word of it  mebbe you think it friend answered a big goodnatured fisherman but its well known that shipwrecked folks go crazy sometimes an imagine strange things  your mind seems clear enough in other ways so i advise you to try and forget your dreams about flyin  rob now stepped forward and shook hands with the sailors  i see you have found friends he said to them so i will leave you and continue my journey as im in something of a hurry  both sailors began to thank him profusely for their rescue but he cut them short  thats all right  of course i couldnt leave you on that island to starve to death and im glad i was able to bring you away with me  but you threatened to drop me into the sea remarked the little sailor in a grieved voice  so i did said rob laughing but i wouldnt have done it for the worldnot even to have saved my own life  goodby  he turned the indicator and mounted skyward to the unbounded amazement of the fishermen who stared after him with round eyes and wide open mouths  this sight will prove to them that the sailors are not crazy he thought as he turned to the south and sped away from the bluff  i suppose those simple fishermen will never forget this wonderful occurrence and theyll probably make reglar heroes of the two men who have crossed the pacific through the air  he followed the coast line keeping but a short distance above the earth and after an hours swift flight reached the city of san francisco  his shoulders were sore and stiff from the heavy strain upon them of the previous day and he wished more than once that he had some of his mothers household liniment to rub them with  yet so great was his delight at reaching once more his native land that all discomforts were speedily forgotten  much as he would have enjoyed a day in the great metropolis of the pacific slope rob dared not delay longer than to take a general view of the place to note its handsome edifices and to wonder at the throng of chinese inhabiting one section of the town  these things were much more plainly and quickly viewed by rob from above than by threading a way through the streets on foot for he looked down upon the city as a bird does and covered miles with a single glance  having satisfied his curiosity without attempting to alight he turned to the southeast and followed the peninsula as far as palo alto where he viewed the magnificent buildings of the university  changing his course to the east he soon reached mount hamilton and being attracted by the great tower of the lick observatory he hovered over it until he found he had attracted the excited gaze of the inhabitants who doubtless observed him very plainly through the big telescope  but so unreal and seemingly impossible was the sight witnessed by the learned astronomers that they have never ventured to make the incident public although long after the boy had darted away into the east they argued together concerning the marvelous and incomprehensible vision afterward they secretly engrossed the circumstance upon their records but resolved never to mention it in public lest their wisdom and veracity should be assailed by the skeptical  meantime rob rose to a higher altitude and sped swiftly across the great continent  by noon he sighted chicago and after a brief inspection of the place from the air determined to devote at least an hour to forming the acquaintance of this most wonderful and cosmopolitan city     18  a narrow escape   the auditorium tower where the weather man sits to flash his reports throughout the country offered an inviting place for the boy to alight  he dropped quietly upon the roof of the great building and walked down the staircase until he reached the elevators by means of which he descended to the ground floor without exciting special attention  the eager rush and hurry of the people crowding the sidewalks impressed rob with the idea that they were all behind time and were trying hard to catch up  he found it impossible to walk along comfortably without being elbowed and pushed from side to side so a half hours sightseeing under such difficulties tired him greatly  it was a beautiful afternoon and finding himself upon the lake front rob hunted up a vacant bench and sat down to rest  presently an elderly gentleman with a reserved and dignified appearance and dressed in black took a seat next to the boy and drew a magazine from his pocket  rob saw that he opened it to an article on the progress of modern science in which he seemed greatly interested  after a time the boy remembered that he was hungry not having eaten a tablet in more than twentyfour hours  so he took out the silver box and ate one of the small round disks it contained  what are those inquired the old gentleman in a soft voice  you are too young to be taking patent medicines  there are not medicines exactly answered the boy with a smile they are concentrated food tablets sorted with nourishment by means of electricity  one of them furnishes a person with food for an entire day  the old gentleman stared at rob a moment and then laid down his magazine and took the box in his hands examining the tablets curiously  are these patented he asked  no said rob they are unknown to any one but myself  i will give you a half million dollars for the recipe to make them said the gentleman  i fear i must refuse your offer returned rob with a laugh  ill make it a million said the gentleman coolly  rob shook his head  money cant buy the recipe he said for i dont know it myself  couldnt the tablets be chemically analyzed and the secret discovered inquired the other  i dont know but im not going to give any one the chance to try declared the boy firmly  the old gentleman picked up his magazine without another word and resumed his reading  for amusement rob took the record of events from his pocket and began looking at the scenes reflected from its polished plate  presently he became aware that the old gentleman was peering over his shoulder with intense interest  general funston was just then engaged in capturing the rebel chief aguinaldo and for a few moments both man and boy observed the occurrence with rapt attention  as the scene was replaced by one showing a secret tunnel of the russian nihilists with the conspirators carrying dynamite to a recess underneath the palace of the czar the gentleman uttered a long sigh and asked  will you sell that box  no answered rob shortly and put it back into his pocket  ill give you a million dollars to control the sale in chicago alone continued the gentleman with an eager inflection in his smooth voice  you seem quite anxious to get rid of money remarked rob carelessly how much are you worth  personally  yes  nothing at all young man  i am not offering you my own money  but with such inventions as you have exhibited i could easily secure millions of capital  suppose we form a trust and place them upon the market  well capitalize it for a hundred millions and you can have a quarter of the stocktwentyfive millions  that would keep you from worrying about grocery bills  but i wouldnt need groceries if i had the tablets said rob laughing  true enough  but you could take life easily and read your newspaper in comfort without being in any hurry to get down town to business twentyfive millions would bring you a cozy little income if properly invested  i dont see why one should read newspapers when the record of events shows all that is going on in the world objected rob  true true  but what do you say to the proposition  i must decline with thanks  these inventions are not for sale  the gentleman sighed and resumed his magazine in which he became much absorbed  rob put on the character marking spectacles and looked at him  the letters e w and c were plainly visible upon the composed respectable looking brow of his companion  evil wise and cruel reflected rob as he restored the spectacles to his pocket  how easily such a man could impose upon people  to look at him one would think that butter wouldnt melt in his mouth  he decided to part company with this chance acquaintance and rising from his seat strolled leisurely up the walk  a moment later on looking back he discovered that the old gentleman had disappeared  he walked down state street to the river and back again amused by the activity displayed in this busy section of the city  but the time he had allowed himself in chicago had now expired so he began looking around for some high building from the roof of which he could depart unnoticed  this was not at all difficult and selecting one of many stores he ascended by an elevator to the top floor and from there mounted an iron stairway leading to the flat roof  as he climbed this stairway he found himself followed by a pleasant looking young man who also seemed desirous of viewing the city from the roof  annoyed at the inopportune intrusion robs first thought was to go back to the street and try another building but upon reflecting that the young man was not likely to remain long and he would soon be alone he decided to wait  so he walked to the edge of the roof and appeared to be interested in the scenery spread out below him  fine view from here aint it said the young man coming up to him and placing his hand carelessly upon the boys shoulder  it is indeed replied rob leaning over the edge to look into the street  as he spoke he felt himself gently but firmly pushed from behind and losing his balance he plunged headforemost from the roof and whirled through the intervening space toward the sidewalk far below  terrified though he was by the sudden disaster the boy had still wit enough remaining to reach out his right hand and move the indicator of the machine upon his left wrist to the zero mark  immediately he paused in his fearful flight and presently came to a stop at a distance of less than fifteen feet from the flagstones which had threatened to crush out his life  as he stared downward trying to recover his selfpossession he saw the old gentleman he had met on the lake front standing just below and looking at him with a half frightened half curious expression in his eyes  at once rob saw through the whole plot to kill him and thus secure possession of his electrical devices  the young man upon the roof who had attempted to push him to his death was a confederate of the innocent appearing old gentleman it seemed and the latter had calmly awaited his fall to the pavement to seize the coveted treasures from his dead body  it was an awful idea and rob was more frightened than he had ever been before in his lifeor ever has been since  but now the shouts of a vast concourse of amazed spectators reached the boys ears  he remembered that he was suspended in midair over the crowded street of a great city while thousands of wondering eyes were fixed upon him  so he quickly set the indicator to the word up and mounted skyward until the watchers below could scarcely see him  then he fled away into the east even yet shuddering with the horror of his recent escape from death and filled with disgust at the knowledge that there were people who held human life so lightly that they were willing to destroy it to further their own selfish ends  and the demon wants such people as these to possess his electrical devices which are as powerful to accomplish evil when in wrong hands as they are good thought the boy resentfully  this would be a fine world if electric tubes and records of events and traveling machines could be acquired by selfish and unprincipled persons  so unnerved was rob by his recent experiences that he determined to make no more stops  however he alighted at nightfall in the country and slept upon the sweet hay in a farmers barn  but early the next morning before any one else was astir he resumed his journey and at precisely ten oclock of this day which was saturday he completed his flying trip around the world by alighting unobserved upon the welltrimmed lawn of his own home     19  rob makes a resolution   when rob opened the front door he came face to face with nell who gave an exclamation of joy and threw herself into his arms  oh rob she cried im so glad youve come  we have all been dreadfully worried about you and mother  well what about mother inquired the boy anxiously as she paused  shes been very ill rob and the doctor said today that unless we heard from you soon he would not be able to save her life  the uncertainty about you is killing her  rob stood stock still all the eager joy of his return frozen into horror at the thought that he had caused his dear mother so much suffering  where is she nell he asked brokenly  in her room  come ill take you to her  rob followed with beating heart and soon was clasped close to his mothers breast  oh my boymy dear boy she murmured and then for very joy and love she was unable to say more but held him tight and stroked his hair gently and kissed him again and again  rob said little except to promise that he would never again leave home without her full consent and knowledge  but in his mind he contrasted the love and comfort that now surrounded him with the lonely and unnatural life he had been leading and boy though he was in years a mighty resolution that would have been creditable to an experienced man took firm root in his heart  he was obliged to recount all his adventures to his mother and although he made light of the dangers he had passed through the story drew many sighs and shudders from her  when luncheon time arrived he met his father and mr joslyn took occasion to reprove his son in strong language for running away from home and leaving them filled with anxiety as to his fate  however when he saw how happy and improved in health his dear wife was at her boys return and when he had listened to robs manly confession of error and expressions of repentance he speedily forgave the culprit and treated him as genially as ever  of course the whole story had to be repeated his sisters listening this time with open eyes and ears and admiring their adventurous brother immensely  even mr joslyn could not help becoming profoundly interested but he took care not to show any pride he might feel in his sons achievements  when his father returned to his office rob went to his own bedchamber and sat for a long time by the window in deep thought  when at last he aroused himself he found it was nearly four oclock  the demon will be here presently he said with a thrill of aversion and i must be in the workshop to receive him  silently he stole to the foot of the attic stairs and then paused to listen  the house seemed very quiet but he could hear his mothers voice softly humming a cradlesong that she had sung to him when he was a baby  he had been nervous and unsettled and a little fearful until then but perhaps the sound of his mothers voice gave him courage for he boldly ascended the stairs and entered the workshop closing and locking the door behind him     20  the unhappy fate of the demon   again the atmosphere quickened and pulsed with accumulating vibrations again the boy found himself aroused to eager expectancy  there was a whirl in the air a crackling like distant musketry a flash of dazzling lightand the demon stood before him for the third time  i give you greetings said he in a voice not unkindly  good afternoon mr demon answered the boy bowing gravely  i see you have returned safely from your trip continued the apparition cheerfully although at one time i thought you would be unable to escape  indeed unless i had knocked that tube from the rascally turks hand as he clambered to the top of the wall i believe you would have been at the yarkand oasis yeteither dead or alive as chance might determine  were you there asked rob  to be sure  and i recovered the tube for you without which you would have been helpless  but that is the only time i saw fit to interfere in any way  im afraid i did not get a chance to give many hints to inventors or scientists said rob  true and i have deeply regretted it replied the demon  but your unusual powers caused more astonishment and consternation than you perhaps imagined for many saw you whom you were too busy to notice as a result several able electricians are now thinking new thoughts along new lines and some of them may soon give these or similar inventions to the world  you are satisfied then asked rob  as to that returned the demon composedly i am not  but i have hopes that with the addition of the three marvelous devices i shall present you with today you will succeed in arousing so much popular interest in electrical inventions as to render me wholly satisfied with the result of this experiment  rob regarded the brilliant apparition with a solemn face but made no answer  no living person continued the demon has ever before been favored with such comforting devices for the preservation and extension of human life as yourself  you seem quite unappreciative it is true but since our connection i have come to realize that you are but an ordinary boy with many boyish limitations so i do not condemn your foolish actions too harshly  that is kind of you said rob  to prove my friendliness pursued the demon i have brought as the first of todays offerings this electromagnetic restorer  you see it is shaped like a thin metal band and is to be worn upon the brow clasping at the back of the head  its virtues surpass those of either the fabulous fountain of youth or the elixir of life so vainly sought for in past ages  for its wearer will instantly become free from any bodily disease or pain and will enjoy perfect health and vigor  in truth so great are its powers that even the dead may be restored to life provided the blood has not yet chilled  in presenting you with this appliance i feel i am bestowing upon you the greatest blessing and most longedfor boon ever bequeathed of suffering humanity  here he held the slender dullcolored metallic band toward the boy  keep it said rob  the demon started and gave him an odd look  what did you say he asked  i told you to keep it answered rob  i dont want it  the demon staggered back as if he had been struck  dont want it he gasped  no ive had enough of your infernal inventions cried the boy with sudden anger  he unclasped the traveling machine from his wrist and laid it on the table beside the demon  theres the thing thats responsible for most of my troubles said he bitterly  what right has one person to fly through the air while all his fellowcreatures crawl over the earths surface  and why should i be cut off from all the rest of the world because you have given me this confounded traveling machine  i didnt ask for it and i wont keep it a moment longer  give it to some one you hate more than you do me  the demon stared aghast and turned his glittering eyes wonderingly from rob to the traveling machine and back again as if to be sure he had heard and seen aright  and here are your food tablets continued the boy placing the box upon the table  ive only enjoyed one square meal since you gave them to me  theyre all right to preserve life of course and answer the purpose for which they were made but i dont believe nature ever intended us to exist upon such things or we wouldnt have the sense of taste which enables us to enjoy natural food  as long as im a human being im going to eat like a human being so ive consumed my last electrical concentrated food tabletand dont you forget it  the demon sank into a chair nerveless and limp but still staring fearfully at the boy  and theres another of your unnatural devices said rob putting the automatic record of events upon the table beside the other things what right have you to capture vibrations that radiate from private and secret actions and discover them to others who have no business to know them  this would be a fine world if every body could peep into every one elses affairs wouldnt it  and here is your character marker  nice thing for a decent person to own isnt it  any one who would take advantage of such a sneaking invention as that would be worse than a thief  oh ive used them of course and i ought to be spanked for having been so mean and underhanded but ill never be guilty of looking through them again  the demons face was frowning and indignant  he made a motion to rise but thought better of it and sank back in his chair  as for the garment of protection resumed the boy after a pause ive worn it for the last time and here it is at your service  ill put the electric tube with it  not that these are such very bad things in themselves but ill have none of your magical contrivances  ill say this however if all armies were equipped with electrical tubes instead of guns and swords the world would be spared a lot of misery and unnecessary bloodshed  perhaps in time but that time hasnt arrived yet  you might have hastened it said the demon sternly if you had been wise enough to use your powers properly  thats just it answered rob  im not wise enough  nor is the majority of mankind wise enough to use such inventions as yours unselfishly and for the good of the world  if people were better and every one had an equal show it would be different  for some moments the demon sat quietly thinking  finally the frown left his face and he said with animation  i have other inventions which you may use without any such qualms of conscience  the electromagnetic restorer i offered you would be a great boon to your race and could not possibly do harm  and besides this i have brought you what i call the illimitable communicator  it is a simple electric device which will enable you wherever you may be to converse with people in any part of the world without the use of such crude connections as wires  in fact you may  stop cried rob  it is useless for you to describe it because ill have nothing more to do with you or your inventions  i have given them a fair trial and theyve got me into all sorts of trouble and made all my friends miserable  if i was some highup scientist it would be different but im just a common boy and i dont want to be anything else  but your duty began the demon  my duty i owe to myself and to my family interrupted rob  i have never cultivated science more than to fool with some simple electrical experiments so i owe nothing to either science or the demon of electricity so far as i can see  but consider remonstrated the demon rising to his feet and speaking in a pleading voice consider the years that must elapse before any one else is likely to strike the master key  and in the meanwhile consider my helpless position cut off from all interest in the world while i have such wonderful inventions on my hands for the benefit of mankind  if you have no love for science or for the advancement of civilization do have some consideration for your fellowcreatures and for me  if my fellowcreatures would have as much trouble with your electrical inventions as i had i am doing them a service by depriving them of your devices said the boy  as for yourself ive no fault to find with you personally  youre a very decent sort of demon and ive no doubt you mean well but theres something wrong about our present combination im sure  it isnt natural  the demon made a gesture of despair  why oh why did not some intelligent person strike the master key he moaned  thats it exclaimed rob  i believe thats the root of the whole evil  what is inquired the demon stupidly  the fact that an intelligent person did not strike the master key you dont seem to understand  well ill explain  youre the demon of electricity arent you  i am said the other drawing himself up proudly  your mission is to obey the commands of whoever is able to strike the master key of electricity  that is true  i once read in a book that all things are regulated by exact laws of nature  if that is so you probably owe your existence to those laws the demon nodded  doubtless it was intended that when mankind became intelligent enough and advanced enough to strike the master key you and all your devices would not only be necessary and acceptable to them but the world would be prepared for their general use  that seems reasonable doesnt it  perhaps so  yes it seems reasonable answered the demon thoughtfully  accidents are always liable to happen continued the boy  by accident the master key was struck long before the world of science was ready for itor for you  instead of considering it an accident and paying no attention to it you immediately appeared to mea mere boyand offered your services  i was very anxious to do something returned the demon evasively youve no idea how stupid it is for me to live invisible and unknown while all the time i have in my possession secrets of untold benefit to the world  well youll have to keep cool and bide your time said rob  the world wasnt made in a minute and while civilization is going on at a pretty good pace were not up to the demon of electricity yet  what shall i do groaned the apparition wringing his hands miserably oh what shall i do  go home and lie down replied rob sympathetically  take it easy and dont get rattled  nothing was every created without a use they say so your turn will come some day sure  im sorry for you old fellow but its all your own fault  you are right exclaimed the demon striding up and down the room and causing thereby such a crackling of electricity in the air that robs hair became rigid enough to stand on end  you are right and i must waitwaitwaitpatiently and silentlyuntil my bonds are loosed by intelligence rather than chance  it is a dreary fate  but i must waiti must waiti must wait  im glad youve come to your senses remarked rob drily  so if youve nothing more to say  no i have nothing more to say  there is nothing more to say  you and i are two  we should never had met retorted the demon showing great excitement  oh i didnt seek your acquaintance said rob  but ive tried to treat you decently and ive no fault to find with you except that you forgot you were a slave and tried to be a master  the demon did not reply  he was busily forcing the various electrical devices that rob had relinquished into the pockets of his fiery jacket  finally he turned with an abrupt movement  goodby he cried  when mortal eyes next behold me they will be those of one fit to command my services  as for you your days will be passed in obscurity and your name be unknown to fame goodbyforever  the room filled with a flash of white light so like a sheet of lightning that the boy went reeling backwards half stunned and blinded by its dazzling intensity  when he recovered himself the demon of electricity had disappeared   robs heart was very light as he left the workshop and made his way down the attic stairs  some people might think i was a fool to give up those electrical inventions he reflected but im one of those persons who know when theyve had enough  it strikes me the fool is the fellow who cant learn a lesson  ive learned mine all right  its no fun being a century ahead of the times
